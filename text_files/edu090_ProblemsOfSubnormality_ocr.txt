  PREFACE 
HERE are four fundamental questions relating to 
mentally subnormal individuals which invite thorough 
scientific investigation: First, the question of the devel- 
opment of an adequate art of differential diagnosis of the 
different degrees and types of mental subnormality; sec- 
ond, the question of providing differentiated educational 
treatment in accordance with the diagnosis for different 
types or classes ; third, the question of the organization of 
adequate systems of after-care, after-guidance, and con- 
trol; and, fourth, the question of the development of pre- 
ventive measures, whether eugenical or euthenical, de- 
signed to reduce or eliminate the army of subnormal in- 
competents. 
Logically the most basal of these four questions is the 
first one. It is idle to hope properly to segregate children 
or adults for special educational or social treatment, or 
to attempt to eliminate their strains, unless such persons 
have first been accurately diagnosed. No well-informed 
person would deny that the accurate mental diagnosis of 
children in the schools, and of child and adult offenders 
in the courts, is of the greatest practical importance not 
only to the individual concerned but also to the state, the 
nation, and the family. A misdiagnosis will often result 
in consequences which may prove inimical not only to the 
individual concerned but also to society. Too much time, 
therefore, cannot be given to the perfection of the methods 
and standards of psychological diagnosis. 
A few years ago the assumption was made that prac- 
tically any intelligent person could determine whether 
or not a child or adult was feeble-minded by a few 
minutes’ examination by means of the Binet-Simon scale,

with the aid of certain arbitrary quantitative stand- 
ards of mental retardation. This assumption has been 
frequently challenged during the last year or two by a 
number of writers, and it is not probable that it is now 
entertained by any considerable number of clinical psy- 
chologists. Nevertheless, it is a fact that psychological 
diagnoses are still being made by persons who are not fully 
qualified for the work. There are two reasons which seem 
to us conclusive why psychological diagnosis should not 
be attempted by any but well-trained persons. First, no 
one but the expert (and sometimes not even the expert) 
can determine whether a child or an adult is feeble-minded 
if he grades near the borderline and backward cases —and 
the number of children and adults so grading is legion. 
Second, the psychological standards by means of which in- 
dividuals have been diagnosed as feeble-minded in the 
recent past, and upon which the partially trained exam- 
iners must very largely lean, have not, in point of fact, 
been demonstrated to be correct. We shall devote a con- 
siderable amount of space in this book to the consideration 
of these theses, and shall propose in Chapter II a tenta- 
tive intelligence standard for the upper threshold of feeble- 
mindedness, in the hope that it will stimulate further in- 
vestigation and criticism by other workers. The sooner 
we can agree upon the upper intelligence limen of feeble- 
mindedness,— to the extent that it is possible to lay down 
a definite limit,— the better it will be for the science of 
psychological diagnosis. 
It is also our hope that the facts presented in these 
pages will emphasize the necessity for further research on 
an extensive scale, in order that we may secure a large 
body of differential diagnostic norms for tests of various 
phases of mentality, and the necessity of providing ade-

quate training for experts in psycho-educational and psy- 
cho-social diagnosis. 
The need of extensive research is, of course, paramount. 
The field is almost virgin soil. But it is doubtful if this 
need will be adequately met until the work is organized 
by a properly financed research foundation, or by a gov- 
ernment bureau. It is a matter of great surprise to work- 
ers in this field who know its large possibilities that it has 
been totally neglected by the existing foundations and by 
the government bureaus. This is all the more surprising 
in view of the fact that there are few fields of investigation 
which offer larger immediate practical returns on the in- 
vestment made. Norms established for mental traits can 
be put to immediate practical use in the grading, classifi- 
cation, and social and educational care of human beings. 
Surely it is as important properly to care for human be- 
ings as to care for animals and plants. The government 
could well afford to include $100,000 for the psycholog- 
ical investigation of children, in the annual budget of the 
Bureau of Education. 
The need of trained and experienced psychological ex- 
aminers should be obvious. Shall we leave the official men- 
tal examination of children to amateurs but insist that 
our official inspectors of horses and cows must possess the 
highest technical training? Practically, it will be diffi- 
cult to induce scientific students to spend three or four 
years in thorough preparation for this basic and difficult 
type of public service as long as they are obliged to com- 
pete with poorly trained workers whose services can be 
secured at grade-teachers’ salaries, and as long as school, 
court, and institutional authorities consider that the work 
of mental classification can be adequately done by psy- 
chological amateurs who have learned to give the Binet

tests. The moment, however, the true réle of the Binet 
tester is understood,— she sustains the same relation to 
the psychologist as the nurse sustains to the physician, 
and in this capacity performs a very useful service,— the 
field will open for the professionally trained, and possibly 
the officially certified, psychological examiner.

  INTRODUCTION 
HE graded class system of instruction was instituted 
on the assumption that children of the same age are 
approximately equal in mental capacity, and therefore 
can be most economically, and successfully, taught in 
groups by uniform methods and a uniform subject mat- 
ter. Experience has shown that this supposition is only 
partly true. The pedagogical studies of retardation and 
the clinical studies of mental backwardness and feeble- 
mindedness conducted in the schools during the last decade 
or two have demonstrated that pupils of the same age an 
the same extent of schooling may vary from one year ti 
five years or more in their mental capacity and peda- 
gogical attainments, and that the number of children 
who thus deviate from the normal is larger than was once 
thought to be the case. 
In consequence of these discoveries public-school ad- 
mbar have begun to realize that the problem of the 
eptional child has become one of the most important 
administrative problems in the schools. In the effort 
to solve this problem we have attempted to adapt the in- 
struction to the varying needs of each variant pupil, al- 
though mainly thus far only to the needs of the child of 
subnormal capacity. Children of inferior capacity or 
deficient attainments have been segregated in small num- 
bers in special classes, and provided with specially trained 
teachers and a special program of work. But it has hap- 
pened inevitably — as has been so convincingly shown in 
this book— that the differentiations have not always 
been very accurately made, and that children varying 
greatly in their type of mental handicap and in their de- 
gree of mental capacity have been congregated in the same 
classes. It is obvious that a type of education suited to

xiv INTRODUCTION 
the feeble-minded child would not be the best type of train- 
ing to give to a backward child, or a normal child with 
specific pedagogical handicaps, or a speech defective who 
is not feeble-minded. And it is evident that if all types 
of misfit pupils are placed in the same class it will be diffi- 
cult to do justice to any one type. It is therefore neces- 
sary in the interest of the individual child who cannot be 
reached by the ordinary curriculum, and in the interest 
of the economic administration of the schools, that the dif- 
ferentiations must be drawn as finely and accurately as 
possible, so that pupils subject to the same type of dis- 
bility or degree of subnormality may be grouped to- 
gether. 
The attempt to supply this need has brought the 
pyscho-educational examiner, or clinical psychologist, into 
the service of the public schools; and to the solution of 
this task Dr. Wallin devotes a considerable portion of this 
book. Dr. Wallin has for many years enjoyed unparal- 
leled opportunities in the first-hand study of a great vari- 
ety of types of mentally and educationally abnormal chil- 
dren, not only in residential institutions, but also in large 
public-school systems, and he has had a wide experience 
in the training of teachers for normal and subnormal chil- 
dren and in the administration of public-school classes 
for subnormal children. In this book he has outlined 
more clearly and adequately than has hitherto been done 
a plan for the organization of various types of special 
and ungraded classes to meet the needs of different types 
of exceptional children, and has had an opportunity to 
subject the plan to a practical test in the St. Louis pub- 
lic schools, where it has been possible gradually to adopt 
many of the recommendations of the book. One of the 
significant results of the examinations conducted by Dr. 
Wallin in the St. Louis schools during the past three

years has been the notable shrinkage in the estimate of 
the number of our elementary pupils supposed to be 
feeble-minded. We had been led to believe that at least 
two per cent. of these pupils were feeble-minded. We do 
not find that the number of pupils requiring special help 
is smaller than we had supposed, but the great majority 
of these pupils are backward instead of feeble-minded, 
We are accordingly organizing different types of un- 
graded classes to meet the needs of these pupils. Of 
these classes we now have almost fifty, which is about 
twice the number of our classes for mental defectives. 
This book on the “ Problems of Subnormality,” how- 
ever, is not restricted merely to the consideration of the 
educational questions, but also considers the social, civic, 
industrial, criminological, and eugenic questions affect- 
ing different types of abnormal children — the feeble- 
minded, backward, epileptic, blind, deaf, speech-defective, 
crippled, psychopathic — which are of vital moment to 
the individual concerned and to the family, the state, and 
the nation. The book deals with the increase of our most 
important national asset, the man power of the nation, and 
comes as a timely contribution to the literature of na- 
tional preparedness. It has a vital message for the school 
administrator no less than for the teacher of defective 
children, and also for the psychologist, physician, penol- 
ogist, social worker, and lawmaker. The author is a 
careful investigator who has not been stampeded into ex- 
travagant statements by some of the publications of the 
day.

  PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
CHAPTER ONE 
CHANGING ATTITUDES TOWARD THE 
SUBNORMAL 
HISTORY OF THE CARE, TRAINING, AND STUDY OF FEEBLE- 
MINDED AND BACKWARD CHILDREN 
& ae attitude which society has assumed toward its 
feeble-minded members, and the consequent treat- 
‘ ment which it has accorded them, has varied from time to 
time. Roughly we may recognize four historical epochs 
in the social care and educational training of the feeble- 
minded. 
1. The Ancient Period 
During ancient times the feeble-minded, generally speak- 
ing, were regarded with indifference, contempt, or aver- 
sion and became the objects of ridicule and often of ex- 
treme cruelty. The feeble-minded were regarded as per- 
sons who stood outside the pale of the humankind, having 
forfeited all human rights either because they were “ de- 
mons possessed,” “ accursed of the gods,” or because they 
were private, peculiar (hence “idiots” +), solitary per- 
sons who were unable to see, hear, feel, know, or do any- 
thing, and who therefore were extra-social, incapable of hu- 
man intercourse. On such a theory it is not at all sur- 
prising that the “ idiots ” not only were treated with cruel 
neglect and indignity, but that they became the objects of 
1The word “idiot” originally meant a private person, then a 
humble person, and later one who was unskilled or clumsy, while to- 
day it refers to the lowest grade of the feeble-minded, say those not 
exceeding a mentality of two years. 
it

  2 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
heartless persecution or extermination, In point of fact, 
idiots and imbeciles were often allowed to perish from de- 
liberate exposure to death perils. They were abandoned 
in the mountains to starve or to be devoured by wild ani- 
mals, or they were thrown in the rivers, or, it may be 
assumed, executed outright. The practice of infanticide 
of both the fit and the unfit was, no doubt, indulged in 
secretly by the ancients just as it is practiced secretly in 
modern times. But the deliberate neglect or abandonment 
of idiots to their fate was countenanced by the laws of 
Lycurgus, and was openly practiced by the Spartans. 
Cicero intimates that the practice also flourished among 
the Romans. The Greeks, a race of ancient eugenists, 
probably were actuated by eugenic motives. The Greek 
philosophers had observed how nature, operating through 
the law of natural selection, permitted only the fittest to 
survive. In legalizing the deliberate extermination of the 
feebly gifted by a process of social selection, the Spartans 
probably considered that they were merely applying a 
natural law to the conduct of human affairs. Undoubt- 
edly the motive, in part at-least, was the desire to prevent 
racial degeneration through the breeding of contaminated 
stock. ; 
Evidences are not lacking, however, that a more tolerant 
attitude was assumed toward the feeble-minded even in 
ancient times. Use was frequently made of them as ob- 
jects of diversion or amusement in the homes of the more 
affluent among the Romans. Seneca’s wife is said to have 
kept a blind imbecile (fatua) for purposes of entertain- 
ment. They became the entertainers at the receptions 
of the wealthy classes. Moreover, it has been asserted 
that a few of the fecble-minded among the ancients occu- * 
pied positions of honor and influence in the state and that 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  CHANGING ATTITUDES 3 
a few among the Romans even wore the royal purple; for 
example, Nero, Commodus, Elagabalus, and Caligula. 
The fact, however, that these emperors were cruel, wanton, 
childish, or profligate does not constitute a sufficient pre- 
sumption that they were feekle-minded in the technical 
sense in which this word should be employed.1 Numerous 
causes contributed toward the degradation of the Roman 
emperors, not the least of which was the sinister tradition 
of the Cesars. Few of the Cesars were paragons of 
virtue. 
The historical records indicate that Nero (37-68) was 
carefully tutored by the scholar Seneca, For a number 
of years he ruled his people wisely and magnanimously ; 
he was modest, affable, liberal, and tolerant. But as time 
went on he became childishly vain, inordinately selfish, 
savagely revengeful and cruel, and profligate. The record 
shows at most that he was mentally backward, not feeble- 
minded. 
Caligula, or Gaius Cesar (A. D. 12-41), ruled well dur- 
ing the first eight months of his reign. Then, after re- 
covering from a disease, his character completely changed. 
He became extravagant, cruel, licentious, and foolish. 
Both the rich and the poor fell victims to his thirst for 
blood. He bestowed the priesthood and consulship on his 
horse. Caligula was probably mentally deranged, and 
possibly also a victim of dementia, instead of being feeble- 
minded, 
Commodus, or Lucius #lius Aurelius, or Marcus An- 
tonius (161-192), received a careful education but pre- 
ferred low society and amusements. He became tyranni- 
1 Namely, serious arrest of mental development dating from birth 
or from early life (i.e, amentia). The degree of mental arrest 
needed to constitute feeble-mindedness will be discussed in Chapter IT.

cal, extravagant, and brutal after an attack was made 
upon his life by an assassin. He possessed muscular 
strength and agility and was skilled in physical contests. 
At most we can only conclude that he was backward 
mentally. 
Elagabalus, or Heliogabalus (a.p. 218-222), blas- 
phemed the state religion, indulged in wild horseplay and 
childish pranks, and led a life of shameless profligacy. 
Whether this was due to the traditional license attaching 
to his position, or to moral perversity or backwardness or 
feeble-mindedness, is not clear. 
2. The Christian Era 
The teaching of the Christian religion gradually 
wrought an improvement in the social status of the feeble- 
minded, as well as of the “ demons possessed,” the bodily 
infirm or afflicted, and the poor. St. Paul’s injunction 
to “ comfort the feeble-minded ” (I Thess. v. 14) probably 
applied to the mentally weak. Christ set a good example 
by pitying the demoniac and idiotic children who were 
brought to him. The feeble-minded thereafter not only 
became objects of commiseration but also of tender solici- 
tude and care.’ In the fourth century the Bishop of Myra 
(the “St. Nicholas” of ancient days) energetically 
championed the cause of the feeble-minded, and organized 
charitable efforts for their care and protection. But up 
to this time no organized effort had been made to train or 
educate the feeble-minded. They were merely housed, 
clothed and fed.* 
1 Incidentally it should be stated that in the Oriental religions 
the care of the feeble-minded was enjoined by Confucius, Zoroaster, 
and Mohammed. The injunction of the Koran was to “maintain . 
them, clothe them, and speak kindly unto them.”
-P-A-G-E-21

3. Medieval Times 
During the Middle Ages the attitude assumed toward 
the feeble-minded was extremely vacillating. The court 
jesters and buffoons are said originally to have been im- 
beciles, while imbeciles furnished a good deal of the enter- 
tainment in the castles of the rich. This attitude of 
frivolity, however, changed to one of superstitious rever- 
ence. The senseless, silly chatter of the imbecile became 
the revelation of “heavenly infants,” or “infants of the 
good God.” + Imbeciles were thought to be under the 
special protection of the divine and to hold communica- 
_ tion with the unknown.). Tycho Brahe’s companion in his 
astronomical observatory ‘was a fool, to whose babblings 
- he listened as to the revelations of an emissary from the 
Most High. Houses in which\feeble-minded children were 
born*were thought to be divinely blessed. During this 
period the feeble-minded in Europe were allowed to roam 
unmolested, just as in modern times they are permitted to 
roam the streets and highways of Brazil, soliciting alms. 
Here they are rarely refused alms, hence one feeble-minded 
person may sometimes support a whole familys/ The atti- 
tude of superstitious reverence of the feeble-minded is said 
still to survive in parts of Ireland and Brittany, and in 
some Oriental countries. Among the latter, Turkey ac- 
cords the feeble-minded special privileges as sacred beings. 
As “ Children of the Great Spirit ” the American Indians 
likewise permitted the feeble-minded to roam about wn- 
‘harmed. In England, through laws enacted during the 
reign of Edward II (1307 to 1827), imbeciles were even 
~placed under the protective and administrative oversight

“cretins” by the French, from Chretien, meaning “ Christian.”

of the king. The king administered the estates of 
“natural fools,” providing for their sustenance and restor- 
ing the property to the legitimate heirs upon the demise 
of the owner. 
But persecution usually follows in the wake of supersti- 
tion and fanaticism, and so the ancient cruelties were re- 
enacted during the period of the Renaissance and the 
Reformation. Imbeciles were again persecuted and re- 
viled. Luther and Calvin openly denounced them as pos- 
sessed of the evil spirit, “ filled with Satan.” To exorcise 
the demons, the feeble-minded were mentally scourged and 
bodily tortured. This process of “ purgation” or exor- 
cism, however, probably wrought a greater change in the 
hearts of those who attempted the purging than in the 
souls of those who were afflicted, for the crusade of cruelty 
was replaced by a campaign of beneficent protection, At 
this time the first organized public effort upon any scale 
was begun to provide for the physical care and comfort of 
the feeble-minded in a residential institution. This at- 
tempt was made in France in the middle of the seventeenth 
century by St. Vincent de Paul? and his Confrérie de 
Charité. They gathered together in the Bicétre (one of 
the historically famous Parisian hospitals and asylums, 
formerly a chateau) the homeless and the outcast and the 
bodily and mentally infirm. But even the most enlight- 
ened public efforts thus far put forth in behalf of the 
feeble-minded were almost entirely limited to housing, 
feeding, and clothing those in want, and to protecting 
them from privation and abuse. No attempt had yet been 
1St. Vincent was regarded by many of his contemporaries with 
superstitious reverence. Many believed that a hair from his beard 
twined around the neck of the afflicted would exorcise the demon and 
restore the shattered mind.

made either scientifically to study their mental condition 
and needs or scientifically to treat, train, or educate them. 
The inauguration of the scientific study of mentally devi- 
ating children and the development of a science of cor- 
rective and ameliorative pedagogy was still some distance 
in the future. The immediate impetus to the development 
of a pedagogy of mental deficiency, however, came from 
the marvelous results obtained from the application of 
special educational methods to the deaf, which marks the 
turning point between the medieval and the modern period. 
4. The Modern or Scientific Period 
The progenitors and the prophets of the corrective 
pedagogy of the feeble-minded (as well as of the blind) 
were Juan Pablo Bonet (d. 1629? Sometimes spelled 
Bonnet) and Jacob Rodrigues Pereire, or Pereira (1715- 
1780), who consecrated their lives to the service of the 
deaf. 
The contribution made by Bonet, a Spaniard, con- 
sisted in the origination of the manual alphabet for the 
deaf, which he published in Madrid in 1620, while Pereire 
not only extended Bonet’s manual alphabet into a dac- 
tylology of forty signs, to be used with one hand, but 
also utilized pantomimic expression, the natural language 
of the deaf, and, most important of all, invented the oral 
method (lip reading) by which many deaf have since been 
‘taught to speak and to understand spoken language. 
Pereire, who was a Spanish Jew, of Portuguese origin, 
learned in many sciences, and who lived successively in 
Portugal, Spain, and France, where in Paris he conducted 
a school for the deaf, received his initial suggestions from 
Bonet’s manual alphabet. Pereire became interested in 
 
-P-A-G-E-24
    8 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
the education of the deaf at Bordeaux, where he met a 
woman who was congenitally deaf. In order to qualify 
himself for the work to which he had decided to dedicate 
his life (he gave forty years of service to the deaf), he 
pursued special courses in medicine. The oral method 
which he devised was based upon a psychogenic theory, 
namely that the fundamental or primitive sense is touch, 
and that the other senses are only modifications or special- 
izations of touch. Pereire therefore assumed that when 
certain senses are impaired it should be possible to make 
touch function vicariously in their stead. Since speech 
on the physical side is nothing but a series of air vibra- 
tions, it should be possible to train the deaf to perceive 
these vibrations through the tactual sense instead of 
through the auditory receptor. Moreover, through the 
visual sense the deaf are able to perceive some of the 
movements made by the organs of articulation in the 
production of spoken language. The deaf may thus be 
trained to feel and see the speech they cannot hear. 
By imitating the articulatory movements, visually per- 
ceived, and by perceiving the vibratory air movements 
through the tactual sense, it should be possible to train 
the deaf not only to speak but to understand spoken 
speech, 
Pereire’s psychological theory led to experiments which 
resulted in the solution of one of the most difficult prob- 
lems in the entire realm of corrective pedagogy,? and he 
1 ‘The deaf are harder to reach than the blind, for they are deprived 
of the greatest stimulus to mental growth, namely spoken language. 
The blind child is able to hear the speech of his companions and soon 
learns to communicate with them. Through spoken language he ac- 
quires a large fund of information denied his deaf brother. The 
blind child may be on an intellectual par with his playfellows when 
he enters school, while the deaf, shut off from human intercourse, en- 
ters school like a baby of two or less as regards language.
-P-A-G-E-25

rendered inestimable service not only to the deaf, to whom 
he opened a new world, but also to educational science. 
The first success of Pereire’s method was accomplished 
with a Jewish boy of thirteen who learned to name the 
letters of the alphabet and to articulate common phrases. 
Four years later, in 1744, the method received the official 
commendation of the committee on methods of the Parisian 
Academy of Science, after Pereire had exhibited before the 
academy? a congenitally deaf boy whom he had taught 
to speak in a natural voice and correctly to reproduce 
his Gascon accent. As a reward for his brilliant ac- 
complishment Pereire was awarded a pension by Louis XV. 
He opened a free school for the deaf at Bordeaux in 1750, 
but moved to Paris two or three years later, where he 
received pupils from all parts of Europe. In 1759 he was 
honored with a membership in the Royal Society of Lon- 
don. Although it is asserted that Pereire kept his method 
a secret, because the Abbé de I’Epée laid claim to the 
authorship of his manual alphabet,” his work exerted a 
wide influence. It directly led to the establishment of 
schools for the deaf and blind, and indirectly also for the 
feeble-minded. De l’Epée’s school was opened in Paris in 
1771. The methods used here were largely pantomimic 
1The New Rochelle Academy of Science, according to one au- 
thority. 
2 There is apparently a difference of opinion as to who originated 
the manual alphabet for the deaf. It has been asserted that Bonet 
merely put into practice the theories of Ponce de Leon (1520-1584), 
a Spanish Benedictine monk, while the letter heads of the American 
“National Association for the Deaf” bear the statement that De 
PEpée was the “first teacher of the deaf, the founder of the first 
school for the deaf,” and “the inventor of the one-handed manual 
alphabet and of the language of conventional signs.” Bonet, how-

while Pereire’s free school was opened twenty-one years and Thomas 
Braidwood’s (1715-1806) school in Edinburgh eleven years before de 
PEpée’s school.

signs and finger spellings, although speech was taught to 
selected pupils. It is said, however, that Pereire’s con- 
temporaries (except Heinike, 1729-1790, in Germany, 
a pure oralist) failed correctly to grasp his educational 
principles (possibly because he kept them secret), so that 
the oral instruction of the deaf languished until the mid- 
dle of the eighteenth century. Not until 1867 was the 
oral method transplanted to America. In this year it was 
introduced into the Clarke Institution in Massachusetts, 
and into a school in New York City, by Bernard Engel- 
mann. Pereire’s success with the deaf inspired Valentine 
Haiiy to found a school for the blind in Paris in 1784. 
The successful work done here eventually led to the estab- 
lishment of schools for the blind elsewhere. 
To what extent Pereire influenced general educational 
theory is difficult to determine. Pereire and Rousseau 
(1712-1778) were neighbors and close acquaintances. 
Rousseau visited Pereire’s school and therefore very prob- 
ably got many suggestions from what he saw in this 
school for the system of training the senses and the body 
of young children which he has outlined in Emile. On 
the other hand, it is likewise possible that the practice of 
Pereire was shaped by the educational philosophy of Rous- 
seau.! 
It is probable that Pereire and Rousseau influenced 
Jean Marc Gaspard Itard (1775-1838), a French otolo- 
gist and philosopher, who was the first person to under- 
1 Rousseau was perhaps the first educational writer to advocate the 
training of the senses of young children. He argues that the senses 
are the first powers to develop, hence they should be the first to be 
trained. He holds that the child needs training in the “most ele- 
mentary distinctions of the sense experience.” “Our first teachers 
of science are our feet, our hands, and our eyes. To learn to think, 
therefore, we must exercise the limbs, senses, and organs which are 
the instruments of our intellect.”

take the systematic training of idiots. Itard was physi- 
cian to an institution for the deaf in Paris and therefore 
had undoubtedly taken pains to investigate the work done 
by Pereire.1_ Moreover, his interest in psychological and 
philosophical questions would lead us to believe that he 
familiarized himself with the works of Rousseau. In fact, 
it was probably primarily Itard’s interest in a psychologi- 
cal question (certainly not in a medical question) and his 
knowledge of the so-called “ physiological education ” that 
led him to undertake the systematic and laborious train- 
ing of the “savage of Aveyron.” is 
This so-called savage, a boy eleven or twelve years old, 
was accidentally found about the year 1800 by hunts- 
men in the woods of Caune in the Department of Aveyron 
in the southern part of France, where he was discovered 
roaming in search of acorns and nuts. The boy was 
brought to Paris and presented before the Academy of 
Science, where he excited a good deal of interest and specu- 
lation. Observed in confinement, he resembled a wild 
animal more than a human being: unable to speak, he ex- 
pressed his wants by inarticulate cries; he selected his 
food by smell, but was indifferent to either fragrant or 
foul odors; he drank while lying flat on the ground and 
immersing his mouth in the water like a horse; he often 
walked on all fours or when taken for a walk always fell 
into a running gait; he would sway sidewise like a caged 
beast; he fought with his teeth, bit and scratched 
those who interfered with his desires, tore off his garments, 
constantly attempted to escape, and evinced a voluptuous 
delight in the phenomena of nature, particularly storms 
or a snowfall, which would evoke peals of joyous laughter

the deaf in the institute founded by Pereire.

or expressions of frenzied rage. His ears were insensible 
to the loudest noises — he gave no attention to a pistol 
shot — and to music, and yet he could hear the fall of a 
nut. His temperature sense was likewise obtuse. He 
rolled with delight in the snow while nude, withstood the 
cold winds when half naked, and would pick up hot coals. 
His wandering eye could not be fixed, he could grasp the 
door knob but was unable to open the door, he was unable 
to imitate or do anything which did not appeal to his 
vegetative needs, he was unaffectionate and uninterested, 
although he was pleased at caresses (light stimulation of 
the primitive sense), and was volatile in disposition, pass- 
ing abruptly from states of melancholic depression to 
states of hilarious exhilaration. Such was this “ child of 
nature” who became the cornerstone of the scientific 
pedagogy of the feeble-minded — the first “wolf boy ” + 
to receive educational treatment. 
The great zeal shown in the education of the savage of 
Aveyron was largely prompted by the desire to settle the 
psychological and philosophical controversy between the. 
empiricists and nativists as to the origin of ideas and the 
original constitution of man. According to the empiri- 
cists (or sensationalists) all ideas come from sensation. 
Before the mind has been acted upon by stimuli it is a 
tabula rasa, an impressionable slate sans any marks or 
characters. The nativists, on the other hand, maintain 
that ideas are innate. They are potentially present in 
the mind, just as the oak is potentially present in the 
acorn, and need only the play of environmental stimuli 
to make them explicit’ or render them kinetic. They are 
1 According to Linneus ten such wolf boys were found between the 
years 1544 and 1767, living among wolves, bears, wild sheep, and oxen. 
A list of these boys is given by Seguin in his Idiocy and Its Treat- 
ment by the Physiological Method, 1907, page 14,

like “ latent contents ” which are merely made “ manifest ” 
by experience. 
Bonaterre, the professor of natural history, was inter- 
ested in this problem of speculative psychology. It 
seemed to him that in the savage of Aveyron nature had 
performed an experiment which would make it possible 
to test the truth of the two rival theories provided the 
boy could be instructed. Here is a boy, he argued, who 
knows nothing. If he has innate ideas it should be pos- 
sible to evoke them by proper stimulation. If his mind 
is an empty tablet it should be possible to make impres- 
sions upon it by supplying the appropriate stimuli. 
Pinel, the distinguished specialist on the insane at the 
Bicétre, had diagnosed the boy as an incurable idiot and 
therefore said that it was useless to attempt to educate 
him. Itard, on the other hand, who was interested in the 
problem of the origin of ideas and who was a sensation- 
alist (possibly through close association with his friend 
Condillac, a noted sensationalist), believed that the 
boy was merely wild and untaught and that his ar- 
rest of mental development was due to educational 
and social neglect. The boy was to be regarded as 
a case of mental atrophy through disuse or apparent 
“idiocy through isolation” from human intercourse. 
Since, therefore, he possessed normal potentials, he could 
be restored to normality by bombarding his nervous sensi- 
bility with varied and energetic stimuli; by supplying him 
with the raw impressions of ideas, by the imitative de- 
velopment of his speech, by applying his mind to the satis- 
faction of his growing physical wants, and by endearing 
him to social life. 
In order to prove the correctness of this psychologi- 
cal theory and the value of his educational program, and
-P-A-G-E-30
    14 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
in order to demonstrate the truth of the theory of sensa- 
tionalism, Itard undertook + to lead the boy by gradual 
steps “from natural life to social life,” “from savagery 
to civilization.” 
After a year of arduous labor it began to dawn upon 
Itard that his educational program would not work and 
that his diagnosis was mistaken — although it is said that 
he never admitted this. He accordingly began to de- 
velop simplified methods of instruction, which would be 
more fitted to the needs of an idiot than to the needs of 
a normal savage.” These methods, referred to as a sys- 
tem of “ medical education,” consisted of sensorimotor ex- 
ercises which were pedagogical rather than medical (in the 
usual acceptation of that term) in character. Essentially 
the method followed was to train each sense separately by 
a series of exercises, beginning with large differences or 
contrasts and proceeding to smaller and smaller differ- 
ences, until very minute differences would be perceived. 
The aim was to refine the child’s “ differential sensibility,” 
— or increase the acuteness of “ sensory discrimination,” 
— an aim which Montessori has borrowed from Itard and 
applied to the training of normal children. 
Itard devised various exercises for the training of audi- 
tion, vision, touch, the stereognostic sense, and taste. On 
the basis of concrete sensory exercises he attempted to 
teach reading and writing and to develop the comprehen- 
sion of words, the power to generalize, and the ability to 
use spoken words. After four years of the most syste- 
1 Bonaterre first left the training of the boy to Sicard at the school 
for the deaf. But he soon despaired of his charge and left him to 
loiter in the halls of the school. 
2Seguin says that Itard got the suggestions for his methods from 
Pereire and Rousseau, while Itard acknowledges his indebtedness to 
Locke and Condillac.

matic and intense course of sense training on record and 
of the individual study of the educational needs of one 
child, Itard’s work came to a sudden halt. At the onset 
of the puberal period his pupil’s character so changed that 
he could no longer be retained in the school. He exhib- 
ited fits of savage temper and broke out in a “ wild storm 
of passion.” Itard accordingly dismissed his pupil, who 
spent the rest of his life (d. 1828) with his caretaker. 
After five years of labor Itard was a much disappointed 
man. He considered that his experiment was a complete 
failure. He had neither restored the boy to even approxi- 
mate normality nor proved that simple ideas were the 
result of sensation alone. He had been obliged to abandon 
the boy as an incurable mute who could only say “ lait ” 
and a few syllables with “1.” “Since my pains are lost 
and my efforts fruitless, take yourself back to your forest 
and. primitive tastes; or if your new wants make you de- 
pendent on society, suffer the penalty of being useless, 
and go to Bicétre, there to die in wretchedness.” But 
the French Academy of Science realized more fully the 
important positive contribution that Itard had made to 
educational science, and commended him for his ingenuity, 
sagacity, courage, and patience. The members of the 
academy reported that a big change had come over the 
boy during his five years of training. He had been taught 
to make relatively fine sensory discriminations, to recog- 
nize objects, to identify letters, to read a little (although 
he understood little of what he read), to comprehend the 
meanings of many words, to apply names to parts of 
things, to use adjectives and verbs, to copy words, to 
write words from memory, and to write words expressing 
his wants (although unable to understand written com- 
munications), to make a few generalizations, to prefer 
   
-P-A-G-E-32
16 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
the foods of civilized life, and to prefer social life to the 
isolated existence in the wild. Itard, in fact, had demon- 
strated that even idiots can be improved more or less by 
appropriate sensorimotor and moral training, and he had 
laid the foundation for the psycho-clinical and psycho- 
educational observation of the individual pupil, just as the 
individual patients are clinically studied in the hospitals.1 
Itard did not realize the far-reaching nature of his re- 
sults because he did not understand that there are all 
degrees of mental deficiency and that the fruits of train- 
ing will vary according to the degree of mental handi- 
cap. 
The true significance of Itard’s work was appreciated 
by one of his gifted pupils, Edouard Seguin, who was born 
in France in 1812—the country that had become the 
cradle of the scientific study and treatment of the deaf, 
the blind, and the feeble-minded: she gave us the first suc- 
cessful demonstration of the oral training of the con- 
genitally deaf and of the trainability of the feeble-minded ; 
she gave us the corrective pedagogy for two classes (or 
three, if we include the blind) of mentally handicapped 
children, and she gave us Pereire (by adoption), Itard, 
Rousseau, and Seguin, no mean contribution to the modern 
science of education. 
1Itard was the first educator clinically to observe and study his 
pupils in the way in which the sick are clinically observed in the hos- 
pitals. Locke (1632-1704) had, however, earlier emphasized that 
children’s minds differ just like their bodies, hence they need to be in- 
dividually diagnosed. The methods of clinical observation along 
psycho-educational lines, however, are not the same as the ordinary 
medico-clinical methods of studying sick patients. (The Mental 
Health of the School Child, 1914, 132f, 156f, 209f, 216f.) The psy- 
cho-educational examiner studies the manifestations of certain men- 
tal states (feeble-mindedness, backwardness, criminality, etc.); the 
physician studies the manifestations and the underlying pathology or 
pathogenesis of diseased processes,  
-P-A-G-E-33
CHANGING ATTITUDES 1% 
Seguin, first a teacher, then a physician and psycholo- 
gist, “one of the world’s greatest educational investi- 
gators and reformers” (H. Holman), devoted the best 
forty-two years of his life to the study and training of the 
feeble-minded. He modified, systematized, and elaborated 
Itard’s system and became in truth the inspiring prophet 
of the best modern work with the subnormal. Seguin 
shares with Itard the honor of working out the foundation 
principles for the pedagogy of the feeble-minded. He 
had studied medicine and surgery under Itard, had been 
a pupil of the distinguished French psychiatrist, Esquirol 
—who was one of the first physicians to define idiocy as 
a condition of arrested development and not a disease, 
and who also interested himself in the training of the 
feeble-minded — and had become identified with the Saint- 
Simonians, a sect of sensationalists (psychologically 
speaking), mystical philosophers, and socialists who strove 
to ameliorate the physical, intellectual, and moral condi- 
tions of the unfortunate classes. Seguin entered upon 
his great work, inspired by unbounded faith in the great 
potentialities of human nature, and intent upon devising 
a system of education, based upon the “ principles of 
physiology,” which should embrace “ every faculty, func- 
tion, and aptitude” (Boyd) and which would be superior 
to book training not only for subnormal but also for nor- 
mal children — a system which he thought would regen- 
erate mankind. 
Seguin entered upon his work in 1837 when, at the age 
of twenty-five, he founded a private school in Paris, the 
first successful school expressly established for the train- 
ing of idiots.1 After eighteen months of labor he had

taught a feeble-minded child to “make good use of his 
senses, to compare, remember, speak, write, and count.” 
The success of his “ physiological education of all the 
senses ” attracted visitors from all over the civilized world 
and won for him, in 1842, the directorship of the enlarged 
school for idiots at the Bicétre. Owing to dissensions with 
the authorities, he retired from this position at the end of 
a year and reéstablished his private school in the Hospice 
des Incurables, where he divided his time between teaching 
and writing. In 1844 a committee from the Paris 
Academy of Science made a critical examination of his 
methods, and reported that he had undoubtedly solved the 
problem of “idiot ” education. His great book (“ the 
Magna Charta of the emancipation of the imbecile class ”) 
on The Moral Treatment, Hygiene, and Education of 
Idiots and Other Backward Children (1846) was crowned 
by the French Academy and was commended in an auto- 
graphed letter by Pope Pius IX for the service its author 
had rendered humanity.1_ At the time of the Revolution 
in 1848 Seguin emigrated to America, where he was in- 
strumental in the founding of the early American state 
institutions. He served for a short time as the superin- 
tendent of the “ Massachusetts School for Idiotic and 
Feeble-Minded Youth” in South Boston, now located at 
Waverly, assisted in the organization of the state institu- 
tion at Syracuse, New York, and was associated in the 
direction of the “ Pennsylvania Training School for Idiotic 
and Feeble-minded Children” in Philadelphia (now lo- 
cated at Elwyn). On January 1, 1880, he opened a 
Voisin in 1839; and at the Salpétriére in 1831 by Falret. In 1833 
Voisin opened a private school. Apparently none of these schools 
proved successful.

and Practice of the Education of Idiots, 1842.

private school in New York City (now located in Orange, 
New Jersey) but came to his death the following Octo- 
ber. 
Seguin’s “ physiological education”? is essentially a 
system of sensorimotor training designed to develop im- 
perfect sense organs, both as “ faculties and as functions,” 
supplemented by moral, intellectual, and vocational train- 
ing. His aim was “to lead the child . . . from the edu- 
cation of the muscular system to that of the nervous 
system and the senses,” and “from the education of the 
senses to general notions, from general notions to abstract 
thought, from abstract thought to morality.” Just as 
Pestalozzi psychologized education, Seguin would physi- 
ologize it. He held that it is necessary to train organic 
functions to acquire maximal accuracy, speed, and scope. 
The child needs to be trained to move and feel (the train- 
ing of motility and sensibility) as well as to cognize and 
moralize. Although Seguin trained the senses and the 
muscles more or less in isolation, using specially devised 
didactic apparatus, he probably regarded the child as a 
unity, and, as Boyd points out, did not advocate the di- 
vorcing of the sensorimotor and intellectual development. 
He expressly states that the exercise of a given function 
must be accompanied by the exercise of the “ related fac- 
ulty,” for the “exclusive training of the function ” im- 
pairs “the faculty,” and “ the exclusive training of the 
faculty ” atrophies “ the function.” Apparently function 
refers to the physiological activity and faculty to the 
mental element, the “ function of the senses ” evolves into 
and eventuates in “intellectual faculty,” the “ sensa- 
tional ” becomes “ idealized ” by a process of comparison, 
which is Seguin’s fundamental principle of education, al- 
though sometimes referred to as the principle of contract. 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  20 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
Moreover, Seguin stipulated that as soon as slight use had 
been developed in a function it should be applied to some 
useful purpose; it should be elevated to a “capacity.” 
The developed powers should be applied to profitable forms 
of vocational work. But beneath and beyond the didactic 
materials and the educative processes was the spirit which 
should actuate the work. The teacher must call to the 
soul of the child. Unless the work has become a passion, a 
mission, a real work of love in the service of one of 
humanity’s most unfortunate classes, the teacher must 
fail in her highest function. 
Seguin believed that his methods would revolutionize the 
training of normal children and were destined to become 
the “basis of the education of mankind.” Certain it is 
that his work became the model and inspiration of the 
subsequent educational work and social care of the feeble- 
minded, both in and out of publicly supported institutions. 
It gave the real impetus toward the organization of 
separate public training institutions for the feeble-minded, 
which later led to the founding of custodial and farm 
colonies for the feeble-minded and the epileptic. It is 
necessary, however, to refer to two of Seguin’s contem- 
poraries who helped to reduce the theories of Pereire and 
Itard to practice and who established institutions whose 
successful work became an inspiration to others, namely 
Guggenbiihl (d. 1865) and Saegert. 
Attracted by a poor cretin whom he observed at prayer 
near a roadside cross, Guggenbiihl became interested in the 
problems of cretinism. In order that he might have the 
opportunity to study the cretin at close range, he took 
up his abode, in 1836, in one of the valleys in Switzerland 
which contained many of these mental and physical dwarfs. 
Here he became convinced that much could be done for the
-P-A-G-E-37
CHANGING ATTITUDES 21 
physical and mental training of cretins. After two years 
he became physician in the asylum of Hofwyl, near Berne, 
in order that he might receive further preparation for his 
life work. Receiving little encouragement in his efforts 
to found a colony for the cretins, he addressed an urgent 
appeal to the Swiss Association for the Advancement of 
Science in a pamphlet entitled “ Christianity and Human- 
ity in Regard to Cretinism in Switzerland.” As a result 
of the interest thus aroused a plantation was secured in 
1842 for a colony on the Abendberg, near Interlaken in 
Canton Berne, at an elevation of 4000 feet above sea level. 
Cretinism, rife in the valley below, was unknown at this 
elevation. The institution, perhaps the first one for men- 
tal defectives to be erected on the cottage or colony plan, 
was located on the south slope of the mountain.! Here 
the cretins enjoyed the advantages of altitude, pure air, 
sunshine, clear water, constant and varied exercise, baths, 
massage, dieting, and physiological training according to 
the methods of Seguin, including, however, not only the 
persistent although varied formal training of the senses 
but also the observation of the glorious and varied phe- 
nomena of nature which were visible from an Alpine 
height. Under this régime many of the inmates appar- 
ently made wonderful improvement, even without the use of 
the modern specific for hypothyroidism. The fame of the 
institution spread rapidly; numerous visitors from afar, 
including scientists, physicians, kings, and philanthropists, 
returned home eloquent in their praise of the miracles that 
had been wrought in the education of imbeciles by this 
1 Asylums for cretins affording merely physical care had been es- 
tablished before this. Moreover, both the teacher Guggenmoos 
(1828) and the pastor Haldenwang (1835) antedated Guggenbiihl in 
the mental training of cretins, but their efforts failed because of lack 
of encouragement.

“patron saint” of the eretins. The result was that 
within a decade institutions were founded for the training 
of the feeble-minded in Germany, America, England, and 
other countries, many of which Guggenbiihl was induced 
to visit. But during the middle of the century admira- 
tion and adulation gave way to envy, suspicion, and ac- 
cusation. Abuses crept into the institution during Gug- 
genbiihl’s frequent pilgrimages ; and he had aroused higher 
expectations than the results justified. The institution 
was dissolved, and Guggenbiihl, impeached and condemned 
as a charlatan, although indignantly denying the charges 
preferred against him, lost the support of the Swiss Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Science, and retired to 
Montreux, where he died of a broken heart at the age of 
forty-seven. While the parent colony on the “Sacred 
Mount” thus came to an untimely end, the daughter 
colonies continue to this day in their beneficent ministra- 
tion to those of feeble mind. 
As director of the Asylum for Deaf Mutes in Berlin, 
Saegert became interested in the welfare of children whom 
he was obliged to exclude from the school because they 
were so weak mentally that they were unable to profit by 
the methods of instruction in vogue in the institution. 
Experiments with these children in 1843 proved to Saegert 
that they could be improved by “ physiological education.” 
In 1845, failing to secure a state subsidy, although aided 
by the minister of education in his efforts, he founded a 
private “Institution for the Cure and Education of 
Idiots,” -which attracted many visitors and became an 
inspiration to workers not only in Germany but also in 
other lands. An outline of Saegert’s treatment of twenty 
cases is given in his “ Cure of Imbecility by Intellectual 
Means.”
-P-A-G-E-39
CHANGING ATTITUDES 23 
Incidentaliy reference may here be made to one of the 
most enthusiastic modern disciples of Itard and Seguin, 
Maria Montessori, who became interested in the pedagogi- 
cal treatment of idiotic children in 1897, partly as a 
result of the popular interest in thyroid organotherapy 
at that time, and partly as a result of a painstaking 
scrutiny of the texts of the founders of the “ physiological 
education” (she translated into Italian the works of 
Itard and Seguin from “ beginning to end ” in order that 
she might “ have time to weigh the sense of each word” 
and get “the spirit of the author ”), and who arrived at 
the conclusion, expressed at the Pedagogical Congress in 
Turin in 1898, that “mental deficiency presented chiefly 
a pedagogical, rather than mainly a medical, problem,” a 
conclusion which went directly counter to her medical 
colleagues. The present-day interest in the problems of 
mental deficiency in Italy is largely due to Montessori’s 
lectures and writing. 
There is, however, nothing essentially new in Montessori. 
Her principle of development (the unfoldment of latent 
impulses) and individuality was emphasized by Locke, 
Rousseau, Froebel and Seguin. 
Her insistence upon the necessity of the individual 
study of children, particularly the need of scientifically 
observing the spontaneous behavior and interests of chil- 
dren, was foreshadowed by Locke and Seguin. Montes- 
sori, however, has performed a service in reémphasizing a 
truth which teachers are prone to forget. 
Her emphasis on the need of giving children freedom and 
liberty of action runs back to Rousseau and Froebel. 
Montessori, however, has demonstrated practically how 
children may be given a maximum of freedom in the school- 
room.
-P-A-G-E-40
  24 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
Montessori’s insistence on the need of physical and sen- 
sory training for young normal children is of the very 
essence of her system. She undoubtedly derived the sug- 
gestion for applying her methods to normal children from 
Seguin, who had expressed his belief that his “ physio- 
logical education ” was applicable to normal children and 
would regenerate mankind. She may also have been aware 
of Rousseau’s advocacy of sensorimotor training for the 
children of the aristocrats. Montessori, however, put 
into practice in the organization of her House of Child- 
hood for normal children of the masses from three to 
seven what had earlier merely been advocated in theory, 
except in so far as Froebel had included more or less 
sensory and motor training in the kindergarten. Many 
of her didactic materials for improving and refining sen- 
sory discrimination are largely either reproductions or 
modifications of Itard’s or Seguin’s apparatus. She em- 
ploys the methods of formal sense training used by both 
of her masters, and while she may have placed greater 
restrictions upon the use of her apparatus according to 
predetermined models, she also includes exercises from 
practical life, as did Seguin. 
She freely admits that she got her spiritual key from 
Seguin. The teacher must act on the spirit and call to 
the man in the child. She must not restrict her aims 
merely to the development of sensorimotor or intellectual 
habits. Although, therefore, Montessori may have added 
nothing to educational theory that is essentially new, she 
has reémphasized certain principles and practices which 
are well worth emphasizing. The value of sensorimotor 
training for mental defectives has been tested and re- 
tested by independent investigators in the hot crucible of 
experience, and the judgment of the actual trainers should

    perhaps carry more weight than the criticisms made purely 
from the standpoint of educational theory. 
To trace in detail the growth of the organized efforts 
made in behalf of subnormal individuals during the last 
sixty or seventy years would bring our discussion too far 
afield.1_ The more significant features of the study and 
care of feeble-minded and backward children since the 
middle of the last century are the following: 
1. The establishment and development of public and 
private residential institutions for the training of feeble- 
minded children and for the permanent segregation and 
colonization of feeble-minded adolescents and adults. This 
work has been accomplished through the active propa- 
gandas which have been waged by social, educational, 
genetic, and medical associations and publications for 
adequate public provision for mental and social misfits. 
2. The establishment of special public day schools or 
classes for the training of “ mentally deficient,” “ sub-

_7 cated throughout the country by individuals, bureaus or 
departments connected with universities, public school 
systems, and state, municipal, government, private and 
semi-private institutions of various kinds. One of the 
most significant contributions during the last decade, not 
only of psychology but of science in general, to the study 
of the problem is the gradual perfection and standardiza- 
tion of mental tests, and intelligence and motor scales of 
development, by means of which it will be possible to grade 
individuals mentally by uniform objective standards. 
While a large amount of valuable work has already been 
accomplished in this field, we are only at the threshold of 
the science of mental testing, and much of the work already 
done is sadly in need of critical evaluation, particularly 
the standards which have been theoretically proposed and 
widely followed for the determination of feeble-mindedness 
by the B.-S. (Binet-Simon) scale. These standards will 
be given special consideration in Chapter II. The reader 
who desires to familiarize himself with the tests which are 
in common use should consult the exhaustive handbook 
in two volumes by Guy Montrose Whipple: Manual of 
Mental and Physical Tests, 1914 and 1915, - 
4, The establishment of psychologicaf or educational 
or psycho-educational clinics and the gradual development 
of a science of psychological and educational diagnosis, 
particularly with the aid of standardized psychological 
and educational tests and scales. We have already traced 
the growth of the psychological clinic and discussed 
psychological diagnosis in The Mental Health of the 
School Child, pp. 22ff., 121 f., 137f., and 156f. No com- 
prehensive handbook of pedagogical tests and scales of 
development has yet been published, but there are many 
scales available in spelling, writing, arithmetic, reading,

grammar, composition, etc., thanks to the labors of Thorn- 
dike, Courtis, Ayres, Buckingham, Starch, Hillegas, Gray, 
Freeman, and other investigators. It is to be hoped that 
a handbook of pedagogical tests comparable to Whipple’s 
handbook of mental tests will eventually be written. 
In the remaining pages of this chapter it will be neces- 
sary to limit our discussion to a brief consideration of the 
development of the institutional and public-school care of 
feeble-minded and backward children. 
Residential Institutions 
At the beginning of the present century residential 
training schools, workshops, and colonies for the feeble- 
minded were supported by the following countries of 
Europe: France, Germany, England, Denmark, Sweden, 
Norway, Finland, J utland, Holland, Austria, Switzerland, 
Belgium, Italy, Scotland, Ireland, and Russia. Among 
the British colonies institutions were supported by Canada, 
South Africa, Australia, and Adelaide, and among the 
Oriental nations by Japan alone. The most generous 
institutional provisions in Europe are afforded by Ger- 
many, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, and England. 
France, the birthplace of the scientific study and training 
of imbeciles, now affords the most meager provisions of 
any of the leading European nations. France does not 
support any separate institutions for the feeble-minded, 
but still cares for the feeble-minded in departments of 
the Bicétre and Salpétriére. 
Within a period of thirty-five years (from 1846 to 1881) 
thirty-two government and private training schools and 
colonies for the feeble-minded had been established in Ger- 
many. The number of institutions in Germany at the 
present time is about one hundred. Only ten of these are 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  28 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
state institutions, while the others are under private or 
church control. These institutions have accommodations 
for 20,000 inmates. Many of the institutions also con- 
tain epileptics. Saxony was the first German state to 
establish a state institution and to make the training of 
the feeble-minded compulsory by law. Some of the Ger- 
man institutions (such as Mariaberg) at first aimed to be 
purely educational in character, but they have gradually 
added custodial divisions. The best German institutions, 
such as Kiichenmiihle, Mariaberg, Alsterdorfer, and Bethel 
(primarily for epileptics), contain hospitals, assembly 
halls, large schools affording instruction in kindergarten, 
sensorimotor and literary work, workhouses and shops in 
which instruction is given in a large number of arts and 
crafts, and hothouses, gardens, and farms which provide 
profitable and healthful employment for the inmates. The 
institutions for the feeble-minded (as well as for the deaf 
and blind) in Germany are, I believe, under governmental 
supervision, administered by the Minister of Education, 
and the teachers are required to hold government licenses. 
The institutions in Denmark, Norway, Finland, and 
presumably Sweden are also under the supervision of the 
Minister of Public Instruction. In Norway the com- 
pulsory-school-attendance law includes imbeciles, and since 
1877 all the institutions and classes for backward chil- 
dren have been under state control. Denmark maintains 
asylums for the custodial cases, farm colonies, day schools 
for “ backward ” children, and workshops in which train- 
ing is given in the handicrafts and to which feeble-minded 
persons may be legally committed for profitable employ- 
ment. 
Sweden prefers small institutions, built to accommodate 
not more than about eighty inmates. These institutions,
-P-A-G-E-45
CHANGING ATTITUDES 29 
of which there are thirty-three, are usually in charge of 
women. The schools contain three classes of one year 
each, with a preliminary two-year course in which the 
pupils are carefully observed and classified. The pro- 
gram covers the primary grades and includes language 
lessons, the history and geography of Sweden, natural 
science, writing, arithmetic, drawing, singing, the cate- 
chism, physical training, manual training or sloyd, which 
was first used by the Swedish schools for educative pur- 
poses, wood, basket, brush and shoemaking, gardening, 
training in domestic employments, and physical training. 
After finishing their school training the boys are placed 
in “workshops ” located in the country, where they are 
employed at farming, gardening, and stock raising, while 
the girls are placed in shops usually located in the towns, 
where they are employed at tapestry, carpet-weaving, sew- 
ing, quilting, and lacemaking. Some of these shops are 
practically supported from the sale of the produce and 
the manufactured articles. 
Switzerland, like Sweden, prefers small institutions. 
There are about thirty of these in Switzerland. 
The first institution in America was a private school 
established in July, 1848, in Barre, Massachusetts, by 
Hervey B. Wilbur. A few months later, in October, an 
experimental school was established by the state in Perkins 
Institute for the Blind in Boston, under the supervision of 
the director of the latter school, Samuel G. Howe. This 
school was established on the recommendation of a state 
ommission which was created by a resolution introduced in 
he legislature January 22, 1846.1 Previous to the foun-    
     
               
   
        
   
   1A somewhat similar resolution was introduced in the New York 
legislature January 13, 1846, but several bills introduced to create 
in experimental school failed of passage until 1851.

  80 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
dation of these schools sporadic attempts had been made 
to train a few imbeciles in the “ American Asylum for the 
Deaf and Dumb” in Hartford, Connecticut, which was 
organized by Gallaudet (1787-1851) in 1816, and the 
Perkins Institute in 1839. In 1850 the Boston school 
was incorporated as the “ Massachusetts School for Idiotic 
and Feeble-Minded Children” and located in South Bos- 
ton. It was some years later si to its present site 
at Waverly. 
The establishment of institutions in the United States 
proceeded very slowly at first, because the movement was 
viewed with much suspicion. The Connecticut commis- 
sion appointed to study the problem of feeble-mindedness 
reported that there was a “ settled conviction that idiots 
were so utterly helpless that it was a waste of time even 
to collect any statistics regarding them.” ‘The annual 
reports of the early superintendents of the institutions 
for the feeble-minded consisted largely of briefs and pleas 
for giving the feeble-minded the same educational op- 
portunities, according to their ability, as the state affords 
normal children. In order to demonstrate to the law- 
makers the possibility of training feeble-minded children, 
experimental schools were located near the state capitals. 
The successful demonstrations afforded by these schools ? 
and the active propagandas waged by such pioneers as 
Howe, Seguin, Richards, Wilbur, Parish, and Kerlin, bore 
fruit in due season. Today thirty-three states in the Union 
support one or more institutions for the feeble-minded.? 
1In 1897 a large colony annex was established at Templeton, in 
order to afford opportunities for employment for those who have com- 
pleted their training at Waverly. 
2 Some of the marvelous results shown are, no doubt, explained by 
the fact that some of the children were backward and not feeble- 
minded. 
3 A list of the public and private institutions for the feeble-minded|  
-P-A-G-E-47
CHANGING ATTITUDES 81 
The states which do not maintain an institution are: 
Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, 
Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, South 
Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, and the Dis- 
trict of Columbia.‘ These states do not furnish any state 
care for their feeble-minded dependents except as they are 
cared for in improper institutions. It is considered that 
no state in the Union has ample institutional accommoda- 
tions for all its feeble-minded incompetents, although it is 
evident, as will be pointed out presently, that many in- 
stitutions contain inmates who are borderline and back- 
ward instead of feeble-minded. ‘Several states support 
more than one institution for the feeble-minded. New 
York maintains four, Massachusetts three (including a 
private school receiving state aid), Pennsylvania three, 
(including the institution at Elwyn), and New Jersey two 
(including a private institution containing state-pay in- 
mates). Nine states maintain, in addition, separate in- 
stitutions for epileptics; namely, Massachusetts, New 
York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Kansas, 
Virginia, and Iowa. Illinois is now building a separate 
institution for epileptics. The large majority of the 
states still care for their epileptics in institutions for the 
feeble-minded, a practice probably inherited from Europe, 
may be found in the “ Report of the Commissioner of Education for 
the Year Ended June 30, 1916,” Vol. II, p. 647. The list of private 
schools is, however, quite incomplete. 
1 Florida has appointed a commission of five to study the needs of 
the feeble-minded and epileptic. Idaho authorized and partly pro- 
vided for an institution for the feeble-minded and epileptic in 1913, 
but the 1915 legislature failed to make the necessary appropriations 
to complete the institution. Texas has appropriated $50,000 for the 
purchase of a site for a colony for the feeble-minded near Austin. 
Vermont has appropriated $65,000 for the establishment of an in- 
stitution at Brandon. Virginia has a cottage for feeble-minded 
women in the state-colony for the epileptic.

  32 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
or in hospitals for the insane, or in other types of im- 
proper institutions. 
The number of inmates in the American institutions for 
the feeble-minded in 1914, according to the report of the 
Commissioner of Education, was 28,878. Of these, 916 
were in private institutions and 27,962 in state institutions 
(the state institutions, however, include two villages for — 
epileptics). How many feeble-minded persons are at large 
in society and how many are confined in improper types 
of institutions are not known. The estimates frequently 
hazarded are mere conjectures. Indeed, we are lacking 
scientifically accurate data to show what percentage of 
the inmates in the public and private institutions are ac- 
tually feeble-minded. While it is evident from the articles 
of incorporation that the vast majority of state institu- 
tions were founded specifically for the care and education 
of the “ feeble-minded ” (including in some cases the epilep- 
tic), the concept of “ feeble-mindedness ” (never defined 
with scientific precision ') has been made so elastic as to in- 
clude almost all types of persons who are somewhat subnor- 
mal or abnormal physically, mentally, or socially. It there- 
fore happens that some of the inmates in the institutions 
for the “ feeble-minded ” are physically weak or incapaci- 
tated, or mentally retarded or backward or morally in- 
firm or unstable, or psychopathic or psychotic, or friend- 
less and homeless (through abandonment or death of 
1The definition proposed by the English Royal Commission is in 
point: A “feeble-minded” person is one who can make his living 
under favorable circumstances but who is incapable of “competing 
on equal terms with his normal fellows or to conduct himself with 
ordinary prudence.” There are any number of persons who cannot 
compete on equal terms with their normal fellows, who are not feeble- 
minded. They may be only dull, backward, or retarded. The pro- 
posed XII-year Binet-Simon criterion will be discussed in detail in 
Chapter II.

parents), rather than feeble-minded. That this should be 
the case should occasion no surprise, in view of the further 
fact that many, perhaps most, of the inmates in state in- 
stitutions are committed by order of court on the recom- 
mendation of examiners who are not specialists on the 
problem of mental deficiency, or they are adjudged feeble- 
minded on the basis of certain arbitrarily adopted stand- 
ards of intelligence development which cannot be validated. 
That the concept of feeble-mindedness has been so ex- 
panded during the last six years as to include degrees of 
mental retardation which can only be classified as dullness 
or backwardness becomes evident from the facts presented 
in Chapter IT. 
In order to determine from the relevant statistical data 
at present available the approximate mentality distribu- 
tion of persons incarcerated in institutions for the feeble- 
minded, we may examine the grade distribution of the 
school children and the Binet-Simon classification of all 
the inmates. In such an examination it is particularly 
important to determine the percentage of pupils who are 
successfully doing literary work beyond the third grade 
and the percentage of inmates who grade higher than 
B.-S. (Binet-Simon) IX, for it is probable that few per~ 
sons who are genuinely feeble-minded successfully carry 
the literary work beyond the ‘third grade * (except in cer- 
1 We are by no means certain that we have not set the academic 
attainments of pupils who are genuinely feeble-minded too high, fol- 
lowing, as we do, Tredgold’s concept of feeble-mindedness: “The 
term ‘mental deficiency’ ... should be restricted to those persons 
who are so lacking in general mental capacity, in common sense, that 
they are incapable of subsisting by their own unaided efforts” (p. 
385). “The lowest intellectual stratum of the normal class... 
stand widely removed from the feeble-minded in that they possess 
sufficient of the saving grace of common sense to look after their in- 
terests without supervision” (p. 392). Tredgold makes this state- 
ment regarding the most intelligent class of children of the average

  34 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
tain branches in which they may be gifted) while the facts 
which will be presented later seem to indicate that few 
feeble-minded persons rarely reach a B.-S. mentality 
of X. 
The only grade distribution available for schools con- 
nected with institutions are the tables published by the 
United States Commissioner of Education. These tables 
are far from satisfactory, because they fail to give the 
number of pupils who are successfully doing each grade of 
work above the kindergarten. It is therefore impossible to 
calculate the percentage of pupils enrolled in the grades 
above our crucial third grade. Moreover, it is of course 
possible that pupils may be classified too high. However, 
the tables show that of 6254 school pupils in the state in- 
stitutions, 36.8% were enrolled in the kindergarten, 
86.2% in the first and second grades, 20.9% in the 
third and fourth grades, and 5.8% above the fourth 
age of twelve in a “typical ‘special’ day school under the London 
County Council”: “Excluding a few children — who, in my opinion, 
are not really defective—it may be said that the scholastic acquire- 
ments of none of these children come up to normal standard II. 
In occupations and manual work they are decidedly better.” (Men- 
tal Deficiency, 1914, p. 169). Mrs. Hume Pinsent, the founder of the 
Birmingham After-Care Committee, stated in 1910 that “It is quite 
exceptional for any of them (referring to children who are retained 
in special schools) to reach a higher educational position than that 
attained in Standard II. This means that at sixteen the best of them 
will be able to read and calculate to about the same extent as a 
normal child of eight or nine. The numbers who attain to Standard 
II are variously stated by witnesses as from 40 to 58 per cent, at the 
best only about half of the total number.” Binet and Simon assert 
that only half of the mental defectives reach the first-year inter- 
mediate course, corresponding to ages nine and ten. Maennel appar- 
ently sets the “middle grade of the regular school” as the upper 
standard for the auxiliary schools. But Maennel practically concedes 
that other than feeble-minded children get into these schools. Our 
experience in public-school work has shown that many children who 
are unable to progress in the literary work through or beyond the 
third grade are certainly not feeble-minded but backward.
-P-A-G-E-51

grade. How many of those “above the fourth grade” 
were in the fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth grade can- 
not be determined. The corresponding per cents for 
private residential institutions, based on 568 pupils, are: 
38.3, 32.5, 20.0, and 8.9. The private institutions con- 
tain not only more pupils in the lowest grade, but also 
more in the highest grade, than the state institutions. 
This was to be expected, for the private schools are not 
restricted by outside authority in their choice of pupils. 
These figures suggest that probably at least 10% of 
the pupils are enrolled in some grade above the third. 
That the standards of feeble-mindedness differ in dif- 
ferent institutions is indicated by the fact that twenty 
state institutions for the feeble-minded offer school work 
above the fourth grade, nine institutions do not go beyond 
the fourth grade, while nine institutions fail to supply the 
data, particularly for the upper grades. Thus more than 
half of the institutions at least go beyond the fourth grade 
—while the Swedish institutions do not go beyond our sug- 
gested standard. On the other hand, eleven of the private 
schools go beyond the fourth grade, four do not, while 
fourteen fail to supply the data. 
Unfortunately the extant B.-S. age data are very much 
less extensive than the data available on school grades. 
However, in a B.-S. survey of all the inmates at the 
training school at Vineland,t New Jersey, 3.7% graded 
X years, 1.3% XI years and 1.8% XII years. In 
other words, 6.8% of the inmates were above TX men- 
tally.

  36 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
State School and Colony in Illinois, 5.5% were recorded 
as backward or normal.* 
In an examination of 988 Binet blanks of the inmates in 
the Ohio Institution for the Feeble-Minded, 7.8% had a 
mentality of X years, 2% of XI years, and 9.9% of X 
years and over.” 
The above school grade and B.S. distribution suggest 
that from 5% to 10% of the inmates in our state institu- 
tions for the feeble-minded may not be actually feeble- 
minded. 
It would be easy to cite illustrative cases of persons com- 
mitted to institutions for the feeble-minded who could not 
on careful examination be diagnosed as other than back- 
ward.? Examination of several boys who escaped from

Binet-Simon Tests.” Psychological Clinic, 1914, 197f. Evidently 
this survey did not include all the inmates in the institution. Had all 
the inmates been included the per cent might have been cut down. 
8 A study of borderline and normal children sent to the Rome, New 
York, custodial asylum has recently been undertaken, at the sugges- 
tion of Dr. Bernstein, by the Bureau of Analysis and Investigation 
of the State Board of Charities of New York: Report on Fifty- 
Two Borderline Cases in the Rome State Custodial Asylum, 1914, 
and Second Report on Fifty-Two Borderline Cases in the Rome State 
Custodial Asylum, 1915. The committee of the Board properly states 
that “in the interest of humanity . . . it was of the utmost import- 
ance that each case be thoroughly investigated, for if, in a single in- 
stance, there was normality, it would be inhuman to stigmatize such 
a child as feeble-minded by committing it to a custodial asylum, and 
also it would be sufficient compensation for all the labor and expense 
if even one of these could be saved from the unhappy fate of con- 
demnation to permanent association with the feeble-minded and 
idiotic.” Several of these children have since been discharged. In 
an examination of 25 children “confined at the Bicétre, at Salpétritre, 
or at other places,” Binet and Simon found “that three of them 
were at age in intelligence, and two others were a year advanced be- 
yond the average.” The term “mental debility” had been applied 
to two and “idiot” to one of those who proved to be normal, while 
 
-P-A-G-E-53

institutions or were removed by their parents, showed that 
they were backward and not feeble-minded. Recently 
after a thorough examination, and after consultation with 
his teachers, the writer refused to certify an orphan as 
feeble-minded. But the orphanage was determined to 
commit him to a state institution for the feeble-minded, 
and prevailed on two physicians to certify that he was 
feeble-minded. On the occasion of a visit to the institution 
in question I was told by one of the boy’s teachers that 
he was the brightest pupil in her class. He is still in the 
institution. 
The case of the following child, who just escaped de- 
portation from Missouri to the state institution for the 
feeble-minded in Kentucky, is also apropos. An aban- 
doned boy, originally from Kentucky, was brought to the 
clinic in January, 1915, at the age of 7.3 years by an 
instructor in a college, a naturalist, who had provided 
him with a temporary home for several years, and who 
was interested to secure the opinion of a psychological 
examiner touching the boy’s mental capacity. The in- 
structor related that the boy had been reported slow in 
his school work, but that he showed very fair intelligence 
in his activities about the house and in his reactions while 
accompanying the instructor on his field excursions. The 
examination showed that the boy graded 7.6 by the 1908 
and 7. by the 1911 Binet scale, age 6 by the Seguin form 
board, that he was normal in height and weight, but some- 
what underdeveloped in strength and in head girth, and 
one of those who was advanced one year was classified as débile. 
The authors’ comments on these findings are apropos, in view of the 
criticisms to which we have been subjected: “We cite this fact for 
the benefit of M. R.... who took upon himself to inveigh against 
our last book, Les Enfants Anormaux (L’Année Psychologique, 
1908, 1ff.). 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  88 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
that he suffered from carious teeth, adenoids, and pityri- 
asis. The instructor was told that the boy at best would 
probably never be very bright but that there was no evi- 
dence that he was mentally deficient. Later in the year 
the boy was returned to the Home for orphaned and 
abandoned children where he had previously resided. 
During an attack of illness he was transferred to the city 
hospital, where he remained six weeks. On his recovery 
he was returned to the Home with the following state- 
ment from a medical officer of the institution: ‘ During 
his stay here he was examined as to his mental state, and 
found to be deficient, having the mentality of a boy of 
TY or 8 years.” (He was then about 814 years old.) 
On receipt of this report the Home had the boy certified as 
feeble-minded by the Home physician, and informed the 
instructor that he would be sent to the Kentucky state 
institution for the feeble-minded. The instructor, how- 
ever, felt that the boy was not feeble-minded and therefore 
inquired who had certified him as feeble-minded. He was 
told that the writer had done so. He did not believe that 
this was possible from the report which the writer had 
previously made and found on inquiry that it was un- 
true. The writer then arranged to reéxamine the boy be- 
fore a class of teachers of mental defectives and social 
workers who were taking a course in clinical testing. He 
was then, June, 1916, 8.7 years old. His B.-S. age was 
7.8 by the 1908 scale and 7.4 by the 1911 scale, indicating 
only a slight gain since the earlier testing; his age by the 
Seguin form board was eight, indicating a gain of two 
years, while in physical development he had made normal 
progress, except that he had lost slightly in weight. The 
greatest change noticed by the writer was in his general 
attitude. He was far more diffident and less inclined to
-P-A-G-E-55
CHANGING ATTITUDES 39 
respond readily than when he was first tested. The in- 
structor said that since his return from the Home he 
had not been the same boy when in the presence of adults, 
whom he avoided, although he was as aggressive with chil- 
dren as before. The instructor was inclined to ascribe 
this to repressive and unnatural conditions in the “ Home ” 
life. On the educational side, the boy had completed the 
second quarter of the second grade, but in some things 
he did not do as well as during the previous examination, 
which may have been partly due to the fact that his 
schooling had been interrupted and he was diffident in his 
responses. The members of the class were asked to 
classify him at the conclusion of the examination. One 
said that he was normal, eight thought he was backward 
or retarded, and two that he might be mentally deficient, 
both basing their opinion on a glassy expression of the 
eyes and a nervous shrug of the shoulder, and not on 
the fact that his general reactions seemed to be typical of 
feeble-mindedness. Not a single member of the class, 
however, considered that the child was an institutional 
case. A good home has been found for him, which pro- 
vides a normal social environment, and at last writing 
he was said to be getting along very well. 
The following cases, examined in the same clinic course, 
are apropos. All of these cases were sent to the clinic 
because they were thought to be feeble-minded. Five were 
sent by one of the local institutions, which desired to have 
them certified for the state institution for the feeble- 
minded. All were boys, except Case 6. After all the 
data gathered on each case had been presented and dis- 
cussed before the class, each member of the class was asked 
to diagnose the case. Most of the members of the class 
had studied the problem of feeble-mindedness for at least 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  40 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
two years, while some had extensive practical experience 
with the feeble-minded. The number of estimations is 
not the same for all cases, owing to occasional absences 
from class. 
Case 1, chronological age 9.58; B.-S. retardation by the 
1908 1.1 year and by the 1911 1.8 year; advanced 1.4 by

1, and backward by the writer. Case 2, aged 12.16; re- 
tardation 1.1 year by the 1908 and .9 by the 1911; at 
age by the Seguin; diagnosed normal by 5 members, re- 
tarded by 2, borderline by 1, and retarded by the writer. 
Case 3, aged 15.2; retarded 4.4 years by the 1908, 5.2 by 
the 1911, and 5 by the Seguin; diagnosed retarded by 2, 
backward by 2, moron by 3, imbecile by 1, degenerate by 
1, and by the writer as a case of mental inferiority 
(borderline) due to early rickets, probably complicated 
by congenital syphilis. Case 4, aged 14.5; retarded 3.5 
years by the 1909 and 1911 and 1.5 by the Seguin; 
diagnosed retarded by 1, backward by 1, borderline by 
1, feeble-minded by 2, and borderline by the writer. Case 
5, aged 7.66; retarded by the 1908 .6, by the 1911 1.2, 
and by the Seguin 1.8; diagnosed retarded by 4, back- 
ward by 2, and backward by the writer. Case 6, aged 
10.5; retarded 2.7 by the 1908, 3.3 by the 1911 and 5 by 
the Seguin; diagnosed retarded by 1, borderline by 2, 
doubtful by 2, and feeble-minded by the writer. All of 
these cases were presumed to be feeble-minded, but only 
one, or at most two, could be so certified. 
The following case was reported to me recently by a 
psychologist. At the age of five a boy, having large out- 
standing ears (an alleged stigma of degeneration), was

transferred from an orphanage to a state institution for 
the feeble-minded. On the assumption that the boy was 
feeble-minded the superintendent did not examine him 
mentally until he was seventeen. He then tested him, but 
only through Binet XII (a method to which we have fre- 
quently disapprovingly referred as “short-range test- 
ing”), and found that he rated 11.2, declared him a 
moron and decided that he should be retained permanently 
in the institution. Fortunately, however, the boy was 
tested a year later by a psychologist who used the wide- 
range method, and found that he graded Binet XII +. 
He failed on only one or two Binet tests. On many other 
standardized tests he proved to be normal. ‘The psycholo- 
gist got the young man transferred from the institution 
—at the expense, however, of his own position —to a 
college preparatory school, where he was reported at the 
end of his first year as the best in his class. To what 
extent this boy’s intellectual development was checked by 
twelve or thirteen years of institutional routine, dry-rot, 
and dearth of incentive to creative achievement, cannot be 
said; at the age of eighteen he should have been in college 
instead of in the preparatory school.1 But there is little 
doubt that some children of promise and of fairly good 
mentality have had their careers blighted because they 
were sidetracked — nay, derailed — into an institution for 
the feeble-minded. Until recently no attempt had been 
1A case somewhat similar to the above, known to me personally, 
is that of an alleged epileptic, age 14, B.-S. 11.4, committed to an 
institution for epileptics, where he was retained for several years al- 
though he was not known to have had a single convulsion at the 
institution. _ He secured his escape only after he had fallen heir to 
a legacy and after powerful influences had been brought to bear in 
his behalf. Children like this make good “show” pupils in institu- 
tions. Binet and Simon notice the same tendency (“fraud”) in 
France to retain show pupils in special classes or in institutions: as 
before, p. 81f.

made in these institutions scientifically to classify the in- 
mates by the methods of clinical psychology. 
The time must come when no child can be incarcerated 
in an institution for the feeble-minded unless he has been 
diagnosed as feeble-minded by a disinterested state official 
who is a trained and experienced expert on the various 
forms and degrees of mental deficiency, and who has mas- 
tered the technique of mental testing. Every state re- 
quires the services of a state psychologist, with a corps of 
assistants, for this work.t 
While it is desirable to enact state laws which will make 
it possible permanently to retain inmates in institutions 
for the feeble-minded, once they have been committed,— 
New Jersey and Illinois now have laws to this effect,— it 
is obvious that such laws must be very cautiously drafted 
so that it will not be possible permanently to retain any 
one who is not actually feeble-minded. It does not seem 
wise to leave the decision as to whether an individual is or 
is not feeble-minded wholly to the authorities of the insti- 
tution, who naturally desire to retain the brightest in- 
mates, but to a disinterested tribunal. The state bureau 
of psychological diagnosis should assume this function, in 
conjunction with the authorized representatives of the in- 
stitution concerned, or in connection with the court of 
jurisdiction. 
That the public is becoming alive to the iniquity of 
committing and retaining backward or normal or psy- 
chotic children or adults in an institution for the 
1Perhaps a better plan would be to appoint two state psychol- 
ogists, one to be connected with the state institutions for the exami- 
nation of the cases sent to the institutions for the feeble-minded and 
the delinquent, and the other to be connected with the state depart- 
ment of education and the state college of education, for work with 
the public-school deficients. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
CHANGING ATTITUDES 43, 
feeble-minded is shown by the recent enactment of a 
rigid law for the commitment of the feeble-minded in 
the state of Illinois, effective July 1,1915: ‘The words 
‘feeble-minded’ in this Act shall be construed to 
mean any person afflicted with mental defectiveness from 
birth or from an early age, so pronounced that he 
is incapable of managing himself and his affairs, or 
of being taught to do so, and requires supervision, con- 
trol, and care for his own welfare, or for the welfare of 
others, or for the welfare of the community, who is not 
classifiable as an ‘insane person.’” . . . Action can be 
taken for the commitment of such a person when through 
“want of proper supervision, control, care, and support, 
it is unsafe and dangerous to the welfare of the community 
for him to be at large without supervision, control, and 
care.” ... “The hearing on the petition shall be by 
court and a commission to be appointed by the court, of 
two qualified physicians or one qualified physician and one 
qualified psychologist, residents of the county, to be se- 
lected by the judge on account of their known competency 
and integrity, and evidence shall be heard and proceedings 
had as in any other civil proceedings.” “ Evidence shall 
also be heard and inquiry made into the social conditions, 
such as want of proper supervision, control, care, and 
support, and other causes making it unsafe or dangerous 
to the welfare of the community, for such person to be at 
large, without supervision or control and care.” 
The feeble-minded person or any of his relatives or 
friends or any reputable person may petition “ the court 
that entered the order of admission, to discharge the 
eeble-minded person, or to vary the order of the court.” 
fter hearing on a petition, “ discharges and variations 
f orders may be made for any of the following causes:

44 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
Because the person adjudged to be feeble-minded is not 
feeble-minded; because he has so far improved as to be 
capable of caring for himself; because the relatives or 
friends of the feeble-minded person are able and willing to 
supervise, control, care for, and support him and request 
his discharge; . . . or for other reasons which the court, 
in its discretion, may deem adequate, having due regard 
for the welfare of the person concerned, or the welfare of 
others, or the welfare of the community.” 
It is of interest to note that the new Illinois commitment 
law accords legal recognition to the qualified psychologist 
as an authority on feeble-mindedness and as competent to 
offer expert testimony before the court. 
One fundamental fact in regard to the institutions for 
the feeble-minded must be specially emphasized. 'These in- 
stitutions in the United States (and in Europe also) were 
organized strictly as “schools,” and were so designated. 
But in the process of time many of them have assumed the 
functions of asylums for the idiotic and the helpless, cus- 
todial homes for adults, farm colonies for the more capa- 
ble workers, as well as schools for educable children. Of 
the 27,962 inmates in our state institutions in 1914, only 
15,253 were in school. From the standpoint of efficiency 
it seems desirable to organize two separate kinds of insti- 
tutions: first, a colony or workshop with a custodial de- 
partment for the employment of the trained workers and 
for the care of the helpless cases ; and second, a residential 
school for the training and education of the educable chil- 
dren. 
The superintendent of the latter institution should be an 
educator, who has specialized on the psychology and peda- 
gogy of fecble-mindedness and on the social care of the 
feeble-minded. In common with Heller and Strohmayer I 
       
           
   
      
-P-A-G-E-61
CHANGING ATTITUDES 45 
hold that institutions in which the work is chiefly educa- 
tional and social should be headed by educational special- 
ists of executive ability, who are experts in the peculiar 
problems affecting each type of institution. Such insti- 
tutions are: the training schools for the feeble-minded, for 
the blind, for the deaf, for the juvenile dependents and de- 
linquents — and, of course, the public-school systems, All 
of these institutions should not only be administered by a 
competent educator, but they should be supervised by the 
state department of education. There is no reason why 
the state schools for the blind and the deaf — and the pub- 
lic schools — should be under the jurisdiction of the State 
Superintendent of Instruction, but not the training insti- 
tutions for the feeble-minded — unless it is that the latter 
are regarded as eleemosynary in character. But, even so, 
this does not change the fundamental conception of the 
feeble-minded institution as an educational and social 
agency and not a sanatorium or hospital. It is indeed 
paradoxical to find that the training schools for the feeble- 
minded in the United States were distinctly founded as 
schools and instituted as “links in the chain of common 
schools ” (Samuel G. Howe), and yet only two of the state 
institutions are subject to the supervision or regulation 
of the state department of education, namely in the states 
of Rhode Island and Montana, and it is probable that few 
of the states require the teachers to hold professional or 
state licenses. We have found a more consistent scheme 
of organization in some of the leading European countries 
(p. 28). 
On the other hand, institutions in which the problems 
lare chiefly or largely medical should be administered by 
hysicians of executive ability who are specialists in the 
eculiar medical problems affecting each type of institu-

tion; namely, the medical dispensaries and sanatoria, and 
the hospitals for the sick, the insane, and the epileptic. 
In the case of other types of institutions — colonies for 
the trained feeble-minded, reformatories, penitentiaries, 
state homes — it is chiefly of concern that they should be 
administered by intelligent executives, who are vitally in- 
terested in the work, and not by politicians who are look- 
ing for political prizes. 
After completing the course of training in the state resi- 
dential school, pupils who are genuinely feeble-minded and 
who will not be properly protected and supervised in so- 
ciety should be transferred for permanent productive em- 
ployment in the farm colonies or workshops. 
Public Day Classes 
A number of causes have contributed to the organiza- 
tion of special classes or special schools for feeble-minded 
children in the public systems of day schools in Europe 
and America. In the first place, the educational work 
undertaken in the early state or private residential schools 
for the feeble-minded demonstrated that feeble-minded 
children could be successfully trained according to their 
capacity. The successful work of these institutions fo- 
cused attention upon the presence of similar children in 
the public schools and the special problems which they 
create in the administration of public-school education. 
In the second place, the enactment of compulsory- 
attendance laws forced large numbers of  feeble-minded 
children into the public schools who had previously re- 
mained at home or roamed the streets. It was soon found 
that these children could not be reached by the ordinary 
processes of the schools. The attempt to mold them into 
a common pattern by means of uniform methods and a
-P-A-G-E-63
CHANGING ATTITUDES 47 
standardized subject matter proved a failure: these pupils 
merely vegetated in the primary grades. It was accord- 
ingly felt that it would be necessary either to organize 
special classes for these children, or to transfer them to 
residential institutions, or to exclude them entirely from 
| school. But since it did not seem humane to deprive the 
mentally weak from public instruction and since the pro- 
visions in the residential institutions were inadequate, or 
since it seemed undesirable to institutionalize all these chil- 
dren, there was no option but to found special classes in 
the public schools. Germany was probably the first 
country to make education compulsory for all children 
within certain prescribed ages, hence it is not surprising 
to find that Germany was the first country to organize 
special day classes for feeble-minded pupils in the public 
schools, a class being started in Halle as early as 1859. 
In the United States the compulsory-attendance laws were 
not enacted, or at least were not generally enforced, until 
the early nineties, hence no special classes were organized 
until 1896. 
The third factor that has contributed to the develop- 
ment and extension of the special-class movement, espe- 
cially in America, are the surveys made during the last 
fifteen or twenty years of pedagogical retardation in the 
grade schools. ‘These studies have shown that from 10% 
to 75% of the pupils in the elementary grades are over- 
age for their grade. These surveys suggest that at least 
one-fifth of the elementary pupils throughout the United 
States are retarded one year or more in their school work.

1 Maennel credits Halle while Henz credits Dresden with opening the first aux- 
iliary class in Germany. The class in Halle received pupils at first for only two 
periods a day. The class in Elberfeld, 1879, is said to have been more truly 
an auxiliary class than that in Halle (classes for the feeble-minded are known as 
“ Hilfsschiile”” in Germany). : 
2 Arrangements for aiding the feeble-minded were begun in Chur in 1881. 
3'The establishment of special public-school classes was made permissible by 
the folk-school law enacted in 1889. 
4 The work of the London classes deserves special mention. The special classes 
(sometimes called junior schools) are housed in a detached building containing 
from two to twelve rooms, located on the grounds of one of the regular schools in 
@ populous district, but separated from the latter by a high partition. Pupils 
come unattended to these “ centers’? from two, three, or more large school dis- 
tricts. Distant pupils may be provided with a guide or conveyance, or they may 
be boarded out at public expense near a special center. Each center usually 
contains two or three classes. The boys and girls are in the same classes. The 
number of pupils to each teacher is limited to twenty. To obtain a special grant 
for the support of these centers, the classrooms must be located on the ground 
floor and eye must provide twenty feet of floor space and a separate desk for 
each child; the building must contain suitable drill rooms, lavatories, and en- 
trances; and the grounds must provide suitable play space. The special centers 
are under the supervision of a special inspector. The principal of a school must 
be a certified teacher, but the teachers, all women, have no special training for 
the work other than that indicated by the ability to pass the qualifying examina- 
tions required to teach in infant schools (kindergartens). It was assumed 
that the work could be modeled along the lines of the infant schools, but the in- 
fant type of curriculum has been found wanting. A feeble-minded boy of ten who 
has crystallized on the five-year level is not like a normal “infant” of five. 
Hence the curriculum has been revised to meet the need of feeble-minded chil- 
dren, and a demand is developing for specially trained teachers. The emphasis 
is now placed on practical industrial work. The regulations of July, 1904, pre-

scribe a minimum of not less than six hours a week of handwork for each child, 
while fifteen hours of handwork are permissible. The number of pupils in a 
class for handwork is limited to eight. The forms of manual instruction given 
to the younger children include paper-mat making, clay modeling, macramé work, and various forms of string work, bead threading, paper cutting, folding 
and mounting, pricking, coloring, kindergarten sewing, needlework (not to ex- 
ceed two of the six hours), worsted work, building with cubes, and basket making. 
The work for the older boys includes modeling in pasteboard (the German pappé 
work), basket making, shoemaking, woodwork of various kinds, mat making,

better opportunities for industrial training, special industrial centers (senior 
schools) have been established for the older pupils. The centers for the boys (in 
charge of masters) and for the girls (in charge of mistresses) are separate. 
Pupils are transferred to these centers at the age of twelve or thirteen. Besides 
the industrial training, instruction is offered in the London classes in elementary 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, object lessons, drawing, singing and recitation,
-P-A-G-E-66
  50 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
ferentiated instruction in the schools has, in the fourth 
place, also been emphasized by the investigations made of 
individual children during this period by means of the 
mental tests of the experimental, educational, and clinical 
psychologists. These tests have revealed not only large 
differences in individual traits among children who may 
be considered normal, but also large differences in general 
capacity or general intelligence among children of all 
ages, frequently amounting to many years. 
As a result of these movements, the public schools in 
practically all of the large cities and in many of the 
smaller cities of Europe and America have consciously and 
systematically undertaken to train feeble-minded children 
in special classes or in special schools. A list of the first 
schools organized in different countries, in Europe and 
America, and the latest available enrollment statistics from 
these countries appear in Table I. Students interested 
in the detailed history of the development of special classes 
and physical training. The daily sessions include two and a half hours in the 
morning and two in the afternoon, with a midday recess of one and a half hours. 
Records are kept of each child, including estimates of the child’s capacity, attain- 
ments, progress in the special class, habits, health, and family history. In 1914 
there were under the control of the London County Council ninety-two junior 
day schools with a roll of 7785 children, twelve senior day schools for older boys, 
with a roll of 1279 pupils, and two senior day schools for older girls with a roll 
of 149. The need is being felt in London for the organization of classes “ inter- 
mediate” between the regular grades and the special schools. 
5 The dates of the founding of the early special classes in the public schools of 
the United States are given variously by different writers. The dates given in the 
table were reported to the writer in 1913 by authorities from the schools con- 
cerned. The special classes started in New York in 1874 and in Cleveland in 
1879 were for disciplinary and truant children. 6 The first school was a state institution, occupying what is said to be “ the 
best auxiliary school building in the world,” with eight classrooms, two shower 
baths, a roof playground, a large yard, a library for the children and the teach- 
ers. The faculty consists of one director, four specially trained male teachers, 
and a lady kindergartner. Connected with the school is the ‘‘ Imperial Physio- 
logical Laboratory,’ directed by a psychiatrist, with the assistance of an ortho- 
pedist, oculist, and aurist; a day home for the children of employed parents, whose activities are directed here from seven in the morning to six in the evening by kindergarten teachers; a continuation school for the further training of chil- 
dren who have finished the auxiliary school, the attendance being compulsory for “all feeble-minded children who are not continuing their education elsewhere ” ; 
an aid society formed by the teachers of the school for assisting children who leave 
school; and a vacation normal school, where training is given to prospective 
teachers of the feeble-minded.

We shall confine our attention to a discussion of one of 
the fundamental problems concerning the organization and 
management of special classes, 
So far as it is possible to judge by the documents at 
hand, the special classes were originally established solely 
for the training of feeble-minded children. This was un- 
doubtedly the intent of the first German classes, although 
the pupils regarded as eligible were generally referred to 
by the more generic and euphonious terms “ defective,” + 
“ deficient,” or “ mentally defective,” or children of “ sub- 
normal endowment,” rather than by the term feeble- 
minded, and although some cities (e.g., Berlin) aimed from 
the outset to return the pupils to the regular grades. 
That it did not seem inconsistent to some of the early 
school executives to attempt to restore feeble-minded chil- 
dren to the regular grades is probably explained by the 
fact that the first reports of the mental improvement 
wrought in the pupils in the institutions for the feeble- 
minded were either exaggerated or otherwise the pupils 
were backward rather than feeble-minded. However, it 
soon became apparent in Germany that it was impossible

1864,   
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  52 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
to return the auxiliary-class pupils to the higher elemen- 
tary grades. Of 1302 pupils in the auxiliary classes in 
Berlin in 1903, only 65 were returned to the grades. The 
fact, however, that pupils were being assigned to the auxil- 
iary classes in Germany who obviously were not feeble- 
minded led the Prussian Minister of Education in 1892 to 
make a distinction between children “neglected at home, 
and those who are naturally deficient,” and to issue in- 
structions that of the latter only those “who, during at 
least two years’ attendance at the Volksschule, have shown 
themselves incapable of attaining the standard set, are in- 
dicated as requiring special attention and instruction,” 
and that the highest grade in the auxiliary schools should 
correspond roughly to.the middle grade of the regular 
Volksschule. He further discountenanced the idea of at- 
tempting to return these pupils to the regular grades. In 
spite of this attempt toward a more rigid delimitation of 
the field of the special class, the greatest diversity appar- 
ently still exists in the organization of special classes in 
Germany, for we find in 1910 that 11 schools had only 
one grade or section; 40 had two; 120 had three; 59 had 
four; 20 had five; 63 had six; 5 had seven; and 1 had 
eight. The Leipsic auxiliary school is said to have a 
“sixth year” in arithmetic, although the admission syl- 
labus shows that the proper candidates for the school are 
limited to “ feeble-minded ” children. 
These figures demonstrate clearly that a large number 
of the auxiliary schools of Germany are harboring back- 
ward children, a circumstance which explains the high de- 
gree of industrial success achieved by the graduates of 
the German classes, as stated in Chapter IV. Very few 
German cities have organized a dual system of special 
classes for pedagogically retarded children, a notable ex-

CHANGING ATTITUDES 53 
ception being Mannheim, where they have clearly recog- 
nized the need of, and established, two kinds of special 
classes, namely, “ furthering” or repetition classes, for 
slow or backward pupils and “ auxiliary ” classes for fee- 
ble-minded children, the latter containing four grades. 
Maennel frankly concedes that pupils placed in the 
“ furthering ” classes in Mannheim “ would have been sent 
to auxiliary schools at once in other cities.!. It is rather 
paradoxical to find Maennel saying somewhat disapprov- 
ingly that the method in vogue in Mannheim changes “ en- 
tirely the previous method of admission to auxiliary-school 
classes,” in view of his admission that “possibly the 
schools at Mannheim are the first to admit to auxiliary 
classes only those pupils who belong there of right,” and 
that low-grade cases (idiots) are not admitted in Mann- 
heim, and in view of his recommendation that “ neglected 
children are not candidates for an auxiliary class.” ? 
“ Admission to auxiliary-school classes can scarcely re- 
ceive too much care.” . . . “ Just as we would avoid send- 
ing to auxiliary schools children who are imbeciles or idiots 
or the blind, deaf-mutes,® or the morally depraved — so, 
too, must we most carefully avoid admitting children who 
are backward by reason of illness, etc., and yet cannot be

backward, and not backward through merely purely adventitious 
factors, although not feeble-minded,

If we may judge by its “ model” school, the situation 
apparently is no better in Hungary. The institution at 
Budapest contains six graded classes, although the school 
was undoubtedly founded for the express purpose of train- 
ing feeble-minded children. 
Binet and Simon? state that the majority of the pupils 
admitted to the first schools for defectives in Belgium 
were backward, and that “these are the cases which give 
such grand results, and are sometimes exhibited as genuine 
defectives who have been improved by teaching.” The 
realization that backward children were being classified 
with the feeble-minded probably led Brussels to organize 
separate classes for children “ pedagogically retarded ” 
because of “bad environment, poor training, irregular 
school attendance, or sickness.” 
In Sweden it is frankly conceded that practically all 
kinds of physical and pedagogical misfits are relegated to 
the “help” classes; those suffering from physical and 
mental weakness, defective health, poor nutrition, poor 
sight, deafness, nose and throat disorders, rickets, epi- 
lepsy, and those showing merely a “ certain degree of men- 
tal backwardness.” 2 Moreover, no child can be com- 
mitted to one of these classes without the parents’ con- 
sent, and the parents frequently withhold their consent.®

by the following resolution which was passed at the fourth session of 
the German Auxiliary School Association in 1903: “ Compulsion 
should be used — but only when parents utterly refuse to have their 
children admitted to the auxiliary school, and are not able to prove 
that such children are already receiving satisfactory training and in- 
struction elsewhere.” 
The auxiliary-school law passed in France in 1909 leaves it optional

     “In France it has been agreed that the ignorant (or 
backward) are not to be admitted to the classes for de- 
with the different communes and departments to open auxiliary 
classes or auxiliary boarding schools, nor is there any indication in 
the law as reported by William H. Holmes, as above, Part II, p. 19, 
that pupils are compelled to attend the schools which have been 
opened. 
In New York the compulsory-attendance law does not apply to 
the feeble-minded, and a feeble-minded child cannot be compelled to 
attend the special classes. 
The situation is otherwise in England, where the Elementary Edu- 
cation (Defective and Epileptic Children) Act passed in October, 
1914, based on the Mental Deficiency Act of 1913, requires (instead 
of permits, as was the case before) all educational authorities to pro- 
vide education in special centers or in boarding schools for all the 
feeble-minded and physically defective children within their area. 
Schools organized under this act may receive a government grant on 
complying with certain conditions. 
The state school laws enacted in New Jersey in 1911 and 1912 now 
make it compulsory for every school board to ascertain the number 
of subnormal (“three years or more below normal”), blind, and deaf 
children in the schools and to establish special classes for the training 
of these types of children whenever ten children of each type are 
found in any school district, provided the blind or deaf are not or 
cannot be cared for in an institution. No class may contain more 
than fifteen pupils, and for each teacher employed in one of the spe- 
cial classes the state appropriates $500. We should insist, however, 
that many children retarded “three years” are not feeble-minded 
and should be assigned to backward classes rather than feeble-minded 
classes. 
The school laws enacted in 1915 in the state of Minnesota leave it 
optional with the local superintendent of schools to petition the state 
Superintendent of Education to establish special day classes in their 
respective schools. State aid will be apportioned for the mainte- 
nance of such classes not to exceed $100 for each child in attendance 
throughout the full school year. The superintendent of schools is 
charged with the supervision of special classes. The teachers must 
hold special certificates issued by the state superintendent. It is 
provided that no child may be committed who is “less than two years 
nor more than four years below the normal mental development for 
his age.” This provision is not entirely satisfactory, for reasons that 
‘cannot here be given. 
The Missouri State Social Service Conference passed the follow- 
ing resolutions in 1915: “ Resolved, That the Conference recommends 
ito the State Legislature the enactment of a law which will make it 
mandatory for every school district in the state to establish special 
classes for feeble-minded children when there are ten feeble-minded 
‘hildren in any given district.

fectives.”1 This rule is accepted by Binet and Simon: 
“Tt is unfair to a normal child to send him to a special 
school.”? “We demand . . . with all our power that he 
will be kept in the ordinary school.”* ‘None but de- 
fectives should be admitted to schools for defectives.” * 
The obvious intent of the French law enacted in 1909 is 
to restrict the special classes or special schools to feeble- 
minded children, and yet doubtful cases are, in practice, 
assigned to these classes or schools. Even in a residen- 
tial school like the Bicétre the work includes four classes 
in the “ big school” for the healthy, fit, and more intelli- 
gent defectives. But this may be due to the presence of 
“a great many abnormal children (perverse and ill- 
balanced) who are not wanting in intelligence” (p. 124). 
The English Elementary Education Act (Defectives and 
Epileptic Children), enacted in 1899, is perhaps more ex- 
plicit than any other enactment on the question of the 
types of pupils who should be considered eligible for spe- 
cial classes in England. The act limits the classes to 
“ children who, not being imbecile and not merely dull and 
backward, are by reason of mental and physical defect in- 
capable of receiving proper benefit from the instruction in 
the ordinary public elementary schools.” The English    
     
                                             
   
   “The Conference would also urge upon boards of education the| 
necessity of establishing separate ungraded classes for the proper 
training of backward children, many of whom can be restored to] 
normality by proper individual instruction and all of whom will be 
more benefited by instruction in such classes than in the regula 
grades. It is inadvisable to train feeble-minded and backward chil- 
dren in the same classes.”

page as practically to make a catch-all of the special class for al 
kinds of school misfits. All of the non-defectives which they men 
tion should, we believe, go into an ungraded class,
-P-A-G-E-73

law explicitly bars from these classes both the legally cer- 
tified cases of mental deficiency (which are the “ idiots ” 
and “ imbeciles ” in England) and the backward and dull 
| cases and admits only the “ feeble-minded ” (in the Eng- 
lish sense). The physically defective pupils, referring to 
the cripples and epileptics, are trained in different classes 
in England. And yet, with a law so carefully drawn, it is 
admitted that many children are assigned to these schools 
for the mentally defective who are merely backward or 
neglected rather than feeble-minded. Some of the reports 
from the English schools make special mention of the fact 
that backward pupils have been restored to the grades who 
have been erroneously committed as feeble-minded to the 
special schools. On this point the observations of Tred- 
gold are apropos: “In examining certified mental de- 
fectives in special schools, I discovered a portion of cases 
which I had no hesitation in saying were not aments at all, 
but merely suffering from backwardness, and this caused 
me to make some inquiries as to the number of such chil- 
dren who recovered. 
“ Now, the essence of mental defect is that it is incur- 
able... . and upon this fact all authorities are agreed. 
When, therefore, it is found that a proportion of the 
urban defectives attending special schools are returned as 
cured to the ordinary schools, it is clear that an error of 
diagnosis has been made, and that they were not defectives. 
. . - The following is the percentage (of the admissions) 
lof ‘ mentally defective’ children who have so far been re- 
urned cwred to ordinary schools in some towns in which 
made inquiries: Birkenhead, 6 per cent; Bradford, 15 
er cent; Bristol, 8 per cent; Derby, 5 per cent; Leeds, 2 
er cent; Leicester, 20 per cent; Liverpool, 4 per cent;

London, 10 per cent; Nottingham, 10 per cent ; Plymouth, 
8 per cent; Sheffield, 4 per cent. I think these figures 
show conclusively that a varying and in some cases con- 
siderable proportion of the town defectives are not aments 
at all. On this point I may quote the opinion of two phy- 
sicians who have had large experience of these children. 
Dr. Evan Powell, of Nottingham, writes: ‘I agree with 
you that a large number of so-called defectives are in real- 
ity not so, but are merely suffering from temporary ar- 
rest.’ And Dr. Ralph Crowley, of Bradford, writes: ‘I 
have no hesitation in saying that, where many go back, 
the reason is to be found in the fact that the children in 
the first place belonged to the merely dull, and backward.’ 
In the course of his evidence before the Royal Commission, 
it was stated by Dr. Eichholz, H. M. Inspector of Special 
Schools, under the Board of Education, that, according 
to his observations, from 40 to 50 per cent of the cases 
classed as ‘ feeble-minded ’ recovered under care and treat- 
ment!” We would also emphasize that the mere fact that 
a child has not been restored to grade does not prove that 
he is feeble-minded, for there are irremediable types of 
backwardness. Moreover, there are non-feeble-minded 
types of children, suffering from specific handicaps, who 
often simulate the feeble-minded, who might possibly be 
doomed to feeble-mindedness if they were placed in classes 
for the mentally defective and treated as though they were 
feeble-minded. It is not improbable that had Helen Keller 
been sent to the ordinary institution for the feeble-minded, 
instead of being privately given the differential treatment 
which her specific defects required, she would have spent 
the rest of her days in such an institution. The recogni- 
tion of this fact has led to an agitation in London for 
the establishment of “ intermediate schools ” (and possibly
-P-A-G-E-75
CHANGING ATTITUDES 59 
to the appointment of an examining psychologist), for 
the alleged 10 per cent of pedagogically retarded children 
who are backward because of aural defects, debilitated 
condition, repeated or prolonged absence, mental retarda- 
tion not amounting to feeble-mindedness, and specific de- 
ficiency in reading. The proposed limit for these schools 
in reading and writing is the “ fourth standard.” 
When we turn to the United States, we are confronted 
with a condition quite similar to that obtaining in Europe. 
Most, if not all, of the first special schools in America 
were undoubtedly organized for feeble-minded children, 
although the recommendations or reports made by the su- 
perintendents of schools at the time of the inauguration 
of the classes are sometimes quite vague. Sometimes the 
superintendents make no reference at all to the classes 
until several years later. 
From the 1899-1900 report of the superintendent of 
schools of Providence it appears that our first special 
class, established November 30, 1896, under the designa- 
tion “ school for backward children,” was the offshoot of 
la “school for special discipline and instruction,” which 
as established in the spring of 1894. This school was 
rimarily founded for troublesome pupils, but other types 
radually found their way into it: those deficient in Eng- 
ish, those too old for their grade, and the “ mentally de- 
cient.” “It was found that many children who had been 
alled troublesome and bad were really mentally deficient * 
     
    
     
         
   
        
    
    
     
    
   
   1A psychologist has been appointed in the London schools. Sin- 
larly the Elementary Education Act (Defectives and Epileptic 
hildren) enacted by England in 1914 fails to accord recognition in 
lhe diagnosis of feeble-mindedness and backwardness to the psy- 
ologist who is an expert on mental retardation, as does the recent 
linois law. 
2In the 1896 report the superintendent suggests that the public 
ichools should not treat the low-grade institutional class of cases, 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  60 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
and needed care and methods of teaching fitted to their 
cases.” A special class was accordingly instituted for 
these “ mentally deficient ” children. Providence has evi- 
dently adhered to this conception of the special class as 
designed for feeble-minded pupils, for we find in 1909 in 
an enrollment of 41 pupils, 27 were in the first grade, 6 
in the second, 6 in the third, and only 2 in the fourth. In 
a letter under date of October 9, 1914, Assistant Super- 
intendent Ella L. Sweeny of the Providence schools writes: 
“No child is admitted to these classes who is not recom- 
mended by the neurologist as feeble-minded, for we are at 
present placing our seriously backward children in our un- 
graded classes, of which we have thirty-five.” 
The superintendent’s reports are silent regarding the 
types of cases assigned to our second special class, started 
in Springfield, Massachusetts, in 1897. The superintend- 
ent in Chicago reported in 1897, the year before the spe- 
cial class is alleged to have been started in that city, as 
follows: “TI find that there are between five and six hun- 
dred children who are classed as feeble-minded that are 
not in any school nor are they receiving any training o 
instruction. .. . The children who are either deaf o: 
blind or feeble-minded, or are even uncontrollable unde 
our system of government in the schools, are entitled t 
the care and training which the state has assumed to giv 
them in separate schools adapted to their special needs.” 
I find no further reference, in the reports available, t 
these children until 1904, when the report refers to th 
authority to “open special rooms for the instruction o 
children who are so defective as to be unable to get alon, 
     
   
   
   
   
         
     
   
       
    
    “but there are a good many children not so defective mentally as th 
term ‘ feeble-mindedness’ usually indicates, but of such low powe; 
and aptitude that they gain very little from the ordinary school.”
-P-A-G-E-77
  CHANGING ATTITUDES 61 
with the ordinary school work.” ‘The public schools can 
. . » make self-supporting citizens of many of them. The 
public schools should undertake the instruction of those 
who are sufficiently intelligent to profit by the instruc- 
tion.” It is evident from the tenor of these statements 
that the special classes in Chicago, called “ subnormal 
classes,” were instituted for the training of grades of fee- 
ble-minded children some of whom, by implication, could 
mot be made “ self-supporting.” It is perfectly evident 
ito any one who understands feeble-mindedness that there 
lare feeble-minded children in the Chicago classes.* 
The report of the superintendent of the Boston public 
chools for 1900, under the caption “ Mentally Deficient 
hildren,” referring to the class started in 1899 (the 
stablishment of which was first agitated in November, 
898), is more explicit: ‘It is too much to expect the 
egular teacher of a class of fifty or more pupils to give 
special care and instruction to the one feeble-minded child 
ho happens to have been moved into her room. Such a 
hild should be placed in a special class.’ But... 
these special classes offer no outlet for the children ordi- 
arily called stupid, whom most teachers would gladly get 
lid of, but who doubtless do not carry the special marks 
at distinguish feeble-minded from normal children.” 
Mental defects amounting to feeble-mindedness in the 
ientific sense of the term are not always nor even usually 
e cause of apparent stupidity.” Boston is said to ex- 
lude moral and mental imbeciles, and backward children,    
     
          
    
        
   
       
    
      
   1It has been asserted that the Chicago classes contain practically 
ly backward children. Dr. Clara Schmitt, one of the psychological 
miners in the Chicago schools, writes me that the classes contain 
he mentally defective children of the high-grade type correspond- 
to the term ‘moron’ in general use. ... Children of the low 
ade imbecile type are not admitted. ... In general, curably back- 
rd children are not admitted.”
-P-A-G-E-78
62 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
limiting the classes to the higher grades of the feeble- 
minded. 
The report of the superintendent of schools in New 
York City for 1899 (the classes were established in 1900) 
is equally positive. After referring approvingly to the 
London scheme of segregating the “ physically and men- 
tally defective,” the report continues: ‘ As long as de- 
fective children are brought into the world, humanity de- 
mands . . . that such children should receive that train- 
ing which will, as far as possible, neutralize inherited evil 
tendencies.” “I would . . . recommend that ‘ centers’ 
for the training of defectives be established.” But the 
“purely imbecile . . . are beyond the reach of the public 
school.” The “ungraded classes” in New York have 
probably from the first been peopled primarily by feeble- 
minded children. 
All available Philadelphia reports at the time of the or. 
ganization of the special classes in that city are silent o 
the question of the specific types which should be assigne 
to those classes. But, as in Providence, the special classe 
gradually developed out of ungraded and disciplinar 
classes and the parental school, for the purpose of pro 
viding special education for the children who proved to b 
most deficient mentally. 
All Rochester reports are also silent until the 1908 
1909-1910 report, when the classes are referred to a 
“subnormal classes.” + It is evident from the warnin, 
which is voiced against misjudging children “ seemingl 
deficient but actually backward,” that the classes were i 
tended for the feeble-minded. 
The reports by the superintendent of schools of S 
Louis for 1905-1906 and 1906-1907 leave little doubt 
1 According to this report the first class began in 1905. 
            
     
         
   
   
  
-P-A-G-E-79
CHANGING ATTITUDES 63 
to the purpose of the special schools in that city: “The 
expression ‘defective children’ does not refer to dull, 
backward, or slow children who are otherwise normal.” 
“In some cases a child that is apparently mentally defec- 
tive is not really so, but suffers from physical ailments.” 
“'The term ‘defective’ applies to that child only who is 
neglected by nature and is constitutionally incapacitated 
for the ordinary studies. He may possibly advance a lit- 
tle in intellectual work, but there are narrow limits in the 
quantity and quality of the school work he is liable to do. 
He may make a little progress in some of the studies, and 
yet be incapable of grasping others. Very often the de- 
fective child can be taught the elements of reading, but it 
takes several years before he has mastered the few pages 
in the primer and even then his reading may be mechanical 
only, speaking the words without grasping their meaning.” 
* In not a few cases, special training in a small school, by 
la skilled teacher who has made such work a specialty, may 
dvance the defective child sufficiently to enable him, when 
e leaves school, to do some useful work in life and to fill 
ome humble economic position.’ “It is evident that ad- 
ission to the special schools must be very carefully scru- 
inized and controlled.” “The backward or slow child 
f otherwise normal faculties should not be taken away 
rom the regular school, . . . and care must be taken to 
imit admission to those children who are mentally de- 
ective and not merely slow.” ‘* No child who can in any 
ay profit sufficiently from instruction in the ordinary 
chools should be transferred to the special room.” On 
e other hand, “ the ‘ mentally unbalanced ’ or ‘ imbecile’ 
x demented children who cannot profit by school instruc- 
ion at all should not be admitted.”” They “ require the 
atchful nurture of an asylum.”

64 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
While it therefore seems clear that the special schools 
started in the United States were inaugurated specifically 
for the training of the feeble-minded, it is perfectly obvi- 
ous to any one who has carefully inspected the work in 
many cities that our practice has failed to square with our 
theory, and that there is considerable confusion in respect 
to the organization and management of special classes. 
In some cities the special classes are made the dumping 
ground for all kinds of pedagogical misfits and social 
ne’er-do-wells: mentally normal children who are peda- 
gogically retarded, mentally or pedagogically backward 
pupils, morons, imbeciles, high-grade idiots,! moral. imbe- 
ciles, truant or unruly children, children of good mental- 
ity, but suffering from sensory deprivation (semi-blind, 
semi-deaf and word blind), crippled or paralytic o 
speech-defective children who are not feeble-minded, for: 
eign children of good mentality whose defect is primaril. 
linguistic. There may be some excuse for throwing to 
gether in one class such a heterogeneous mass of childre 
as this in a small system, where only one class can be or. 
ganized, but there is no excuse for such a situation in 
large school system. 
Many of these classes are still organized as ungrade 
classes or restoration classes (the functions of which ar 
defined in Chapter III) rather than as special schools 
In many of them the aims are to restore the child to th 
regular grades as soon as possible, and to provide indi 
vidual coaching in the regular subjects of the elementar: 
grades. Curiously, the restoration aim is kept in vie 
even in cities where the classes were distinctly establish 
for feeble-minded (“mentally deficient”) children, 
1Such a pupil was examined by the writer in 1912. He had sp 
six years in a special school in a large city.

shown by the following quotations, the first from New 
York and the second from Rochester: 
“The classes are considered as special coaching classes, 
from which the child may be returned or promoted to the 
grades, if capable of being coached up to grade standards. 
This is necessary because there are so many grades of 
aments and some of the higher types are practically in- 
distinguishable from the worst cases of retardation due to 
neglect and malnutrition.” + 
“When a child is believed to be ready to return to the 
grade, a program of grade work is secured daily.”  Chil- 
dren placed in a special class . .. are always studied 
with a hope that they will be restored to full normality,” 
“ that the child is not forever dubbed a feeble-minded child 
because he is transferred to a special class.” “The child 
is not eternally condemned as a subnormal, defective, or 
feeble-minded child because of a temporary place in a 
class.”? But the very fact that a child has been re- 
stored to grade proves that he was not feeble-minded and 
that he should have been assigned in the first place to a 
lass for the backward instead of a class for the feeble- 
inded. 
We may emphasize the point which we are making by a 
tudy of the distribution of mental ages of pupils sent to 
pecial classes and by a study of the pedagogical status 
f pupils in such classes. In Detroit, among a total of 
eventy-five boys who had been on the registers of a spe- 
‘ial class for hand training, the distribution of B.-S. ages 
as as follows: age V, 1 case; VI, 5; VII, 13; VIII, 14; 
1 Quoted from William H. Holmes, as before, Part II, p. 29. It is 
etter to assign doubtful cases of this kind to classes for backward 
‘ildren than to classes for the feeble-minded.

lected with the Rochester Public Schools.

TX, 23; X, 11; XI, 5; XII, 3; and XV, 1. No matter 
how old some of these boys may have been, it is evident 
that a fourth of them need not have been feeble-minded 
judged by these B.-S. ages. Incidentally, how would it be 
possible to do effective school work with groups of “ de- 
fectives ” who differ by eight or ten B.-S. ages? Even 
when the age limits of the pupils in the special classes are 
fixed at B.-S V to IX, the children will be so heterogene- 
ous that it will be absolutely necessary to split them up 
into several groups in order to carry on the instruction 
economically. 
Of 210 special class pupils in Trenton, New Jersey, Mc- 
Callie? diagnosed only 52.7% as feeble-minded, while 
82.7% were diagnosed as borderline, 8.9% as backward, 
and 5.2% as “ potentially feeble-minded.” ?_ Forty-six or 
21.9% had an intelligence quotient (see Chapter IT) be- 
tween .70 and .74, 19 or 9% between .75 and .79, 10 or 
4.7% between .80 and .84, and two each or .9% between 
-85 and .89 and between .90 and .91. Thus '79 children, 
or 37.6% of the 210, had a quotient of from .70 to .91. 
It is evident that these children are not shown to be feeble- 
minded by the quotients. Twenty-seven had a mentality 
of X, four of XI, and one of XII, a total of 32 with a 
mentality of X or over, which is 15.2% of the enrollment. 
It is significant that, while only about half of the children 
who were in the classes were considered actually feeble- 
minded, only 40, or 33%, of 120 pupils recommended by

children three or more years below the normal, . . . shall establish 
special class or classes for their instruction.” These classes are des. 
ignated by the state commissioner of education as “Class C, Men. 
tally Subnormal.” It is evident that many children assigned to thes 
classes will not be feeble-minded.

the principals for special classes were placed in such 
classes, This corresponds almost exactly with the per- 
centage of our clinic cases in St. Louis who were assigned 
to special schools in 1914-1915 (33.9%)? and in 1915- 
1916 (38%). It should be explained that during the 
latter year we made a special effort to “round up” the 
feeble-minded children in the schools by examining some of 
the pupils who were most seriously pedagogically re- 
tarded. In order to secure lists of such pupils we con- 
ducted a census, through the aid of the principals, of all 
pupils (a) 9 years of age or less who were pedagogically 
retarded two years or more and (b) of all pupils over 9

years of age who were pedagogically retarded three years 
or more. For the purpose of this study, the teachers and 
principals were asked to rate the pupils according to “ the 
grade in which they did successful work ” and not accord- 
ing to the grade in which they happened to classify. 
Under these conditions 1861 pupils were reported,’ as 
shown in Table II. 
In other words, 2.5% of all the pupils enrolled in the 
elementary schools (72,851) were retarded two years or 
more. The corresponding per cent for the white children 
was 2.1 (1487 out of 67,546) and for the colored, 8 (424 
out of 5305). There are considerably more retarded pu- 
pils among the boys, whether colored or white, than 
there are among the girls. The number of children of 9 
or less retarded two or more years was quite negligi- 
ble, .2%. 
From these figures it would appear that the extent of 
pedagogical retardation in the St. Louis schools is not 
as serious as in some other cities. Thus, in a survey con- 
ducted in Pittsburgh in 1913, over 10% of all the ele- 
mentary pupils were retarded three years or more. It is 
possible that the quarterly system of promotions in vogue 
in the St. Louis schools may be partly responsible for the 
favorable conditions which apparently obtain in the latter 
schools with respect to the problem of retardation. 
In order to obtain an estimate of the number of the! 
worst pedagogical retardates who might be feeble-minded, 
the clinic booked for examination 156 of the 257 children! 
who appeared to be the. most seriously retarded in their 
school work according to the records submitted in th

1 Most of these children were recent immigrants, or had recently come either 
from the South or from the country and had been very little in school. 
The following facts indicate the status of these 67 cases: 
According to the pedagogical report made by the teach- 
ers and principals on our Form 18-A, which is regularly 
sent to the clinic for all children listed for examination, 
the average pedagogical retardation for the five children 
(2 boys and 8 girls) who were 9 years old or less was 2.1 
ears, and for the 62 (17 girls and 45 boys) who were 
ver 9 years old 3.3 years. According to the report made 
in the earlier census returns of pedagogical retardates 
he average amount of retardation for those 9 or less was 
.6 years (the data were reported for 3 pupils only), and 
or those over 9 (58 pupils reported) 3.6 years. Our
-P-A-G-E-86
70 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
pedagogical examination, however, showed that some of 
these pupils had been rated too low in the census report 
and that the later record was frequently more nearly cor- 
rect. Of the pupils nine years old or less, one was re- 
ported on Form 13-A as being pedagogically retarded 114 
years, three as being retarded 2 years, and only one as 
being retarded 3 years. Of the pupils over nine years 
of age, four were reported as pedagogically retarded only 
11% years, ten 2 years, three 21% years, nineteen 3 years, 
sixteen 4 years, one 414 years, six 5 years, and three 6 
years. In other words, 45 of the 67 pupils were reported 
as pedagogically retarded three or more years. The 
corresponding report made in the census returns was less 
favorable, no doubt owing to the fact that the teachers 
were asked to rate the pupils according to the grade in 
which they were able to do the work and not according to 
the grade in which they were classified. Of the pupils nine 
years old or less, two were reported retarded 2 years and 
one 4 years. Of the pupils over nine years, five were re- 
ported as retarded 2 years, one 214 years, twenty-three 3 
years, two 31% years, seventeen 4 years, one 414 years, 
five 6 years, and one 7 years. Fifty-three were reported 
as pedagogically retarded three years or more. 
When we turn to the results of the psychological exam- 
ination in the clinic, the average mental retardation was| 
found to be slightly less than the pedagogical retardation. 
According to the 1908 scale, the average amount of men- 
tal retardation for those 9 years or less was 1.55 years, 
and for those over 9 years 3.15 years (being 3.01 for th 
boys and 3.51 for the girls). The corresponding retar 
dation figures according to the 1911 scale were 2.14 year! 
and 3.44 years (being 3.28 for the boys and 3.88 for th 
girls).

  72 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
On the most rigid standards of mental deficiency which 
have been followed (over 2 years of retardation for the 
first group and over 3 years of retardation for the second 
group = feeble-mindedness) 36 of the pupils (23 boys and 
13 girls) would be feeble-minded by the 1908 scale and 
43 (29 boys and 14 girls) by the 1911 scale. The above 
figures include only one pupil (a girl) by the 1908 scale 
and three pupils (one boy and two girls) by the 1911 
scale 9 years or less in age. But according to the more 
recently proposed four-year standard of retardation, only 
nine of the pupils ( 6 boys and 8 girls) would be feeble- 
minded by the 1908 scale and 17 (11 boys and 6 girls), 
by the 1911 scale. The diagnosis actually made of the 
cases was as follows: retarded 1 (girl) ; backward 22 (19 
boys and 8 girls); borderline 17 (10 boys and 1 girls) ; 
deferred diagnosis 6 (5 boys and 1 girl) ; morons 20 (13 
boys and 7 girls); and imbecile 1 (girl). It will be seen 
that the percentage classified as feeble-minded among 
these seriously retarded pupils (31.6%) is approximately 
the same as the percentage of feeble-mindedness found in 
the entire group in 1914-1915 (29.5%) and in 1915— 
1916 (30.8%). ‘This indicates that the vast majority 
of the pupils reported in the retardation census belong 
in ungraded classes rather than in special classes. 
     
                                                  
    1Since the above was written we have made extraordinary efforts| 
to “rout out” all the feeble-minded children in the regular grades. 
In September, 1916, the principals of the elementary schools were| 
definitely and emphatically instructed by the superintendent to sub- 
mit for examination the names of all the pupils in their schools whom} 
they considered to be feeble-minded. Every school was obliged to} 
make a report. Under this strong-arm method of rounding up th 
feeble-minded we examined 383 cases, of which 26 were reéxamine' 
cases. The diagnosis made of the 357 new cases was as follows 
normal, 2.8% (10 cases); retarded, 3% (11 cases); backward, 33.8% 
(121 cases); borderline (including potentially feeble-minded), 54.6% 
(195 cases); deferred diagnosis, 5.6% (20 cases); and feeble-minded,
-P-A-G-E-89
CHANGING ATTITUDES 13 
Although we have assigned to special schools only 
35.8% of the pupils examined during 1914-1916, or 
39.3% if the pupils are included who were already in the 
special schools,’ a considerable number of those assigned 
could not be definitely certified as feeble-minded, as shown 
in Tables V and VI, by the distribution of the mental 
ages, the years of mental retardation, the intelligence 
quotients, and the diagnosis made of the cases assigned to 
the special schools. 
Turning to the admission for 1914-1915, it will be ob- 
served that while only 14% (22 cases) by the 1908 scale 
and 5% (8 cases) by the 1911 scale graded over IX- 
years mentally, 25.4% (40 cases) were retarded less 
than 2.1 years by the 1908 scale and 15.2% (24 cases) 
by the 1911 scale. By the 1908 scale 59.8% (94) and 
by the 1911 scale 43.9% (69) were retarded less than 3.1 
years. By the 1908 scale only 24.2% (88) and by the 
1911 scale only 33.7% (53) were retarded over four 
21% (75 cases). This gave us a lower percentage of feeble-minded 
cases than we have secured in any previous survey in the St. Louis 
schools. It is 8.5% and 9.8% lower, respectively, than the figures 
for 1914-1915 and 1915-1916, and 10.3% lower than the figures for 
the children selected from the pedagogical census. If we combine the 
'feeble-minded and the borderline, the figures are as follows:

ie 1916-1917 strong-arm census gave us 13.7% and 10.9% more

915 and 1915-1916, but 2.1% less than we found among the children 
xamined from the census of pedagogical retardates. 
1It should be emphasized that many of those diagnosed as feeble- 
inded could not be admitted because of too low mentality or be- 
ause they had been committed to a residential institution. Thus 
mly 159 of the 261 diagnosed as feeble-minded were assigned to 
special schools.

Among the 1915-1916 assignments only 2.9% (5 
cases) by the 1908 scale and 1.1% (2 cases) by the 
1911 scale graded over IX-years mentally, while 17.6% 
(30 cases) were retarded less than 2.1 years by the 1908 
scale and 11.7% (20 cases) by the 1911 scale. By the 
1908 scale 32.9% (56 cases) and by the 1911 scale 
81.1% (53 cases) were retarded less than 3.1 years. By 
the 1908 scale only 34.7% (59 cases) and by the 1911 
scale only 46.4% (‘79 cases) were retarded over 4 years. 
According to the 1908 scale, 36 or 21.1% had an intelli- 
gence quotient between .'70 and .74, 23 or 13.5% between 
-75 and .79, 14 or 8.2% between .80 and .84, 7 or 4.1% 
between .85 and .89, 3 or 1.7% between .90 and .94, 3 
or 1.7% between 1.00 and 1.09, and 86 or 50.5% be- 
tween .70 and 1.09. By the 1911 scale, 33 or 19.4% 
had a quotient between .70 and .74, 17 or 10% between 
-75 and .79, '7 or 4.1% between .80 and .84, 3 or 1.7% 
between .95 and .99, and 63 or 37% between .70 and .99. 
It is evident that we have assigned far more children to 
the special schools (although only about one third of all 
those examined) than we should have been justified in 
doing had we merely adhered to the standards which have 
been followed in connection with the Binet scale (see, 
Chapter II). Binet and Simon concluded, it will be re- 
called, that no child should be “ considered defective in 
intelligence no matter how little he knows unless his re- 
tardation of intelligence amounts to more than two years.” 
The reason we have assigned so many children retarde 
Jess than 2.1 years is partly due to the fact that th 
tests in the lower ages are too easy, so that many o 
these children were really retarded more than the Bine 
rating indicates. Moreover, many who were not retard 
two years were undoubtedly feeble-minded. Neverth

less, only 41.4% (65 cases) of those assigned in 1914— 
1915 were diagnosed as definitely feeble-minded, and 
68.1% (107 cases) as feeble-minded and borderline, while 
58.6% (92 cases) were diagnosed as borderline, back- 
ward, retarded, and reserved, and 31.8% (50 cases) as 
backward, retarded, and reserved. Of those assigned in 
1915-1916, 55.2% (94 cases) were diagnosed as definitely 
feeble-minded, and 77.0% (181 cases) as feeble-minded 
land borderline, while 44.7% (‘16 cases) were diagnosed 
s borderline, backward, reserved, and normal, and 22.9% 
(39 cases) were diagnosed as backward, reserved, and 
ormal. Since we have attempted to be cautious in our 
iagnosis, it is probable that some who were diagnosed 
s borderline and reserved, and possibly a few diagnosed 
s backward, will eventually prove to be feeble-minded.* 
n fact, some of them were assigned to special schools on 
he supposition that they would make such slow progress 
hat they would prove to be feeble-minded as they grew 
Ider. At the same time, a few of those diagnosed as 
orons may eventually reach the borderline or seriously 
ackward status. But although we have assigned pupils 
lo the special classes who could not be definitely diagnosed 
s feeble-minded and who should have been assigned to 
graded classes, classes for the semi-deaf, semi-blind, 
ir other types of special classes, had they been available, 
has been impossible to keep the attendance in these 
lasses up to the highest point reached before the clinic 
s established, namely 419 (average school membership) 
1913-1914. In 1914-1915 the average school mem- 
rship was 354 and in 1915-1916, 355.

who had been assigned to the special classes before the 
clinic was organized, were actually feeble-minded, or, to 
use Soldan’s words, “ mentally defective ” and not merely 
“dull, backward, or slow.” Our time has been pre- 
occupied with the examination of new candidates, hence it 
has been possible to examine only a few of the old en- 
trants. But it is quite apparent from other consider- 
ations that the percentage of not-feeble-minded children| 
was very much higher among the old admissions than 
among the clinic admissions. Among the old admissions| 
which we have removed as improper subjects for a specia 
school have been children who have been semi-deaf, semi. 
blind, word-blind, speech defective, paralytic, or crippled, 
although in no sense feeble-minded. Some of these chil 
dren were absolutely normal intellectually. The follow: 
ing are a few illustrative cases: 
M. had been assigned to a special school somewhat ove 
two years before the examination; attended one special 
for a couple of weeks, then refused to go to school wit 
“ crazy ” children, as he expressed himself. Was induce 
to try another special school, but rebelled after a fe 
days’ attendance, because this school was “ crazier ” tha: 
the other. Stayed out of school for two years, becaus 
he would not attend special school. Examined at t 
clinic at the age of 10.8, he graded 11.4 years mentally, o| 
-6 advanced by the B.-S., and 11 years in psycho-mot 
development (Seguin). He was likewise distinctly ahea 
in his physical development in all respects (i.e., in sittin 
and standing height, manuometry, and spirometry). 
was diagnosed as normal and assigned to an ungrad 
class because of his pedagogical backwardness. He w: 
never a proper candidate for a special school.

attended only 29 days, doing work successfully in the 
second quarter of the third grade; the following fall was 
placed in a parochial school because he refused to attend 
the special school any longer; out of school a great deal 
because of illness. Examination at the age of 12.2 showed 
that he was retarded 3 years by the B.-S. and a little 
over two years by the Seguin. Diagnosed as seriously 
backward, and assigned to an ungraded class where he 
was first refused admission because the principal said that 
his school was not a “dumping ground” for defective 
children. At the end of two quarters the teacher re- 
ported that he was doing fourth and fifth grade work, 
nd that he was the ablest pupil in the class. 
M., examined a year before the opening of the clinic — 
examination consisted of a conversation. and a few 
rithmetical problems and lasted a few minutes —declared 
“mental defective” and assigned to a special school. 
he parents, however, refused to send him. Examination 
t the age of 11.7 showed that he was very near-sighted, 
hat he had adenoids, that he was nervously unstable, that 
e was ahead in physical development in all respects, and 
hat he was retarded on the mental (B.-S.) and psycho- 
otor (Seguin) sides only about three fourths of a year. 
e was diagnosed as slightly backward and assigned to an 
ngraded class. On April 14, 1916, the principal re- 
orted that he was in an ungraded class last year, but 
ad been restored to grade, and was now doing work in 
e first quarter of the fifth grade. He is accelerated 
reading, but retarded in arithmetic. However, with 
tra instruction in arithmetic he did two quarters of 
ork in one quarter.

ained over three years. Examination at the age of 11

showed that her thyroid was somewhat enlarged and that 
she was merely backward in intelligence (1.1 year by the 
B.-S. and 2.5 by the Seguin). Her fundamental handi- 
cap was not mental deficiency but speech defectiveness —| 
her articulation was and always has been extremely im- 
perfect. She was transferred to a school where she coul 
be given appropriate speech-corrective work. 
M., assigned to a special school in 1911, where he re: 
mained for five years. On arrival at school could no 
understand what was said to him and could speak only 
few words. Examination at the age of 11 showed tha 
while he was retarded mentally almost three years, hi 
hearing was so seriously impaired that he was not able t 
hear a loud whisper at a distance of eighteen inches 
The history showed that he had been semi-deaf since in 
fancy, but his hearing had improved. He was trans 
ferred to another school for speech-corrective work. Th 
teacher’s report after a month and a half indicates tha 
he “has shown improvement in his sentence work and ii 
his speech.” 
The following are typical of children assigned to th 
special schools who have shown by their after-careers tha 
they were not mentally defective: 
M., assigned to a special school in 1908 at 13, wher 
he remained until he could secure his working papers a| 
14; very poor in spelling and reading; reached thir 
grade; now married at the age of 24, night foreman in 
rolling mill, earning $28.50 a week. 
M., who suffered from very poor vision, was assigne 
at about the age of 10 to a special school in 1908, whe 
he remained for two years and two months; returned 
the grade school, where he graduated in 1915; now, Jun 
1916, at the age of 16, doing “ medium ” work in the se 
ond half of the first year in the high school.

   F., who suffered from poor hearing and speech defect, 
assigned to a special school in October, 1908, where she 
was retained until June, 1911; graduated from an ele- 
mentary school in June, 1915, winning a scholarship for 
lan art school; now in high school, where she is reported 
to be doing “ excellent work.” 
Two boys, assigned to a special school about eight 
ears ago; effort thrice made to have them enter was 
rustrated by the principal, who did not regard them as 
lefectives; both subsequently finished the grade school 
atisfactorily and entered the high school. 
M., assigned to a special school in October, 1913, where 
e remained until June, 1916, when he was examined in 
he clinic at the age of 10.7 and found to grade 10.6 by 
he B.-S. and 9.2 by the Seguin; the personal history 
howed that his development had been precocious in most 
espects, while the family history was negative except that 
he mother was reported to be nervous, a cousin was 
luffering from tuberculosis, while one brother was para- 
tic. Curiously he was reported as doing work only in 
ie second grade, third quarter, although the teacher 
id that he “ could if he would.” He was diagnosed as 
lormal and recommended for an ungraded class. 
M., assigned to a special school in February, 1914, 
tering second grade; returned in September, 1914, to 
ade school; now, June, 1916, at age of 11, after un- 
aded instruction, has reached fifth grade, second 
arter. Has qualified for advanced work for special 
omotion in the summer school this year. 
Numerous similar types have been sent to the clinic 
candidates for the special schools for “ the mentally 
fective and not merely slow.” For example:

special school and found to be retarded intellectually 
about a year and a half, but ahead in psycho-motor de- 
velopment about a half year. Diagnosis: backward and 
word-blind. Recommended for an ungraded class, 
M., examined at the age of 13 as a candidate for a 
special school, and found to be retarded intellectually 3.2 
years and two years in psycho-motor development. Diag- 
nosis: backwardness, complicated by semi-deafness. Rec- 
ommendations: (1) ear treatment; and (2) assignment 
to a hard-of-hearing class. In the absence of such a 
class he had to be assigned to an ungraded class, wit 
instructions as to the special care needed. 
M., examined at the clinic at the age of 8.9 and foun 
to be retarded 1.1 years by the B.-S. and almost 2 year 
by the Seguin, and to suffer from trachoma and a ver 
severe lisp, which the family doctor had said he would out: 
grow. Diagnosis: backwardness, complicated with a se 
vere speech defect. Assigned to a class for speech-correc 
tive work, with the recommendation that he be later trans: 
ferred to an ungraded class for temporary coaching 
After seven months of speech-corrective work, the teache: 
reports: ‘ M.’s articulation at the time of entrance wa: 
so faulty that none of the teachers could understand hi 
Three months later his mother said: ‘It is wonderf 
what you have done for M.’. . . The habit of jerking hi 
head and arms during speech has also been eliminated a 
most entirely.” 
F., examined as an urgent candidate for a special scho 
at the age of 12.6, and found to be retarded 6.2 year 
by the B.-S. and 3.5 by the Seguin, to be unable to hea| 
a whisper at a foot’s distance, the hearing being partic 
larly poor in the right ear. Diagnosis: partial deafnes'

due to the deafness or to early educational neglect ; diag- 
nosis of feeble-mindedness reserved. Assigned to a school 
for speech-corrective work. After several months of 
training the teacher reported: “There has been a very 
noticeable improvement in F. When she entered she 
talked nothing but ‘baby talk’ and could not answer 
questions. She spoke in broken sentences, answering only 
in a word or two, as she was not able to associate ideas 
with words. She now reads well, is a good speller, and 
writes better.” 
M., examined at the age of 10.3 as a candidate for a 
special school; retarded about a year and a half by the 
Binet and about three years by the Seguin; articulation 
lefects and suspected visual aphasia. Assigned to an 
mgraded class. Although reported by the principal to 
e the most backward of the “backward” children as- 
igned to the class, after seven months of work he had 
dvanced from second grade in arithmetic to the third 
uarter of the fourth grade, while in reading he had ad- 
anced from a condition of almost complete incapacity 
o the fourth quarter of the first grade. 
It is indisputable that many of the above types of 
chool misfits are being assigned throughout the country 
0 special schools as “ mental defectives,” although they 
re in no sense feeble-minded and ought to be assigned to 
ther types of classes. It is very difficult in some cities 
lo cut down the attendance in these classes as it ought to 
cut down, owing to the wide publicity which has been 
iven to the claim that at least 2% of the elementary 
ildren are feeble-minded. The data from Trenton and 
‘om St. Louis lead us to believe that the older or more 
mservative estimates of the percentage of feeble-minded 
ildren in the public schools are more accurate than the

The average of the above per cents for both the European ani

When we turn to the grade distribution of pupils i 
special classes — although satisfactory and complete dat 
are not at hand—we again find evidences that pupil 
who are not feeble-minded are assigned to these classe 
In some cities in this country the pupils in the speci 
classes are doing work in the upper intermediate and jj 
the grammar grades. A recent visitor from an Easte:

city of 75,000 reported that the course in their special 
classes covers six and sometimes seven of the elementary 
grades. How many special classes throughout the coun- 
try are attempting sixth and seventh grade work it is im- 
possible to say. 
Programs sent me in 1914 from special schools 
showed that the number of divisions, classes, or groups 
was as follows: Spokane, three divisions; Los Angeles, 
three groups; Philadelphia (Wood School), three classes, 
with a “fourth year,” Class III, containing “backward 
and feeble-minded children, ages 10 to 16”; Detroit (Sill 
School), five classes (B first, A first,,B second, A second, 
and B third); and Cleveland, five groups, 1 to 5. It is, 
of course, inadmissible to conclude offhand that these 
groups or classes parallel the elementary grades. 
In the annual case reports in June, 1915, the teachers 
in the special schools in St. Louis classified the pupils ac- 
cording to the grade which they had reached in the vari- 
ous branches pursued. The number of pupils covered 
in the reports was 374. Some teachers, however, failed 
to supply the data for some of the pupils in some or all of 
the branches. Thus the total number of pupils reported 
on in reading was 289; in language 138; in spelling 172; 
in arithmetic 259; in writing 187; in drawing 119; in 
geography 31; in industrial work 74; in physical games 
187; in mental games 73; and in calisthenics 193. The 
per cents in Table VII are based only on the number of 
pupils whose grade was actually reported on in the studies 
concerned. The analysis is confined to the data on the 
children who were doing work above the third grade, al- 
though data are available for each grade below the third. 
The children are arranged into two groups; namely, non- 
clinic cases and clinic cases. The first group includes

    260 children who were already in the special schools when 
the psycho-educational clinic was established, while the 
second group includes 114 pupils who were assigned to 
the special schools as a result of an examination in the 
clinic. 
It will be seen from Table VII that the highest per- 
centage of pupils doing fourth-grade work in any one 
literary subject amounts to only 7.6% (in geography). 
The corresponding per cent in reading is only 6.7 and in 
arithmetic 3.9. The per cent of pupils doing fourth, 
fifth, and sixth grade work amounts to 7.6% in reading 
and 5.0% in arithmetic. Curiously, less than seven per 
cent are reported as reaching the fourth-grade standard 
in industrial work. This is probably explained by the 
fact that the teachers were unable accurately to classify 
the pupils by grades in the industrial work. In the liter- 
ary branches the classification could be guided by the ele- 
mentary curriculum. The general belief is that feeble- 
minded pupils do much better in the manual than in the 
literary work. On the other hand, in physical games 
18.2% and in calisthenics 32.7% were reported as doing 
fourth-grade work. 
Basing the per cents upon the entire number of pupils 
(374), 22.7% (85 different pupils) did work in the fourth 
rade or above, in one or more of the academic or manual 
ranches or in physical training; 16% did work in the 
ourth grade or above in one of the physical or manual 
ranches; but only 8.0% (30 pupils) did work in the 
ourth grade or above in one or more of the following 
cademic branches: reading, or language, or spelling, or 
rithmetic. Only .8% (8 pupils) did fourth-grade work 
hroughout ; .8% did fourth-grade work in two academic 
ubjects (reading and spelling, reading and arithmetic),
-P-A-G-E-106
  90 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
and .5% (2 pupils) in three academic subjects; 1.0% 
(4 pupils) did fifth-grade work in one academic subject 
(reading or arithmetic); and .8% (8 pupils) did sixth- 
grade work in one academic subject (two in arithmetic 
and one in reading). 
The number of pupils in the special classes at present 
in St. Louis who do work beyond the third grade in the 
literary branches is, therefore, not very large. But this 
does not conclusively demonstrate that the number who 
have the capacity to do work beyond the third grade is 
equally small, for two reasons. First, the vast majority 
of the special-class pupils drop out of school in St. Louis 
at the age of fourteen, while they are retained until 16 
in some other schools. These two additional years would 
doubtlessly afford the opportunity for some pupils to 
advance another year. Second, backward pupils who can- 
not be carried beyond the third grade when placed with 
feeble-minded children could be brought to the fourth 
grade or higher when placed with backward children who 
can make more rapid progress in academic work. As 
long as children must be taught in groups in the special 
schools, the progress of the backward children is neces- 
sarily retarded by the slow pace of the feeble-minded. 
The records of the following two boys whom we trans- 
ferred from a special school are suggestive: “A” had 
been in a special school five years but had not gotten be- 
yond the third grade. In the ungraded class where he’ 
could be given intensive academic work he had advanced| 
almost through the fifth grade in less than one year, 
“B” had been in the special school four years and ha 
advanced to the fourth grade in reading and the thir 
grade in the other branches. After a year in an un 
graded class he was working in the sixth grade. T

show that it is pedagogically inadvisable to assign back- 
ward children to feeble-minded classes we give the data 
in Table VIIa, gathered from one of our ungraded classes 
(at the present time we have data differently compiled 
from four other classes). At the end of the school year 
we requested, without prior warning, the principal of one 
of the elementary schools in which an ungraded class had 
been established at the beginning of the second quarter 
of the year, to average from the school record the grades 
made in all the branches by the pupils of the class during 
the last quarter in which they were in the regular grades 
and during the last ten weeks of work in the ungraded 
class. This class was organized largely because of the 
fact that many of the children sent to the clinic had been 
returned to the school for ungraded instruction. This 
grade of pupils had formerly been transferred from the 
school to a special school for mental defectives. The 
class also contained many backward pupils, some un- 
doubtedly of good intelligence, who had not been examined 
in the clinic. Although it is recognized that teachers’ 
grades possess only a fair degree of reliability, we believe 
that the results in this class are highly suggestive. The 
progress made by some of these pupils under the advan- 
tages of individual instruction in an ungraded class with 
lan average enrollment of about 20 (many were restored to 
rade) is very striking. The ungraded class has saved 
ome of these pupils from the special school. 
The tendency of the psycho-clinical examination has 
een to reduce the number of pupils doing work beyond 
he third grade in the special schools, although this does 
ot appear clearly from Table VII. It is significant, 
owever, that only one of the clinic cases does work in 
he fifth or sixth grades (an epileptic who does sixth-

  According to the data supplied in the report of th 
United States Commissioner of Education for 1914 
17.6% of the pupils in the special schools reported wer 
doing work above the fourth grade, 25.3% were enrolle 
in the third and fourth grades, 48.6% in the first an 
second grades, and 8.1% in the Kindergarten. It is prob 
able that 25% of the pupils included in this tabulate 
were not feeble-minded at all. 
Sometimes the special classes are left Peary: wit

out educational supervision, or are provided with amateur- 
ish or inefficient supervision, and sometimes the adminis- 
trative control is placed in some division other than the 
department of instruction. 
Thus a visiting teacher from a special school established 
in a city of 250,000 in the fall of 1914 told the writer that 
er school was wholly without any sort of pedagogical 
upervision. The school had never been visited by the 
uperintendent of schools, or by a deputy from his office, 
cause it was placed under the jurisdiction of the depart- 
ent of school hygiene. The school had been visited by 
he head of the latter department, but he had never offered 
single suggestion as to the pedagogical training of the 
hildren. In fact, he was far less competent, according to 
he teacher, to determine what children should be assigned 
0 the school than one of the teachers who had three years 
f institutional experience. Several large American cities 
ave organized the special classes in the department of 
edical inspection, or under the immediate supervision of 
at department or of the board of health, on the suppo- 
ition that feeble-minded pupils are sick children, whence 
e treatment and training must be fundamentally med- 
al, or on the supposition that the means of differential 
iagnosis between feeble-minded, mentally backward, or 
entally normal children is fundamentally medical, both 
which suppositions, as will be emphasized later, are 
mdamentally erroneous. The physician has an impor- 
nt function to perform with respect to all types of 
lagogically retarded school children, but his function 
other than educational and psychological diagnosis and 
dagogical supervision, unless indeed he possesses the 
hnical training of an educational, clinical, and genetic 
ychologist. It would be just as reasonable to place 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
    96 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
the medical supervision of a nose and throat clinic in 
the hands of an educator, as to place the educational 
supervision of the classes for feeble-minded or backward 
children in the hands of a physician. 
The fundamental weakness, then, in the organization of 
special classes in the public schools has been the lack of 
definiteness in the selection of the candidates for these 
classes, with the resultant confusion of aims and the fail- 
ure to develop different types of special classes for sub- 
normal children of different types. 
What is the cause of this situation? It is probably not 
primarily the failure to appreciate that the special schools 
were instituted for the differential training of feeble- 
minded children (although that is one explanation), but 
the employment of antiquated and inefficient methods of 
selecting the cases. In other words, the fundamental de-| 
fect has been, and largely continues to be, the inadequate} 
provisions afforded by the schools for the accurate psycho: 
logical diagnosis of varying degrees and types of mental 
deficiency or retardation. In the vast majority of schoo 
systems the special-class pupils have from the first bee 
selected, and largely still are selected, either by the teach 
ing staff alone (the superintendents, principals, super: 
visors, and teachers) or by the school medical inspecto 
alone, or by the joint action of teachers and medical in 
spectors. Sometimes a neurologist or psychiatrist ha: 
been employed to pass on the candidates. Usually th 
initial selection has been made by the instruction depart 
ment on the basis of the candidate’s pedagogical recor 
and the physician has based his judgment of the child’ 
mentality largely on the school data. Little, if any, at}

ber of cities for the retarded pupils.

    tempt was made scientifically to measure the child’s inher- 
ent mental capacity: that was inferred either from his 
school record or from the results of the physical examina- 
tion. Lately, to be sure, the Binet-Simon scale has come 
into very wide use, as an easily manipulated instrument 
by means of which teachers and physicians who are not 
trained as examining psychologists would be able to de- 
termine who should be classified as feeble-minded and who 
should be assigned to a special school. But we have the 
impression that the Binet scale has thrown more children 
into the special schools than the older methods did. This 
is due less to any imperfections in the scale itself than to 
the loose and arbitrary standards of feeble-mindedness 
which have been laid down as theorems but acted upon as 
demonstrated facts. The XII-year? standard of feeble- 
mindedness undoubtedly has thrown thousands of back- 
‘ward children into the “ moron ” class and relegated them 
to special schools instead of ungraded classes. 
In Germany the candidates selected by the teaching 
staff are examined by the school physician, but apparently 
the final decision usually rests with the teaching staff and 
ot with the physician. In Berlin the examinations are 
ade by the teacher, principal, school inspector, director 
f the auxiliary classes, and the school doctor. 
In Sweden a medical examination precedes and deter- 
ines the admission to the “help ” classes of pupils who 
ave spent from two to six terms in the regular grades 
ithout making progress. In London the teachers re- 
ort children who are not fit for promotion after spending 
wo years in the grade to the medical officers, who certify 
hem as mentally defective. Parents may demand a re- 
xamination at the end of six months to determine whether 
1 Ages given in Roman notation refer to Binet-Simon ages.
-P-A-G-E-114
98 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
the child is fit for transfer to the regular grades, but this 
examination is also made by the medical officer. The 
1914 Elementary Education Act (Defectives and Epi- 
leptic Children) practically reénacts the earlier regula- 
tions: the medical officer is one of the local educational 
authorities who is authorized to give a certificate as to 
a child’s mental condition. Later examinations are also 
made by the medical officer or under his immediate super- 
vision. 
Curiously the French law, enacted in the land of Binet 
as late as 1909, shows no indication of a fuller grasp of 
the problem of psychological diagnosis. The examina-| 
tions in France are made by the elementary-school in- 
spector, the director of the special school, and the medical] 
doctor. <A medical examination is required at least onc 
each half year. 
In New York City the suspected cases reported by th 
principals are given a physical examination by a physi 
cian assigned to the ungraded classes and a pedagogica' 
examination by the inspector of ungraded classes, and ar 
then assigned to the ungraded classes if thought to 
mentally deficient.t 
In Boston the final decision as to whether a child is t 
be retained in a special school, or returned to a regula 
grade, or be sent to an institution is left in the hands o 
the physician connected with the special classes. Pupil 
reported for these classes are admitted for a probationar 
period of a few weeks, after which the special class teache 
reports to the physician whether she thinks the chil

ance is now also secured from the educational clinic of the Cit 
College.

should remain in the classes or be returned to the 
grades. 
In Providence the cases are reported by the medical 
inspector for examination by a neurologist in the board 
of health. Here apparently a medical examiner has both 
the initial and the final say. 
In Chicago the pupils are assigned to the subnormal 
classes by a staff of three psychologists connected with 
the department of child study. 
The plan of procedure formerly in vogue in St. Louis 
is indicated by the following quotation from the report of 
the superintendent for 1906-1907: “The admission of 
children to the special schools should be in the hands of 
the principal and the teacher who makes the recommenda- 
tion, and the supervisor of defective schools, whose in- 
dorsement should be subject to the approval of the Super- 
intendent of Instruction. In addition to this an expert 
hysician should examine each case.” 'The psycho- 
ducational clinic, established in September, 1914, now 
letermines the admission of pupils to the special schools 
St. Louis. 
In a large number of American cities the candidates 
ave been selected during the last five years by the Binet- 
imon scale, usually administered by a grade or special- 
lass teacher (see p. 106). 
While the methods differ somewhat in different places, 
it is perfectly evident from the general practice that 
eeble-mindedness has been regarded as a disease, that 
‘eeble-minded children have been looked upon as invalids, 
nd that the way to determine whether or not a child is 
fit candidate for a feeble-minded class is to examine 
im pedagogically and physically. In other words, the 
uthorities on mental deficiency are the teacher and the

       physician. This position is, I believe, fundamentally 
wrong. Feeble-mindedness is a mental defect which can 
be determined only by psychological criteria. We can- 
not conclude from a child’s pedagogical or social ineffi- 
ciency that he is feeble-minded until we have first shown 
that his pedagogical and social incompetency is due to 
mental deficiency. We cannot conclude from a discovery 
of physical defects, diseases, or illness that a child is 
feeble-minded. There are no diseases or physical defects 
which are pathognomonic of feeble-mindedness: feeble- 
minded children have exactly the same diseases and physi- 
cal defects as normal or backward children. The fact 
that a backward child is physically defective does not 
prove that the physical defects are the cause of backward- 
ness. We cannot even infer feeble-mindedness from the 
inspection of the signs of nerve lesions: gross nerve lesions 
sometimes produce little mental impairment. Nor is it 
possible by a physical reéxamination at the end of six 
months? to determine whether a child should be retained 
in a special class or restored to grade. As a matter of 
fact, the reports from London, where this system has been 
longest in use, show that the medical examination is of no 
value for this purpose. Shuttleworth and Potts report 
that the judgments of the medical officers are largely! 
based on the progress reported by the special teachers 
and not on the medical examination. There can be littl 
hope for a correct differentiation of backward and feeble 
minded children until the réle of the doctor and that of th 
examining psychologist (or psycho-educational examiner. 
1It ought to be obvious that if a child is to be reéxamined t

ination must be a psychological one. As a matter of fact, the diag;

as we prefer to call him) are clearly understood. Our 
own views are largely expressed in the following excerpts 
from Binet and Simon: ? 
      
   
                                 
      
      
    “The Doctor not to Pick out the Defectives from amongst 
the Children in School 
“There is a general misunderstanding with regard to the 
special knowledge and aptitude of the doctor. One tends to 
credit him with a kind of omnipotence and infallibility against 
which he protests in vain. He is made to judge questions 
which do not belong to his special province — namely, the 
medical, and upon which he expresses opinions which are 
neither more nor less valuable than those of any other intelli- 
gent person. Recently, at various congresses, we have seen 
doctors with the best intentions laying down educational pro- 
grams, comparing the educative value of science with that of 
letters, and expressing a variety of opinions, no doubt very 
sensible, but with which the medical art had nothing whatever 
todo. As regards the selection of defectives, one is influenced 
by the same prejudice. We have discussed this with many 
people, and especially with educationists, and when we have 
insisted on the difficulties of examination, they usually reply, 
‘That is the doctor’s business.’ The prejudice we have noted 
is very tenacious, and will doubtless be difficult to overcome, 
for there are many people who have interests to maintain of 
a pecuniary nature. ... Just imagine a doctor introduced 
into a school of 300 children in order to pick out the defectives 
by strictly medical methods. No doubt every doctor, espe- 
cially if he is an alienist, is called upon to estimate the intel- 
ectual level of children, and to sign certificates of idiocy, 
imbecility, and feeble-mindedness. But just consider how 
hings are managed at the consultation. The parents bring 
he child. They know very well that he is ‘not like others.’ 
hey bring him for that very reason, and consequently the 
1 As before, p. 87f.  
-P-A-G-E-118
  102 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
doctor does not require to distinguish the child from a normal 
one. He only requires to sit and listen to the parents, who 
give him a crowd of particulars. When he questions and 
examines the child, it is only to verify what he has learned, 
and to add his own personal impression. As a general rule 
the case is a severe one; the deficiency is so evident that any 
sensible person would notice it. The task of the doctor is 
therefore narrowed. He has only to certify the mental defi- 
ciency of the patient, stating in technical terms the diagnosis 
which the parents have brought to him ready made. Even his 
estimation of the gravity of the case, apart from special in- 
vestigations on his part, is not very different from that of 
ordinary people who readily distinguish between the idiot who 
cannot speak; the imbecile, who can make himself understood, 
though he cannot be educated; and the feeble-minded, who can 
do some work, but is not able to provide for his wants or to 
behave himself sensibly. 
“When the doctor thus certifies the intellectual level of the 
patient, does he try to do so with precision? By no means, 
for it is not expected of him. The parents do not come t 
him in order to ask him, ‘Is my child backward in his menta 
development?’ Alas! they see it only too well, and little i 
matters to them whether his backwardness amounts to si 
months or a year. But they do come to ask, ‘ Why does thi 
child not make the usual progress? Is there not some medi: 
cine, doctor, which can help his development?’ When the: 
come to the doctor, it is not even with the hope that som 
medico-pedagogical treatment will cure their child. The: 
know very well that the devoted care which they have alway: 
bestowed upon him from his infancy is superior to anythin, 
which can be given to him at a dispensary for children; bu 
their indomitable hope leads them to seek chimerical meas 
ures. In all this, let us repeat, the doctor does not requir 
to estimate the degree of mental deficiency with any delicac 
But if he should try to do so, what methods would he use?

for a class for defectives because he cannot follow the usual 
lessons in the elementary school. You, however, doctor, put 
to him some of your usual questions. You ask the child his 
name, his age, the occupation and address of his parents; the 
date, day, month, year; some details about his life; you even 
ask him to read or count. The replies are given to you quietly 
and correctly. Are you going to refuse to admit him to the 
special school, and by what right? You have the notes of 
one, of two, or of three teachers. He cannot follow; he is 
still with children of seven years of age, in spite of having 
been at school for three years. It is evident that he is not 
an idiot, nor an imbecile, nor even feeble-minded to any great 
extent. But you have been notified that he is behind other 
children of his age. There is therefore something peculiar 
about him. It is not a medical question whether he ought to 
remain in the ordinary school. The doctor cannot go against 
the opinions which have been given to him, in order to verify 
whether the retardation is genuine. To do so, it would be 
necessary for him to make a comparison with the normal con- 
dition. Now this varies according to age. The doctor does 
not know exactly, to two or three years, the normal condition 
lof the mental faculties; nor, after such and such a period of 
chool ‘attendance, the habitual level of instruction reached. 
hat, however, in such special conditions, is the very problem 
hich faces him. We do not hesitate to express the opinion 
hat, in such circumstances, the doctor would be incapable of 
stimating the intellectual level of the child. He has not 
ore experience in this matter than any other person. Let a 
loctor seek to pick out a feeble-minded child from a number 
f normal ones, and he will find how little he is prepared to 
ake the selection. 
“ But it may be asked: ‘Is not mental debility associated 
ith physical signs which the doctor alone is able to appre- 
iate? ”

judgments of mental capacity based on the inspection of the 
physiognomies of sixty photographs of normal and abnormal 
children was not so good for the doctors as for the school- 
masters. ‘A medical alienist . . . was mistaken in his opin- 
ion as often as his colleagues who were most ignorant of 
medicine.’ . . . ‘There are some questions which escape the 
doctor unless he is also an educationist and psycholo- 
gist.’ . . . ‘It is not his (the doctor’s) business to select the 
abnormal from the normal. But from the children picked ou' 
as abnormal he will differentiate certain types and prescrib 
certain measures with regard to their care and treatment.’ ” 
     
       
          
    
    
      
           
   
     Likewise the following from L’Année Psychologique, 
1905, p. 163f.: 
“Idiocy, as Esquirol was the first to recognize, consists i 
the weakness of the intelligence. . . . The child is judged t 
be an idiot because he is affected in his intellectual develop 
ment. This is so strikingly true that if we suppose a cas 
presented to us where speech, locomotion, prehension, were a 
nil, but which gave evidence of an intact intelligence, no on 
would consider that patient an idiot. . . . A classification o} 
idiocy is a clinical classification to be made by means of ps 
chology.” “The physical disorders of idiocy have no valu 
except as signs which reveal the intelligence.” “ The medic. 
method is indirect because it conjectures the mental from t 
physical. The pedagogical method is more direct, but the ps 
chological is the most direct of all because it aims to measu: 
the state of the intelligence as it is at the present moment, 
Our own position is that every candidate for a speci 
class should be given a thorough preliminary physic: 
examination by a physician. But the fundamental pu 
pose of the medical examination is not to make a differe

   tial mental diagnosis; that is, determine whether the child 
is mentally normal, retarded, backward, feeble-minded, or 
imbecilic. The purpose of the medical examination is to 
disclose any hampering physical conditions or diseases, in 
order that such conditions may be removed or mitigated, 
or in order that the child’s program of work may be ad- 
justed to meet the needs of the special physical conditions 
found. It occasionally happens that the child’s mental 
andicap is due to a physical handicap, in which case the 
hysical diagnosis will have an important bearing on the 
ental diagnosis, but this is by no means always the case. 
hysical defects and diseases may increase the mental 
tupidity of the feeble-minded, but they rarely produce 
ctual feeble-mindedness. The correction of the physical 
isorders in the feeble-minded, therefore, should be at- 
empted not merely for the sake of improving mentality + 
ut also for the sake of improving health and physical 
‘ondition. 
The réle of the examining psychologist, on the other 
and, is to determine whether or not the child is mentally 
eficient, and if so the degree and character of the defi- 
iency. The psychologist is called upon to decide whether 
e child is approximately normal, or only slightly re- 
rded, or backward, dull or slow, or feeble-minded, im- 
lecilic or idiotic, and whether he is temporarily or per- 
anently retarded, or whether the retardation is intrinsic 
inherent) or extrinsic. He must decide just where the 
ild can be placed to the best advantage in the school 
stem, whether in an ungraded class for backward chil- 
en, or in a special school for the feeble-minded, or in

an elementary industrial or vocational school, or in a 
truant or disciplinary class, or in a class for the blind or 
deaf or semi-blind or semi-deaf, or in an open-air school, 
or in a speech-defective class, or in a regular grade. In 
order to come to an intelligent decision on the large 
variety of pedagogical misfits which constantly pass 
through the psycho-educational clinics, it is evident that 
the psychological examiner must have available complete 
data on each case from the teaching and medical staff as 
well as from the field investigators, and that he must be 
able to interpret these data in the light of the findings 
from his own psychological and educational examination. 
It is evident that no mere Binet tester? can fulfill the 
functions of a consulting psychologist in a school system 
or in a court. The Binet tester fails at the very point 
where expert service is most required; namely, the dif- 
ferentiation of the large mass of the highest grades o 
feeble-minded from the larger mass of the lowest grades o 
backward individuals, and the adequate differentiatio: 
between the mass of difficult cases which should be as: 
signed to a special school and which should be assigne 
to an ungraded class. Even the trained and experience 
psychologist is frequently baffled by the difficulties o: 
mental diagnosis and completely balked by the presen 
limitations of the science. The training required by th 
clinical psychologist if he is to do his work skillfully mus 
be fully as thorough as the training required by any med} 
1In an investigation made in 1913 of the status of the diagnosis 
backward and feeble-minded children in the public schools in thi 
country, the writer reached the following conclusion: “ After a car 
ful scrutiny of the qualifications of the examiners, I am forced to t 
conclusion that not more than thirty psychologists, physicians, alie1 
ists, and educators occupy a status other than that of the Binet teste; 
Accordingly 74% of the testing is done by Binet testers.” (The Me 
tal Health of the School Child, 1914, p. 395.)

ical specialist. Moreover, the psychologist to the schools 
(and in a measure to the courts) must be more than a 
psychologist: he must be a technically trained education- 
ist, conversant with all fields of elementary education, 
and particularly the education of all types of mentally 
and educationally exceptional children, and he must know 
enough about physical diagnosis to be able to interpret 
the findings of the medical examiner. 
No large public-school system can hope adequately to 
differentiate its pupils without the services of a properly 
trained examining psychologist.1 Such a specialist will 
be able to come to a positive decision from one examination 
lion from 75% to 90% of the cases. I cannot subscribe 
to Binet and Simon’s contention “that all decisions,” 
ith respect to admissions to special schools, “ are to be 
egarded as provisional; the children are to be admitted 
o the class for defectives on trial, to be kept under ob- 
ervation.”? Such a recommendation may be necessary 
o long as the obsolete system of diagnosis by psycho-edu- 
ational amateurs continues. But it is quite certain that 
n expert on mental deficiency is able to make a proper 
ssignment from a single thorough examination of the 
rge majority of his cases. 
It is our conviction that the physical and psychological 
aminations should be made by two different specialists ; 
amely, a physician, with clinical experience, not only in 
e general field of medicine but in neurology and 
sychiatry, and a psychologist, with not only a technical 
quaintance with all aspects of elementary, industrial, 
d corrective pedagogy but with adequate clinical ex- 
     
                     
   
    
    
           
    
             1The juvenile or criminal courts and reformatories are equally in

perience with the fundamental types and the different 
grades of mental deficiency, from a slight degree of re- 
tardation to profound idiocy. The physician should make 
the physical diagnosis (including in this term the neuro- 
logical and psychiatric), prescribe the necessary medical| 
treatment, and indicate the social care suggested by th 
medical findings, while the psychologist should diagnos 
the degree of mental deficiency found (if any), determin 
the cause of the deficiency from the data supplied by th 
earlier investigations, distinguish various psychic adoles 
cent deviations which resemble psychoses but which ar 
not truly psychotic in character, and prescribe th 
needed pedagogical and social treatment, having in min 
all the facts bearing on the case. 
There are few specialists at the present time who ar 
competent to do all the work that a skilled physicia’ 
should do and all the work that a skilled psychologis 
should do in the examination of mentally and morally e 
ceptional children. Nor is it likely, with our vast exte 
sion of the fields of human knowledge and the constantl 
growing necessity for increasing specialization, that 
shall ever be able to equip one person to function ad 
quately in both of the two fields of medicine and ps 
chology. Any one who attempts to exhaust both fiel 
must become a jack-at-all-trades. Even now both t 
physicians and the psychologists find it necessary 
specialize in some narrow province of their science. 
Since a psychological clinic in a public-school syste} 
exists for the purpose of making it possible to classify t 
pupils better in their school work and of prescribing t 
type of pedagogical training best adapted to meet th 
peculiar needs, it is evident that the director of such 
clinic must be a technically trained educator. The

sential purpose of the medical, social, hereditary, and 
psychological investigations is to furnish the necessary 
data for intelligent educational guidance and social after- 
care. <A psychological clinic must be an educational and

must be fundamentally psycho-educational and psycho-

  CHAPTER TWO 
Wuo Is FEEBLE-MInpDED? 
THE PROBLEM OF DIAGNOSIS 
DO not know that there is any present-day social 
question of great practical moment which it is in- 
cumbent upon the scientific clinical psychologist to at- 
tempt correctly to answer. The following considerations 
are offered in justification of this broad statement. 
First, through the activities of various publications, 
organizations, institutions, and writers there has been 
developed during the last few years an acute nation-wide 
conviction that there is no class of mental, moral, and 
social misfits which is nearly so numerous and which con- 
stitutes nearly so grave a social menace as the feeble- 
minded. It is certainly incumbent upon some one of the 
exact sciences rigidly to scrutinize the grounds of this as- 
sumption, for the problem of feeble-mindedness comes defi- 
nitely within the domain of the exact sciences and must b 
studied by the “ pure ” scientist solely in the light of col 
facts and not under the imperious sway of sentiment, n 
matter how nobly motivated. In the consuming desire t 
become intensely practical in this field of applied psychol: 
ogy it is quite possible to permit feeling and theory t 
    as an examining psychologist), the obligatio| 
110
-P-A-G-E-127
WHO IS FEEBLE-MINDED? 111 
rests heavily upon him to examine the presuppositions of 
his science. This work cannot be done by the army of 
amateurs who are invading the precincts of psycho-diag- 
nosis. 
Second, in consequence of the aforesaid conviction the 
ublic is now everywhere becoming aroused as never before 
o the necessity of segregating and supplying adaptable 
reatment to the feeble-minded in the public schools, 
juvenile courts, detention homes, homes and institutions 
or juvenile delinquents, rescue homes, reformatories, 
ails, prisons, workshops, and orphanages. This rapidly 
Increasing popular appreciation of the special needs of 
Ihe feeble-minded class is entirely commendable. But 
ince we are beginning to readjust our treatment of the 
leeble-minded, it is therefore all the more necessary to 
sist that the individual should be correctly diagnosed, so 
at, for example, backward pupils may not be forced to 
end all their school days with feeble-minded children in 
ecial schools, and so that backward prostitutes and 
ckward juvenile and adult delinquents shall not be diag- 
sed as feeble-minded, in order to incarcerate them as 
eble-minded for lifelong custody in an eleemosynary in- 
itution or in order to exculpate them from accountabil- 
for the commission of criminal acts. It is just as in- 
cusable for the educator, social worker, judge, or jury 
treat and dispose of a backward individual as though 
were feeble-minded, as it is intolerable for a physician 
treat a tuberculous person as though he were a syphi- 
ic. The questions which we are raising are not prima- 
y academic or theoretical. The clinical psychologist, 
e the physician, is concerned with the practical problem      
       
        
       
     
      
        
   
   In some cities children assigned to special schools have no option 
to attend those schools if they are to remain in the public schools
-P-A-G-E-128
  112 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY    
        
     of individual diagnosis, the prescription of educational, 
mental, and social treatment and training, and the making 
of recommendations with respect to the curtailment of the 
individual’s rights or his enforced restraint under insti- 
tutional care. Since it is evident that on a correct mental 
will depend the very issues of life for the indi- 
vidual concerned, we must make sure that our art (and 
psychological and social diagnosis is just as much an 
art as surgery or dentistry) does not rest upon a sub 
stratum of assumptions, false principles, or pseudo 
facts. 
Moreover, even if surveys of feeble-mindedness are mad 
for purely statistical purposes, or with a view to arousin 
popular interest in the problem and securing effectiv: 
legislation, we have a right to insist that statistical sur; 
veys should be reliable and maximally aceurate. When i 
is asserted that the statistics which have been gather 
        
      
    
   
        
    
     
       were, what “ qualifiea#ions they possessed fo] 
accurate mental diagnosis, what tests were e 
1The New Hampshire Children’s Commission reports that “ai 
child has been considered feeble-minded who is three years or mo: 
retarded in intelligence. Such retardation could be determined a 
for all institutional cases by the use of the Binet-Sim 
Scale.” “The Commission also wishes to emphasij 
strongly the fact that their figures, so far as they go, underestima| 
rather than overestimate the situation. They have erred, if at all, 
the side of conservatism.” Witness the following sweeping clai 
made within the last year: “In a study of harlots numbering 424 
80 per cent plus were found to be distinctly imbecile, their mental a: 
never exceeding twelve years.” “Of some studies made in juven 
courts, numbering 1487 cases — 61 per cent were found imbecile 
yond a peradventure, their mental age averaging from 7¥, to 11.”
-P-A-G-E-129
  WHO IS FEEBLE-MINDED? 113 
ness were followed. It is evident that the value of the 
statistical studies will stand or fall with the character of 
the replies which must be given to these questions. 
Third, it is becoming recognized, and very properly, 
that feeble-mindedness must be diagnosed primarily by 
psychological and social tests, and only secondarily by 
physical tests. In consequence of this recognition large 
numbers of social and psychological workers are being 
appointed as “experts” on feeble-mindedness in the 
schools, courts, and clinics throughout the country. Un- 
fortunately many of these so-called “ psychologists ” are 
lyoung teachers just out of the normal school (three such 
esters were recently referred to as “ our psychologists ” 
in a large conference on the welfare of babies and children 
eld in a large city, which I chanced to attend) ; some are 
ade teachers working with subnormal children, who have 
learned to give the B.-S. (Binet-Simon) or other tests; 
ome have had a college course but possess practically no 
raining in scientific research, possess little or no clinical 
raining or experience, and have no technical acquaintance 
ith psychoasthenic or psychopathic anomalies, although 
hey may have spent a few weeks in an institution and 
ave read some of the texts; some are social workers who 
re not versed in the technical procedures of any of the 
sychological or medical sciences but who may have spent 
lome time in an institution and who can work by rule-of- 
umb with the B.-S. scale; and a few are medical men with 
e equipment of the average physician, sometimes also 
ained in neurology and psychopathology, but rarely 
jossessing any extended training in clinical, educational, 
experimental psychology and in differential pedagogy. 
is very probable that the majority of those using the 
ale are mere Binet testers or amateurs, for we are told
-P-A-G-E-130
    os 114 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
that 20,000 copies of the Vineland Guide were printed 
between 1911 and 1914. Obviously the number of per- 
sons who are using this version alone reaches into the 
thousands. It should require no extended argument to 
show that it is incumbent upon some science (specifically 
clinical psychology) to formulate the minimum of techni- 
cal preparation needed for workers who would attempt 
accurately to differentiate the various grades and types| 
of subnormality — feeble-mindedness in its various degrees 
and types, borderlinity, backwardness, retardation, etc. 
In the popular mind the belief has become widespread tha’ 
a modicum of training and experience will suffice to consti 
tute one a psychological “ expert” or a “clinical psy 
chologist ” or “ psychoclinicist,” in a public-school sys 
tem, court, or institution. The notion has gotten abroa 
that accurate state, city, institutional, and school sur 
veys of feeble-mindedness, and surveys of the feeble 
minded among all types of social derelicts (prostitute: 
and juvenile and adult criminals), can be made by a rule 
of-thumb procedure by any one who can administer cer 
tain psychological tests (specifically the Binet-Simon) 
There are some, however, who regard this assumption a: 
entirely indefensible and utterly subversive of any seriou 
effort to found a respectable science of psychologic: 
diagnosis or to deal scientifically with social problem 
Be this as it may, the scientific workers in this field canno 
supinely acquiesce in procedures based on certain assum 
tions until the assumptions have been proved correct b 
yond a reasonable doubt. 
Fourth, the widespread belief and procedure we ha 
just mentioned have sprung largely from the popular a 
ceptance of three alleged facts: 
(1) That measuring scales of intelligence have be    
                    
    
         
       
    
   
   
  
-P-A-G-E-131
  WHO IS FEEBLE-MINDED? 115 
perfected which enable us to locate with wonderful accur- 
acy the “mental age” (more properly, intelligence age) 
of children and youths — and even adults, judging by the 
diagnosis constantly being made of adult offenders by 
means of the same scales of intelligence. This claim has 
been repeatedly made with reference to the Binet-Simon 
scale. Since most of the surveys of feeble-mindedness 
(as will be seen later) and many, if not most, of the indi- 
vidual diagnoses have been made by means of this scale, 
the clinical psychologist must raise the question whether 
the scale is as accurate as it has been said to be. 
(2) That the upper age limit of feeble-mindedness 
as already been accurately located at a precise point in 
ental development, that we can accurately determine in 
he case of any individual beyond the middle teens whether 
e has reached or exceeded this “ dead line” of normality, 
nd that we can therefore determine by the administration 
f the measuring scales of intelligence now available 
specifically the B.-S. or its variants) whether or not he 
is feeble-minded. 
If this assumption is justifiable, it is evident that all we 
ave to do to train experts in the diagnosis of feeble- 
indedness is to offer courses on tests of mental age. 
The boundary line between feeble-mindedness and 
normality ” (rather, non-feeble-mindedness. This slip- 
hod use of the concept of normality is unjustifiable. 
here are many steps between feeble-mindedness and 
normality ”) has been drawn between the B.-S. ages of 
II and XIII. It is incumbent upon some scientist to 
laise the question whether the boundary line properly 
mes between these ages and to scrutinize the evidence 
on which the decision has been reached. We need to 
ow whether we are confronted with a dictum based upon 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  116 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
unverified hypotheses or upon mere authority, or whether 
we are dealing with a scientifically demonstrated 
fact. 
(8) That feeble-mindedness can be determined by ar- 
bitrary or fixed quantitative units of intelligence retarda- 
tion. Two methods for determining the degree of the in- 
dividual’s intelligence retardation have been proposed; 
first, the method of absolute amount of retardation, and, 
second, the method of relative amount of retardation. 
The absolute degree of retardation is found by subtract- 
ing the individual’s mental age (i.e., B.-S.) from his 
chronological age. The rule has been laid down that the! 
individual is feeble-minded if he shows an “ intellectual] 
retardation of two years at an age below nine, or three 
years at and above nine.” As will be seen on page 166f. 
however, the standard has not been uniformly formulated 
even the same writer has formulated it differently at dif. 
ferent times. The absolute standard, however, either a: 
given above or in a modified form, has been very ex: 
tensively followed in the diagnosis of feeble-mindedness 
particularly by the amateur examiners using the Bine 
scale. No explanation was made in the early formulatio: 
of the rule as to whether it was applicable to the late 
adolescent and adult years of life, and in point of fact} 
the rule has been applied not only to the upper adolescen 
years but also to the adult years. The absurdity of thi 
procedure having, however, been pointed out (we hav 
illustrated it with our “ normal ” adults on pages 222 t 
227), it has recently been proposed to use the age of 1 
or 16 as the highest chronological age from which to sul 
tract the mental age of the examinee. 
The proportional standards of retardation were adv 
cated, without any limitations as to the individual

chronological age, before Stern’ proposed his “ intelli- 
gence quotient,” because it was realized that a year of re- 
tardation was not a constant quantity. It is much 
greater relatively for a three-year-old child than for a 
twelve-year-old. Therefore, the unit of retardation 
should be expressed as a fraction of the chronological age 
of the individual. The intelligence quotient is found by 
dividing the chronological age into the mental age (B.-S.). 
The diagnostic standards suggested by Stern were as fol- 
lows: the “not abnormal” 0.81 to .90, morons 0.71 to 
0.80, and imbeciles 0.61 to 0.70. The intelligence of 
morons, “ measured by that of normal persons, is a ‘ three- 
quarter intelligence,’ ” and of imbeciles a “scant ‘ two- 
thirds intelligence.’ ”? Stern apparently made no attempt 
to demonstrate the correctness of these standards. He 
erely computed the quotients from the B.-S. ages of a 
oup of auxiliary pupils who had been tested and classi- 
ed by some one else, presumably on the basis of the Binet 
ecords and the earlier standards. But, as we have al- 
eady pointed out, the mere fact that a child is found in 
special class does not prove that he is feeble-minded. 
‘hese standards have been accepted and utilized inthe 
iagnosis of cases by some American investigators. 
tern, however, restricts very sharply the applicability of 
he quotient. It is not applicable to idiots, and it is only 
pplicable to the feeble-minded “ during that period when 
he development of the feeble-minded individual is still in 
rogress.” According to Stern this development ceases 
t the age of 9.2. It has been proposed by certain Ameri- 
1 William Stern, The Psychological Methods of Testing Intelligence 
Whipple translation), 1914, 42, 80f. 
2 For once the stage of arrest that we have previously discussed is 
ached (for morons at the mental age of 9), the quotient obtained 
dividing mental age by chronological age increases.” 
Since the above was written Terman (The Measurement of Intelli-

  118 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
can writers arbitrarily to fix the upper chronological age 
at 13, 15, and 16, although, in point of fact, divisors 
as high as 19 have been used, and possibly higher. The 
intelligence quotient has been considered distinctly su- 
perior to the absolute retardation difference, and it has 
been recommended as a substitute for the latter. 
It should go without saying that it is incumbent upon 
the clinical psychologist to reéxamine the grounds upon 
which these standards have been erected. We need to 
know whether these standards are based upon verifie 
facts or on mere assumption and whether, in the fina 
analysis, the higher degrees of feeble-mindedness can a 
all be reliably differentiated from the lower degrees o: 
backwardness by any fixed formulas or automatic pro 
cedures. 
The situation that confronts us, then, is the following 
a large number of psychological surveys, classifications 
and diagnoses of children, youths, and adults who ar 
either inapt at learning or delinquent in conduct have bee 
and are still made by “ Binet testers” 1 whose chief o     
      
     
      
     
    
   
       gence, p. 79) has proposed the following intelligence-quotient stan 
ards of diagnosis, based on the Stanford Revision of the B.-S. scal 
Above 140, near genius or genius. 
120-140, very superior intelligence. 
110-120, superior intelligence. 
90-110, normal or average intelligence. 
80-90, dullness, rarely classifiable as feeble-mindedness. 
70-80, borderline deficiency, sometimes classifiable as dullnes| 
often as feeble-mindedness. 
Below 170, definite feeble-mindedness. 
50-70, most of the morons (high, middle and low). 
20 or 25-50, imbeciles. 
Below 20 or 25, idiots. 
1We apply this term to persons making mental classifications 
the Binet scale who are neither clinically trained and experienc 
psychologists nor psychologically trained physicians. It goes withoj 
saying that many of those using the Binet scale are qualified ai 
conservative examiners who do not slavishly follow the Binet findin;

      sole reliance is the Binet scale and one or another of the 
arbitrary intelligence standards of feeble-mindedness. 
If it can be shown that the evidence on which the Binet 
scale has been declared to be marvelously accurate may be 
inadequate, that the standards of diagnosis may be based 
upon an indefensible substratum of assumption and hy- 
pothesis insted of demonstrated proof, and that, whether 
accurate or not, it is impossible to diagnose as feeble- 
minded a large number of both children and adults by the 
Binet scale alone, we shall have cause to suspect the ac- 
curacy, and to question the value, of mere Binet surveys 
of feeble-mindedness and to reject the staggering statis- 
tics of feeble-mindedness which have been compiled during 
the last half decade. 
To contend that it is bootless and contemptuous to raise 
the above questions or to criticize the established pro- 
cedure, because those who have used the Binet tests and 
some one or the other of the above standards have found 
them to be “entirely satisfactory ” seems like attempt- 
ing to evade the issue and to beg the whole question. In 
he first place, many of those who have most stoutly de- 
ended the accuracy of Binet surveys made by amateurs 
(by which, again, I refer to persons who are not clin- 
cally trained psychologists or psychologically trained 
hysicians) have never attempted to prove the accuracy 
f the diagnosis by expert reéxaminations of the same 
ases. In the second place, there is substantial agree- 
ent among those who are competent to judge, that the 
mateur — the mere Binet tester — is unqualified to make 
ental diagnoses, that at most the amateur can reliably 
liagnose only the very obvious cases of feeble-mindedness 
nd is quite incompetent to make a differential diagnosis 
f the most numerous types of defectives, the high-grade

    feeble-minded, the borderline, and the backward cases. In 
the third place, the Binet scale, valuable as it is, is not as 
accurate as it has been held to be, nor is it able to carry, 
nor was it originally intended that it should carry, the 
great diagnostic burden that has been placed upon it. 
In the fourth place, the arbitrary intelligence standards 
by which the feeble-minded have been, and still are, diag- 
nosed have not been demonstrated to be correct, nor are 
they accepted as correct by many scientific workers in the 
field. 
Before considering these questions in detail, we shal 
proceed to summarize * briefly a considerable number o 
the American studies of various mentally abnormal classe 
of juveniles and adults. Such a digest as this should en: 
able us to compare the methods of examination which wer 
used and the classifications which were made by the differ. 
ent examiners, it should enable us to examine the evidence 
the grounds or criteria, on which the different classifica 
tions are based, it should permit a judgment as to th 
adequacy of the data gathered on the cases, the avera,

I think it will be admitted that if the internal evidence 
revealed by such an examination show large and irreco: 
cilable discrepancies in diagnosis, the presumption is i 
resistible that there is something wrong with the standard 
employed or that the differences in the classifications a:

and not to objective differences in the groups examine

    between the ages and types of the subjects and the habitat 
in which they dwell. 
Unfortunately the attempt to make a résumé of the lit- 
erature has been beset with many obstacles. Many writ- 
ers have withheld the details required to appraise the ac- 
curacy or value of the conclusions drawn. Some writers, 
for example, have not deemed it of any consequence to 
state the ages of the subjects which they have tested, al- 
hough they are diagnosticating on the basis of certain 
tandards which may be legitimate within a certain range 
f ages but which may have absolutely no application to 
different set of ages. Some writers tell us categorically 
hat a given percentage was “ found ” to be feeble-minded, 
ut give absolutely no facts to show how they arrived at 
he conclusion, save possibly the bare statement that the 
ubjects were “ given the Binet test.” Evidently the tacit 
ssumption has been that the basis of classification which 
as been used is universally accepted and therefore need 
ot even be stated, much less explained or justified, al- 
ough the literature clearly shows that the whole matter 
f the criteria or standards of feeble-mindedness is still 
controversy. Others do not give even a hint as to the 
dequacy of their examinations — the thoroughness of the 
inet testing, or the extent of the psychological, medical, 
levelopmental, and social examination. Many of the 
riters do not tell us whether the 1908 or the 1911 scale 
as used, whether the 1918 suggestions were followed, 
hether the tests above age 12 were given, and whether 
e Binet rating includes the latter tests. The presump- 
on is inevitable that their classifications are based wholly 
a Binet survey, sometimes perhaps sketchily made. 
hus in one survey where the facts are given, as many 
thirty cases were examined during the school day. But

it is out of the question to make any sort of satisfactory 
mental or educational examination of a child in ten or 
twelve minutes. 
In the résumé which follows it must be remembered, 
therefore, that the facts essential for a critical considera- 
tion of the classifications or diagnoses given were not com- 
municated in many of the published studies. In some 
cases I have felt warranted in inferring certain facts 
clearly implied in statements actually made. 
The studies fall naturally into two classes: (1) those 
which have been made largely or wholly by means of psy- 
chological tests (frequently the Binet alone), the diag- 
nosis being based, so far as can be determined, upon arbi 
trary standards of mental age or mental retardation; an 
(2) those which have been made by persons of experienc 
devoting practically all their time to psychological o 
mental diagnosis who have personally examined all th 
individuals whom they have diagnosed, and who, so far a 
can be determined, have based their diagnosis upon a thor: 
ough examination of each case. 
The data are tabulated under the following headings: 
Institution, indicating the institution from which th 
subjects were taken. 
Examiner, name of the person actually conducting th 
examinations, together with the literary reference. Some 
times the name of the examiner has not been revealed. I:

however, is “ that 85.83% of our cases, exclusive of t

leave less than 5% “ insane, alcoholic, and drug habit’

that John is feeble-minded provided three years of reta

While we do not hold that clinical psychology (or the d 
agnosis of feeble-mindedness) is an exact science as ye 
still we believe that a clinical psychologist who has he 
wide experience with the feeble-minded and who gathe 
sufficient data on his cases will be able to make a positi 
diagnosis in very many cases. At any rate the practi 
of making various supposititious diagnoses based on arb 
trary assumptions emphasizes the necessity of a thoroug 
scrutiny of our standards.)

probably more accurate than the Binet, for reasons tha

average “about 17.” 
Method: Nine psychological tests, given as grou’ 
tests, and tests of visual and auditory acuity and mus 
cular strength and speed. Aim to determine how man. 
were of “normal mentality and how many were feebl 
minded.” (This cannot be reliably determined except b 
a clinical examination of each individual.)

fancy one lacks some trait or traits of social importanc 
he is considered feeble-minded ”: The University of Mi

necessarily follow from the premises. The fact that two 
thirds were found “subnormal,” a conclusion proper 
enough in itself, does not prove that two thirds were “ fee- 
ble-minded.” The author states, incidentally: ‘“ Careful 
studies indicate that in this country there are about four 
feeble-minded children in a hundred. One child in two 
undred is a low-grade imbecile or idiot. If this estimate 
f the number of feeble-minded holds in Missouri, we have 
in the state 38,260 feeble-minded children between the ages 
f six and twenty-one.” A “liberal” estimate of the num- 
er of both the juvenile and adult feeble-minded in Mis- 
ouri, published in 1911, was 11,427. In the fall of 1914, 
committee in St. Louis, after canvassing the facts avail- 
ble, estimated the total number at from 5000 to 8000. 
e highest estimate by an official commission for New 
ork, almost three times as populous as Missouri, was

Results: No data on number of cases for each year of 
retardation. 
Conclusions: 46% normal, 56% feeble-minded, includ- 
ing 86% of “higher grade moronity ” (evidently refers 
to the 836% grading X years, which would thus rank as 
middle-grade morons by the prevalent scheme of subclassi- 
fication of the feeble-minded by the B.-S. scale) and 18% 
definitely segregable types about whose mentality there 
would be little difference of opinion among trained ob- 
servers.” None of these latter has a mentality above IX 
years, which the writer, quoting Goddard, refers to as the 
“fatal psychological level.” (This fatal psychological 
level may, as we shall see, only indicate the upper region 
of feeble-mindedness. )

(The difference between the findings of these two 
Massachusetts surveys —16.8% and 51%, respectively,

lifferences in the two groups seems to be that the one 
onsists only of prostitutes while the other probably con- 
ists of a preponderance of former prostitutes, since sta- 
istics seem to show that criminality among women is 
isually complicated by prostitution, and yet the one sur- 
rey returns only one third as many feeble-minded as the 
ther. Is the difference in the standards of the examiners 
yr in the examinees?)

tile cerebropathies from indications of spastic plegias * 
and especially psychological. Extends concept of feeble 
mindedness above age 12 into the teens: “It is too ba 
that the classification of morons had an upper limit at 1: 
years, for it omits an important group of feeble-minded 
ness whose condition first becomes conspicuous toward 
maturity. The age between 17 and Q1 is a good one it 
which to diagnose mental deficiency, as before that it i 
often difficult to detect mental defectiveness and menta 
defect from simple mental retardation.” (It may b 
justifiable to apply the writer’s term “sociopath” t 
1The author says that every one of “one hundred cases examine 
as they were admitted at Vineland,” “from the highest to the lowes 
grade, showed organic brain lesion”; and concludes that “ all cases o 
mental defectiveness and perhaps mental defect show organic brai 
lesion,” “the reactions of the spastic paralyses.” If the inference i 
that feeble-mindedness can be accurately diagnosed by a purely neut 
ological examination, specifically by tests of the reflexes, it will b 
necessary to show that the spastic signs of feeble-mindedness ar 
absolutely pathognomonic; that is, that these same signs are no 
present or are different in other abnormal neurological or menté 
types, e.g., the insane, the epileptic, the neuropathic, the border-lin 
and the backward — and we might add, the normal and the super 
normal. It is evident that if they are also present in all types o 
abnormals they cannot be used to diagnose either the grade or eve 
the mere presence of feeble-mindedness and much less “to substan 
tiate most effectively our borderland cases of feeble-mindedness.” I 
appears that it was possible to elicit these signs equally frequent! 
from a group of 25 delinquents “ selected at random” which were n 
classified as feeble-minded but as “high-grade border-land.” The: 
would probably be little difficulty in eliciting the same signs fro 
backward cases. In fact, it happens not infrequently that both tl 
spastic and flaccid type of reflexes can be elicited from normal pe’ 
sons by prolonged stimulation or under certain mental conditio 
The mental state of the person—the ability to relax, willful reé 
forcement, fatigue— may seriously modify the elicitation of at lea 
some of the reflexes. Even when the spastic signs clearly indica 
brain lesions, the degree of the paralysis, as Tredgold has pointed o 
affords no indication of the amount of psychic damage. If our co 
clusion is correct, there is no means of diagnosing feeble-mindedne| 
in the technical meaning of that term except by psycho-social criter:

never attain a mentality beyond that of a normal child o 
twelve years.”? (It would be no easy matter to make suc 
a prediction in the case of many subnormal children, par

cation” . . . determined by the averages of the class of 
individuals we see.” “The study of any human indi-

esults on tests without reference to the relationship of 
bilities or disabilities to environment, lacks in common- 
ense elements which must be introduced into any investi-

mal mentally; 11.5% clearly feeble-minded; 6.4% sub- 
normal mentally; 3% dull mentally from physical causes } 
4.3% psychotic; and 2% constitutionally inferior. 
It will be observed that Healy finds it necessary to sub 
divide his intelligence classification into at least a doze’ 
groups in the first series. The writer requires from seve’ 
to nine groups (see page 182f.), and has never yet foun 
it possible to dispense with a “ doubtful ” or “ reserved ” 
category. Many Binet testers use only two categories| 
feeble-minded and normal, or at most three, normal, bor. 
derline, and feeble-minded, and apparently are able t 
say after a few minutes’ Binet testing (whether conducte 
by themselves or by some one else is apparently of littl 
consequence) whether a given individual is “ feebl 
minded ” or “normal.” On the other hand many experi 
enced workers who for years have devoted practically a 
their time to the study of the backward and feebl 
minded frankly confess that they are occasionally unab: 
to classify some cases even after an exhaustive investig: 
tion. 
In this connection it may also be pointed out th 
Haberman’s contention is not supported by the diagnos 
of any investigator, whether physician or psychologis 
whose results are surveyed in this chapter, namely th 
“the child with whose quota of intelligence the clinic 
psychologist is in the largest measure concerned is the s 
called “ psychopathic constitution.” (“The Intelligen 
Examination and Evaluation,” The Journal of the Am 
can Medical Association, 1915, July 15, 399ff.) T 
highest figure given by any medical investigator (24%

   Anderson) is less than his figure for “ mental defectives ” 
(314%), and less than one-half as large as his combined 
figure for “subnormals” and “mental defectives ” 
(51%%). Most of the medical examiners do not report 
la single instance of “psychopathic constitution.” Not 
single constitutional psychopath was reported by the 
welve physicians who examined my 864 St. Louis cases, 
Ithough the writer so classified .9% (p. 177). Ap- 
arently this concept is even more subjective than the 
oncept of feeble-mindedness in the loose sense in which 
he latter has been used during the last few years.

14 who passed the X-year tests and some of the XII-year 
tests were regarded as “doubtful” rather than subnor- 
mal, much less feeble-minded. 112 passed normal by the 
B.-S. tests for their chronological age or did the XII- 
year tests correctly. 
Conclusions: 88.9% undoubtedly normal; 9.1% prob- 
ably feeble-minded; 11.1% possibly feeble-minded (in- 
cludes doubtful cases, 2% ). 
The reader must have been impressed by the difference: 
in the number of feeble-minded cases returned from th 
municipal clinic and county clinic and detention home ii 
Chicago. The number of cases diagnosed as feeble 
minded in the boys’ and morals’ courts clinic was mor 
than eight times as large as the number who were pro: 
nounced feeble-minded in the juvenile court clinic and i 
the detention home.? It is difficult to believe that thi 
large difference is objective — that it is due to some ol 
jective factor at work in Cook County which selectivel 
directs a vast number of feeble-minded children into th; 
municipal courts and a small number of feeble-minded int 
the juvenile court and detention home. Since both of thes 
clinics are located in the same city, it is fair to assu 
that they are dealing with the same type of human mat 
rial from the standpoint of intelligence or mental de’ 
ciency, the difference being that the city court cases a 
somewhat older (ages 17 to 21, while the average age 
the county cases was 15.5 years) — we shall see later th 
the older the group the higher the percentage of feebl 
mindedness when the diagnosis is based on the fixed Bin 
standards which have been in general use —and t 
county clinic probably received a few cases from the ter

tory outside the corporate limits of the city. Evidently 
the difference is subjective: it represents primarily a dif- 
ference in the examiners’ standards of feeble-mindedness, 
and not primarily a difference in the subjects examined. 
That this is the correct explanation is suggested by the 
following four studies of juvenile court cases. The first 
two of these, in which the diagnoses were not based on ar- 
bitrary Binet standards, as far as can be inferred from 
the data available, returned only 5.4% and 7.9% as fee- 
ble-minded. On the other hand, the number returned as 
distinctly feeble-minded ” in one of the studies in which 
the diagnosis was frankly based on arbitrary Binet stand- 
ards was 66. In the second Binet survey 46% were 
liagnosed as feeble-minded on one assumed standard and 
3% on another. In the third Binet survey the estimates 
aried, according to the assumptions made, from a mini- 
um of 6% for two groups to a maximum of 66% for 
me group.

Method: B.-S. 
Standard: “ Beyond the four-year point (of B.-S. re 
tardation) . . . there is no possibility that these childre 
can ever be normal.” (Even if we grant the correctnes 
of this generalization — we shall quote Binet on this poin| 
later — it does not therefore follow that all those retarde 
over four years are feeble-minded. That would depen 
on the age of the individual. There are many steps 
deficiency between normality and feeble-minded. ) 
Conclusions: 1% normal; 84% backward (less thal 
4 years retarded); 66% “distinctly feeble-minded ”— 
to 8 years backward. (Many of these 66% “ distinct 
feeble-minded ” would, no doubt, on standards which ¢ 
be proved to be applicable be just as “distinctly n 
feeble-minded.”’)

Subjects: 63 boys and 87 girls detained for various 
offenses. Ages, 7 to 20; 23 were 12 or less; 78, 18 or 
lover. (This makes 101 cases.) 
Method: B.-S. (Goddard’s revision.) “The Fifteen 
land Adult tests were made use of whenever feasible.?* 
© Double credit was allowed for any test accomplished 
correctly in the Fifteen and Adult tests.” This “ allowed 
more correct computation of the number of years of re- 
ardation in each case.” 
Basis of classification: Those testing XII years or 
ore who were not retarded more than one year were 
assed as normal; those retarded from 1.1 to 3 years, 
ackward; those retarded 3.1 or more, feeble-minded. 
Conclusions: 83% normal; 21% backward; and 46% 
leeble-minded (including 12% between XI and XII and 
9% between X and XI); or, discarding the XV-year 
nd adult tests and classifying as normal those testing 
I and above; 57% normal and backward, and 43% 
eble-minded.. (On the other hand, if we regard those 
ting between XI and XII as not feeble-minded, the per 
mt of feeble-mindedness is reduced to 34%.) 
* Between 40 to 50 per cent of our juvenile delinquents 
e without a doubt feeble-minded.” (If this statement 
ere made to read “feeble-minded and backward” it 
uld probably be correct. Our own results show that 
e backward group among delinquents is more numerous 
an the feeble-minded. )

23% of these as feeble-minded. Since there is a larger 
number of younger children among the dependents than 
among the delinquents, the figures are incomparable and 
hence scarcely justify the inference drawn from them, be- 
cause the older the average age of the group the larger 
the percentage of feeble-mindedness found by the Binet 
standards (see p. 263f.).

telligence that the answers reveal.” “The answers i 
their totality permit one to make a fair estimate of theij 
mental ages” . . . “on a non-mathematical basis.” 
Basis of classification: ‘Inasmuch as they are mo 
than three years retarded, they would, according to t 
generally accepted standard, be considered mentally d 
fective, or feeble-minded.” (The writer, however, appa 
ently rejects this standard.) _“ The intelligence quotie’ 
to indicate feeble-mindedness must fall below .80.” 
Conclusions: “82.5% are three or more years r 
tarded, and would thus be considered mentally defective, 
However, eliminating those “that test twelve years

over, in order to make full allowance for the deficiency 
of the tests in the higher years,” we obtain a slightly 
more “ conservative estimate,” 26%. The figure for the 
probationers is 17%, “ conservative estimate” 13% ; for 
the first offenders 14%; for the boys in the industrial 
school 30%, “ conservative estimate ” 26% ; and for the 
girls in the industrial school 66%, “conservative esti- 
mate” 52%. However, on a different standard (four 
years of retardation) the author arrives at different fig- 
ures: probationers and first offenders, 6% “ feeble- 
minded ” ; industrial school boys, 18% ; industrial school 
irls, 56%. (The average mental age of the girls, “ 12- 
.”? cannot be considered a low rating. When the aver- 
ge chronological is almost 17 years, four years of re- 
ardation does not prove feeble-mindedness. It is sig- 
ificant that, taking only the higher ages, the average 
ental age of the 19-year-olds was “13-8,” of the 18- 
ear-olds “12-9,” of the 17-year-olds “12-4,” of the 
6-year-olds “13-3,” and of the 15-year-olds “12.8.” 
one of these averages falls below Binet XII. More- 
ver, the average retardation for the 14-year-olds is only 
bout two and a half years, while for the 13-year-olds it is 
nly a little over a year and a half. A group of boys and 
irls in the twenties would probably not average much 
igher in Binet mentalities. But this would not prove 
at the group was therefore more feeble-minded or that 
contained more feeble-minded persons. The difference 
the author’s percentages of feeble-mindedness in the dif- 
rent groups is not due simply to an intelligence differ- 
ce but to a difference in the chronological ages.)

minded, we would reduce our insane population in thes 
proportions. Certainly the results of the test indicat 
that if we reduce feeble-mindedness we will in proportio' 
reduce insanity.” (Even granting the legitimacy of th, 
XII-year standard of normality used, the results do no} 
prove that all these cases were feeble-minded. Many 
them were undoubtedly cases of dementia and not amenti:

Conclusions: Of the 34 insane patients 38.2% we 
judged by the writer to be feeble-minded in intelligen 
(i. e., cases of dementia, not amentia). By the arbitrar 
12-year standard the figure would have been almost twi 
as large, or 67.6%. While the number of patients test 
is too limited to justify positive conclusions, attenti 
may be called to the following points: 
(1) One patient was reported as an “ idiot ” althou 
he graded B.-S. XIII -++-. One who was reported as 
“manic-depressive imbecile” graded XII; another r 
ported “thoroughly demented” graded IX, or rank 
with the higher grades of the feeble-minded, while anoth 
who was reported as a senile dement with “no ratio 
periods ” graded 8.2 years. Two of the medical office

   of the institution estimated the mental age of eight pa- 
tients, whom they knew well, as follows:, Patient No. 22, 
8 and 11 years; No. 29, 9 years (both estimates) ; No. 
37, 5 and 7 years; No. 7, 2 and 5; No. 15, 11 and 12; 
INo. 38, 5 and 10; No. 27, 13 (both estimates) ; and No. 
30, 5 and 8. The difference is considerable between most 
lof these estimates. Most of the estimates also differ con- 
siderably from the B.-S. age, although there is an exact 
correspondence in two cases. 
(2) The average B.-S. age of the insane was 10.3 
ears, which is little lower than the average B.-S. age of 
arious groups of delinquents or of some successful citi- 
ens. On the other hand, ten, or 29.4%, of the insane 
raded XIII +-, which is higher than the B.-S. age of a 
ingle one of the successful citizens whom we have studied 
223ff.). 
(3) The intelligence level is the highest in paranoia, 
aranoid dementia precox, and catatonia, and the lowest 
hebephrenia, paresis, senile dementia, and the manic de- 
ressive psychosis. The average intelligence status of all 
e latter groups falls below the line of feeble-mindedness. 
he group classified as feeble-minded, however, has the 
west intelligence status. 
(4) Earlier investigation has shown that the mental de- 
lelopment of epileptics is very irregular as determined 
the B.-S. scale. Many epileptics will pass a higher 
.-S. age level, while failing in one or more lower ones. 
pileptics frequently pass one or more tests in a half 
zen higher age-levels, The difference in the mental age 
ting when the base used is the highest age successfully 
ssed plus advance credits, and when the base used is the 
west age successfully passed plus advance credits (in this 
se the subject has failed on one or more age standards

           below the upper base), may be very considerable. Thus in 
89% of 103 cases the difference amounted to from 1 to 
8.2 years. In the case of psychotic patients, as may bi 
seen from Table IX (the Columbus patients could not b 
included because the original records were not available) 
the largest difference is 1.2 years, while the averages ar 
just the same. That the difference is small in the ma 
jority of cases is due, of course, to the large number o 
tests in the middle group of ages, particularly ages V- 
and VII. A study of the original records shows that th 
X-year standard proved relatively easy and the VI-yea 
standard relatively difficult for the alienated subjects 
We previously found the same fact to obtain among epi 
leptics. Moreover, both the insane and the epilepti 
failed on the same tests in age VI, namely, reproductio 
of sentence and recollection of age— both memory tests 
Eight of the 21 subjects failed on an age standar 
below the upper base (the highest age successfully passed) 
The average number of advanced points reckoned from th 
lower base earned by the 8 subjects who had a lower bas 
amounted to 16.9. The variation, from 4 to 25 points, jj 
about as large as the extreme variation which we foun 
among the epileptics. On the other hand, the avera, 
number of advance points reckoned from the upper ba 
for all the subjects was only 4.6, varying from no poi 
to 16 points. The average, however, amounts to almo 
ayear. The reason that the number is not greater is di 
to the fact that there were no tests beyond age XII 
As many as six of the subjects passed age XIII and wou 
have gone higher had higher tests been available. It 
evident that there is a large amount of scattering over t!

scale among the insane, just as we found to be the cas 
among the epileptics. Apparently the scattering is some 
what greater among the epileptics, although it should b 
said that the wide-range‘ method of testing could not b 
used as completely with all the insane as was the cas 
with the epileptics. Whether the scattering phenomeno 
is more pronounced among the insane and epileptic tha 
among the feeble-minded and backward children has neve 
been determined.” It is significant, however, that th 
scattering is considerable among both of the hospital case 
diagnosed as feeble-minded, amounting to 16 points fo 
the one said to suffer from “ arrested development.” It is 
of course, possible that both of these cases were dement 
(secondarily feeble-minded) rather than aments. It i 
seen, for example, that the scattering is very great amon, 
three of the four paretic dements and the two senile de 
ments, all of whom fail on age-levels below the upper bas¢ 
It is probable that scattering is a symptom of dementis 
although Binet and Simon hold that the difference betwee 
even the amented feeble-minded and the normal is no 
merely quantitative but qualitative — an unequal develop 
ment of the different psychic functions. 
Binet and Simon ® further state that there are no resid 
uals from earlier higher stages of mental functionin 
among paralytic dements in the field of scholastic know! 
edge or knowledge of practical life, but only in the form 
verbal expression — they retain a vocabulary and fo 
of phrase indicative of a higher mentality in the past 
    1 Wallin, as before, p. 21. 
2 And cannot be comparatively determined unless the same wi 
range method of testing has been used. The writer has a large nw 
ber of records of this sort of feeble-minded and backward cases av: 
able for analysis.

    while they also maintain, on the basis of a number of psy- 
chological tests, that the peculiar defect of the paralytic 
dement is “ difficulty of evocation ” or “ inertia of func- 
tioning.” The latter “ constitutes the essential character 
of the mentality of general paralytics.” We have previ- 
ously pointed out that some dementia precox persons 
whom we have tested retain scholastic accomplishments of 
a higher order than would be expected from their Binet- 
Simon age. Many of the epileptics whom we have tested 
would respond to Binet and Simon’s tests exactly as did 
their demented paretics. The defect of many of the epi- 
leptics could thus also be characterized as difficulty of 
vocation or loss of the power of functioning. And yet 
he mental reactions of many epileptics could not be so 
interpreted. The whole question of the psychic differ- 
nces between paralytic, epileptic, and other types of de- 
ents and aments still invites experimental investigation 
n a larger scale than has yet been attempted.

ry, 1911, June, 232f. “Two Thousand Normal Chil- 
ren Tested by the Binet Scale,” The Training School

scale and reported, 1547 (or, according to Table I, 1536 
cases). 
Method: B.-S. “The number tested in the school 
day varied from twelve to thirty at the beginning.” “ An 
average of ten to thirty minutes for each child, the longer 
time being due to those examiners who had never tested 
normal children — this longer time was confined to their 
first few days.” 
Basis of classification: ‘‘ We group the one year above 
and the one year below together with those at age and 
consider the entire group as normal children.” ‘ Those 
more than a year above age . . . are especially well en- 
dowed .. . ‘gifted’ children.’ Those two and thre 
years behind are “ merely backward ”; four years or mor 
behind, “ without doubt feeble-minded.” The standard o 
feeble-mindedness, however, is given differently elsewhere 
“Tt has been found that if a child is more than two year 
backward while he is still under nine years of age (that) 
he is probably feeble-minded. For a child above nine, w 
allow him to be more than three years backward befor 
we call him defective.’ (From a reprint on “The Bine 
Measuring Scale of Intelligence, What It Is and How I 
Is to Be Used.) “If he is more than three years back 
ward he is mentally defective ” (“The Binet-Simon Meas 
uring Scale for Intelligence.” Reprint from The Trainin 
School Bulletin, 1910, January, p. 3), “ his brain has no 
developed as it should and he is feeble-minded ” (Pedi 
atrics, 1911, June). “ More than two years” evidentl 
means less than three years, and “ more than three years, 
less than four years. “The imbecile . . . has stoppe 
growing mentally, and has stopped previnna to the age 
_ twelve.”? However, an individual who has “ only the me’ 
tality of twelve [instead of ‘previous to the age

becile, 1915, p. 15. (Would it not be well, in the interest 
of scientific consistency, to use the word “ imbecile” only 
lin the technical sense laid down by Binet and Simon, and 
lby Goddard elsewhere, of the feeble-minded whose men- 
alities range from three to seven years, inclusive? If 
e must call morons and super-morons imbeciles when they 
ommit crimes, must we not also call moronic and super- 
oronic pupils imbeciles when they happen to fail in their 
chool work? Are we justified in calling them imbeciles 
in the one case and morons in the other? Are we justi- 
ied in applying the term “ criminal imbecile ” to persons 
ho would “ make scores above the averages for their year 
roups by the Point Scale?” Shall we not, by so doing, 
ring the science of criminal psychology into disrepute? 
e shall see presently that there are “normal” adult 
entalities that do not reach Binet XI or XII years.) 
Conclusions: 4% gifted (65 cases “ more than a year 
jove age”); 78% normal (554 cases at age, 329 one 
ar advanced and 312 one year below); 15% backward 
56 or 10% two years, and 79 or 5.1% three years 
ckward); and 8% (actually 3.3%) feeble-minded (37 
ur, 8 five, 6 six, and 1 seven years behind). The con- 
sion with respect to the percentage of fecble-mindedness 
variously stated: 2% of public-school children are “ so 
mtally defective as to preclude any possibility of their 
x being made normal and able to take care of them- 
ves ” (School Training of Defective Children, 1914, p. 
). “These — the feeble-minded — are more than 2 per 
tt of the school population,” “2 per cent feeble- 
ded” (Proceedings of the National Education Asso- 
tion, 1911, July, 1041, 1045). “ At least two per - 
t of the school population belongs to this class ” (Pedi-

the first five grades are feeble-minded ” (Training Schoo 
Bulletin, 1911, p. 312). “These children are, without! 
doubt, feeble-minded. They, constitute 3 per cent of th 
total group ”— the exact per cent is 3.3 (The Training 
School Bulletin, 1911, p. $21). However, the number re- 
tarded three or more years is 131, or 8.4%. According 
to the most recent statement: “It is probably true that 
at least 2 per cent of the children in any school syste 
are so defective mentally as never to be able to profit b 
the usual instruction. They require special tentang i 
separate classes, or, better, in special schools.” (Scho 
and Society, 1916, p. 497.) Although this estimate is n 
doubt literally correct,—the percentage probably j 
nearer four or five,— this does not mean that all the 
children require special instruction because they are a) 
feeble-minded. We have clinically examined thousands 
children whose needs were not met by the regular el 
mentary curriculum who were in no sense feeble-minde 
Some of these misfit pupils were feeble-minded, othe’ 
backward, semi-blind, semi-deaf, word-blind, aphasi 
speech defective, illiterate or ignorant, crippled, or han 
capped by defective command of English or by nasal o 
struction or pronounced malnutrition. They did not 
require the same educational treatment and it would haj 
been pedagogically wrong to have assigned all types 
special classes for the “ mentally defective,” a term whi 
is universally used as synonymous with feeble-mindedne|

Conclusions: 2% normal, 18% backward, 80% “ de- 
fective,” 98% below age. ~(It is stated that the 80% 
‘ound defective includes only 15% of those who should be 
in special classes. This would give a feeble-minded popu- 
ation of 1580 in the elementary schools of Rochester, 
hich is over 6% of the entire enrollment. Williams’ con- 
lusion that “The number of feeble-minded children in 
he public schools of Salt Lake City is probably not far 
hort of 600” would make 3.2% of the pupils in the 
chools of Salt Lake City feeble-minded, based on an at- 
lendance of 18,257. (J. Harold Williams, “ Backward 
nd Feeble-Minded Children in “Salt Lake City,” The 
raining School Bulletin, 1915, p. 125.) We are not 
Id whether the attendance figures include the high-school 
lupils. In sharp contrast with these estimates, based on 
ed Binet standards, may be quoted Cornell’s findings 
Philadelphia: ‘There are in the Philadelphia Public 
thools, in round numbers, 400 definitely feeble-minded 
ildren and 3500 borderline cases.” (Walter S. Cornell, 
(Methods of Preventing Feeble-Mindedness,” Proceedings 
the National Conference of Charities and Correction, 
15, p. 335.) This give .18% of feeble-minded children 
the Philadelphia schools — based on the “ enrollment ” 
the elementary schools during 1913-1914 (216,302). 
cording to the 2% dictum, 4326 of the elementary pu- 
s should be feeble-minded. In a personal communica- 
m Dr. Cornell writes under date of June 20, 1916: 
egarding the proportion of children found to be feeble- 
ded, I have never agreed with the estimate that 2% 
all school children are feeble-minded. In my book 
Health and Medical Inspection of School Children, 
lished in 1912, I placed the number of feeble-minded 
small fraction of 1%. My personal belief is that it

is approximately one half of 1%.” Dr. D. P. Mac- 
Millan, director of the Child Study Laboratory of the 
Chicago Schools, writes similarly under date of June 6. 
1916: “I have been delaying my reply to you just be- 
cause I wanted to have some actual statistics before me 
. » . It seems to me as if three fourths of one per cen 
would be a high rate” of feeble-minded children in th 
Chicago schools. Dr. Clara Schmitt, of the same labora) 
tory, in a recent address placed the number of feebl: 
minded in the Chicago schools at about one half of on 
per cent. During two years of continuous examinatio 
of suspected mental defectives in the St. Louis schools, t 
writer has identified 261 as feeble-minded, which is .29 
of the elementary enrollment on April 7, 1916 (89,000 
According to the 2% dictum there should be 1780 feebl 
minded children in the St. Louis elementary schools. A 
though there remain in the grades feeble-minded pupi 
whom we have not yet examined and although some of o 
borderline cases will later prove to be feeble-minded, 
seems to us probable that only about one half of one 
cent of the elementary pupils are feeble-minded in the 
Louis schools (see page 85f.).

open to question if by “mental deficiency” is mea' 
feeble-mindedness and if the evidence which is accept

Method: Clinical study of each case, including B.-S.

The B.-S. rating is by both the 1908 and the 1911 
ales. In order to secure data which would be compara- 
e with an earlier study of epileptics by the 1908 scale 
has been necessary to employ the same experimental

   vance to the borderline or backward status. Some of 
the: borderline will prove to be feeble-minded as they grow 
older, others will prove to be merely backward, while 
others will remain borderline. 
The average chronological ages, B.-S. ages, average 
intelligence quotients (chronological age divided into the 
mental age), and average retardation in years (chrono- 
logical age minus mental age) for the various groups in 
this classification (based, however, on the 414 cases thor- 
ughly tested by the B.-S. system) are given in Table XI. 
agnosis of 89 Disciplinary Cases, Examined in 1914- 
1915 
Eighty-nine of the above children were reported as dis- 
iplinary cases. This group includes: (1) children in 
he regular grades who were troublesome; (2) truants in 
he regular grades; (3) persistent truants (boys) as- 
igned to the boys’ class; (4) children committed by the 
uvenile court to the Industrial School for various of- 
lenses; (5) a few sex offenders or sexual degenerates. 
wing to the limited number examined the data are not 
alyzed separately for the above sub-groups. 
Subjects: 434 consecutive cases (302 boys and 132 
rls) examined in the clinic during 1915-1916, exclusive 
8 cases which were examined the year before. Average 
ronological age of boys, 11.82; of girls, 10.87; of 
th sexes, 11.18; highest age, 21.1; lowest age, 6. 
istribution of chronological ages: age 6, 6 children; age 
28; 8, 45; 9, 56; 10, 58; 11, 68; 12, '75; 13, 57; 14,

The number of cases of visual aphasia could have been increased by the addi- 
mn of borderline forms. 
  15, although, as explained on page 67, during 1915- 
16 the clinic asked for the examination of some of the 
ildren reported as most retarded in the census of peda- 
gical retardates. There is a reduction in the number 
normal, retarded, and speech-defective children, and 
increase in the number of backward and epileptic

marily because they were backward in their school work, and not primarily 
ause they were delinquent. Hence the disciplinary groups in Tables XIV and

Method and basis of classification: Same as above, e: 
cept that the majority of these cases, owing to inadequa’ 
facilities, were given a less thorough physical examinatio 
Results: For distribution of cases according to yea: 
of intelligence retardation, as determined by the B.- 
scale, and for classification according to the arbitrari 
proposed quantitative schemes of intelligence defect, s 
Graph III. 
Conclusions: For the final intelligence diagnos 
based on all available facts, Graph IV. 
The average chronological ages, average B.-S. a, 
average intelligence quotients and average retardation 
years for the various groups in this classification 
given in Table XVII. 
The questions which we now have to consider are 
following: 
1. Can reliable mental diagnoses and classifications 
children and adults be made by Binet testers who 
essentially amateurs in psychological, or psycho-edu 
tional or psycho-social, diagnosis? 
2. Is it possible accurately to diagnose cases by 
Binet scale alone, even assuming that it is a “ marvel 
accuracy ”? 
38. Is the B.-S. scale, in point of fact, as amazingly 
curate as it has been claimed to be? Can we determ 
by this scale the exact mental age of children, you 
and adults?

    4. Does the boundary line between feeble-mindedness 
nd normality (sic!) lie between the ages of XII and 
III? How did this assumption originate and what is 
he nature of the evidence produced in its support? 
5. Can feeble-mindedness be adequately or reliably 
iagnosticated by arbitrary units of intelligence retarda- 
ion, whether absolute or proportional? If so, what are 
lhe units and what is the value of the evidence adduced 
support of the standards which have been proposed? 
Question 1 
In attempting to answer the first two questions we 
all content ourselves largely with quoting from the 
ritings of scientific men whose opinions we share. 
Binet and Simon themselves have answered our first 
estion in the negative:1 “A last word for those who 
sire to employ the method. Any one can use it for his 
personal satisfaction or to obtain an approximate 
aluation of a child’s intelligence, but for the results of 
le method to have scientific value it is absolutely neces- 
ry that the individual who uses it should have served 
apprenticeship in a laboratory of pedagogy or possess 
horough practical knowledge of psychological experi- 
ntation.” 
ikewise Goddard, although he has defended the use of 
Binet tests by teachers, parents, and “ even novices ” 
“untrained or wrongly trained persons,” who has 
rmed that “ Binet’s plan is perfect,” and who has said 
t “by the use of this method, any superintendent may 
mine his system of schools and determine with consid- 
ble accuracy whether each and every child is in the

it of the Intelligence of Young Children, 1913, p. 69.

grade that his mental ability actually warrants,” has 
nevertheless reached the following conclusion:1 “ Does 
it require highly trained experts to give the tests? Yes 
To determine a child’s mental development to a nicet 
with a degree of precision and a certainty that cannot 
doubted, requires the highest kind of training on the pa 
of the person who gives the tests. Such a person mus 
be a good psychologist, must understand the human min 
must understand the methods of scientific procedure . . 
and finally must know how to interpret the answer th 
the child gives and give to it the correct amount of credi 
Besides a general knowledge of psychology and of chil 
psychology in particular, this involves considerable e 
perience with the scale itself.” 
So also Mitchell:? “In a corresponding way t 
Binet-Simon tests may be and are being conducted 
Cleveland and elsewhere by examiners who have tho: 
oughly mastered this special technique, but who are n 
trained psychologists and who are not able to administ 
the other available tests in the same field. Competen 
in this field involves ability to use a wide range of psych 
logical tests and measures and a grounding in the theo: 
and practice of applied psychology.” ‘ Diagnosis 
mental status should be made by a clinical psychologis 
“Some psychologists are concerned with the behavior 
normal human beings. They never carry their obse 
tions beyond the confines of the laboratory psycholo, 
These people are in the same relation to the clinical p: 
chologist as the experimenter in the medical laborat 
is to the practicing physician.”

The following quotation from Pearson and Jaederholm * 
is also apropos: “While the psychologist, after care- 
ful testing of a child with one to three years of mental 
backwardness, would be unable to determine whether such 
a child was a negative variation from a normal group 
lof children or a positive variation from the feeble-minded, 
he field worker with no special training in psychology is 
repared to tell us that this child is a Mendelian reces- 
ive and lacks a determiner of normal mentality, or is a 
endelian dominant and possesses this mentality! In 
ruth there is no such intellectual boundary between a 
ormal and mentally defective. The distribution of in- 
elligence in both normal and mentally defective is abso- 
tely continuous, and in purely psychological tests of in- 
elligence there are no rigid and limited categories of 
ormal intelligence and feeble-mindedness.” ? 
1Karl Pearson and Gustav A. Jaederholm, Mendelism and the 
‘roblem of Mental Defect, II. “On the Continuity of Mental De- 
ct,” 1914, p. 17. 
2 We fully concur in this conclusion, but we do not think that the 
thors have demonstrated that 54% of one category ranges over 64% 
the other — referring to groups of feeble-minded and normal chil- 
‘en tested by the Binet scale. The latter conclusion cannot be con- 
lered as proved for two reasons. First, the authors did not show 
a thorough preliminary clinical examination that every one of the 
ipils in the “help” classes in Stockholm whom they included in 
eir B.-S. study was actually feeble-minded. In the second place, 
y did not prove by a prior expert examination that none of the 
‘ildren in the normal group was feeble-minded, and they included in 
study the three “ worst” cases in each class. As a matter of fact, 
writers frankly concede, as we have already pointed out (p. 54) 
it a hotchpotch group of children are assigned to the “help ” classes 
Stockholm, some of whom show merely a “ certain degree of mental 
kwardness,” and that feeble-minded children are retained in the 
ular grades because parents often persistently refuse to send their 
ils to the “help” classes. It is evident that conclusions drawn 
m a comparative study of groups of so-called “normal” and so- 
led “mentally deficient ” children may be quite valueless unless the 
dren have first been segregated into non-feeble-minded and feeble- 
ded groups by means of a thorough clinical examination. More- 
1, feeble-minded children must be compared with normal children

    194 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
Moreover, the American Psychological Associatio 
has, by special resolution, gone on record as follows 
“Whereas psychological diagnosis requires thoroug 
technical training in all phases of mental testing, thor 
ough acquaintance with the facts of mental developmen 
and with the various degrees of mental retardation: 
“ And whereas there is evident a tendency to appoin 
for this work persons whose training in clinical psychol 
ogy and acquaintance with genetic and educational psy 
chology are inadequate: 
“Be it Resolved, That this association discourage th 
use of mental tests for practical psychological diagnosi 
by individuals psychologically unqualified for the work. 
There is thus substantial agreement that the work 
psychological diagnosis requires the services of a traine 
specialist. As we have frequently insisted,’ it is no mo 
the function of the Binet tester or amateur to ma 
psychological diagnoses, even for statistical purpose| 
than it is the function of the school nurse to make me 
ical diagnoses. All that is expected of the nurse is th 
she shall efficiently perform the limited functions for whi 
she has been specially trained; all that should be expecte 
or permitted, of a Binet tester who is not a qualified ¢| 
amining psychologist or a psychologically qualifi 
physician is that she shall master the technique of 
ministering the tests, so that she can give them accurat 
and efficiently, and properly compute the intellige 
of the same chronological ages and not with younger normal child 
From what has been said, it should be evident that there is no 
rant for the corroborative evidence that has been hastily extrac] 
from this study by others, that 3% of elementary-school children 
feeble-minded.

rating in the approved units of the scale. That is quite 
a different function from diagnosing the subjects as 
feeble-minded, backward, or normal. All that should be 
attempted in psychological surveys conducted by 
lamateurs for state or city commissions or school or court 
systems should be to state the results purely empirically 
in terms of the number of persons of each mental age, 
x the amount of intelligence retardation for each chro- 
ological age of the subjects. If commissions, institu- 
ions, schools, and courts are not satisfied with this 
odest program, they should secure examiners who are 
dequately trained to do the required work. If the work 
ls worth doing at all, it is worth doing well. Certainly 
here is no excuse for the employment of dilettante ex- 
miners by the large public-school systems of the country, 
lhe state institutions, and the courts and institutions of 
lhe large cities. In the schools of the smaller cities the 
mancial conditions will probably make it necessary to 
se the services of teachers who have been trained to give 
ental tests. But the limitations of these examining 
achers should be explicitly recognized. They should 
t be designated “ psychological experts” nor should 
ey be expected to make psychological diagnoses. They 
ould confine themselves to using the psychological data 
corroborate the pedagogical findings instead of at- 
mpting to diagnose the children. In classifying chil- 
en for instruction, all pupils not clearly feeble-minded 
ould be given an adequate trial in an ungraded class 
fore being assigned to a special school, in order to avoid 
justice to backward children. 
Question 2 
Binet’s answer to our second question is also in the 
ative. In spite of many contradictory statements    
      
         
        
    
    
     
    
      
     
        
 
-P-A-G-E-212
196 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
(see p. 213f.), Binet evidently recognized the limited 
diagnostic possibilities of his scale, for he tells us that 
“Our scale of intelligence gives the actual level of an 
intelligence without analyzing it, and without informing] 
us about the mentality.” “It is an error to pretend tha’ 
the scale alone is sufficient to enable us to know the char- 
acter of children; in reality it is made to aid observation 
to complete and control it, but by no means to r 
place it.” + 
Binet and Simon further assert? that the fact that 
“defective of eleven . .. is at the level of a child o 
nine .. . has no bearing on the cause of the retarda. 
tion, nor upon its particular nature, nor upon the mean: 
for rectifying it.’ Concerning their standards for th 
initial selection of suspected cases of mental deficienc 
they say: “Let us even say boldly that if, by some un 
happy chance, other finer methods should conflict wit! 
this, and indicate as defective a child who has show: 
himself well adapted to school life, it is school life whic 
should be considered the more important test.” The 
would probably apply the same remark to “ social life, 
which many writers regard as the ultimate test of feebl 
mindedness. ‘ We may vigorously exclude from the cla’ 
of defectives the child who is simply ignorant, but the 
is a whole series of complex cases intermediate betwee 
the ignorant and the defective. . . . “ We hope they (t 
“normal cases”) will be kept “in the ordinary school. 
“We hope it; we even demand it with all our power,

     garded as provisional.” Incidentally the observations of 
Binet and Simon on the bearing of heredity are apropos: 
“ But the above observations upon his heredity do not 
bear upon the question of whether he is a defective, and 
throw only the dimmest light upon his character and the 
manner in which one should treat him.” “ At most, the 
discovery of a pathological heredity might incline one in 
a doubtful case towards a diagnosis of mental deficiency, 
but yet one should be extremely cautious about permitting 
oneself to be influenced in this way, for we are ignorant 
to a most incredible degree concerning the heredity and 
ntecedents of normal children, and as our ignorance in 
his respect is so complete, we are unable to say pre- 
isely what is really pathological in the heredity and the 
ntecedents of those who are abnormal. Information of 
his kind, therefore, is not directly useful.” And yet, 
e have been constantly told that the Binet diagnoses 
ave been “ proved” to be correct by the child’s family 
istory. 
Witmer writes:+ ‘Where we shall draw the line be- 
ween the child whom we shall call a normal child with 
ental defects, and a subnormal or feeble-minded who is 
entally defective, is a problem which cannot be wholly 
ved within the realm of psychology. No Binet-Simon 
sts, or any other tests, will inform us as to what we 
all consider feeble-minded.” 
Fernald declares that “ An accurate and incontestable 
iagnosis of one of these borderline cases can be satis- 
ctorily made only after a thorough physical examina- 
ion of the patient, knowledge of the family history, per- 
1L. Witmer, “Children with Mental Defect Distinguished from

        sonal history,” etc. . . . “The Binet tests, in the hands 
of competent examiners, usually corroborate the results 
of clinical examinations in the recognition of all degrees 
of mental defect in children under 10 and of pronounced 
mental defect in older persons. These tests are not so| 
effective in the detection of slight mental defect in world-| 
wise adolescents and adults. In other words, the Binet 
tests corroborate where we do not need corroboration. 
and are not decisive where the differential diagnosis of th 
high-grade defective from the normal is the question.” 
According to Fernald the tests fail at the very poin’ 
where confirmation is most needed. 
Mitchell writes: ‘ Those who call in question the valu 
of the result obtained by this method do not claim tha’ 
the Binet-Simon tests are without merit. They say tha 
they are valuable but not completely adequate. The: 
claim that they should only be used by people who ar 
thoroughly trained in other methods of psychological 
examination.” 2 
Also Langmead: “TI do not think that we can label 
child as defective in mind by a fixed test, or set of test: 
no matter how carefully thought out. . .. Judged b 
them alone, the minds of many children who are not me 
tally defective will be weighed in the balance and foun| 
wanting ’— and that is exactly the situation that co: 
fronts us today. 
Huey asserts that “ Such persons (as the “ many no 
psychologists”) will at least find the Binet and oth 
series of tests an enrichment of their stock of homema 
devices, often economical of time and giving a glimps

t least, of mental efficiency in more varied and repre- 
entative directions. Each will make these tests some- 
hat in his own fashion, inevitably, and the results will 
yy no means match the ‘standardized results. . . . The 
sts will not displace the practical judgment but may 
e of great assistance in forming and improving it, and 
en the trained clinical psychologist with the scale at its 
lest, will doubtless have to ‘ set’ it somewhat differently 
Y various social and industrial classes, and will make 
rious allowances for local circumstances, even if not 
x his own ‘ personal. equation.’ ” + 
According to Healy “ this scale, it may at once be said, 
to be fairly employed merely as a scheme for prelimi- 
lary diagnosis, and like many other useful ideas has 
en given exaggerated importance, as if by it one were 
pable of measuring all the vast intricacies and possi- 
lities of the human mind, defective and normal.” ? 
Similarly Yerkes, Bridges, and Hardwick, referring to 
e “ often demonstrated and patent fact that the Binet- 
mon scale is relatively unreliable for individuals under 
or over ten years of age”: “As matters stand, the 
st that can be done with the Binet scale is to interpret 
e results in the light of such facts as are obtainable. 
at is, the verdict often depends on the judgment of the 
aminer almost as completely as when no ‘scale’ is 
led.” “It is today a matter of common opinion and 
ort that the child’s mentality may be measured by al- 
st any one who chooses to devote a few days to the 
dy of the Binet scale, and to practice in applying it.”

    mal or the pathological individual demands thorou, 
training and extensive experience,” + upon the necessi 
for which we have constantly insisted. 
Yerkes goes even further:? “I believe that the a, 
arrangement of tests is wrong in principle, violating 
laws of mental development. For this reason, I have r 
jected the age scales. . .. Possibly it would be wi 
wholly to ignore the Binet method, and on the assum 
tion that nothing satisfactory exists, to proceed with t 
development of the sort of thing that we think we shou! 
have.” 
My own position is, in general, in harmony with t 
conclusions of the above writers as against the positi 
taken by Goddard that “nothing else is needed in t 
great mass of cases than this test ” (the Binet), and 
the claim made by Kohs that “ the Binet scale is enti 
satisfactory for purposes of mental diagnosis,” and t 
the “Binet scale itself is entirely satisfactory when 
have to determine the existence of mental deficiency ii 
subject testing 10° or below, or its non-existence in 
testing 11° or over.’ Even had the Binet scale b 
proved to be absolutely accurate, we do not believe it 
capable of carrying this diagnostic burden. It may s 
fice with obvious cases, but even with these it will so 
times “ miss fire.” 
Question 3 
We shall consider the third question only with re’ 
ence to the Vineland revision of the Binet scale, beca’

Mental Ability, 1915, pp. 38, 87, and 98.

scale by other writers appear in subsequent issues of the Journal.

is is more widely used in America than any other and 
»ddard maintains that it is wonderfully accurate.’ 
It is evident that an inspection of Goddard’s statisti- 
| data? does not supply the proof of the marvelous ac- 
racy of the scale. Goddard gives the following as his 
andard for determining whether or not a given test was 
operly placed in the scale: ‘ We consider that a ques- 
mn. is misplaced in the scale if it is not answered cor- 
stly by about '75% or more, of those trying it.” By 
(5% or more, of those trying it” we have to assume 
at Goddard referred to 75% of all the pupils of the 
me chronological age. But “with the purpose of de- 
mining just what percentage of children at the various 
es can answer the different questions,” Goddard dis- 
buted the pupils of a given chronological age accord- 
x to their mental ages in Table II, on which his results 
e based. In consequence the per cents of successes for 
siven test (no per cents, however, are given in the table) 
nnot be calculated for all the pupils of a given chro- 
ogical age, but only for the pupils who classify in the 
et age in which the test came in the 1908 scale. Ac- 
dingly the number of passes and failures on which the 
cents must be based for any given test in any given 
is very materially reduced. The highest number of 
res for any test is 109, for tests X 2 and 3 of age 10, 
e in very many cases it is less than 50. Thus, al- 
ugh there are 114 5-year-old pupils, the per cent of 
cesses for the V-year tests can be based only on from 
to 34 pupils in age 5, or from 18 to 25 pupils in age 
         
      
       
         
        
        oreover, the statistical data published by Binet and Simon are 
completely set forth as to render detailed analyses impossible.

6, or from 7 to 10 pupils in age % The 5-year-o 
pupils are distributed in the table all the way from a 
III to age VII. Likewise, although there are 89 13-yea 
old pupils, the percentage of successes for the XIII-ye 
tests can be based only on 5 subjects in age 13, from ‘ 
to 39 in age 12, and from 0 to 12 in age 11. The nw 
ber of pupils of the chronological ages corresponding 
the same Binet ages is as follows for the remaining age 
VI, from $2 to 48; VII, from 96 to 108; VIII, from ' 
to 93; IX, from 53 to 72; X, from 105 to 109; XI, fre 
88 to 53; and XII, from 36 to 44. It is at once appare 
from the above figures not only that all the tests of 
given mental age were not given to all the pupils of t 
corresponding chronological age, but that it is impossil 
to determine what all the 5-year-old pupils did in t 
tests of, say, ages IV to VIII. We can only tell what t 
5-year-olds who classified as IV did in the Binet IV tes’ 
what the 5-year-olds who classified as V did with t 
V-year tests, what the 5-year-olds who classified as 
did with the VI-year tests, etc. And similarly for t 
other ages. We must bear in mind, then, that the p 
cents of successes or failures for the tests of a giv 
Binet age are based only on the children of the cort 
sponding chronological age who successfully passed t 
tests of that age. In other words, the norms establis: 
are based on children who had already been menta 
standardized by the 1908 scale, and not on the 75) 
standard of successful performance of all the children 
a given chronological age. Goddard indeed states t 
the per cents can be checked up by the results in the lo 
and higher ages — he gives the figures in the table but 
does not actually carry through the detailed analy 
“Tt seemed worth while to determine whether the s

-atio approximately would hold good for those who were 
bove and below age. We have consequently worked out 
he same problem for those who were one, two, and three 
ears above and below age. [This analysis has not been 
arried through. Only the number of + and — are 
iven in the table.] That is to say, if a child is 9 years 
Id actually, but tests only 6, how does he succeed with 
e 6-year-old questions? Have such children on the 
hole succeeded and failed in about the same ratio as the 
ildren who are physically only 6 years?” (But this 
mparison can be carried out only with the 6-year-olds 
o classify as VI, and not all the 6-year-olds.) “An 
ustration will make the problem clear. Take question 
1. By the children who are ‘ at age’ it is answered 
rrectly by 35, while 8 fail. Of those who are a year 
ove age (i. e., precocious) 34 succeed and 8 fail,! prac- 
ally the same proportion. Those who are two years 
ove, 4 succeed and 0 fails, while those who are one 
ar below (i.e, dull), 14 succeed and 8 fail.2 This is 
‘y close to the ratio of 35 to 8. Whatever may be 
id in favor of this procedure, it is obvious that the 
vanced and retarded children who are compared with 
children who are “at age” have also been mentally 
mdardized in advance by the 1908 Binet scale. More- 
r, the per cents of successes for children of different 
onological ages for the tests in the Binet ages in which 
y classify are often amazingly different — certainly 
ry do not “agree very closely.” For example, VI 1, 
8%, 81.4%, 88.2%, and 100% ; VII 4, 33.8%, 43.5%, 
%, and 92.3% ; VIII 2, 20%, 48.4%, 84.9% ; IX 1, 
Jo, 59.7%, 87.2%, and 100% ; X 3, 28.9%, 84.4%,

86.6%, and 100%; and XI 2, 11.1%, 44.5%, 13.5% 
and 60%. 
When we turn to the actual relocations of the tes 
made on the basis of the standard adopted, we likewii 
encounter difficulties. It is not clear just why the fi 
digits test was advanced to age VIII (83.7% + for t 
8-year-olds classifying in VII), as the test proved to 
just right for the 7-year-olds in age VII (74.7% 
passes). The color test is too easy for the '7-year-ol 
in age VIII (95%), but no data are available for t 
‘{-year-olds in age VII, where it has been placed. Ce 
tainly we are not justified on the basis of the few 6-yeal 
old cases (14) tabulated in age VIII to decide that t! 
test does not belong in age VI. Let the reader again 
reminded that both the 7- and 6-year-olds consider 
had a 1908 Binet mentality of VIII, so that we have n 
come to any conclusion at all as to whether '75% of chr 
ologically '-year-olds would or would not pass the test 
question. The rhymes test in nearer the accepted sta 
ard for the 10-year-olds (72%) than for the 11-year-o! 
(90%) who classified in XII. 
Of tests which were not changed, the patience t 
proved too hard for V (62.5%). The result for 
6-year-olds (73.6%) indicates that it should be 
vanced — the data, of course, do not show what the 
year 6-year-olds did in this test — which seems to c 
respond with our experience with the test. Count: 
13 pennies proved to be too easy for VII (94.9%), 
knowledge of coins for X (95.4%), the ages in w 
they are retained. The 6-year VII-year-olds passed 
counting test (72.7%). The sentence repetition pro} 
too hard for XII (41.6%), where it is retained, as 
as too hard for the 13-year-olds in Binet XII.

The following criticism by Thorndike ? is also apropos: 
Goddard has asserted that ‘ the Binet scale was wonder- 
lully accurate ’— that its questions are well graded, at 
ast from ages five to twelve, and that they fit the ages 
which they are assigned;’ and others have accepted 
is conclusion. 
“T shall show that the very measurements whence God- 
rd derived this assumption of the exact correspondence 
the Binet mental ages V to XIII, to the average abil- 
of chronological ages 5 to 12, show in reality some- 
ing entirely different, and that so also do the results 
others who have used these tests. . . . The Binet XI 
s chronological 1214, the Binet XII fits chronological 
1%. You must not test 166 11l-year-olds and only 20 
-year-olds and then use the gross numbers of 60 11- 
ar-olds and only 5 14-year-olds. testing Binet XI to 
love that Binet XI fits the 1l-year-olds.” ... It is 
ar from table III (Thorndike’s table) that 11-year- 
children do not equal Binet XI standard, but a stand- 
of about 10.6 (or X + % of the Binet X-XI step) ; 
t 12-year-old children do not equal the Binet XII 
ndard, but about 10.9 (X + %o of the Binet X-XI 
»). . . . Probably 11.4 (or XI plus 40 of the Binet 
-XII step) is as high as the general run of 13-year- 
children would score.” Thorndike gives the true 
ental ages ” for ages X and XI as follows:

The significance of Thorndike’s conclusions should b 
obvious. It has been asserted that mentalities which ar 
arrested on the 12-year-old plane are definitely feebl 
minded, while if they go beyond 12 years they are norm: 
(sic). According to Thorndike the Binet XI-year-ol 
who have been diagnosed as feeble-minded actually measu: 
121% years, and therefore ought not to be feeble-minde 
by the very standards which have been followed, while t! 
XI-year-old “ feeble-minded” are found to rank 1} 
years above the dead line! On the basis of these stan 
ards, declared fallacious by Thorndike, we have been aj 
sured that “It has been established beyond doubt that 
per cent of all public school children belong in the cla 
of the mentally deficient!” (Maria Dean), and that t! 
“Binet-Simon scale . . . has given an accurate clas 
fication of their cases, which is fundamental for all s 
cial-class work,” and that, as stated at the last ann 
meeting of the National Conference of Charities and C 
rection by a Pennsylvania field worker who had 
trained in an institution to administer this scale and w| 
essayed to diagnose feeble-mindedness automatically 
means of it, 98% of unmarried mothers are feel 
minded ! 
We must conclude, therefore, that, no matter how val 
able the Vineland revision may be —and we do not w] 
to minimize its real value—it has not been “ mat! 
matically demonstrated” that it is a “marvel of 
curacy ” and that it will “tell us to a nicety just w! 
a child stands in his mental capacity.” All we are ju 
fied in saying is that it possesses a fair degree of accur:

and that it is of considerable value for the estimation of 
the intelligence level — in fact, of very high value in spite 
of its imperfections, provided it is legitimately used (that 
is, as an aid in mental diagnosis but not as an automatic 
mental diagnosticon). The scale is still susceptible of a 
very marked degree of improvement, both in the reloca- 
tion of some of the tests, and in the substitution of better 
tests for the many poor tests which it still contains. The 
very age standards which have been made crucial in the 
diagnosis of feeble-mindedness in older adolescent and 
ladult criminals and prostitutes — ages X, XI, and XII 
(and all the higher ages, so far as they are used) — are 
he most inaccurate, with the possible exception of the 
lowest ages.?    
   
       
     
     
   
     
    
    
  
    
       
       
   Question 4 
But more important perhaps than the question of the 
ccuracy of the Binet scale is the question concerning the 
pper age limit of feeble-mindedness. Even if the scale 
ere absolutely accurate in every age-step, this would 
furnish no proof that the boundary line between feeble- 
indedness and not feeble-mindedness comes at any given 
1In addition to the shortcomings pointed out above, we do not 
ink that the accuracy of the Binet scale can be satisfactorily demon- 
rated by the narrow range method of testing, to which we have 
ireviously referred (Experimental Studies of Mental Defectives, 1912, 
. 21f., 28f.), and which necessarily had to be followed in the Vine- 
nd testing, because of the fact that from twelve to thirty children 
ere tested in a school day even by the beginner. We hope soon to 
blish data showing wide discrepancies in the intelligence rating 
cured by narrow and wide range methods of giving the Binet-Simon 
ists. These data will help to explain why from four to six times 
large a percentage of feeble-minded children were found in the 
blic schools of Vineland as we have found in the public schools 
St. Louis. 
It should be stated that since this chapter was written the Stan- 
d revision of the scale has appeared, representing a consider- 
le amount of experimental work.

  208 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
age in the scale. The limit of feeble-mindedness is not 
determined primarily by the mere fact of the accuracy 
of a measuring scale of intelligence, but by social criteria: 
the degree of intelligence required by a person to make} 
his living and to conform to the laws and conventions of| 
the social milieu in which he finds himself. But a person’s 
social and industrial competency is by no means solely 
dependent upon his degree of intelligence, or mental de 
velopment. Nevertheless, in so far as it is dependen’ 
upon “ mental age,” the minimal mental level requisite t 
the minimum socio-industrial competency needed for ac 
ceptable participation in the activities of the communit; 
can only be determined by practical socio-industrial test: 
—that is, by criteria external to the measuring scal 
of intelligence itself. We must determine independent] 
the minimal mental age needed for a minimal degree o} 
acceptable socio-industrial competency in different envi 
ronments (assuming that this can be done). But onc 
this has been determined, it will then be of the utmost i 
portance to devise a scale of tests which shall be max: 
mally accurate in every age-step or in all of its units. 
The widespread adoption of a definite upper age lim 
of feeble-mindedness growing out of the use of the Bin 
age scale is apparently due to Goddard, who in 1910 
recommended a scheme of classification of the feebl 
minded to the American Association for the Study of t 
Feeble-Minded, according to which the upper limit 
feeble-mindedness was placed between the ages of twel 
and thirteen (obviously according to the Binet rating| 
and according to which persons arrested at the age of t

are declared to be middle-grade morons and those arrested 
at eleven or twelve high-grade morons, meaning by mo- 
rons persons who are feeble-minded. The recommenda- 
tion to fix arbitrarily the upper limit of feeble-mindedness 
between the ages of twelve and thirteen was “ tentatively ” 
adopted by the association. According to a verbal re- 
port of what transpired at the meeting — the published 
report is silent upon the question — the recommendation 
was adopted purely as an arbitrary convention without a 
thorough sifting by the Association of the evidence as 
to its essential correctness. Nor did Goddard in his 
aper present any experimental or objective proofs of 
he validity of his XII-year standard, nor has any one 
Ise, so far as I am aware, presented any such proof. 
uey says that “The upper limit of feeble-mindedness 
as placed at twelve years of mental age because observa- 
ion and test, agreeing completely at Vineland and at 
incoln, showed that children of any higher intelligence 
re able to ‘float’ in society and insist on doing so. 
hey manage to keep out of the institutions or to get 
ut when placed in them. In France the defectives 
float’? at a still lower level; and indeed it will be seen

    on. 
Unfortunately neither Huey nor Goddard has ever 
resented any proofs based either on valid “ observation ” 
conclusive “test”? that persons of less than mental 
e thirteen cannot “float” in society, for neither has 
blished any extended experimental studies of the men- 
lities of persons not in institutions who are just able

  210 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
to float in society. It is probable, therefore, that the 
said test simply amounted to the observation that some 
inmates were found in these institutions who graded as 
high as age XII but not age XIII by the Binet (1908) 
scale, since there was no other method by means of which| 
to estimate their mental age. That this evidence does| 
not demonstrate that the upper limit of feeble-mindedness| 
extends to and includes age twelve, follows from the fol- 
lowing considerations. First, as has been shown, Bine 
XII is not equivalent to age twelve. Second, the fac 
that 12-year-old mentalities get into the institutions fo: 
the feeble-minded does not conclusively demonstrate tha 
they are therefore feeble-minded. Backward persons ge 
into these institutions just as persons not insane some 
times get committed to the hospitals for the insane. Per 
sons with bodily infirmities and mental disorders, who ar 
not feeble-minded, are sometimes sent to the institution: 
for the feeble-minded. This argument is just as lackin, 
in cogency as the parallel argument, frequently advance 
that a child has been properly placed in a special clas 
for the feeble-minded simply because it has been found im| 
possible to restore him to grade. But this does not prov 
that the child is feeble-minded. At most it only prove 
that he is backward. There are types and degrees 
backwardness which are just as irremediable as feebl 
mindedness, although the backward children can 
brought nearer to the normal standards: the difference 
essentially quantitative. There are no pathognomon: 
signs by which we can infallibly differentiate the one co 
dition from the other. The laws of heredity governi 
the transmission of backwardness (the hereditary typ 
are probably just the same as those governing the tran: 
mission of hereditary feeble-mindedness. *

Third, the number of persons with a XII-year mental- 
ity sent to institutions for the feeble-minded is quite neg- 
ligible, if we may judge by the figures given on page 35. 
Even in the private school at Vineland, where the attempt 
is made to attract high-grade cases, only about 6.8% of 
the inmates rank even above IX years in mentality. It 
is evident that, because we find a few XII-year mentalities 
lin the institutions, we are not therefore justified in draw- 
ing the sweeping conclusion that the upper limen of feeble- 
indedness extends to the age of thirteen. In fact, 
ourth, the chief method of determining where the upper 
imen of feeble-mindedness comes is to ascertain the men- 
al status of the persons at large in society who are mak- 
ng their living and who are conducting themselves in con- 
ormity with the laws and conventions of society, although 
hey have had meager educational advantages and are 
nown not to be bright mentally. In other words, in or- 
ler to determine the minimal mental level necessary to get 
long in society without external support we should study 
ot primarily the distinctly abnormal, pathological ma- 
rial in the institutions, but the material in society which 
“making good” although it may not be absolutely 
lormal. Reference will presently be made to a limited 
udy of this sort. 
It has indeed been asserted that Binet and Simon 
ached the conclusion that the upper limen of feeble- 
indedness comes between the mental ages of twelve and 
irteen, and that these mental ages can be unequivocally 
certained by their scale of intelligence tests; and that 
e American investigators were simply carrying over to 
erican conditions standards which had been demon- 
rated to be correct for the French people. If this is 
e, it is reasonable to suppose that Binet and Simon 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
  212 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
would have taken special pains clearly to enunciate the 
standards in the one place where we have a right to expect 
that they would supply the necessary rules for applying 
their tests for diagnostic purposes; namely, ‘in the test 
scales themselves. But what are the facts? 
The only reference to any definite upper limen of feeble- 
mindedness in the 1905 scale is the following tentative 
statement: “Lastly we have noticed that children of 
twelve years can mostly reply to abstract questions. We 
limit provisionally mental defect at this point.” This 
provisional statement evidently furnished the cue for the} 
American writers. But the French investigators supply 
no experimental facts in proof of their hypothesis. Wha 
is more, the 1905 scale was not even arranged into age 
steps, so that evidently the hypothesis was not proved b 
the application of the 1905 tests. Moreover, the dat 
published for these tests are based on surprisingly fe 
numbers of children, five or ten school children in some o: 
the ages from “ three to twelve,” and “ about thirty ” in. 
stitutional cases, while the testing, we are led to believ 
from a later statement, did not extend over a very wid 
range of graded tests: ‘ As a whole we have economize 
our work, doing only what was necessary to establish th| 
intellectual level of each child and not concerning ou 
selves deeply with the manner in which each test is co 
prehended by children of all ages.” 
The 1908 scale does not even refer to the XII-ye: 
standard. But the following statement is significan 
“ We hope that we are not dangerously precise in admi 
ting that the six preceding tests (arrangement of weight 
comprehension of questions, sentence with three suppli 
words, definition of abstract terms, interpretation of pi 
tures and rhymes) will apprehend all feeble-mind
-P-A-G-E-229
        
     
   
                              
        
                  
       
       
       
            WHO IS FEEBLE-MINDED? 218 
idults,t and that one who can pass the majority of them, 
yr at least four, is normal.” On this standard a person 
esting 10.8 would be normal. It should be noted that 
hree years later, in the 1911 scale, four of these six tests 
vere advanced from one to three years. Moreover, the 
statement is specifically made that the limit which “ sepa- 
rates debility from the normal state” is “not fixed but 
variable according to circumstances.” 
The 1911 scale, again, is completely silent on the ques- 
ion of the XII-year standard. Not only so, the 1911 
scale makes it practically impossible to determine whether 
or not an individual possesses a XII-year mentality, for 
she boundary ages of XI and XIII have been eliminated, 
vhile no further experimental testing on a large scale was 
indertaken to perfect the XIl-year tests — unless, in- 
leed, we are ready to follow the authors in the belief which 
they sometimes express, that the grade of intellectual 
Jefect can be determined by a single test, a view, how- 
ver, which at other times they emphatically reject.2 The 
1This in spite of the fact that the authors have assured us that 
lhey “have studied only the morons of from eight to thirteen years, 
juch as one finds in the schools. It is to these alone that our process 
pplies.” “The measuring scale that we present is designed only for 
lhildren of school age.” “Our principal conclusion is that we 
ctually possess an instrument which allows us to measure the intel- 
ctual development of young children whose age is included between 
ree and twelve years.” ‘The further reservation is made that “ It is 
derstood that these diagnoses apply only to the present moment.” 
2 It would be easy to point out glaring inconsistencies in the various 
ritings of Binet and Simon. Thus, to illustrate the point made 
ove, we are assured that mental defect can be determined by a 
ingle test or only a few tests: “When a subnormal, or a child sus- 
‘ted of being such, is questioned, it is not necessary to follow the 
act order of the tests. A little practice enables one to cut short, 
id put the finger upon the decisive test” (italics ours). Speaking 
Delai: “She cannot repeat a single sentence nor indicate the dif- 
rence between two objects. One sees at once her place.” Imbecility 
n be distinguished from debility (the highest grade of feeble- 
indedness) “by the test of reasoned comparisons.” Later we are

  above facts render it certain, we believe, that Binet anc 
Simon did not regard the XII-year standard as crucial — 
a conclusion corroborated by a later statement fron 
Simon which we shall quote presently. 
told that the reading test serves as the borderline between these tw 
states. “The series of abstract questions . .. alone would be suf 
ficient to characterize him (Martin, a débile), and so definitely tha 
other tests seem superfluous.” “Five tests will suffice to establis! 
subdivisions ” of the débiles. “If our divisions and tests are adopted 
the rank and intellectual development of each subject can be fixe 
with great precision”—this before the age-gradation method ha 
been evolved. “One can resort to a more rapid method, which con 
sists in starting the child on the tests appropriate for his age; if h 
fails, his retardation is, in a way, instantly manifest. This investiga 
tion takes only five minutes.” (We shall show in future the injustic 
frequently done to the child by this short-range method of testing. 
The experimenter’ “must be entirely convinced that by using thi 
method (the 1908 scale), he will be able by it alone to obtain : 
thorough knowledge of the child without depending on any outsid 
help ”—a confidence that has, no doubt, inspired many of the eas; 
diagnoses made solely by the scale,—but the authors were late 
forced to acknowledge that many of the 1908 age-standards wer 
inaccurate. “If one wishes to know summarily whether a child ha 
the intelligence of his age, or if he is advanced or retarded, it suffice 
to have him take the tests of his age.” 
But quite in contrast with the sanguine views recorded above ar 
the following opinions: “We note this fact as a warning... . I 
spite of the system of annotation which we have devised, we think i 
the duty of the experimenter to judge, weigh, and examine the replies 
Our method is not an automatic weighing machine like those in rail 
way stations, which register automatically the weight of a persor 
without intervention or assistance.” “It requires some originality t 
operate” the method. “The results of our examination have no valu 
if deprived of all comment; they need to be interpreted.” “In spit 
of all this precision . . . the process must be used with intelligence, 
“Tt is necessary, then, to abandon the idea that a method of investi 
gation can be made precise enough to be entrusted to the first come 
Every scientific process is a scientific instrument which needs to 
directed by an intelligent hand.” “We conclude that we can dete 
mine the intellectual level of a child only by the sum total of all 
tests.” “We are so convinced of it that we consider it chimerical a 
absurd to judge the intelligence of a child on any single test.” “Or 
test signifies nothing, let us emphatically repeat, but five or six tes 
signify something.” “ Evidently, let us say it in the most emphati 
manner, our test of intelligence will not suffice to know absolute! 
that a child is subnormal.”          
  
-P-A-G-E-231
WHO IS FEEBLE-MINDED? 215 
We conclude, therefore, that the XII-year standard 
as been adopted merely upon hypothetical grounds, and 
et innumerable social and scholastic misfits of every de- 
cription have been diagnosed as feeble-minded on the 
asis of this standard, While this standard has been 
ry widely followed, and still is followed, it is evident 
‘om the résumé on pages 123 to 188, that some examiners 
ve felt that they are on uncertain ground, and have 
gun to break away from the XII-year Moloch. Some 
ve begun to draw the line at XI, or even lower, while 
hers confessedly hedge between various suppositions. 
If, then, the XII-year standard is doomed, where shall 
place the upper boundary line of feeble-mindedness? 
rsonally I have been quite dubious of the propriety of 
empting to draw an inflexible line at any fixed age, be- 
luse a degree of mental enfeeblement which might be re- 
ded as feeble-mindedness in one person might possibly, 
h equal propriety, be regarded only as backwardness 
borderlinity in another person. The diagnosis would 
end more or less upon the attendant complications. 
jus we might be justified, for all practical purposes, in 
arding an adult epileptic with an XI-year mentality as 
le-minded, while we would not be justified in so re-

tional Society, Binet’s associate, Simon, made these state 
ments: “We mean by the term ‘idiot’ an individus 
whose intellectual development is that of 2 years or unde1 
We mean by the term ‘ imbecile’ an individual whose ii 
tellectual development corresponds to that_of a child b 
tween the ages of 3 and7 years. And finally by the ter 
‘ feeble-minded ’ (débile) we mean an individual whose it 
tellectual level, while superior to that of a child of 
years, is nevertheless below the average development of 
adult. This latter degree of development, as I have sai 
is still inadequately determined. Provisionally it mig] 
be proposed to fix at 9 years the upper level of mental d| 
bility. . . . A development equivalent to the normal a 
erage at 9 years of age is the minimum below which t 
individual is capable of getting along without tutelage 
the conditions of modern life. . . . Nine years is the jj 
tellectual level found in the lowest class of domestic se 
ants, in those who are just on the border of a possil 
existence of economic independence; it is, on the ot 
hand, the highest level met with in general paralytics w 
come under asylum care on account of their dement 
[Our paralytics average 9.8, based on the highest 
passed, p. 159.] ‘The level of intelligence in the m 
highly developed asylum cases of congenital def, 
does not exceed that of normal children of 9 years 
age.” a 
Upon reading these words in June, 1915, I immedia'

d in various public demonstration clinics were not in- 
uded). The diagnoses of the Pittsburgh cases were 
ade between April, 1912, and June 1, 1914. The orig- 
als are on file in the university clinic. The diagnoses 
the St. Louis cases were made between September, 1914, 
d June, 1915. All of these cases, therefore, were diag- 
sed before I had had access to Simon’s article. In mak- 
ig these diagnoses I did not consciously follow any 
finite upper-age-threshold of feeble-mindedness because, 
already indicated, of uncertainty as to where this line 
ould be drawn or as to whether it was feasible to draw 
y line at all at a definite point. I merely attempted, 
h the caution and conservatism which is required in all 
es of mental and physical diagnosis, to review the cases 
the light of all the facts brought to light by a study 
uiring, in the aggregate, from two to four hours of 
or on each case, 
he results of the analysis caused me no little surprise. 
ppeared that the standard which I had been following 
ctically coincided with Simon’s.1 Of the 362 con- 
tive Pittsburgh cases only 9 were diagnosed as feeble- 
ded with a mentality in excess of IX years (7 X-year- 
and 2 XI-year-olds), which is 2.4% of all the cases 
ined, or 10.4% of all the cases diagnosed as feeble- 
ded and 18.7% of all the cases diagnosed as morons. 
eover, only 20 cases diagnosed as “ borderline” had 
entality of from X to XII (12 X-year-olds, 7 XI- 
-olds, and 1 XII-year-old), which is 5.5% of all the 
it should be mentioned that the above diagnoses were based on 
wn, Guide for the 1908 scale. The age-rating by the 1911 scale 
have been slightly lower, as indicated in Tables XI, XII, and 
. We are elsewhere publishing a more detailed comparison of 
lesults obtained by the 1908 and 1911 scales.

cases examined and 45% of all the borderline cases. Or 
the other hand, 64 cases diagnosed as backward had men

Only 14 cases were diagnosed as borderline with me 
talities of from X to XIII (12 X-year-olds, 1 XI-yea 
old, and 1 XIII-year-old), which is 3.25% of all the cas 
examined and 28.57% of all the cases diagnosed as bo} 
derline. On the other hand, 57 cases diagnosed as bac 
ward had mentalities from X to XII (36 X, 20 XI, an 
XII), which is 18.2% of all the cases and 41% of all t 
backward cases. The combined statistics (792 case 
thus give 13 cases diagnosed as feeble-minded with a m 
tality of X years or more, which is 1.64% of all the ca: 
examined, or 6.19% of all diagnosed as feeble-minded a 
11.60% of all diagnosed as morons; 34 cases diagno 
as borderline with a mentality of X years or above, wh 
is 4.29% of all the cases examined and 36.55% of all 
borderline cases; and 121 cases diagnosed as backwa 
which is 15.2% of all the cases and 45.48% of all 
backward cases. In other words, the number of pers 
with a mentality of X years or more whom I have 
nounced feeble-minded amounts to the negligible figur 
1.6%. 
My own results, therefore, in agreement with Si 
suggest that the upper threshold of feeble-minded: 
comes somewhere near the tenth year, as determined 
the B.-S. scale. I have sought to corroborate this re|

rom the literature and from an experimental study whose 
urpose was to test the legitimacy of the XII-year hy- 
othesis when applied to persons at large in society who 
d demonstrated their capacity to cope with their social 
d industrial obligations. : 
I find a reference antedating Simon’s to the [X-year 
andard, the import of which had not fully dawned on 
when first reading the translation of Stern’s Psycho- 
ical Methods of Testing Intelligence. In the course of 
discussion of the intelligence quotient Stern? makes 
is pregnant remark: “The quotient ... shows a 
dency to fall in value as age increases. This tendency, 
is evident, is but slight within the limits of age that 
ve been mentioned, so that for many problems it can be 
lected. Before and after these ages the fall in the 
ue seems to take place more rapidly. In the case of 
later age-levels this is easily intelligible, for once the 
ge of arrest that we have previously discussed is 
ched (for morons at the mental age of 9), the quotient 
ained by dividing mental by chronological age must 
ease as chronological age increases.” Here we are 
rly told that the “stage of arrest . . . for morons ” 
eached “ at the mental age of 9.” 
tern also cites Binet as holding “that the imbecile 
not progress beyond the mental age of seven, the 
on (the feeble-minded in the narrow sense) beyond 
mental age of nine.” Stern evidently added the par- 
etical clause to indicate that the term “ moron” has 
ifferent connotation in French usage. One or two 
les written jointly by Binet and Simon indeed show 
fluence of the American recommendations to extend 
limit beyond nine, but the statement quoted from

Simon may be presumed to supersede the joint statement: 
since it was made later. 
In giving the results of the examination of 195 childrer 
Porter, Huffaker, and Ritter! state that the “ moron 
are such high-grade feeble-minded as never at any a 
acquire a mental age greater than 10 years.” All exce; 
one of Hill’s morons had a mentality of less than 9 
among his 63 delinquent and destitute boys. M. Hambl 
Smith examined 80 consecutive male and 80 consecuti 
female adult prisoners. Of the 64 classified as non-feeb: 
minded 21 did not reach a mentality of X years, and 
these 3 failed to reach IX. None of his feeble-mind| 
succeeded in the X-year group, while only 23% pass 
all the tests in the [X-year group. “I have found ve 
marked deficiency in intelligence in subjects whom I 
sure no observer would think of calling feeble-mind 
still less of recommending their detention as mental 
fectives.”? According to Cornell “ the high grade fee 
minded as a rule stick fast ” in “ the third school grad 
. . . “The third grade very largely corresponds as a 
to the ninth-year Binet test, and the great majority 
high-grade feeble-minded children, eleven or more year 
age, with exceptions either way, test nine years plus 
the Binet and coincidentally with third grade in sc 
work.” 3

erely a demand for logical consistency. 
If we are justified in pronouncing older-adolescent or 
ult prostitutes, murderers, or criminals (or grade and 
th school retardates) as feeble-minded on the basis of an 
bitrary intelligence standard, then, by a parity of rea- 
ing, we must be equally ready to call law-abiding, re- 
lectable, and successful farmers, laborers, or business 
n, Who have had no more school training than most 
stitutes and criminals are claimed to have had, feeble- 
ded on precisely the same standards. The logic of 
ls conclusion seems to us to be inescapable. If we are 
tified in branding every X-, XI-, or XII-year-old 
stitute of limited scholastic training as feeble-minded 
use of intelligence deficiency, logical consistency de- 
ds that we so brand every successful X-, XI-, or XII- 
r-old housewife of limited scholastic training. If we 
justified in branding every X-, XI-, and XII-year-old 
derer, robber, or thief of limited scholastic training 
‘eeble-minded, common fairness demands that we brand 
'y X-, XI-, or XII-year-old successful farmer, laborer, 
usiness man of limited scholastic training as feeble- 
ed. We cannot consider every X-, XI-, and XII- 
-old criminal as feeble-minded because they happen 
le criminals and refuse to consider X-, XI-, and XII- 
-old housewives, farmers, laborers, and merchants as 
le-minded simply because they are law-abiding and 
ssful. If the rule works in the one case it must work

During a brief visit in the state of Iowa I had occasic 
to study a few successful farmers, a business man, and 
housewife. Each subject was given all the 1908 and 19 
Binet-Simon tests above age IX, except the opposites t 
(Subject F, however, was given all the tests above a 
VIII). The 1908 scale was administered according 
my own Guide+ and the 1911 according to Goddar 
version, which is usually used in this country for diagn 
ing feeble-mindedness. The subjects were generou 
rated in the tests; ie. full credit was given for so 
responses that did not quite meet the technical pass 
requirements. Moreover, in order to do the subjects 
justice by the scale, the fifteen-year and adult tests w 
included. This made it possible for some subjects to r 
slightly higher than they would otherwise have d

munities of the country, socially and industrially

imagination be considered feeble-minded. Not a si 
one has any sort of record of delinquency, or crime, p:

sition, all high-school graduates and all except one one- 
e students in colleges and universities.

This man, measured by the automatic standards whic] 
have been commonly followed, would be hopelessly feebl 
minded and should have been committed to an instituti 
for the feeble-minded long ago as a “ mental defective. 
But is there any one who has the temerity, in spite 
the Binet “ proof,” to maintain, in view of this ma 
personal, social, and commercial record, and the record 
his family, that he has been a social and mental mis: 
and an undesirable citizen, and should, therefore, ha 
been restrained from propagation because of mental 
ficiency (his wife is still less intelligent)? It is a s 
guess that there are hundreds of thousands like h 
throughout the country, no more intelligent and equa 
successful and prudent in the management of their affai:

n eminently successful farmer and respectable citizen, 
ith no vices (except the use of tobacco), had committed 
crime and had been examined at the order of the court, 
ir if he had been the father of a feeble-minded child, those 
ho diagnose by rule-of-thumb on the basis of assump- 
ons, would immediately have pronounced him “ unques- 
onably feeble-minded ” and recommended his lifelong 
mmitment to a colony for mental defectives at the ex- 
mse of the state. In the light of a record of successful 
ing, unquestioned in the community where he lives, who 
ll venture to brand this man feeble-minded, in the tech- 
cal meaning of the word? 
It thus appears that, according to the arbitrary and 
pothetical B.-S. XIII-year standard of normality, every 
e of the above individuals would be feeble-minded. Ac- 
rding to life’s crucial test of economic and social suc- 
s not a single one could be regarded as feeble-minded.

other four girls were admitted to the college without ex 
amination on the strength of their high-school record 
(those ranking in the upper two-thirds are admitted wit 
out examination), while the boy has always been excuse 
from written examinations in the high school on t# 
strength of his daily class record. All these subjec 
would be rated as superior students with possibly one e

In the age rating by the 1911 scale I have followed li 
erally the rule that “ all questions under any age must 
answered to pass that age,” and “a year is added to t 
intelligence age, if he has succeeded in passing five ad 
tional tests belonging to superior age groups.” It is, 
course, quite inadmissible to apply such a rule to t 
upper part of the scale— which indeed has been rec 
nized — owing to the fact that no tests are supplied f| 
ages XIII and XIV, but the fact is that the rule has b 
constantly thus applied in practice by many of those w 
have diagnosed adolescent and adult delinquents by 
1911 scale. We are trying to determine how a gro 
of well-schooled adolescents, whose mental status is 
questioned, will grade when diagnosed by exactly the saj 
standards which have been used in diagnosing delinque 
and assumed defectives.

Attention may now be called to a few general facts. 
1. Not a single subject passed all the individual Bin| 
tests. The average number of failures per subject in t 
student group was 4.8 and 12.3 in the group of poo 
schooled subjects. Whether the students’ superiority 
due to better and more extended schooling or better nati

    intelligence cannot be determined with certainty from our 
ata. But the results at least suggest that the factor 
f schooling’ cannot be ignored in estimating the intelli- 
ence age. 
2. All the subjects except one in the poorly schooled 
roup and possibly all except two in the student group 
aded higher by the 1908 scale according to my Guide 
han by the 1911 scale according to Goddard’s revision. 
his confirms a conclusion previously reached from varied 
linical experience, that the 1908 scale grades more ac- 
urately and fairly in the upper years than the 1911 
ale, at least so far as Goddard’s version is concerned.* 
follows that the 1911 scale throws more people into the 
eble-minded category than the 1908 scale.? 
8. Every one of the subjects in the poorly schooled 
oup graded feeble-minded by both the 1908 and the 
11 scales on the basis of the assumed Binet XII-year 
per limen of feeble-mindedness or on the basis of XIII 
ars as the lower limit of “ normality.” It has been ob- 
cted that Mr. A and Mrs. B were in their “ dotage.” 
lhe fact is, if Mr. A or Mrs. B had demented, the degree 
dementia was so slight as to be scarcely perceptible to 
e who has known them for years. Neither had ad- 
inced “into dotage,” nor even into near-dotage. Even 
we assume that these two persons had demented, we 
ve all the more reason to assume that criminals of equal 
who have been diagnosed as feeble-minded by the B.-S. 
le had also demented. However, if we exclude these 
Below the age of X the 1911 scale appears, from a comparison 
in progress, to grade more accurately. 
Elsewhere we have shown that the so-called 1913 “improved 
” of the scale relegates still more to the feeble-minded status.

two subjects all the rest would still be feeble-minded by 
the XII-year standard. Moreover, on the basis of the 
intelligence quotient and the accepted quotient standard 
of feeble-mindedness,* all except one would still be feeble- 
minded even if we only use age 16 as the maximum divisor. 
As we shall see later, there seems to be no justification for| 
using age 16 or any other arbitrary age as the maximum 
divisor. By the 1908 scale three of the students rate a 
feeble-minded when the advanced credits are counted fro 
the lower base of rating, while no one rates as feeble 
minded when the rating is based on the highest age passe 
irrespective of failures in lower age levels. On the othe 
hand, by the 1911 scale all the students except one woul 
be rated as feeble-minded when the rating begins with th 
lower base, while all except two would be feeble-minde 
when the rating begins with the upper base. Only tw 
possess the indispensable “ three-quarters intelligence.” 
By the usually accepted arbitrary standard four of th 
students would be high-grade morons, although all excep| 
two have been found by years of testing in the schools t 
be superior to the average in scholastic ability. 
: If we are not justified in regarding the above la’ 
abiding and successful adult citizens as feeble-minded, 
to say nothing of the students,— what justification wou 
there be in so regarding the following malefactor, w 
grades higher by the Binet than half of the above poor! 
schooled individuals?

    life of moral degradation toward which she was headed. 
Examination of the prisoner showed that he had had 
about one year of schooling, that he did fourth to fifth 
grade work in spelling and third to fourth grade work in 
eading and arithmetic. His B.-S. rating was 11.2. He 
raded about 10 years mentally by the modified Seguin 
orm-board, but did the more difficult of the Healy con- 
truction boards. Testimony was offered before the 
ourt to the effect that the prisoner was possessed of an 
infantile type of mind, that he was subnormal but not 
eeble-minded, and that, so far as intelligence was con- 
erned, he was able to distinguish between right and wrong 
nd correctly to judge the quality of his acts.‘ Three 
eurologists and psychopathologists by whom he was ex- 
mined also concurred in the opinion that he was men- 
lly inferior but not feeble-minded and that he was able 
judge the quality of his acts. The jury took the 
round that the intellectual defect was not sufficient to 
nder this criminal irresponsible, and other juries have, I 
lieve, invariably taken precisely the same stand with 
spect to XI-year B.-S. mentalities.2 The question nat- 
ally arises: What greater justification would there be 
x freeing XI-year criminals from responsibility for their 
iminal acts than for freeing XI-year successful farmers, 
borers, and merchants from responsibility for their acts, 
ether legal or illegal? 
There were other factors of a serious nature affecting this case 
ich seemed to justify the opinion that he was irresponsible at the 
e when he committed the crime. 
Thus the following request of the defendant in a murder case was 
fused by the Court: “Defendant requests your Honor to charge 
jury that if it finds that the defendant is of a mental age of under 
‘Ive years, he is presumed to be incapable of crime and that pre- 
ption is not removed by proof that he had sufficient capacity to 
lerstand the act charged against him and know its wrongfulness.”

The inferences to be drawn from the examination of 
these successful groups of poorly schooled adults anc 
well-schooled adolescents are thus in complete harmon. 
with the conclusions reached from an analysis of thi 
classification of our clinic cases and with the conclusion: 
reached by the authorities whom we have cited. Certain 
the mere fact that an older adolescent or adult canno 
pass Binet XI or XII does not prove that he is feebl 
minded. In fact, the presumption amounts almost to 
certainty that he is not feeble-minded in the sense thi 
his intelligence is so defective that he is unable to ta 
care of himself or earn his living. The number of pe 
sons with a mentality of XI and over who can be legit| 
mately diagnosed as feeble-minded constitutes, we believ, 
an entirely negligible quantity. If these conclusions a 
correct, it is evident that we must abandon the concept 
the high-grade moron as determined by the present B.- 
standards. 
Nor are we justified in saying that all adults and old} 
adolescents who have stagnated on the B.-S. X-year le 
are feeble-minded. Before such a conclusion can be c 
sidered as scientifically established, we must prove t 
all persons in different communities who are not regar 
as bright and who have had meager educational adv: 
tages but who have made a success in manual labor, ind 
try, agriculture, or business invariably grade above 
years mentally. Until this has been shown we can: 
dogmatize about all X-year-olds being “ middle-grade 
rons.” It must first be shown that there is not availa 
in practically every community some necessary types 
work that can be successfully done by Binet X-year-o! 
and that these X-year-olds cannot live within the so 
requirements of the communities. There are undoubt

WHO IS FEEBLE-MINDED? 235 
some individuals with mentalities of KX whom we may 
legitimately classify as feeble-minded, but these cases very 
robably constitute only a small percentage of the total 
eeble-minded population. Most “ middle-grade ” morons 
hould be classed as backward or borderline.t It is prob- 
ble that there are X-year persons whom we are justified 
classing as socially weak — or sociopathic, to borrow 
ickson’s term— rather than feeble-minded. It should 
e emphasized that feeble-mindedness is only one cause of 
cial weakness, incompetency, and irresponsibility. 
Admissions made by Goddard himself tend to support 
x conclusions regarding the higher B.-S. mentalities. 
the original article he tells us that “ in the eleven-year- 
id group we find only five individuals, but they contain 
ildren who for example can care for the supervisor’s 
om entirely, can take care of animals entirely satis- 
ctorily, and who require little or no supervision. .. . 
ere are only seven who grade twelve years of age, but 
ong these seven are those who can, for example, weigh 
t various groceries, use machinery of various kinds, do 
usework as well as anybody can do it, and who require 
actically no supervision in doing the things that they 
ve been taught to do.” Let us say incidentally that 
generalization regarding the capacities of XI- and 
I-year-olds, even for institutional cases under 21, given 
the Vineland industrial classification prepared in 1910 
reproduced in Feeble-Mindedness (p. 581), can 
rcely be justified on the basis of 12 cases: “ mental 
11, fairly complicated work with occasional oversight ; 
tal age 12, uses machinery, can care for animals, no 
ervision for routine work, cannot plan.” Our non-     
        
      
       
    
   
   
     
        
   
     
   
     
   in the other hand, the concept of the VIII- and I[X-year morons 
ears to me to be very serviceable.
-P-A-G-E-252
  236 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
institutional individuals, who, however, were adults, of 
from X to XII were quite able to “ plan.” 
In his later utterance Goddard goes further still:+ 
“ May it not be possible that we will find use for all thes 
people of moderate intelligence, and that the productio: 
of so many high-grade feeble-minded is only the produc: 
tion of so many more people who are able and willing t 
do much of the drudgery of the world, which other peopl 
will not do?” 
We agree entirely with this conclusion if by “ high 
grade feeble-minded” is meant older adolescents an 
adults who cannot go beyond Binet XI, or even beyon 
the X-year step, for we have found adults who were i 
their prime who did not exceed these mentalities and wh 
were not only capable of drudgery but who were able t 
manage their own affairs, make a living, raise families 
normal children, and contribute to the world’s civilizatio: 
On the basis of the ultimate test, socio-industrial comp 
tency, we cannot regard these individuals as other tha} 
dull or backward, the Binet mentalities notwithstanding. 
      
         
     
    
    
     
       
    
   
     If, therefore, we concede, as I believe we must, that 
cannot classify older adolescents and adults as feebl: 
minded simply because they have not gone beyond Bin 
X (even though they may be delinquent), what becom 
of the huge compilations of feeble-mindedness which ha 
been based on this assumption? It is impossible satisfa| 
torily to answer this question by an adequate analysis 
the published data, because the vast majority of the wr: 
ers have, as has already been noted, withheld the fa 
essential for the analysis. Only a few writers of th

reviewed have disclosed how many XI-year-olds, and fewer 
still how many X-year-olds, have been classified as feeble- 
minded, while many have maintained a sphinx-like silence 
lin respect to the age standards which they may have fol- 
lowed. However, it is possible to make the comparisons 
hich follow. Of course, we do not hold that the reduced 
igures give absolutely true values, which could only be 
btained from a careful clinical examination, but it is 
robable that the reduced values are more correct than 
he original estimates based on the arbitrary conventional 
tandards. 
Excluding the 81% who grade between X and XII re- 
luces the percentage of feeble-mindedness found in the 
letention home of the juvenile court, Columbus, Ohio, from 
6% to 15%, a figure probably more nearly approximat- 
g the truth. 
By excluding those grading between X and XII, the 
ree classified as normal and the two- and three-year re- 
rdates, the number of feeble-minded “ determined with 
ientific accuracy,” in the Manchester, New Hampshire, 
dustrial School drops from 81.6% to 42.1%. Even if 
permit the three-year-olds to be considered feeble- 
inded, the figure remains at 45.5%, a figure not improb- 
ly larger than the real facts warrant. 
By excluding the X-year mentalities the percentage of 
leged feeble-mindedness in the Girls’ Reformatory of 
io will be reduced 48%, from 77% (3-year retardates) 
29%. Including as feeble-minded the younger girls 
o “pass something less than four years backwardness 
their mental age is less than X,” the figure must still 
reduced by 41%, and, excluding the XI-year mentali- 
, by 28%.

declared feeble-minded by B.-S. tests in the New York 
State Reformatory for Women, the per cent would be 
reduced from 100 to 80. If the X-year-olds (the number 
of which is not given) were excluded, the reduction would 
be very much greater, as the average mental age of th 
group was 10.05. 
Excluding the 36% of “higher-grade moronity ’ 
(which corresponds to the number of X-year-olds), th 
number of prostitutes examined in houses of assignatio: 
in Albany, New York, and declared feeble-minded woul 
be reduced considerably more than half, from 56% t 
20%. 
By not considering the X- and XI-year-olds as feebl 
minded, the percentage of feeble-mindedness among prost| 
tutes reported by the Massachusetts Commission for t 
Investigation of the White Slave Traffic will be cut 
half, 25.67% instead of 51%. 
The estimate (based, however, on measurements of t 
Stanford revision) of the “definitely feeble-minded ” 
the Whittier State School, California, is reduced fr 
28% to 2.2% when the per cent classified as “high ” a: 
“middle” grade morons are eliminated, assuming t! 
these classifications refer to mentalities ranging from 
to XII years—a figure, however, which probably 
too low, possibly because of the greater difficulty of 
Stanford scale. 
By excluding from the feeble-minded classificat: 
mentalities of X and above, the per cent of feeble-mind| 
ness in the Chicago House of Correction is reduced fr 
65 to 26.5. If we accept Kohs’ own B.-S. upper li 
of feeble-mindedness (10.6), the figure is reduced to

    inia survey, the percentage of feeble-minded would be re- 
luced from 64 to 42 for the inebriate and criminal jail 
epeaters, and from 71.6 to 35 for the prostitutes. In 
e survey of the Massachusetts State Prison the per cent 
ould be reduced from 22 to 7.6. In the latter, however, 
e Yerkes-Bridges scale was used, which gives a higher 
ting than the B.-S. in the upper years. 
By excluding the cases with mentalities of K years and 
ove, the percentage of feeble-mindedness reported in 
e survey from the Cleveland schools is reduced from 
6 to 20.4, 
By excluding all those with mentalities from X to 
II +, and also those with mentalities of VI, VII, VIII, 
d IX who are not retarded over two years (some re- 
ded over two years should very probably also be in- 
ded), the number of feeble-minded in the Indiana Boys’ 
hool is reduced from 72% to 55%. 
It should be evident that there is a borderline zone of 
mtal capacity where the judgments of different exami- 
's will differ. Those whose standards of feeble-minded- 
s are very fluid and elastic will use a large borderline 
and will throw a large number of persons into the 
le-minded category, if they happen to be delinquent, 
le the conservative workers who are more rigid in their 
dards will use a smaller borderline zone and will dis- 
ler a large number of backward and borderline cases.

Apparently the intelligence status of the social inco 
petents was not very different from that of the co 
petents. Not only so, the average accuracy score of th 
white prisoners estimated by both the superintendent an 
the physician as socially incompetent amounted to 91 
of the efficiency of employees of the same age and schoo: 
ing in the shops of the Erie Railroad, while for the co! 
ored group the corresponding figure was 94%. Both 
the two white prisoners estimated as feeble-minded had 
Binet rating of XV, one showing exactly the same ave: 
age accuracy score as the railroad employees, while t 
other showed 76% efficiency (although superior in t 
average time). The 7 colored prisoners classified 
feeble-minded, of whom only one had a Binet rating 
low X, while 5 rated from XI to XV, showed 90% 
ciency. It is quite evident that the judgments as 
feeble-mindedness did not have even the value of intel] 
gent guesses from the standpoint of both the B.-S. rati 
and the rating in the special tests, and that intelligence 
by no means the only condition of your “ ability to t 
your place in society.”” Nor is it likely that we shall 
able wholly to eliminate the subjective element in the b 
derline region even if the mental examination is made v

   group markedly inferior to the non-delinquent group of 
the same social status or educational advantages. Bron- 
ner! administered a series of psychological tests to 
groups of delinquent girls (all sex offenders except two), 
college girls, girls attending evening classes, and girls 
engaged in domestic service, all approximately of the same 
ages. Bronner’s conclusions were: “If now we attempt 
to answer our original question, ‘ Are these thirty delin- 
uent girls so lacking in intellectual capacity that they are 
mable to earn a livelihood in legitimate vocations? ? we 
ust answer in the light of our findings, ‘ No more so than 
thers who are succeeding in doing so.’ . . . Undoubtedly 
he delinquent group, as a whole, is poor in ability, yet it 
is composed of girls who vary greatly among themselves, 
‘or the best in the group is six times as successful as the 
oorest in the group, averaging the results on the six 
eneral intelligence tests. The poorest members of the 
‘oup are very poor indeed. 
“ But the results attained by Group S (domestic serv- 
nts) show that this lack of capacity, in and of itself, 
loes not explain the fact of delinquency, for Group §, 
ough no more gifted, yet contains only members who are 
ot and have not been delinquent as far as known. 
“ Since Groups D (delinquents) and S, when compared, 
rove to be quite on a par as far as general intelligence 
concerned, we must conclude that the explanation of 
e delinquent tendencies shown by members of Group D 
elinquents) is something other than the intellectual 
latus alone. This does not mean, of course, that the

be other factors as well which cause these individuals to 
engage in careers that lead them into conflict with the 
law, while others of like mentality experience no such 
difficulties.’ One cannot “lay all the blame for de 
linquencies in behavior at the door of poor ment: 
gifts.” 
Among our St. Louis cases 89 pupils in the 1914-191 
group and 84 pupils in the 1915-1916 group were r 
ported as delinquent’ in some respect. Some of thes 
children were reported as disorderly, or unruly, or truan’ 
or given to stealing and lying or immoral practices, 
considerable number had been sent to the boys’ class b 
cause of repeated truancy, a considerable number had 
juvenile-court record, while a number had been committ 
to the city Industrial School for delinquent children. I 
order to determine to what extent the factor of ment 
deficiency might account for the delinquency of these chi 
dren, they have been classified separately in Tables XI 
and XVI. The data in these tables should be of unusu 
value to those interested in this problem, for two reason 
first, because they make it possible to compare the ment: 
status of a group of non-institutional public-school d 
linquents with a group of non-delinquent public-scho: 
children from the same environment, both of which grou 
were sent to the clinic largely for the same reaso 
namely, inability to do the school work or suspected me; 
tal deficiency. If feeble-mindedness is a prime cause 
criminality and misconduct, we should expect to find 
heightened percentage of the feeble-minded in the dis 
plinary group. (It is evident, of course, that we sho’

wide sense in which the word is here employed, although they wi 
not so reported by the principals or teachers.

          lexpect to find a larger percentage of feeble-minded chil- 
ren in our disciplinary group than would be found in any 
mselected group of delinquent children, since it is un- 
lerstood that our clinic has been established primarily 
or the examination of suspected feeble-minded pupils.) 
n the second place, both the delinquent and the non-de- 
inquent children were examined and classified by the same 
erson, using the same tests and standards of diagnosis. 
ll of the children had been classified by the examiner 
efore any attempt was made to compile the data. The 
mly difference of moment between the groups is that the 
914-1915 delinquents averaged about one year older, 
hile the 1915-1916 delinquents averaged about half a 
lear older than the pupils in Tables X and XV. As 
e shall see, this would tend to increase the percentage of 
eble-mindedness in the delinquent group in purely B.-S. 
assifications. Our diagnoses, however, as already ex- 
ained (p. 175), were not based solely on the B.-S. 
ting. 
A comparison of the tables shows that there is no sig- 
cant difference in the classification of the two groups 
x the 1914-1915 data except in the backward category. 
ong the delinquents there were 16.2% more backward 
ildren but only .8% more feeble-minded children than 
ong the pupils included in the entire group. Singu- 
ly, the percentage of normal children was somewhat 
ther (by .9%), while the percentage of imbeciles (by 
%) and morons (by 2.5% ) was lower in the delinquent 
n in the combined group. During the following year 
increases among the delinquents are again found in 
normal and retarded categories (an excess of 2.3% in 
h) and particularly in the backward (an excess of 
%) category, while there is an actual decrease in the

  244 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
feeble-minded category (amounting to 9.4%), particu- 
larly among the imbeciles (8.1%). 
It is evident, however, that, the differences ‘between the 
two groups may be somewhat lessened because the delin- 
quent cases in Tables XIV and XVI are also included i 
Tables X and XV. In Table XIX we have overcom 
this difficulty by separately classifying the 173 delin 
quent cases and the 691 non-delinquents examined fro: 
1914 to 1916.

   mindedness is higher among the worst cases of delin- 
quency, let us consider separately the classification of the 
pupils from the boys’ class and industrial school (56 
cases). Six of the ten industrial school cases (all boys) 
nd 28 of the pupils in the boys’ class were wards of the 
juvenile court. This group classified as follows: normal, 
or 8.9% § retarded, 3 or 5.8% ; backward, 27 or 48.2% 3 
orderline, 7 or 12.5% ; morons, 11 or 19.6% ; and diag- 
osis deferred, 3 or 5.8%. Compared with the whole 
roup of delinquents the percentage of normal and bor- 
erline pupils in this group is slightly higher, while the 
ercentage of retarded, backward, and feeble-minded is 
lightly smaller. There are no imbeciles among the 
worst ” cases. 
It will be of interest also to consider the distribution of 
e delinquent cases according to years of Binet-Simon 
tardation and intelligence quotients (Table XX). 
ccording to the 1908 scale 64 of the delinquents were 
entally retarded over three years, which is 37.2% of 
e 172 whose mentality was determined, while 30 were 
tarded four years and over, or 17.4% of the entire 
ber. The corresponding figures by the 1911 scale 
e 72 or 40.7%, and 40 or 22.6%. According to the 
08 scale, 62 had an intelligence quotient less than .'75, 
ich is 86% of the 172 cases, and 98 less than .70, or 
%, while the corresponding figures according to the 
11 scale are 79 or 45.9%, and 50 or 29%. It is evi- 
nt that, judged by the arbitrary 4-year rule, less than 
% of the delinquents would be feeble-minded, while the 
centage according to the arbitrary .70 quotient would 
y from 22 to 29 according to the scale used.

    schools in St. Louis and elsewhere — that it is partic 
larly the backward pupil who creates the problems o 
discipline in the schools, is in harmony with the observ 
tion of Katherine B. Davis, the former superintendent 
the New York State Reformatory for Women. She h 
called attention to the fact that it is the borderline cas 
which cause the most trouble in the institutions, 90% 
the disciplinary troubles being attributed to them. 
course, we do not wish to imply that the feeble-mind 
pupils are entirely tractable and cause no disciplinar| 
troubles. Many of them are exceedingly restless, mi 
chievous, and prone to outbreaks of temper, while so’ 
are consummate plotters of evil. And yet, it is probab! 
true that most of the feeble-minded develop delinque 
tendencies in after years, not so much because of ou 
spoken vicious proclivities as because of intellectual a: 
moral weaknesses, weak powers of inhibition, and inabili 
to resist temptation. They often become unsuspectin 
helpless, or guileless dupes of the more intelligent vultur 
who prey upon the weak. The feeble-minded as a cla 
become a social menace because of their weaknesses a 
because of environmental opportunities.* 
1Since the above was written I have found corroboration of thi 
views in Healy’s Honesty (1915). The following passages express 
own conclusions from a first-hand study of numerous disciplin 
children: “We must confess to a lack of sympathy with the hig] 
colored statements and immaturely considered statistics that h: 
been in the last few years placed before the public. The realities 
the situation are bad enough: there is no need of any propaganda 
exaggerations” (p. 121). “ Notwithstanding a general idea whic! 
abroad nowadays, that it is explanation enough for a mentally de: 
tive individual being a delinquent because he is a mental defectivi 
challenge the satisfactoriness of this explanation. . . . One would 
feel this point so strongly if one were not acquainted with cle 
feeble-minded individuals whose notions of right and wrong are q 
as well fixed, perhaps, as those of normal individuals” (p. 131).

mated might exist at about nine years, or its equivalent mental age|

    The slow, backward child is, I believe, a more aggressive 
nd intelligent trouble maker, and constitutes potentially 
greater criminal menace. Judging by our case records, 
school he is inclined to be listless and inattentive and 
fatigue easily, because the regular studies do not ap- 
eal to him. He is unstable, is inclined to be surly and is 
ibject to attacks of stubbornness. He it is rather than 
e feeble-minded child, who is the bugbear of the other 
pils whom he teases and annoys, particularly the 
unger ones, and he it is who is the despair of the 
acher whom he harasses. He is unable to compete with 
e normal and brighter pupils, and so he grows pessi- 
istic and cynical. He suffers from a certain degree of 
ral obliquity. This fact has also been noted by Pear- 
im, who made a comparative study of intelligent, dull, 
bust, and delicate children among the English profes- 
mal classes. He found that the intelligent children 
re far less sullen, far more conscientious, and more 
ust than the dull, suggesting a correlation between 
elligence and morality. The ordinary elementary 
riculum is maladjusted to the needs of the backward 
ld and does not adequately prepare him for his life 
rk, Because of this and because of his moral obtuse- 
s he tends gradually to gravitate into the ranks of the 
ial misfits and industrial incompetents, the vagabonds, 
ler-do-wells, paupers, criminals, and the immoral. We 
ctives has not been substantiated by any large observations” (p. 
... “Hence the fallacy of the notion that all individuals of nine 
tal years, as estimated by this superficial measuring scale (the 
let) or any other age, are to be conceived of as unmoral” (p. 139). 
en when the mentality of the delinquent is clearly abnormal, it 
be found that environmental factors must always be taken into 
unt” (p. 122). “We should ever insist that when considering 
the defective delinquent is what he is, one must take into account 
‘oundings as well as mental capacities, nurture as well as nature” 
140).

do not say that this is a typical picture of every backward 
child, but it is typical of a large number of them. An

    Question 5 
Absolute Standards of Mental Retardation 
Binet and Simon did not lay down any quantitativ 
standard, either absolute or relative, of the amount o| 
mental retardation necessary to constitute a perso 
feeble-minded, for no such standard is found in the o 
place where we should expect it, the guide for the fin 
revision of the scale where “those details will be give 
which it is necessary to know in order to apply t 
method.” + What Binet and Simon did was merely 
offer a tentative pedagogical basis for the prelimina 
selection of candidates for special classes: “ A retard: 
tion of three years indicates a child who should be r 
garded a suspect ” (Mentally Defective Children, 191 
p. 88). “ According to a convention accepted in B 
gium, which we modify slightly, the retardation [i. 
pedagogical retardation] which determines a child as 
defective is two years when the child is under nine, a 
three years when he is past his ninth birthday. ‘| 
method which we have just indicated permits the maki 
of a first selection . . . without being final” (p. 4 
On page 8, where the authors define feeble-mindedn 
1The only reference to standards are the following general st 
ments: “A child is advanced or retarded in intelligence if he is 1 
2 years ahead or 1 or 2 years behind his age” (p. 68, Town’s tran: 
tion). “A child should not be considered defective in intelligence} 
matter how little he knows unless his retardation of intellige| 
amounts to more than two years” (p. 69).

cording to arbitrary units of retardation, they are

cause they recommended this preliminary pedagogical 
lasis of selection, it has been argued that Binet and Simon 
Id that a child of less than 9 showing 2 years of mental 
tardation and one past his ninth birthday showing three 
ars of retardation, as determined by the B.-S. scale, 
ould be considered feeble-minded. This argument is in- 
nclusive. 
First, even if Binet and Simon considered such cases 
candidates for a special class, this does not of itself 
monstrate that they therefore regarded the children as 
tually feeble-minded. It is true that Binet and Simon 
e the position that “ none but defectives should be ad- 
tted to schools for defectives.” 1 But, as we have al- 
dy pointed out (p. 56), they practically reverse 
mselves when they later affirm that “ doubtful cases ” 
uld be admitted to the “classes for defectives” (p. 
, and “ that all decisions arrived at are to be regarded 
rovisional ; the children are to be admitted to the class 
defectives on trial, to be kept under observation ” 
86). Moreover, Binet and Simon would place in 
e classes “ ill-balanced ” or “ unstable ” children, al- 
ugh “mental deficiency” and “ mental instability ” 
“two quite independent pathological conditions ” 
19), and although the ill-balanced on the average are 
rded only about one year while some may be quite 
al (p. 17). Binet and Simon were familiar with the

. However, they do not attempt any sharp, differential defini- 
f a “defective” child. They do not indicate clearly whether the 
lective” includes the seriously backward child, or whether it is 
d to the child who is actually feeble-minded, although it is prob- 
that they refer only to the latter.

  252 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
tendency prevailing in many European cities of herdir 
together feeble-minded and backward children in the san 
classes or in the same schools (see Chapter I). 
Second, Binet and Simon expressly state that whe 
there is a conflict between the school rating and “ oth 
finer methods,” the school rating should take the pre 
dence (see quotation on page 196). They appear 
have considered “school life” as a ‘more importa| 
test ” than their intelligence scale. 
Third, Binet emphatically repudiated the hard and f 
psychological standards laid down by some of his foll 
ers, in one of his last utterances: ‘One must, theref 
(referring to a quarter in Paris where children were 
vanced “ by four and even by five years”), no longer c 
sider the retardation or advance of three years as 
anomaly.” 1 Similarly with respect to the pedagogi| 
standards: while Binet and Simon in 1905 affirmed t 
“any child is subnormal who, in spite of regular 
sufficient schooling, is two years behind children of 
same age” (L’Année Psychologique, 1905, p. 191ff.) 
1908 they were equally clear that this need not be 
case even when the child is three years behind in 
studies and “ when that retardation is not the resul 
lack of sufficient instruction.” ‘ Now it appears t 
wise and prudent to admit, until further investigation 
made, that this aptitude is not necessarily confounde 
every case with the intellectual faculty that we mea: 
by our methods” (L’Année Psychologique, 1908, 1

on, such standards have been formulated and have been 
idely followed in the United States (see p. 116f.). The 
lost radical standard proposed merely paraphrases the 
dagogical standard referred to on page 250. “ Feeble- 
indedness is defined psychologically as intellectual re- 
irdation of two years at an age below nine or three years 
and above nine.” It is evident, however, that this 
ndard has been regarded as too rigid, for the rule has 
mn modified so as to read “ more than two years back- 
rd” below nine and “ more than three years backward ” 
ve nine. Even this rule, however, has been further 
eralized so as to make those two and three years be- 
d “merely backward” and those four years or more 
ind “without doubt feeble-minded.” Judging by the 
lished studies, however, the first or the second stand- 
has been more frequently followed than the third, and 
is certain that many diagnoses of feeble-mindedness 
e been and still are based on the one or the other 
hese standards (see pp. 123 to 173). 
here are various reasons for doubting the relevancy 
the correctness of these absolute retardation stand- 
is for purposes of accurately diagnosing feeble-minded 
dren. 
. The same amount of absolute retardation need not 
the same significance for different children of exactly 
same chronological ages. Two years’ retardation 
indicate actual and permanent feeble-mindedness in 
child of eight years, while in another child of the 
age the feeble-mindedness may be only apparent, 
use the condition can be overcome. The absolute 
dation quantum in and of itself need not tell us 
her the mental retardation is permanent or transient, 
hether the child has large or small potentials for

development. In and of itself a retardation constan 
tells us nothing as to the etiology or the prognosis of t! 
condition, how it was caused, to what extent it can 
overcome or mitigated, or just how it is to be overco 
or mitigated. In mental diagnoses, however, we mu! 
strive to distinguish between the permanent and the tra 
sient, the curable and the incurable forms of arrest 
retardation. Of course, it is probable that when the ri 
tardation exceeds a certain amount —e.g., two yea 
for a four-year-old child — it is permanent. and incurab! 
or at best it can be overcome to so slight a degree th 
the child will always remain feeble-minded. But we ha 
not as yet satisfactorily worked out this exact relatio

whose retardation is due to different causes and who h 
been subjected to different modes of treatment. Ev 
if a given equation applied to the vast majority of m 
tally arrested children, we should probably still have 
provide for exceptions because of the varied causation

range of chronological ages, although, as already sta 
(p. 117), the significance of the standard varies for 
different ages to which it is applied. The two-year 
tardation standard ( or “over two years”) applies 
eight ages, or all the ages “below 9.” But two year 
retardation at eight is a very different thing from 
years of retardation at four. Children of three or 
who are retarded less than two years can be recogn:

feeble-minded, while a child of eight retarded two years 
ed not necessarily be feeble-minded. The “three 
ars” (or “over three years”) standard likewise ap- 
lies to many ages from nine up or “above nine.” ‘As 
have said (p. 116), originally no limit was placed upon 
e range of chronological ages “ above nine” to which 
e rule should be restricted, in consequence of which it 
s been literally applied to all ages of adolescents and 
ults. Owing to the patent absurdities into which we 
re led by the literal application of the rule to any of 
adult ages (which we have illustrated in the case of 
successful adults on pp. 223 to 227), it has been pro- 
sed to fix the upper chronological limit at 15 or 16. 
til the legitimacy of these arbitrary limits has been 
isfactorily demonstrated, the convention should merely 
considered as of theoretical interest, instead of being 
lied for practical diagnosis. 
jut it is evident that “three years” or “ over three 
rs”? of retardation does not mean the same thing for 
9 or 10 that it does for age 15 or 16 or 19 or 20, 
that the value of the unit decreases more or less con- 
tly from year to year until maturity is reached. 
n if the age steps in a measuring scale were made to 
allel these changing units, the differences between the 
tal and chronological ages would still have a different 
ificance in different parts of the scale.

until early adolescence (beyond which there should

   restricted to “ amentia ” dating from birth or from earl 
life), as mental deficiency manifests itself cumulatively i 
many individuals who develop more and more slowly 
time goes on, in consequence of which the older they gro 
the more deficient they become relatively to the ind 
viduals who develop at the normal rate. Moreover, t 
congenital cases are increased somewhat by the cases 
accidental brain injury occurring during early childhoo! 
But the large increase of feeble-mindedness found with i 
creasing chronological age which has been reported 
those using the Binet method of diagnosis with subjec 
ranging from early childhood to early or late adolescen 
is out of all proportion to this natural increase. We mi 
cite as a case the New Hampshire study of unselect 
school children (see p. 174), in which the classification 
arbitrary B.-S. standards is given separately for grou 
of children of different chronological ages. The per ce 
of feeble-minded. children reported was as follows: 2 
for ages 6 and 7, 20% for ages 8 to 10, and 23% for a 
12 to 14. It is inconceivable that the percentage 
feeble-mindedness should jump from 2% in the prim: 
grades to 20% in the intermediate and 23% in the gr: 
mar grades. Had older adolescents in the high sch 
been diagnosed by the same standards, the percent 
would undoubtedly have mounted still higher. 
These large differences — and similar differences fo’ 
by others between children and adolescents — are not 
solely, or perhaps even primarily, to differences in 
children, but to the measuring scale itself and the sta 
ards employed. The explanation is, we believe, v 
simple. As is generally conceded, the Binet scale is 
easy in the lower end, more nearly correct in the mi 
register, and too difficult in the upper end. The ex

            sive difficulty in the upper end is due to two causes: first, 
ithe standards are too difficult where tests are supplied; 
nd, second, tests are entirely lacking in many age levels, 
including the levels near the period of maturity, which 
akes it impossible foradolescents and adults to get any 
redit at all in these levels. The result is that the per- 
entage of retardation will be relatively slight for the 
oung children, will increase during middle childhood, will 
crease still more during later childhood and early 
dolescence, and decidedly more during middle and late 
dolescence. That this explanation is correct is indicated 
yy an analysis of our; own data. Taking the 414 con- 
lecutive St. Louis children who could be thoroughly tested 
uring the year 1914-1915, the average amount of B.-S. 
tardation increases as follows for each increasing chron-

subjects in some of the ages), that the increase is very 
marked between 6 and 7% and after 12, and that the abso- 
lute amount of retardation in the upper ages is from fiv 
to ten times as large as in the lower ages, even if we ex: 
clude the two upper ages on the theoretical ground tha 
intellectual maturity is complete after 16. That thi 
enormous increase in the amount of retardation is du 
in part to the scale itself is suggested by a compariso 
of the number of feeble-minded yielded by the scale o 
the basis of the arbitrary standards of retardation,’ an 
the number actually diagnosed as feeble-minded after 
full consideration of all the data, as shown by the follo 
ing tabulation:

It will be seen that there is an almost exact correlati 
between the B.-S. classification and the classificati 
actually made in ages 6, 7, and 8, in ages 9 and 10 mo 
cases were diagnosed as feeble-minded than the arbitra 
standard required,” while after age 11 far fewer cases we 
diagnosed as feeble-minded than required by the B.- 
standard — the exceptions above age 15 are explaina 
by the great retardation of the few cases examined.

ninth birthday = feeble-mindedness. 
2The standard changes abruptly at 9 from “over two years” 
“over three years.” While there is a close correspondence up t 
this does not mean that the arbitrary standards were merely follo 
in the final diagnosis. As a matter of fact, of those diagnosed as 
ble-minded between 6 and 8, 5 were retarded from 1.5 to 1.9 yea

   We arrive at a similar conclusion by comparing the 
ctual diagnoses made of our Pittsburgh and 1914-1915 
t. Louis cases, based on all the available data (175f., 
85f.), with the B.-S. diagnoses of the same cases, based 
urely on the arbitrary standards of retardation. Only 
hose retarded over three years were classified as feeble- 
inded by the B.-S. retardation standards. No one 
nder nine years retarded two years or more than two 
ears was classified as feeble-minded. Following an arbi- 
rary convention which has been used, those arbitrarily 
lassified as backward were retarded over two years but 
lot over three years, while those classed as normal did 
ot deviate more than a year in either direction from the 
ronological age. It should be remembered that all the 
actual” diagnoses of these cases were made by the per- 
m who gave the Binet tests and conducted the examina- 
on. The average chronological age of the Pittsburgh 
oup was almost half a year higher than the average 
of the St. Louis group. This does not seem like a 
ry large difference, but while only three of the St. Louis 
ses were over 16 years of age, 12 of the Pittsburgh 
ses were over 16. When we compare the diagnoses of 
lese two groups, it is found that the arbitrary B.-S. 
gnoses, based on the fixed standards of intelligence re- 
dation, gave an excess when compared with the actual 
gnoses of 15.8% of feeble-mindedness for the Pitts- 
rgh group but only 2.3% for the St. Louis group, a 
erence of 13.5%. We consider that this difference is 
more to the difference in the B.-S. rating, owing to 
age discrepancy of the two groups, than to any 
jective difference in our diagnoses of the cases in the 
groups. On the other hand, the B.-S. classification 
e too few backward cases, amounting to 17.4% for

     the Pittsburgh cases but only 13% for the St. Louis cases 
a difference in this case of only 4.4%. 
From what has been said it is evident that the conclu 
sion which has been reached, based on the above standard: 
(or on the XII-year standard), that a larger percentag 
of industrial-school and institutional cases of delinquen 
boys and girls and of prostitutes is feeble-minded than o 
juvenile-court cases or of orphaned or destitute childre’ 
cannot be regarded as scientifically established unless thi 
groups compared consist of persons of the same distrib 
tion of chronological ages. We cannot prove by a Bine| 
survey that there is more feeble-mindedness among prost: 
tutes than among non-prostitute, delinquent girls, o 
among juvenile-court delinquents than among negelecte 
detention cases, when the members of the former grow 
are older than those of the latter groups. Comparati 
B.-S. surveys, at least with the scale as at present const} 
tuted, are valueless unless the groups compared are of t! 
same ages. 
4, That the particular standards which have been ge 
erally used yield too high a percentage of feeble-minde 
ness is indicated? by the very significant fact that, whi 
the standards have been profusely applied in the diagno! 
of delinquents and criminals, no one who has advocat 
their use for this purpose, or who has so used them (wi 
one possible exception, to be noted presently), has ii 
partially applied the same standards when classifying u 
selected arrays of public-school children. If the thr 
year standard of feeble-mindedness is correct when aj

tive figures in Graphs I and III, except when young children are c 
cerned,

plied to delinquent children, it should, pari passw, be cor- 
ect when applied to groups of non-delinquent school chil- 
ren of the same ages. On this basis 8.4% of the un- 
elected group of public-school children tested by God- 
ard’s assistants are indubitably feeble-minded.t But 
ven those who are most zealous in advocating the three- 
ear standard recognize the absurdity of this estimate. 
m this basis 1,596,000 of the 19,000,000 elementary- 
chool children of the country (Report of the Bureau of 
ducation, 1914) would be feeble-minded — and this does 
ot include among the feeble-minded the children who were 
ss than 9 years of age who were retarded two years, 
r more than two years but less than three years — 
hich perhaps would add 1% or 2% more. On the other 
land, if the four-year standard is correct then at least 
3% of these pupils were feeble-minded (not including 
e younger cases retarded two years or over two years), 
on the same estimate at least 627,000 of the pupils in 
elementary schools of the country would be feeble- 
inded — and, no doubt, these figures would have been 
msiderably increased had older children been tested (be- 
nd the fifth or sixth grades), corresponding to the older 
linquents who have been tested. But even Goddard 
self, who regards those retarded four years or more 
“without doubt feeble-minded,’” says that there are 
ly betwen 300,000 and 400,000 feeble-minded in the 
ited States, including both children and adults,? while 
the group of children actually studied (but not clin- 
lly diagnosed by Goddard himself), he considers 2% 
a fair estimate, although for the New York schools he

       regards this figure as conservative: ‘I am entirely con 
vinced that 2% is well within the mark.” 
One study, however, has been impartial and has applie 
the arbitrary standards indiscriminately to groups o: 
delinquents and to public-school cases, with most interest: 
ing results. In a quiet residential city in New Hamp 
shire, without mills and with only four small factorie 
(see p. 178. In view of the astonishing statistics pro 
duced it is not surprising that the name of the city is wit! 
held), we are told that 16% of the children tested “a 
random ” in fourteen different public schools were feebl 
minded, while in the most favorably located schools “t 
per cent was 11% in a random selection.” Since this 
evidently a superior community, let us apply these esti 
mates to the country at large. On the basis of the fo 
mer figure over three millions and on the basis of t! 
latter figure over two millions of our elementary childr 
would be feeble-minded. Evidently feeble-mindedness h: 
lost its sting, and incidentally its legitimate connotatio 
Fortunately no city schools in the country have th 
far been ready to apply in the segregation of its feebl 
minded pupils the same criteria which social workers ha’ 
followed in the diagnosis of delinquents as feeble-minde 
Nevertheless, while it is true that the majority of t 
schools of the country either have organized no speci 
classes at all or too few special classes, there are so 
cities which have overstocked their special schools by 
signing backward children to these schools who sho 
have been assigned to ungraded classes. Nothing h 
contributed more largely to this result than the diagno: 
of pupils by amateurs who have slavishly followed 
arbitrary standards in connection with the B.-S. sc: 
which we have been discussing. But we believe that it

orally and pedagogically indefensible to pronounce back- 
ard children feeble-minded (in act if not in word) and 
orce them into classes for the feeble-minded. This is 
articularly true of the larger cities, where it is just as 
asy to organize two types of classes for mentally handi- 
apped children (the “ special” and the “ ungraded ”) 
s one type of class for all types of pedagogical misfits. 
hen it becomes clearly recognized that it is no easy 
atter to differentiate between the children who should 
e assigned to a special school and those who should be 
ssigned to an ungraded class, the public will demand a 
jore adequate type of diagnosis than can be given by 
mn amateur psycho-educational examiner who classifies 
e cases merely by means of arbitrary standards of re- 
rdation as determined by a B.-S. test. 
Our conclusion, then, in regard to the use of absolute 
leasures of retardation for purposes of practical diag- 
sis are quite in harmony with the conclusion of Binet 
. 252) and, in the main, of Pearson and Jaederholm, 
o say: A child with two years’ defect in its mental 
velopment will be classed as normal according to the 
rsonal equation of the observer, and with 54% of one 
tegory ranging over 64% of a second, any desired 
tios can be extracted from the facts even without con- 
ious bias.” “Until the mental age of the child is 
ething like four years in arrear of its physical age, 
is not possible dogmatically to assert . . . that it is 
‘ble-minded.” + While undoubtedly the specialist on

     mental retardation is considerably less than four years 
we do not think that it is possible for amateurs to mak 
accurate or reliable mental diagnoses of children by fol 
lowing the arbitrary quantitative standards of intelli 
gence retardation which have been in general use sinc

The Intelligence Quotient 
In order to determine the value of the intelligenc 
quotient in each category, we have computed the quotien 
for all the subjects in our 1914-1915 St. Louis group 9 
cases and in our group of Pittsburgh cases (see Tabl 
XI and XVII). As previously explained, these cas 
were not classified purely on the basis of the B.-S. test: 
but on the basis of these and other tests and other relevai 
facts. It would be improper first to standardize the sul 
jects purely on the basis of a particular system of test 
e.g., the Binet, and then use these standardized results 
prove the value of the intelligence-quotient scheme f 
practical diagnosis, and to demonstrate the correctness 
the different proposed quotient values. We do not pr 
tend that our classification is absolutely accurate, but 
is more accurate than a purely B.-S. classification cou 
have been. The following are the quotient values for t 
different categories in our two groups of cases:

  These figures reveal several interesting facts.
-P-A-G-E-281
  WHO IS FEEBLE-MINDED? 265 
1. Our values are quite different from those suggested 
yy Stern. The quotients for the imbeciles are from .12 
0 .24 points lower and for the morons from .6 to .15 
joints lower. 
2. There is a singularly close correspondence between 
he quotients of the same intelligence groups for our 
ittsburgh and St. Louis cases. In no group, except in 
he reserved category, does the difference amount to more 
han 5 points. It might have been assumed that the dif- 
erence would be much larger in view of the fact that the 
aximum chronological age was 33 for the Pittsburgh 
roup but only 18 for the St. Louis group. But the 
umber of persons above 18 in the Pittsburgh group (4) 
as-so small that it could not appreciably affect the 
verages. 
8. The quotient invariably decreases with each descend- 
g category of intelligence. That is, the quotient grows 
aller as the intelligence decreases. The following tabu- 
tion gives the difference between each descending cate- 
ry and the next higher category:

e difference between the normal and the retarded is 
htly larger than the difference between the retarded

en the morons and the imbeciles is decidedly larger.

     4. The fact that the quotients decrease regularly wit! 
each descending intelligence group would seem to prov 
conclusively the great value of the intelligence quotient fo 
mental diagnosis. But a critical examination of Table 
XI, XIII, and XVIII, which give the distribution of th 
intelligence quotients in each category, shows that th 
range of variation of the quotients is so large in each in. 
telligence group that the greater part of many of th 
groups overlap, so that the same quotients may indicat 
imbecility in one case and moronity in another, or back; 
wardness in one case and moronity in another, etc. Ac 
cordingly it would be quite impossible to make reliable in| 
dividual diagnoses on the basis of the mental quotien 
alone. Taking the Pittsburgh cases, we find that t 
quotients range all the way from .20 to .68 for the i 
beciles ; from .53 to .80 for the morons (exclusive of t! 
adult); from .58 to .95 for the borderline (or exclusi 
of those above 15 from .62 to .95); from .53 to 1.06 fi 
the backward (exclusive of the adult, or from .65 
1.06 exclusive of averages over 15); from .24 to 1.00 f 
the retarded; from .34 to .83 for the doubtful or r 
served (no diagnosis given); from .88 to 1.33 for t 
normal; and from 1.05 to 1.47 for the supernormal. T' 
range is very great even if we exclude the subjec 
above 15, ‘ 
If we turn to the St. Louis 1914-1915 cases, in whi 
the oldest child is eighteen years and the highest avera; 
16, we find that the same situation obtains. Based on t! 
1908 scale for imbeciles the quotients vary from .20 
.80, exclusive of ages above 15; for morons from .49 
-86, even if ages above 15 are excluded; for the borderlij 
from .65 to .86; for the backward from .70 to 1.00; 
the retarded from .71 to 1.04; for the doubtful or reser 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
WHO IS FEEBLE-MINDED? 267 
from .60 to .94; and for the normal from .90 to 1.16. 
The ranges do not differ greatly for the 1911 scale. 
These figures, of course, represent the ranges between 
the greatest extremes. Sometimes the extremes are repre- 
sented only by a single case. However, an inspection of 
ithe tables shows clearly that even if the extreme quotients 
* both ends of the columns are ignored, and even if the 
omparison is confined to the chronological ages below 
6, the variations may still easily amount to from 15 to 
5 points in several of the categories. It is evident from 
he above analysis that statistical or experimental proof 
hen based merely on means or medians may be quite de- 
eptive, and that mental diagnoses based on the intelli- 
nce quotient may be quite fallacious. 
A further analysis of the figures in Tables XII, XIII, 
nd XVIII shows that the wide range in the size of the 
uotients in each intelligence category is due to the great 
ifference in the chronological ages of those who grade in 
e same category, for it is found that the lower the 
otient the higher the chronological age, or, conversely, 
e higher the quotient the lower the chronological 
e, irrespective of the age limits —i.e, whether we 
e dealing with the older or the younger subjects. 
is can be seen by inspecting the columns in the tables 
ich contain the average chronological age for each 
oup of quotients which are given under each intelligence 
tegory. It is seen that as the quotients increase in 
ue in each intelligence classification, the chronological 
es tend correspondingly to decrease. This rule holds 
both the Pittsburgh and St. Louis cases. In the 
mer group, however, there are 14 exceptions (and 2 
al) out of 52 comparisons, and in the latter group 
exceptions (and 1 equal) out of 44 comparisons, using

the 1908 scale, and 15 exceptions (and 3 equal) out of 
46 comparisons, using the 1911 scale. Sometimes the 
exceptions are not significant because of the fewness of the 
cases. There are no exceptions when comparison is mad: 
between the average chronological ages for the lowes 
quotient group and for the highest quotient group i 
each intelligence classification, even when the ages abov 
16 are excluded. For the St. Louis cases, 1908 scal 
the average chronological age of the subjects with th 
lowest imbecile quotient (.20) is 13.5, but only 8.5 fo 
the subject with the highest imbecile quotient (.80). Fo 
the lowest moron quotient, excluding age 16 (.54), t 
chronological age is 14.9, but only 9.2 for the higheg 
moron quotient (.86). For the lowest borderline qu 
tient (.65) it is 13.2, but only 10.6 for the highest qu 
tient (.86). For the lowest backward quotient (.70) 
is 13.9, but for the highest (1.00) only 10. For the lo 
est retarded quotient (.71) it is 9.5, but for the highe| 
(1.00) 8.6. For the lowest normal quotient (.90) it 
1.6, but for the highest (1.16) 6.5. Similar data for t 
Pittsburgh cases, and the St. Louis cases rated by t 
1911 scale, can be obtained from the table. 
It is evident, therefore, that the intelligence quoti 
falls slightly with increasing chronological age, not o 
after or during the teens, but also before the teens. It 
not surprising that this should be so in the case of fee 
minded and backward children, who fall more and m 
behind as they grow older, but it is not so clear why t 
should be so in the case of normal and bright child 
whose mental ages should parallel their chronologi 
ages. The explanation is probably to be found in 
fact, to which attention has already been called, that w 
the difference between each successive chronological

is a constant difference (exactly one year), the difference 
tween each successive mental age gradually (although 
robably not regularly) diminishes until it becomes im- 
erceptible toward the period of mental maturity. Thus 
he difference betwen 10 and 12 is considerably greater 
han the difference between 19 and 20. Relatively one 
ear of difference at 5 or 6 may amount to three years at 
7 or 18. Without a compensating corrective formula 
e intelligence quotient fails to take account of this law 
diminishing-mental returns. Of course, the diminish- 
ry mental returns would be accentuated by the greater 
culty of the higher tests in the B.-S. scale. It would 
m that the gradual decrease in the quotients with in- 
easing chronological age is merely the obverse side of 
e gradual increase which we have found in the amount 
absolute retardation with increasing age, as determined 
the B.-S. scale. 
If these results are correct, the following conclusions 
ult: (1) The intelligence quotient cannot be em- 
yed without the use of a corrective formula to counter- 
the natural slackening in the rate of normal mental 
wth. Until this formula has been worked out for nor- 
1 children, we shall not be able to interpret our findings 
h subnormal or supernormal children. (2) Such a 
rective formula should be applicable until the period 
ental maturity is reached. After that the mental age 
be divided by a constant divisor, the age of mental 
urity. It has been proposed to use 13, 15, and 16 as 
maximal divisor.t At the present time, however, we    
   
    
   
        
   
   
    
     
    
   
    
        
   
     
    
    ecording to Stern the maximal divisor would probably be nine 
s for the feeble-minded, since, as we have seen (p. 117), he re- 
ts its use to the “period when the development of the feeble- 
ed individual is still in progress.” This ceases, according to 
, at 9 for morons.

     do not think there is any justification for using any arbi 
trary figure, for no one knows exactly when the age o: 
mental maturity is reached. From the very nature of thi 
case, it seems doubtful whether a single age can represen 
the point of maturity for all mental traits. Some menta 
traits probably mature before 15, some between 15 an 
20, while others increase in strength after 20. As Hue: 
has said: “ Mind grows to a maturity not complete til| 
in the twenties. Indeed, it grows farther, normally, i 
a transformation with the life cycle, to a different cha: 
acter and strength, harmonious with and normal to eacl 
period of chronological age. What are the norms an 
the tests then for the levels of 14, 16, 20, 24 years 
And what are the most significant functions to which 
shall apply these tests and norms? ” Until these questio 
have been satisfactorily answered, we do not seem to 
justified in using some hypothetical maximal divisor. O' 
own results with the Seguin form-board,! and with 7 out 
12 intelligence tests, given to pupils from the second to t 
eleventh grades (not yet in print), show that the curv 
increase up to and including the highest age tested, name 
17. The irregularities found in some of the latter curv 
are probably due to the limited number of subjects test 
in each age and the unequal number of backward ch 
dren in the different ages. With the Seguin form-boa: 
given to a larger number of subjects, the increase conti 
ued without exception to the highest age tested, nam 
17. From the character of many of the curves there 
no reason to suppose that improvement would not c 
tinue beyond 17. Since the use of the actual chronol 
ical ages of older adults lands us in absurdities, as sho

n pages 223 to 227, and since we do not know when the 
ge of mental maturity is attained nor what attenuating 
ormula to employ within the period of growth, it would 
eem that the intelligence quotient cannot be safely used 
t present for purposes of practical mental diagnosis.' 
The chief conclusions of this chapter may be summa- 
ized as follows: 
1. It is not possible in a large number of cases of both 
hildren and adults to make accurate and adequate indi- 
idual mental diagnoses, or to make a mental classification 
f a group of individuals merely by following a rule-of- 
humb procedure involving the use of the present scale of 
sinet-Simon tests and certain arbitrarily proposed abso- 
ite standards of retardation or the arbitrary quotient 
ormulas which have been proposed. Even after the test 
cales and the diagnostic standards have been made max- 
nally accurate by extensive investigation, it does not 
em probable that we shall be able to make reliable diag- 
ses by the automatic employment of these instruments, 
wever valuable they may prove to be — and we have no 
ubt as to their value when properly employed. There 
e many aspects and clinical phases of mental deviations 
eg., of feeble-mindedness — which are not elicited by 
e administration of a series of controlled tests, whether 
tellectual or motor. 
       
    
   
   
The difficulty of using the intelligence quotient as a means of 
rate diagnosis may be illustrated by the following individual 
es examined in our clinic: M., age 16.83, B.-S. age 8.4, has a 
tient of .49 and should be an imbecile according to one proposed 
dard. He is a moron. M., age 9.66, B.-S. 6.4, has a quotient 
.66 and should be a moron according to one proposal. He was 
nosed as an imbecile and his subsequent record indicates the 
rrectness of this diagnosis. M., age 14.08, B.-S. 10.4, has a lower 
ient, .73, than M., age 8.58, B.-S. age 6.4, quotient .74, but the 
er has proved after three years of observation to be only back- 
‘d, while the latter still grades as an imbecile, although he may 
the status of a moron.

        2. The function of tests in clinical psychology is tl 
same as the function of tests in medicine. They a: 
standardized tools by means of which the trained ps: 
chologist or trained physician may work more skillfull 
They enable him to observe under controlled, standardize 
objective conditions, they render his results comparab 
with the observations of others, and make it possible fe 
him to interpret his findings in terms of normal functio: 
ing when the norms are available. Even the best tests | 
psychology, however, should be regarded merely as aic 
to assist the examining psychologist to a guarded dia, 
nosis, Tests in psychology are frequently no more coi 
clusive than the many tests employed in medicine. T] 
information yielded by a test in psychology, as in med 
cine, frequently depends more on the skill of the examin 
to use the test and interpret the results than on the vah 
of the test itself. It is to be feared that the recent er 
phasis which has been placed on test scales of intelligen 
(specifically the Binet), fixed diagnostic criteria of r 
tardation, and the intelligence quotient is largely r 
sponsible for the mistaken belief, which has gained wi 
acceptance, that psychological diagnosis, and particular 
the identification of feeble-minded persons, is a ve 
simple, non-technical matter, and that therefore the clas 
fication of school, institutional, and court cases can 
adequately done by any intelligent person who knows h 
to administer the Binet tests and apply the propo: 
hypothetical diagnostic formulas. In practice we hi 
found persons attempting to diagnose feeble-mindedn: 
who have had no more prior knowledge of the condition 
feeble-mindedness or of psychological diagnosis than 
knowledge which a freshman or a sophomore in a medij 
school has of physical diseases and their correct diagno!

he blunders which will be made by an amateur on feeble- 
indedness are similar to the blunders which will be made 
yy an amateur on physical diseases. It is just as difficult 
o differentiate high-grade feeble-minded children from 
ackward children as it is to differentiate two physical 
iseases with like symptoms, or two related psychoses. 
any of the surveys of feeble-mindedness which have been 
ade by amateurs for state commissions or for institu- 
ions are, we believe, quite worthless as scientific docu- 
ents. They have done much harm because of their ex- 
avagant claims to “ scientific accuracy.” 1 It is neces- 
ry, therefore, to emphasize that measuring scales of in- 
lligence and quantitative measures of feeble-mindedness, 
Juable as they are (and they are of the highest value),

in physical diagnosis, and the one essential ? in either 
As Butler has said: “The work of untrained, inexperienced per- 
is in this field is valueless. In fact, a considerable amount is 
lished that is inaccurate, therefore harmful.” ... “One thing, 
ever, I think is sure,— we are not doing the cause any good by pub- 
ing extreme statements. On the contrary, we are hindering it. Al-

eat variety of standardized psychological tests and scales of de-

   kind of work is to require a high standard of training o 
the examiner. We realize, of course, that it may b 
necessary for smaller school systems, because of financia 
reasons, to have the psychological testing done by schoo! 
teachers who have learned to administer various test: 
Such work may be countenanced if its limitations ar 
clearly recognized. The function of the examinin 
teacher is not to diagnose the children, but merely t 
corroborate the pedagogical rating by means of ment 
tests, particularly tests which determine the level of it 
telligence. Feeble-minded suspects thus selected for spi 
cial instruction should be given a thorough trial in an wu 
graded class for backward children before they shoul} 
be considered for a special class or special school f 
mental defectives, unless it is perfectly evident that th 
are feeble-minded. The child should be given the bene 
of the doubt. The new English mental-deficiency act h 
created a situation in England which will, no doubt, ari 
in America as soon as more of our states provide for t 
compulsory segregation of feeble-minded children in sp} 
cial classes in the public schools. To assign a child 
a special school in England is to certify him as feeb! 
minded. It is felt in England that not all children w 
are being assigned to the special classes are feeble-mind 
and that it is wrong to assign such pupils to these class 
As a consequence, greater caution is now urged in + 
certification of children for the special schools. To qu 
W. A. Potts: “I have, however, and others also hi 
refused to certify under the mental-deficiency act so’ 
defectives on the ground that they would ultimately 
able to support themselves.” 
Let us add that there is no excuse for the larger ci 
of our country employing any one but a well-trained e

    cator with clinical experience for the work of educational 
iagnosis and the direction of the educational activities 
or all types of mentally exceptional children. Moreover, 
he tendency which is evident in many school systems of 
equiring the examiner to examine so many children that 
t is impossible to do anything but the sketchiest testing, 
should be discouraged. 
8. The standards which have been most frequently used 
this country during the last six years yield entirely too 
igh a percentage of feeble-mindedness. There was a 
ime when the estimates of the number of the feeble- 
inded in the general population, in the schools, courts, 
risons, and reformatories, was too conservative. But 
e pendulum has now swung to the opposite extreme. 
eeble-mindedness has become the Nemesis of our times. 
e are now told that at least 3% of elementary-school 
ildren are feeble-minded, that at least half of the delin- 
ents are feeble-minded,— the figures given are some- 
mes nearer 100% than 50%,— and that most of our 
cial ills are due to feeble-mindedness. We believe that 
eble-mindedness is one cause, a very important cause, 
t still only one cause, of our social difficulties. We be- 
ve that the number of feeble-minded children in the 
hools varies from less than one half of 1% to less than 
fo, instead of 3% or more, while the number of the 
leble-minded in the courts, reformatories, assignation 
uses, and penal institutions varies from about 10% to 
%, instead of from 50% to 97%. 
4, The term “feeble-mindedness” should be more 
rply delimited. From the standpoint of intelligence 
limiting line should be drawn at the point where the 
elligence is so deficient (amentia) that an older adoles- 
t or adult is just barely not able to make his living —

     cannot maintain an independent existence at the simples 
form of work afforded by the community. This point wil 
vary more or less with the community and with the indi 
vidual, but the variation should not be unduly extende 
when the individual happens to be a delinquent. Ther 
are other reasons for social irresponsibility than feeble 
mindedness. 
As we have said elsewhere:+ ‘The present-day. tend: 
ency to play fast and loose with such vague and unde 
fined concepts as ‘ defective children,’ ‘ mental deficiency 
‘mental defect,’ ‘defectiveness,’ ‘subnormality,’ an 
* feeble-mindedness,’ ‘ moronity,’ and ‘ criminal imbecility 
when applied to mentalities of KX and over, and to bas| 
vital practical action on diagnoses based on such vagu| 
concepts, is not only inexcusable but it constitutes a pos 
tive bar to sane progress in the study of the problems 
mental deviation. A recent writer recommends that ad 
quate provision be provided ‘ by the State for the perm 
nent custodial care of all committed cases of mental defe 
whether or not they have a court record.’ Another r 
cent writer maintains that ‘there is little doubt that 1) 
majority of criminals are mentally defective.’ It wo 
be difficult indeed to find any person who is free from so 
kind of ‘mental defect,’ or who is not to some exte! 
‘mentally defective.? On the basis of the sweeping reco! 
mendation and generalization above it would be possi 
to report almost any person as a case of ‘ mental defec 
and thereby secure his lifelong incarceration in a custod: 
institution, What do our contributors mean by ‘ men 
defect? or by ‘mentally defective’? Do they use 
words in the generic or specific sense? Let us place 
most lenient construction possible upon these words a|

only assume that the words are used as synonymous with 
feeble-mindedness. What, then, do they mean by feeble- 
indedness? Do they include all persons who fail to go 
eyond Binet XII? If so, our results indicate that many 
illions of our citizens, law-abiding and successful as well 
s miscreant and criminal, would be unable to qualify as 
ot-feeble-minded on the basis of this widely used stand- 
rd. It is necessary to emphasize that there are all 
inds and all degrees of ‘ mental defect,’ ranging from a 
pecific defect of memory or from a slight degree of men- 
al retardation down through backwardness, dullness, 
borderlinity,’? and the various degrees of feeble-minded- 
ess. ‘The fact that a person is classed as ‘ mentally de- 
ctive’ or has a ‘mental defect’ proves neither that he

MENTALLY AND PEDAGOGICALLY RETARDE 
CHILDREN 
N the month of November, 1914, the writer drew up 
series of statements bearing on the problem of th 
education and care of feeble-minded and retarded schoo 
children. These statements were first presented for dis 
cussion before a subcommittee appointed to consider th 
educational requirements of feeble-minded and backwar 
children in St. Louis. They were then discussed seriatii 
during seven or eight meetings by the special-scho 
teachers in one of my lecture courses. A similar e: 
change of views occurred at one of the meetings of tl 
elementary principals’ club and at a number of meetin, 
of the curriculum committee on special schools. In Apri 
1915, these statements were reformulated into a series 
20 “declarations and resolutions” and adopted by t 
committee on special schools. In October, 1915, t) 
resolutions were adopted, with minor amendments, by t! 
large joint committee consisting of about 50 represent 
tives from the various committees which have been ma: 
ing an extensive study of the curriculum in the St. Lo 
schools during the last two years. A questionnaire and 
copy of the thirteen original statements were sent in Apr 
1915, to the supervisor and each of the teachers in t 
Special Schools for Individual Instruction in St. Loi 
(thirty-four individuals) and to supervisors or super: 
tendents in charge of special classes in the public scho 
in sixteen of the larger cities of the country where s

cial classes for deficient children have been in existence for 
some time. The questionnaire merely required the re- 
pondents to “ approve,” “ disapprove,” or “ partly ap- 
rove” (explaining “in what respect ” partly approved) 
ach of the thirteen statements. 
They were asked to “ answer independently, so as not to 
e unconsciously prejudiced by the judgment of others.” 
t is probable, however, that the St. Louis teachers were 
fluenced by the prolonged classroom discussions of the 
uestions. Owing to the numerous requests which have 
een made by the respondents for a statement of the re- 
Its of the investigation, and the inquiries which have 
me from school administrators throughout the country 
x information bearing on the organization of work for 
ledagogical retardates, it seems desirable to publish not 
ly the original statement in unabridged form together 
ith a summary of the replies and a discussion of the 
me, but also a verbatim reproduction of the “ declara- 
ms and resolutions ” which were finally adopted by the 
Irge committee. It should be explained that I did not 
to make the original draft serve as a complete expo- 
ion of my own views on the topics considered, but the 
was rather to draw up a number of theses to be used 
a basis for discussion. 
All the cities except New York and Rochester replied, namely: 
Angeles (Principal of Special School); Philadelphia (Assistant 
erintendent); Providence (Assistant Superintendent); Chicago 
ssistant Superintendent) ; Worcester (Assistant SupeHatengenoys 
ton (Supervisor) ; Seattle (Supervisor and Director of Child Study

ids (Supervisor of Special Classes); Washington (Supervisory

ed from fourteen cities. I tender my hearty thanks to the respond- 
from these cities and from St. Louis.

   GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND FACTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN 
THE ORGANIZATION OF WORK FOR MENTALLY AND 
PEDAGOGICALLY RETARDED CHILDREN 
1. The special class is designed exclusively for pupil 
who are more or less genuinely subnormal in mental pote 
tials, or in inherent mental capacity. The followin 
classes of misfit pupils are, therefore, by definition, e 
cluded from the special class; pedagogically retarded pi 
pils whose mental potentials are approximately normal, 
who are motor minded and merely retarded in the literar 
branches; the blind and deaf, or semi-blind and semi-de 
who are approximately normal in inherent mental capa: 
ity; disciplinary or truant cases who are not sufficient 
mentally subnormal to render the mental subnormality t 
antecedent or basic condition; speech defectives who 
mental subnormality is not the prior or basic conditio: 
and foreign children unfamiliar with English who do n 
belong to the feeble-minded or the near-feeble-mind 
Genuine many-sided mental subnormality, to a greater 
less degree, should be the primary prerequisite to adm: 
sion into the special class. This principle of selection 
fundamental, and should only be waived when special c 
cumstances so require. In short, the special class is 
feeble-minded, border-line, and seriously backward cas 
2. The ungraded class, on the other hand, is desi, 
exclusively for pupils who are pedagogically retard 
from various causes, in one or more of the ac

ranches, provided the pedagogical retardation is not due 
» marked deficiency in mental potentials, or in inherent 
ental capacity. The pedagogical retardation must be 
ue primarily to one or more adventitious causes, and not 
) serious mental deficiency. 
8. The elementary industrial schools for boys and girls

lly are, more or less backward mentally, who are re- 
irded or disinterested in the academic subjects of study, 
it who have ability in, or inclination for, motor forms

me of the ablest pupils in the special class should be 
romoted into these schools at the prepuberal epoch. For

tion and assistance (individual teaching), but such dif- 
entiated types of work as will meet the peculiar re- 
irements and capacities of the different pupils (differ- 
jated teaching). It is preéminently a problem of dif- 
ential orthogenic treatment, whether physical, hygienic, 
ial, pedagogical, or mental. The differentiation ap- 
les both to the method and the content of the teaching. 
is apparent, therefore, that the teacher in these classes

individual attention to pupils who are weak in one or me 
of the regular academic or literary branches. While #] 
may involve a modification of methods, and always shoz 
involve a careful study of the peculiar difficulties of ea 
pupil, it is primarily a problem of coaching slow pupils 
the regular curriculum of studies, so that they may 
returned to the regular grades, whenever possible, or 
that they may be prepared for prevocational and voc 
tional classes. These should aim to be restoration class 
. While we may say theoretically that the goal to 
aimed at in special-class work is the restoration of t 
pupils to mental normality, and to a place in the regul 
grades, and while it may be well to keep this aim in sig] 
so that no pupil will be retained in a special class who c 
do successful work in the regular or ungraded classes, y 
it is found in practice that this aim can be realized or 
in a small proportion of the cases grading distinctly abc 
the feeble-minded station. Hence, for the large majori 
of these cases we must aim to provide continuously 
special classes such types of work as will maximally stim 
late and develop those powers, aptitudes, and intere: 
which they possess, and which will render them maxima 
self-supporting, self-assisting, self-directing, useful, 1 
abiding, self-respecting, and happy members of society 
of city and state supported colonies. 
8. It has been found, in practice, that these aims 
most closely approximated by providing a prepondera: 
of sensory, motor, manual, vocational, and physical e: 
cises, and a minimum of literary work of a distinctly ele 
tary, concrete, and practical nature. In general, from 
thirds to three fourths of the teaching should be of a 
sorimotor, manu-mental, vocational, and physical nat

GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND FACTS 283 
“9. Mental defectives should be segregated in special 
classes at the very beginning of their school course, if 
ecognized, both because they should be eliminated from 
he regular grades, where they interfere with the progress 
f the normal pupils,{and because they should be subjected 
lo corrective treatment as early as possible. This being 
lo, the minimal mental level for eligibility to the special 
lasses would necessarily have to be placed below the level 
f mental development required for entrance into the kin- 
lergarten (which is five years in St. Louis). Adequately 
provide for the needs of these young defectives requires 
e organization of primary special classes, or primary 
visions in the special schools with home, kindergarten, 
d sensorimotor forms of work. i 
10. The degree of defect considered necessary to debar 
child from public-school instruction in a special class is 
matter for determination by the administrative and ex- 
utive authorities of the schools. To draw the line, in 
e customary slipshod manner, at “ institutional cases ” 
ds nowhere, because it is impossible to define an “ in- 
tutional case,” either in terms of degree of defect or of 
e of pathology. It is not a fixed entity. Cases in 
te institutions practically everywhere vary from the 
found idiot to the borderline and seriously backward 
es. Idiots can be readily excluded from the special 
sses, because they are not appreciably amenable to any 
m of public-school care or instruction; but all other 
des from the low-grade imbecile up, are improvable in 
tain aspects of their mental, moral, social, and phys- 
make-up. Ideally no grades lower than the low- 
de morons should be trained in the public schools. 
in practice this criterion cannot be enforced unless 
community is content to permit a large number of

necessary to accept middle and high grade imbeciles ix

residential institutions have been provided to meet th 
demands made by the presence of these children in societ 
11. Adequately to handle the problem of the feebl 
minded in a large city like St. Louis requires the estal 
lishment of a residential school or colony, in addition t| 
the special day schools. To this colony school should 
sent (1) those pupils who cannot profit measurably b 
the work afforded in the special day schools or who a: 
unable, because of youth or infirmity, to betake themselv 
to these schools, and (2) those pupils leaving the speci 
schools who cannot be made self-supporting, or sel 
directing, and who cannot be guaranteed adequate prote| 
tion at home from the social and economic consequenc| 
and penalties of their mental deficiency. “The latter p 
pils should be trained in the special classes up to the ti 
of the puberal epoch for profitable service in the re 
dential school, where supplementary training should 
afforded for the indoor and outdoor activities connec 
with the institutional life. The colony should be loca 
on a large tract of land, adjacent to the city, and sho 
be rendered maximally self-sustaining by the labor of 
inmates. It should be primarily a school, with che 
homes and farms, and only secondarily a custodial in: 
tution or asylum for helpless or almost helpless’ ca: 
It should be managed by a competent educational adi 
istrator, who should reside on the premises, and it sho 
sustain the same relations as do the special classes to

12. In order to reduce as far as possible the expenses 
special classes to the community, and in order to pro- 
de opportunities for the children in these classes to ac- 
ire the habit of doing things which have a direct utili- 
rian value both to themselves and to society, a part of 
e craft work offered should consist in making articles 
lich can be used by the pupils themselves. To illustrate: 
e girls could prepare and serve daily lunches to be of- 
red at cost to the pupils who wished them, or they could 
epare hot lunches for themselves from their own sup- 
ies; they could repair and make some of their wearing 
yparel; make bandages, towels, etc., for the school; wash 
e school dishes, towels, etc. ‘The boys could manufac- 
re some of the didactic materials needed in the kinder- 
rden, sensorimotor, and industrial forms of work, and 
ey could make some of the regular supplies and furnish- 
gs needed in any of the buildings. © 
18. Provision should be made for the after-care or 
er-guidance of many of the pupils who leave the special 
sses. Adequately to perform this service would re- 
ire the appointment of one or more social or industrial 
isers in connection with the psycho-educational clinic. 
e functions of the adviser would be (1) to make a vo- 
ional survey of positions available in the community 
mentally deficient children (positions which come 
hin their limited range of capacity, and in which the 
rounding social conditions are such as not to impose 
great strain on their weak moral natures); (2) to 
the children to obtain positions suited to their limita- 
s; (3) to explain the children’s limitations to em- 
ers, so that they may take more personal interest in 
ir welfare and extend them greater sympathy; (4) to

‘Ungraded Class.’ It would be important to note here that the 1 
grading which is usual in such classes is in itself a disadvantage, a 
where numbers permit it is very much better to have a number of su 
classes in the same organization in order that the pupils and the wo 
may be properly graded, even if it be necessary to accomplish this 
bringing the pupils from a rather wide area to secure a sufficient nu 
ber for this purpose. This is what is being done in the schools 1 
normal children by eliminating the little ‘red schoolhouse’ (an v 
graded class) and transporting the children to a central school whe 
they may have all the advantages incident to graded and specialized | 
struction. 
2. Orthogenie Class. The composition of this class and the aim of t 
instruction similar to that described in your circular under the head 
‘special class.’ The disciplinary and truant cases come under t 
head, but where conditions permit are segregated in special classes 
the disciplinary type. The special disciplinary class where mental st 
normality is not the basic condition, will practically disappear in cit 
maintaining residential or parental schools for the treatment of d 
ciplinary cases. 
3. Orthopedic Class. (For crippled children.) Children whose phy 
ical disability is such that they cannot attend the class of a regul 
school, but must be transported to school. Among these are apt to 
found children of low mentality. These children may be tolerated 
the orthopedic class if no better provision can be found for the 
Practical conditions will oftentimes determine this. The orthopec 
class, however, is primarily for children of fair mentality but physic 
disability. 
4, Open-Window Class, (For undernourished, anemic, and pretub 
cular children.) 
5. Open-Air Class. (Required by the School Code of Pennsylvania 
be in a separate building.) ‘This class is for children having tuber 
losis but able to receive physical and mental benefit by attendance 
school. The distinction between “ Open-window” and “ Open-air ”| 
a convenient device for designating the difference in grade of physi 
disability or actual disease. 
6. English Class. For non-English-speaking pupils, who on accoun 
their physical and mental maturity are physical, mental, and so 
misfits in the first and second grades, in which they are liable to 
placed to begin their school work in this country if a special Eng! 
class is not provided for them. The purpose of this class is to 
these pupils intensive instruction in English to fit them just as soo: 
possible to enter the elementary school fairly high in the grades 
companions of their own size and age. 
7. Speech Classes. For stutterers, stammerers, and children of o 
speech defects; Lip Reading Classes for the deaf and semi-deaf; To 
Reading Classes for the blind and semi-blind, are other types of spe| 
classes whose establishment and development must be provided for.

     GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND FACTS 289 
It will be noted that in the above classification the aim of the instruc- 
‘ion rather than the defect of the pupil is used in indicating the kind of 
special class, the purpose being to divert attention from the defect of 
he child to the purpose of the class.” 
The following comments by Assistant Superintendent 
amuel B. Allison, of Chicago, with reference to the desig- 
ation of the special classes in Chicago and the classifica- 
ion of the types, is also in point: 
“My judgment is that there should be but two classes of cases in the 
ecial schools: the retarded and the backward. In our schools we ad- 
it the borderline cases, but as soon as we have definitely decided a 
ld non-educable, he is excluded. 
“Our classes in Chicago would then come under your class of un- 
aded classes wherein we have retarded and backward children, in- 
ding children not markedly feeble-minded. . . . A child with aver- 
mental endowment should be denominated ‘ retarded’ if he is one 
more years behind normal gradation, leaving the term ‘backward’ 
apply to children below average mental capacity. . 
“The problem of terminology in this work is very important, it seems 
me. The work was begun here under the caption ‘Subnormal.’ I 
not use it except when I have to. The objections are obvious. No 
iild should be branded by the term that implies feeble-mindedness un- 
s it is a marked case.... A uniform terminology in this work 
ughout the United States is a great desideration.” 
          
    
        
         
    
    
   
                   The prevailing practice unquestionably in the United 
ates is to use the designation “special class” in its 
lecific sense, and apply it to schools or classes which 
le designed for children who are, or are thought to be, 
ble-minded or at least very deficient mentally. The 
son that this term has come into this restricted use is 
bably threefold. First, the word is euphonious and 
ocuous, free from any suggestion of stigma or re- 
ach. Second, it has back of it the force of tradi- 
al usage. Historically the first types of segregated 
sses to be organized in the public day schools (with the 
eption of those for the blind and the deaf) were spe- 
classes for disciplinary boys. For obvious reasons it
-P-A-G-E-306
  290 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
was impolitic to denominate these “ disciplinary classes.” 
Since the classes were organized to meet a special social 
need, it seemed consistent to refer to them simply a 
“ special classes,” although they were also called “ boy 
classes.” Moreover, as time went on the necessity of pro 
viding special pedagogical training in these classes becam| 
more and more apparent, as it was found that many 9 
the disciplinary cases were also very backward ped 
gogically. In fact, it was discovered that some of t 
pupils were so extremely backward that they did not r 
spond satisfactorily even to the modified social and edi 
cational program provided in the disciplinary classe 
These children often proved to be feeble-minded. It b 
came apparent that the methods of educational and soci 
care had to be still further differentiated to meet t 
special needs of these pupils, and that this could not 
done unless they were segregated in “special” class 
apart from the special class for disciplinary pupils, w 
usually were boys. Moreover, many tractable feeb 
minded boys and girls were found in the lower grades 
the regular classes who were equally in need of specij 
pedagogical training. No doubt, many of the pupils 
signed to these classes were wayward, incorrigible, 
backward rather than feeble-minded — and this is s 
true — but the aim always has been to give pupils assu 
to be “ mentally defective ” special educational treatm 
in special classes. There have been far more classes 
tablished for “ mentally deficient ” than for disciplin 
pupils, and so the practice has become general of app 
ing the designation “special class” to classes for 
feeble-minded. In the third place, American practice 
probably influenced by English custom. In England

       its English sense), are designated “special schools” or 
* special centers.” 
Of course, there is a logical impropriety in continuing 
o restrict a generic term to one kind of special class or 
chool, since we now have about a dozen types of special 
lasses, and since it is possible that the development of 
chool medical and psycho-educational inspection. por- 
nds in future a still finer classification of pupils for 
ifferentiated instruction in special types of classes or 
hools. It is highly desirable, therefore, that a uni- 
rm terminology should be developed and standardized 
roughout the United States for the different types of 
ecial classes and special schools which are being organ- 
led, so that it will be possible to communicate in a com- 
on language. Owing to the equivocal connotation of 
names now in use it is difficult correctly to interpret 
e statistical data published by boards of education or 
e National Bureau of Education relative to the organ- 
tion of special classes for pedagogical retardates. For 
ample, it is very frequently impossible to determine from 
le statistical data in some of the bulletins of the United 
ates Bureau of Education whether the special classes 
orted are designed for children who are actually feeble- 
inded or borderline, or for children who are backward 
retarded, or for all kinds of subnormal or retarded 
pils. All recognize the need of an accurate nomen- 
ture for special classes. The difficulty is to obtain 
rds which are unequivocal and accurate, unless purely 
ventional symbols are arbitrarily adopted. 
he easiest solution undoubtedly is to designate the 
sses by the type of the material that goes into them.

or morally defensible to compel backward children t 
spend all their schooldays with children who have bee 
definitely diagnosed as feeble-minded. This is not righ 
to the child, to the parent, or to the taxpayer. If 
child at the time of the examination or the assignmen 
cannot be definitely diagnosed as feeble-minded, he shoul 
we believe, be given the benefit of the doubt and be as 
signed to a class for backward children, where he shoul 
be retained permanently, if he proves later to be bac’ 
ward, or from which he should eventually be transferr 
to a special school if he proves to be feeble-minded. 
should then have (1) classes (or schools) for feebl 
minded children and (2) classes for backward children ( 
backward and retarded). As a matter of fact, speci 
classes are now sometimes officially called backward class

or classes for the mentally defective or mentally deficie 
Administratively considered, there is no objection to t 
first appellation, provided the eligibility to the backwa: 
classes is limited to children who are backward and n 
feeble-minded. But unfortunately “backward” is t 
often used as a euphemism for “ feeble-minded,” so th| 
the term as often employed is a misnomer. 
The terms “subnormal,” “mentally defective,” a: 
“mentally deficient ” are objectionable because they

specific than the word “ special,” but they are more gen- 
eral than the word “ backward,’ or “ feeble-minded,” or 
* moronic,” for we must recognize that there are all de- 
rees of “ mental deficiency ” and “ subnormality,” from 
slight degree of subefficiency or retardation to profound 
idiocy, and there are no sharp, pathognomonic dividing 
ines between the steps. The differences are probably 
rimarily quantitative, and only secondarily qualitative. 
Personally I prefer administratively to call things by 
heir right names, because we then know exactly what we 
re talking about. We will then be able to compare simi- 
r data from different school systems and correctly clas- 
ify our facts. However, it would not be politic to refer 
ublicly to our classes as “ feeble-minded ” and “ back- 
ard.” This would give offense both to the parents and 
the pupils so classified. The normal children would 
‘ize upon the names of the classes and apply them to the 
signees as terms of reproach — possibly a minor point, 
even now the grade pupils constantly refer to the spe- 
al classes as “ crazy,” “ buggy,” or “ dummy classes.” 
r these reasons it may be advisable to name the differ- 
t types of special classes according to their several aims, 
suggested by Dr. Cornman. But to follow Dr. Corn- 
n’s suggestions it would be necessary first clearly to dif- 
entiate the specific aims and functions of each type of 
ss. It would further be necessary to decide whether 
le name should be determined by the purpose which we 
to realize or the results which we actually achieve. 
As has been pointed out in Chapter I, there is a good 
1 of confusion still regarding the purposes of the spe- 
1 schools for the pedagogical retardates. Little at- 
pt has been made in many school systems clearly to 
erentiate between the provinces of the special class and

   of the ungraded class. On the one hand, there are thos 
who proclaim that the special class should be a clearin, 
house for all sorts of pedagogical retardates, some to bi 
permanently retained, some to be restored to the grades, 
some to be transferred to other types of special classes 
while, on the other hand, there are those who conten 
that the special class is exclusively designed for childre 
who have been proved tobe definitely feeble-minde 
Some supervisors of special classes pride themselves 0: 
the number of children whom they have been able to re 
store to grade, while others take pride in pointing out tha 
this simply proves that the children were not feeble-minde: 
and should never have been placed in the special cla’ 
but in the ungraded class. It is obvious, therefore, if 
are to denominate these two types of classes by their aim: 
we must first know what their aims are, and then s 
whether the proposed terminology conforms to what 
have in view. 
It seems to me that the problem of differentiation, a: 
signment, and instruction of mentally and educational 
handicapped children may be stated as follows: 
First, the primary clearing house for these childr 
should be the psycho-educational clinic. 
Second, the ungraded class should serve as a furth 
clearing house, supplementing the work of the clinic f 
three types of cases: 
(1) Restoration cases. These are children of go 
mentality who are pedagogically retarded for vario 
reasons (late entrance, frequent absence, frequent tra 
fer, sickness, indifference, etc.) but who can be brou,

the regular grades. Some will require individual atten- 
tion only in some branches. These pupils should be re- 
turned to grade as soon as possible. 
(2) Backward cases. These children, often referred to 
s “ dull,” or as “ dullards,” are more or less all round de- 
cient in mental potentials. They are below normal in 
ative mental strength, but they are above the feeble- 
inded status. Many of these children can be consider- 
bly aided by proper physical treatment. Others can 
artly redeem themselves by indefatigable application and 
dustry. But most of them will be unable to reach the 
andard set in the regular grade work for the normal pu- 
ils. ‘These pupils require prolonged individual instruc- 
on in an ungraded class. In fact many of them should 
retained continuously in an ungraded class. As they 
ow older they should be given increasing amounts of 
nd work, and at the dawn of adolescence many should 
promoted into prevocational and vocational schools. 
(3) Doubtful cases. 'These cases are on the borderline 
tween backwardness and feeble-mindedness. When it is 
possible to decide definitely at the time of the examina- 
m that the child is feeble-minded, he should be given 
le benefit of the doubt and be assigned to an ungraded 
ss where he can be given a large amount of individual 
truction and a thorough trial in the literary work. 
ter an adequate trial in the ungraded class, the child 
uld be reéxamined in the psycho-educational clinic 1

ss or be transferred to a special school.

   result of the ungraded class try-out, to be clearly feebl 
minded, or so backward mentally that he is almost feeble 
minded, or unless the indications are quite positive that h 
will develop at a retarded rate and eventually prove to b 
feeble-minded. 
Negatively, then, the special classes should not serve a 
a clearing house for all kinds of mental misfits — feebl 
minded, borderline, seriously backward, backward, and r 
tarded cases, and non-feeble-minded “ incorrigibles,”— e: 
cept in small cities where it is impossible to organize mo: 
than one class. The milder types of disciplinary cas 
should be assigned to special classes if they are feebl 
minded, and to ungraded classes if they are backward. 
I believe all who have had public-school experience wi 
special classes will agree that it is wrong in principle 
send pupils to a special school in order that they m 
have an opportunity to prove themselves not feeb 
minded. The burden of proof should rest with the pro: 
cution, the school authorities. When the evidence 
merely circumstantial,— when it amounts to nothing mi 
than a strong presumption or suspicion,—the ch 
should always be given a preliminary trial in an 
graded class. To this general principle it is, of cour} 
sometimes justifiable to make exceptions; e.g., in the c 
of an older adolescent very backward both mentally 
pedagogically, who will be ready to leave school in a cow 
of years and who cannot be given individual help 
opportunities for hand work in other types of classes. 
But once a child has been definitely diagnosed as fee 
minded, he should be compelled to attend a special cl 
as long as he attends the public schools (if he is to att 
at all), or otherwise be excluded from school. It is jus 
unjust to permit feeble-minded children to remain in

‘ades to hamper the work of the normal children as it 
to force children not feeble-minded to spend their school 
yes in association with the feeble-minded, who often ex- 
bit gross physical stigmata or deformities, and who fre- 
ently are subject to perverse practices and moral 
liquity. 
If the above are the differing functions of special and 
igraded classes, it is questionable whether we would be 
stified in calling an ungraded class a restoration class, 
r it is evident that not all the ungraded types can be 
stored to normality. Of course, it is quite feasible in 
e large school systems to form restoration sections or 
usses for the strictly restorable cases and separate sec- 
ms for the non-restorable types. This can be done, by 
inging pupils together from adjacent schools. 
Dr. Cornman’s objection to the word “ ungraded” is 
Il taken. It is, of course, possible to do successful 
oup work in these classes and even class work when the 
pils are closely graded, and it is desirable to grade the 
pils as closely as possible for group instruction. Of 
is more anon. Nevertheless, there should always be a 
siderable amount of individualization in these classes 
a continuous study of each child’s peculiar obstacles 
shortages and of the best means of overcoming them. 
I have any preference for the word “ ungraded,” it is 
ly due to the fact that it does not involve any pre- 
ion or promise as to whether the child is to be restored 
grade, to be retained, or to be demoted to a special 
ool. 
he word “ orthogenic ” as applied to a special class is 
sfactory from the standpoint of the character of the 
cesses which we should apply rather than from the 
dpoint of the results which we actually achieve, for

it is notorious that we are not able to make the minds 
feeble-minded children function aright, or become orth 
If the application of the term carried the implication 
the parent that the mind of a feeble-minded child wot 
actually be transformed so that it would function ni 
mally, its use would be fraught with possible difficult 
for the schools. Parents are constantly insisting tk 
their children be restored to the grades. The basis of t 
clamor is not infrequently the injudicious promises ma 
by school officials, who, in order to induce parents to cc 
sent to the assignment of the child to a special scho 
hold forth the hope that he will soon be restored to t 
grades. In assigning pupils to special schools we shot 
avoid anything which tends to arouse false expectatio 
Utter frankness with the parents is imperative in a matt 
which means so much to them. In order to deal fais 
with parents in this field, the school should have in 
employ an official who can give authoritative judgment 
mentally handicapped cases, so that errors of assignme 
may be reduced to the minimum and so that parents c 
be reliably informed as to the probable future dispositi 
of the child in the school. 
While I do not think that this objection constitute 
formidable argument against the use of the word “ 
thogenic ” (the fact that it is partly a misnomer), it 
be pointed out that the same objection holds against “ 
thogenic class ” as against “ special class ”: orthogeni 
a generic concept. It applies equally well to spe 
corrective work— which is more successful — or 
other type of corrective work. I have previously sg 
gested the word orthophrenic as the specific concep 
apply to mental orthogenesis, in contradistinction to 
thosomatic, which applies to physical orthogen

ese words, however, are rather unusual, and will there- 
‘e probably not come into general use. 
After all, it is perhaps not a matter of prime impor- 
ice just what particular designations are adopted be- 
nd the fact that the words should provoke a minimum 
offense and of misapprehension, but it is very desirable 
it the terminology should be standardized throughout 
» country. This work might well be undertaken by the 
umittees on standardization of pedagogical nomencla- 
re of the various national educational associations. I 
ve been content to use the terms “special class” and 
ingraded class”? in the sense in which they are com- 
nly employed. 
Statement 3 
The establishment of elementary industrial schools was 
proved by practically all the respondents who expressed 
opinion, for those who indicated partial approval 
rely objected to certain features. One demurred 
ainst applying the word “industrial” to the schools 
templated in 3 and 4, because “it involves class dis- 
tion,” while two questioned the advisability of promot- 
any one “ genuinely subnormal in mental potentials ”

that the industrial work could be given in the special 
es. The majority (79%), however, approved the 
ration.

the ordinary special classes are: (1) the enforced as 
ciation between younger and older feeble-minded child 
of both sexes; and (2) the great expense involved in f 
nishing a large number of special classes or special schc 
with sufficient supplies, equipment, and tools to carry 
the varied forms of industrial and trade training wh 
should be afforded feeble-minded adolescents who ought 
be trained for useful service either in institutions, in 
home, or in society. Many boards in the larger ci 
might be willing to install adequate equipment in one 
two centers, when they would not consider for a mom 
the installation of a similar equipment in a dozen cent 
In consequence, the children would be compelled to ¢ 
tinue with the elementary and limited forms of hand w 
now generally given to the younger children. 
The elementary industrial school spoken of in 3 cot 
no doubt, be properly equipped for the needs of feel 
minded youths. But even thus it would be advisable 
keep the feeble-minded in separate divisions, if, for 
other, at least for social reasons. The most satisfact 
solution, I believe, is the establishment of a separate vo 
tional school for feeble-minded adolescents, possibly 
separate divisions for the two sexes. Preliminary pl 
have been considered for the establishment of such a sc’ 
in St. Louis.

he usually accepted connotation of the word. Two re- 
pondents felt that the teacher did not have time for the 
elfare work (evidently referring to social service). 
hree felt that a child requiring the attention of a nurse 
ould be kept at home with its mother and should not 
be imposed on any teacher who has a number of 
ildren under her care. There are some duties to be ex- 
cted from the mother.” One considered that a “ moth- 
ly matron” should be engaged for the nursing duties, 
ree considered that they should be performed by the 
hool attendant, two that they should be performed 
intly by the school nurse, attendant, and physician.

is well to point out, before leaving the subject of 
aded instruction, that the efficient organization of un-
-P-A-G-E-318
302 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
graded classes may present a rather complicated adminis 
trative problem, partly because of the wide divergence it 
the ages and capacities of the proper candidates for thes: 
classes and partly because of the difficulty of bringing to 
gether in the same class homogeneous groups of pupil. 
From the standpoint of the most efficient conduct of th 
instruction, it would be advisable to organize three sep 
rate ungraded classes. These three classes, howeve 
would be quite differently constituted according to t 
basis of organization adopted. It is possible to group t! 
pupils, in two ways: first, according to the degree of me: 
tal handicap or according to the degree of prospecti 
amelioration; and, second, according to the grade 
school work done by the pupils who require special aij 
According to the first criterion we should get the followi 
classes: one for the restoration type of pupils, one for t! 
backward, and one for the borderline. According to t 
second classification we should have one class, say f 
pupils doing work in the first, second, and third grad 
one for pupils doing work in the fourth and fifth grad, 
and one for pupils in the sixth, seventh, and eighth grad|

with a sufficient number of ungraded pupils to necessit 
the organization of three classes. Either plan could

three classes are made to serve a given district, one ¢ 
could be located in one school, another in a second sch

ment and the proper facilities for doing the best wor

ag. This would make it possible to carry on a certain 
mount of departmental work, particularly in physical 
aining and in sensory, motor, and manual training. It 
ould permit of greater freedom in the organization of 
e school activities and would make it easier to develop 
e proper esprit de corps in ungraded-class work. The 
lethods of individual instruction and the spirit of work 
these classes should be patterned after the best stand- 
ds of work obtaining in the special schools for the feeble- 
inded. 
It would seem advisable, however, to locate the ungraded 
sses or the ungraded center in the regular grade build- 
, so that the pupils may enjoy the advantages of asso- 
tion with normal children, particularly during the play 
‘iod, and so that segregation in a detached center may 
exaggerate the presumption that they are markedly 
erent from other pupils.? 
t should be recognized that there are advantages as 
as disadvantages attaching to each one of the forms 
lass organization suggested above. If we group the 
dren according to their status in the grade work, we 
liable to get three types of cases in the same class: 
erline, backward, and restoration. This makes it 
ult properly to differentiate the work to meet the in- 
ual needs, particularly if the children must be taught 
‘oups, as will usually be the case on account of the 
of the classes. While the program of work for the 
ration cases should be patterned after the work in 
regular grades, the training provided for the un-    
     
    
          
     
          
       
       
      
          is recognized, of course, that there are pupils who need special 
mly in one or two branches during one or two periods a day, while 
the rest of the day they are able to do successful work in the

restorable backward and borderline children should b 
patterned more and more after the best models of special 
class work. While the backward and borderline pupi 
should be given more literary instruction than is, 
should be, offered in the special schools, they should 
given a large amount of the sensorimotor, physical, a: 
manu-mental training which is now given in properly o 
ganized special classes, 
However, we would emphasize that, in the case of you: 
borderline or backward children, say from six to eigl 
years of age, every advantage should at first be afford 
in the regular literary studies. But after two or thr 
years of intensive academic work has shown that the chi 
does not possess any aptitude in the abstract and litera: 
work, the different forms of hand work should be 
creased. The hand work should be given so far as p 
sible in correlation with the literary work. It sho 
furnish a means of vivifying and motivating the liter 
work and rendering it concrete and intelligible. Theh 
work will furnish vital centers of interest and cores 
correlation. 
On the other hand, if we group the children accord 
to their degree of restorability, we shall have border! 
cases of various chronological ages in one class, bal 
ward children of various ages in another class, and si 
larly for the restoration cases. Under this plan of cla)

his declaration was approved by all except three, who 
ected to the first sentence: “ Why recognize theoret- 
lly the goal mentioned when we no longer consider such 
possible of attainment?”? The reason for recog- 
ing such a goal theoretically is to provide a loophole 
r the escape of children who have been misdiagnosed and 
it improperly to a special class. The argument that 
such loophole is necessary, since it can soon be de- 
‘mined by the child’s work in the special schools whether 
not he is feeble-minded, is not entirely conclusive. 
1e fact that it is impossible to restore a child to the 
ides does not prove that he is feeble-minded or that he 
longs in the special school. It may only prove that he 
backward and that he belongs in an ungraded class. 
ere are types of backwardness that are just as 
ediable as feeble-mindedness. That is why we find 
any special classes throughout the country backward 
ren who are mistakenly classified as feeble-minded 
who should be in a different type of class. However, 
s significant that there is complete unanimity among 
lcators experienced in the problems, that the aims to 
realized in the education of children who are actually 
le-minded (or even borderline or seriously backward)

shall we interpret the not infrequent claims that from 5 
to 25% of the pupils from the special classes are bei 
returned to grade? This either means that the puy 
were not feeble-minded or near feeble-minded and the 
fore were out of place in the special class, or that th 
have been returned to one of the lower grades.* 
Statement 8 
This is the first statement in which there is a signific: 
difference between the responses from St. Louis and fr 
the other cities. The declaration is approved by all - 
14 respondents from the other cities who answered, « 
qualifying his approval with the statement that the “ p 
portions were not quite acceptable,” while one added tl 
“in institutions too little time is given to academic wo 
in the public special classes too much.” 
Fifteen (44%) of the St. Louis teachers approved : 
proportions without qualification, One approved 
proportion for children “needing permanent custod 
care.” One contended that the matter should be left : 
tirely to the teacher’s discretion: ‘It is absurd to | 
to specify by per cents the time to be devoted to 
different forms of work. . . . The teachers who are gi 
charge of these children have some sense and judgm| 
as to what quantities of time different children requi:

vary with the grade of the children: give them as muc! 
they can master. Two said that one-fourth to one-tl 
academic work was not enough, two adding that this 
        
     1 We recognize, of course, that small school systems which have 
for only one special class will have to be content with a combined 
cial-ungraded class, subserving the functions of both classes. 
' where it is possible to organize two or more classes the feeble-mij 
and backward children should be placed in different classes.

      GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND FACTS 307     
t sufficient under present conditions. Six said there 
ould be 50% of academic work, one adding that public 
inion demands this much. Two gave the proportion 
one third to one half, one 35% to 50%, and one two 
ths to one half. 
Table XXII gives the per cent of time devoted to the 
rious branches in the special schools in a number of 
ies throughout the country. 
Almost one half of the pupils’ time has been given to 
rely literary work. There are various reasons why so 
ich time has been given to the regular grade work. 
First, the insistent demand on the part of parents that 
> child be taught to read, cipher, and write. Parents 
‘ognize that these accomplishments are of basic impor- 
ace in social life. The ability to read, write, and cipher 
newhat can be used as a cloak to conceal many defects, 
ile a child who cannot do these things is at once classi- 
1 as “illiterate.” Hence, “If you can’t teach John 
thing else, teach him to read, write, and figure. That 
all I care about.” 
econd, the demand sometimes made by the parents and 
times made by the school authorities that the child 
uld be “* coached back” into the regular grades — an 
ustifiable aim of special-class work. 
hird, the belief on the part of parents, teachers, and 
ers that there is a special virtue in literary instruc- 
3 it furnishes the best means of developing the brains 
minds of mental defectives. The probability, how- 
, is that motor training is a better cerebral adjuvant 
literary gymnastics for the feeble-minded. 
‘ourth, the claim frequently made by teachers in these 
ses that special-class children do profit from a large 
unt of literary instruction. Most admit that this is

is conceded that it is possible by repeated drill to d 
velop mechanical command of the elements of the literar 
branches. But it is denied that this raises appreciabl 
the intelligence level of the feeble-minded child; it doe 
not develop any form of skill by which he can directl 
earn his living; the mechanical control of the literar 
rudiments does not endow him with the discretion an 
judgment needed to maintain his position in the socic 
industrial world. No one denies that the child has nee 
for certain literary controls in many of his employment: 
But it is contended that he can be given a command o 
those elements which will actually function in his socis 
life, which he will be able to employ in earning his living 
in much less time than is now devoted to the literary ir 
struction. This time which could be saved from th 
literary instruction should be devoted to perfecting th 
child in different forms of practical hand work. 
Such is the argument of the proponents of the indus 
trialization of the special-class curriculum. The dom 
nant tendency today is unquestionably in tune with thi 
thought. The feeling amounts almost to conviction tha 
the public schools are now wasting millions of dolla 
in the aggregate on worthless literary instruction f 
feeble-minded children. But it is a far cry to conclu 
from this that all the literary work should be eliminat 
from the special classes. I do not foresee the time wh 
we shall ever realize such a goal in the training of t 
feeble-minded in the public schools. But the amount 
literary work could very profitably be greatly reduced 
most special classes in the United States where the admi 
sions are limited to feeble-minded pupils.

Statement 9 
Here, again, we find a marked difference in the replies 
from St. Louis and the other cities. All the respondents 
in the latter group sent favorable replies except one, who 
mphasized the practical difficulty of examining all the 
ntrants and the parental objection to the transfer of all 
ut very low-grade cases. Among the St. Louis respond- 
nts 41% approved the suggestion, 32% disapproved it, 
nd 26% partly approved it. One was in favor of ad- 
itting these young cases provided they could be clearly 
ecognized, one provided there was no other provision for 
lhem, and one provided they were placed in a special 
indergarten. On the other hand, eight would give them 
eir initial opportunity with normal children in the 
indergarten or first grade, unless, according to two, the 
ild was of very low mentality. Two of these would 
st give them at least a year in the kindergarten, while 
e would keep them in the kindergarten from 5 to 7. 
lwo questioned the advisability of using the public funds 
r training children of. such low mentality, because, as 
e expressed it, if the child is “ recognized so young it 
icates a very low grade of mentality.” Two would 
the minimal mental level at 6; while five would require 
least a five-year mentality, for the reason that a de- 
tive of less than five cannot attend to his physical 
nts, or he cannot take care of himself or find his way 
or from school, or mothers would hesitate to let him 
e from any distance. ; 
n St. Louis we have adopted the following policy. No 
le-minded child is admitted to a special class with a 
tality of less than five years (except that he may be 
itted on one month’s probation if he is approximately
-P-A-G-E-332
  816 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
five years). An older child of low mentality, say an idio 
or a low or middle grade imbecile, is excluded entirel. 
from the public schools. A younger child with a me 
tality of a middle-grade imbecile may be retained in 
regular kindergarten provided he does not become a di: 
ciplinary problem. If he becomes too troublesome he j 
excluded from attendance in the public schools, althoug 
he might later be entered in a special class if he attai 
the requisite eligibility mentality. We recognize, 
course, that these children are out of place in a kinde 
garten for normal children, but the difficulty of tran: 
porting them to a separate primary special school is i 
superable. Even if this difficulty could be overcome, t! 
question must be considered whether it would be jus 
fiable to use the public funds to provide a very expensij 
form of education and care for children who are so 
pendent upon the ministrations of others. When 
younger retardate grades above the kindergarten sta 
pedagogically and it cannot be determined with certain| 
at the time of the examination that his mental deficien 
amounts to feeble-mindedness, he is placed at the out: 
in an ungraded class if it chances that such a class 
available. 
Incidentally two of the respondents suggested that 
child who has gone beyond the third grade should be 
mitted into a special school. We have discussed in Ch 
ter I the question of the upper limit of ability for spec: 
class candidates,

63% of the respondents approved, 20% disappro

   e in the public schools. ‘They are institutional cases 
nd should be segregated permanently as soon as found. 
s long as the public will furnish day schools for them, 
o long it may.” ‘Two others, who approved of the 
ideal” special school, probably held the same view. 
‘our would admit no one lower than a low-grade moron, 
me because it is the duty of the city and the state to care 
x the others and one because the parents object to the 
sociation of their children with low-grade cases. Two 
ould admit none lower than high-grade imbeciles, one for 
e reason that it is the parents’ obligation to care for 
lower grades, while six would draw the limiting level 
middle-grade imbecility, the suggestion in the text, 
ich thus is approved by the majority. On the other 
nd, one would admit pupils regardless of the “ degree 
defect if they can be trained as designated in the latter 
rt of 7. One would admit the lower grades provided 
re is no other provision for them, and one provided 
y are placed in nursery kindergartens. 
nquestionably it is eminently desirable that the public 
ools should be relieved of the heavy burden of caring 
feeble-minded children, in order that all their resources 
ly be devoted to the training of normal (i.e., not feeble- 
ded) children. But it is difficult, if not impossible, to 
lize this laudable desire. These children are here 
mg us. Shall we train them or shall we neglect them? 
s question was definitely answered over a hundred 
irs ago, and it is not probable that modern education 
philanthropy will backtrack. The only question, 
, is: Where shall we train humanity’s waste pro- 
? The proposed answer is: In the state institu- 
s. In theory this may be the best solution, in prac- 
it is unattainable. First, because it is impossible

   positively to diagnose many children as feeble-minded un 
til they have spent many years in the public schools. A 
Pearson and Jaederholm point out, many cannot be diag} 
nosed as feeble-minded before the age of 9, the age whic! 
approximates the upper mental limit of the mass of th 
higher grades of the feeble-minded. There are some case} 
that cannot be identified until they reach the teens. It j 
therefore idle to talk about the exclusion of all the feebl 
minded children from the public schools. 
Second, it will be very difficult to induce legislators 
enact state laws which will compel the commitment of t 
high-grade cases; and even if such laws were enacted, 
would be comparatively easy to get “experts” to 
on the stand and testify that the child was not feebl 
minded. I do not think we can hope for any such legis] 
tion so long as American diagnosticians proceed on the 
sumption that the line of feeble-mindedness is fixed betwe 
XI and XIII years—an assumption which has be 
challenged in the first two chapters. 
Third, it is not imperative, much less desirable, to co 
mit all feeble-minded children to institutions or coloni 
Many parents who are able adequately to support a 
protect their feeble-minded progeny should be permit 
to do so as long as they can. The children are better 
in a good home than in an institution. Moreover, it} 
the parents’ obligation rather than society’s. Child 
who cannot be properly environed at home should be fo 
bly committed. But if the state is ready to support 
educate feeble-minded children who have been thus c 
» mitted, shall the public schools refuse to train those 
are being supported by their parents? 
Fourth, it is cheaper to train these children in the 
lic schools than to train and support them in the i
-P-A-G-E-335

    tions before they are able to render any economic re- 
rns. From the standpoint of economy it would seem 
tter for the public schools to train feeble-minded chil- 
en until they arrive at the socially dangerous period, 
d then transfer the institutional cases to the colonies 
ere they can be assigned profitable work at the very 
itset. 
‘ifth, no state in the Union has adequate custodial 
ommodations for all its feeble-minded dependents. It 
ot probable that this situation will be radically altered 
a long time to come in the majority of states. If, 
ause of present exigencies, the children cannot be com- 
ted to a state colony, shall we then add to their bur- 
s and refuse to help them to develop the few powers 
ch they possess? 
e training of the feeble-minded imposes a heavy 
den upon the public schools. But can the schools 
k the obligation so long as our social system permits 
e children to be born among us or to immigrate to us 
foreign lands? 
Statement 11 
his proposition was approved by the large majority. 
hose who expressed partial approval or disapproval, 
felt that this is the duty of the state and not of the 
cipality or the city school system. ‘Three expressed 
‘oval, but one felt that we have no legal means to 
a child permanently, one felt that parents would 
commit the disciplinary and helpless cases, and the 
institution would meet the needs of these, while one 
ot believe that the institution could be made self- 
rting. 
o arguments for a city colony are: (1) the state

       institutional provisions for the feeble-minded are inad 
quate everywhere; (2) many of the state institutions a: 
located too far away. Parents are more ready to comm 
their children if the institution is near by, so that it c 
be visited frequently. The distinction between the stati 
and the city’s obligation in respect to the feeble-mind 
is largely academic or a matter of convenience, provi 
the taxes are properly apportioned. Is not the care 
the feeble-minded just as truly an obligation for ea 
populous community to assume in accordance with its o 
needs as the care of the insane in city and county h 
pitals? But if this position should be regarded as 
tenable, it is the duty of the state to locate traini 
schools near the large centers of population so that t 
can be made readily accessible to the parents who m' 
use them. 
As we have stated elsewhere, we believe that train 
institutions for the feeble-minded, because they pres 
chiefly an educational problem, should be under the su 
vision of the departments of instruction (state or city 
cording as the institutions are state or municipal), 
should be administered by an educator who is not 
professionally trained in education, but who is an ex 
on the psychological, pedagogical, and social aspect 
feeble-mindedness. 
Statement 12 
This proposition was approved by all the respond 
from cities other than St. Louis, who sent replies, but 
by 58% of the St. Louis teachers. However, only 
of the St. Louis teachers indicated distinct disappr 
while 35% indicated partial approval. Six disappr| 
of the commercial aspect, two disapproved unless the

    rnished the material, three disapproved because it causes 
ivalry, and one because selling child-made articles is not 
ractical. Four expressed approval of the idea of 
aking supplies for school use, two of the domestic- 
‘ience activities (one, provided they were done in a pre- 
cational or vocational school), and two approved of the 
ildren making things for their own use (one stipulating 
at they should pay for the materials). One thought 
is work was feasible in an institution, but not in a day 
ool. Two approved the practical emphasis but felt 
lat the work the pupils could do was too crude. One 
ified approval for the type of work which the pupils 
do “ without the teacher having to do the first half.” 
e do not think that the sale of articles made in spe- ' 
1 classes is objectionable if the proceeds are used for 
further enrichment of the work or for partially de- 
ying the cost of the supplies. Moreover, some of the 
icles made by the more mature and intelligent of the 
mormal children are indistinguishable from those made 
normal children. 
Statement 13 
mly one person rejected out and out this recommenda- 
; namely, on the ground that the scheme loads “ too 
t a burden on the schools, and many of the teachers 
give data concerning the pupils who have left the 
ial schools.” Two felt that this work was very de- 
le, but impractical because of the great expense, 
two felt that it should be extended so as to embrace 
hole school system. One suggested that the labora- 
worker and the after-care officer should have separ- 
‘unctions.

THE OBLIGATION OF THE SCHOOLS FOR THE TRAINING 
OF FEEBLE-MINDED CHILDREN 
While we may say that the prevention and the eliminati 
of the feeble-minded are the fundamental obligation of soci 
with respect to this class of social incompetents, it is rec 
nized that society cannot, from the standpoint of its o 
well-being, evade the necessity of caring for, supervising, 
protecting the feeble-minded already born into the state. 
question as to whether or not feeble-minded children sho’ 
be educated, in addition to being cared for, may be said 
have been settled in the early part of the last century w 
it was demonstrated by Itard, Seguin, Guggenbiihl, Sae 
and their followers that the feeble-minded could be impro’ 
and rendered more or less self-supporting and law-abiding 
systematic training. The obligation of providing a pract 
type of training for feeble-minded children, so that they 
be made to contribute their little mite to the world’s work, 
now been assumed by all of the leading civilized nations of 
earth. The only question now at issue is whether this 
should be assumed by residential schools under state, cou: 
or municipal control or by public-school day classes. Pr 
cally this question has largely solved itself, for since so 
has agreed that these children must be educated, there i 
option but to train them in the public day classes, becaus' 
provisions afforded by the residential institutions are ent: 
inadequate, and are likely to remain so for some time to c 
Moreover, it is more economical to train these pupils i 
public day classes than in the residential schools where 
would have to be housed and fed at public expense.

  GENERAL PRINCIPLES AND FACTS 323 
cognized, however, that some defectives ought to be trained 
institutions, either because they are so low grade that they 
nnot betake themselves to the day classes, or because they 
e not properly environed at home, while others should be 
rmanently colonized at the puberal period for remunerative 
rvice, because they cannot be guaranteed adequate protective 
ersight in the home and threaten to become a social menace. 
It is now generally recognized, however, that feeble-minded 
pils should not be educated in the regular grades of the pub- 
schools but in separate schools or classes, both because 
y injuriously affect and seriously obstruct the progress of 
normal pupils, and because they receive little benefit from 
instruction afforded in the regular grades. In conse- 
lence of this fact, the following recommendations are offered: 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS 
. It is recommended that the special classes or special 
ols, as here defined, should be designed exclusively for 
ble-minded pupils. By a feeble-minded child is meant one 
suffers from a serious and permanent condition of ar- 
ed brain development dating from birth or from early 
, by reason of which even the highest grades of children 
affected are rarely able satisfactorily to do school work 
ond the third grade and rarely reach a mentality of ten 
's, and by reason of which children so affected will find it 
ult to acquire sufficient competency to perform their social 
industrial obligations in society without proper super- 
m. By means of suitable mental tests and scales of men- 
evelopment and a consideration of the physical, develop- 
tal, hereditary, pedagogical, and social factors it is pos- 
to diagnose feeble-minded children with considerable 
racy, to differentiate various degrees of feeble-mindedness, 
to differentiate between feeble-minded and backward 
ren. Children who are on the borderline between feeble- 
ledness and pronounced backwardness and mentally back-

ward children should be assigned to special schools only whe} 
special circumstances render this necessary. 3 
2. Negatively, the special classes are not intended to 
clearing houses for all kinds of pedagogical misfits. Speci! 
cally, the following types of misfit pupils are not eligikle f 
a special class, unless they are so deficient in mental capaci 
as to be feeble-minded: first, pedagogically retarded or ove| 
age pupils; second, blind or semi-blind, and deaf or se 
deaf pupils; third, speech defectives; fourth, disciplinar 
morally unstable, or truant cases; and fifth, foreign childr 
unfamiliar with English. 
8. While it is desirable to segregate feeble-minded pup’ 
for special treatment at the very beginning of their sch 
careers, provided they have been positively diagnosed 
feeble-minded, it is recognized that this involves serious di 
culties of an administrative and pedagogical nature. It 
therefore, recommended that the minimal entrance requi 
ment to a special school should be a mentality of five yea 
or a mental status corresponding to that of the mid 
grade imbecile, except that doubtful or borderline cases (ij 
those almost reaching a mentality of five years) may be 
mitted upon probation for a period not to exceed f 
weeks. 
4. The aim of the training provided in the special clas 
not merely to afford increased opportunities for individ 
assistance or instruction, but to provide such differenti 
types of work as will meet the peculiar mental, pedagogi 
moral, social, industrial, and physical needs of feeble-min| 
children, and which will maximally stimulate and dev 
those powers, aptitudes, and interests which they poss 
The special class is not instituted for coaching in the lite: 
branches, but for the purpose of providing a program of 
so individualized as to meet the developing needs of

dren according to their mentality and thus successfully to 
group instruction in various branches, it is recognized tha

eed for differentiation both in the methods and in the con- 
nts of instruction is greater for subnormal than for normal 
upils. For this reason special-class teachers and supervisors 
quire special training not merely in the details of the recog- 
‘ized methods of the corrective or remedial pedagogy of the 
ibnormal but also in the wider theoretical foundations of 
cational psychology and the psychology of subnormality, 
that they may be able independently to psychologize each 
ild and thereby continuously to modify and adapt the train- 
ig to meet the changing requirements of the individual. In 
der to obtain teachers and supervisors who are properly 
alified to carry on the work of instruction according to these 
als, it is necessary to offer higher salaries for special-class 
rk than for régular-grade work, so that teachers may be 
luced properly to prepare themselves for this highly spe- 
lized form of service. 
. Special classes are not restoration classes. It is not the 
of special-class work to restore feeble-minded children 
normality or to a place in the regular grades. It is found 
practice that, even with our best efforts, this restoration 
cannot be realized except in a small proportion of cases 
ding above the feeble-minded status. Our aim, therefore, 
0 supply the feeble-minded continuously with a special 
gram of work in special classes. It sometimes happens, 
ever, that backward children are assigned to special 
ols. Such pupils should be restored as soon as possible 
ither the graded or the ungraded classes or they should 
ransferred to an elementary industrial school. 
. The guiding principle in the organization of the course 
tudy for feeble-minded children should be the practical 
ty of the subject matter offered. Because of the fact that 
training of the feeble-minded requires a heavy financial 
y by the schools, and because of the fact that the care, 
rol, and support of the feeble-minded imposes a heavy 
len upon society, it is desirable that we should concen- 
our time and effort upon lines of work which will

    maximally increase their productive efficiency, and which wi 
render them as happy as possible in their restricted world 
opportunity. 
7. It has been found in practice that these aims are be 
realized by providing a preponderance of sensory, moto 
physical, manual, vocational, and musical training and a mi 
mum of literary work of a distinctly elementary, concrete, a 
practical nature. 
8. It is recommended that the relative amount of time 
voted to the various activities in the special classes be a) 
portioned as follows: academic, 35%; manual, 33% ; physi 
training, 10% ; sensory training, 4% ; opening exercises, 9 
and recess, 9%. It is felt, however, that these divisio| 
should represent a general tendency, rather than an inflexil 
norm to be applied indiscriminately to all children in 
special schools. Some children should be given still m 
manual work, because they acquire few useful literary ski 
while others may be given more literary work if they have 
capacity to profit enough from it to justify the added 
penditure of time and effort. 
9. It is recommended that, in order to reduce as far 
possible the expenses of special classes to the community, 
in order to provide opportunities for the children in th| 
classes to acquire the habit of doing things which hav 
direct utilitarian value both to themselves and to societ; 
part of the craft.work offered should consist in making aj 
cles or supplies which are of use to the pupils themselves 
to the schools; or which can be sold, the proceeds to re’ 
to the special schools for the purchase of materials or for 
use of excursions. To illustrate: the girls could prepare 
serve daily lunches to be offered at cost to the pupils 
wished them, or they could prepare hot lunches for t! 
selves from their own supplies; they could repair and 
some of their wearing apparel; make bandages, towels, 
for the school, wash the school dishes, towels, ete. The 
could manufacture some of the didactic materials needed i

kindergarten, sensorimotor, and industrial forms of work, and 
they could make some of the regular supplies and furnish- 
ings needed in any of the buildings. 
10. There should be established a vocational or trade class 
lor school equipped to provide economically useful forms of 
industrial training for special-class boys and girls when they 
each the age of from 12 to 14. 
11. Owing to the inadequate care and supervision afforded 
any feeble-minded children in the homes and the physical 
nd moral dangers to which they are exposed on the streets 
nd alleys, where many of them spend the late afternoons, 
tt would be well if feeble-minded children could be retained 
mn the school premises until 5 p.M., either for relaxation, 
creation, or light occupational employments. In such an 
vent it would be well to close the regular program of studies 
lomewhat earlier, for the reason that these children do not 
ap much benefit from prolonged application to work re- 
iring concentrated attention; in fact, such work frequently 
es them harm. It would also be necessary to employ an 
sistant to supervise the activities of the children after the 
lose of the regular session. 
12. Provision should be made for the after-care or after- 
idance of the pupils who are not properly environed, and 
10 must go to work when they leave the special classes. 
ch provision is needed both for the purpose of saving as 
y children as possible from failure, and for the purpose of 
thering reliable data bearing on the success of our school 
‘orts, at great expense, to train these children and bearing 
their ability to take their places in society. Among the 
cific functions of such a department would be the follow- 
: (1) To make a vocational survey of positions available 
the community for mentally deficient children (positions 
ich come within their limited range of capacity, and in 
lich the surrounding social conditions are such as not to 
ose too great strain on their weak moral natures). The 
jools need to know the kinds of work in which these chil-

       dren can make good, so that they may more efficiently train 
them for remunerative work. (2) To aid the children to ob- 
tain situations suited to their limitations and to keep them 
employed in such situations. (3) To explain the children’s 
limitations to employers, so that they may take more persona 
interest in their welfare and extend them greater sympathy 
(4) To protect the children from moral and economic ex: 
ploitation, and safeguard them from criminalistic careers whe 
the parents fail adequately so to do. (5) To advise parent: 
concerning measures necessary to be taken for the child’ 
future social and economic welfare (frequently the need o 
colonization). And (6) to gather reliable data on the after 
careers of the children who leave our special classes, so thai 
in the future the schools and other social agencies may mor 
intelligently deal with the numerous perplexing problem 
which confront society because of the fact that many of i 
members must always remain children in mind though havin; 
the bodies, instincts, and passions of adults. 
Adequately to perform this service would require the a) 
pointment of one or more social or industrial advisers, pre: 
erably working in conjunction with the psycho-education 
clinic and the attendance department. [If the schools are n 
ready to inaugurate this work, even as a temporary mea 
ure, it is suggested that it would be well to invite the cod 
erative aid of public-welfare organizations in this underta 
ing.] 
13. In order to provide for the institutional needs of tl 
feeble-minded of St. Louis, there should be established ne! 
St. Louis a residential institution of the colony type eit! 
under state or municipal control or under the control of 4] 
public schools. 
14. Efforts should be made to secure the enactment

tutions those children who have been definitely diagnosed

for the diagnosis of the cases and the juvenile court for the 
commitment. 
UNGRADED CLASSES 
15. These classes are intended for the following types of 
hildren: (1) Restoration Cases. This refers to children of 
ood mentality who are pedagogically retarded for various 
easons, such as late entrance, frequent transfers, frequent 
bsence, serious illness, indifference, or lack of application. 
ith children of this type the problem is to provide coaching 
in the regular curriculum of studies, or in the literary branches 
in which they are particularly weak, so that they may be re- 
rurned as soon as possible to the regular grades. (2) Back- 
ard Cases. This refers to pupils who are not only peda- 
‘ogically but also genuinely mentally backward. These chil- 
ren, while not feeble-minded, are so lacking in mental 
rength that it is only rarely that they can be restored to the 
gular grades. While provision should be made at the out- 
+ for these pupils for a larger amount of hand work than 
in be given in the regular grades, during the early years the 
phasis should be placed upon the regular-grade curriculum 
studies. As they grow older many, perhaps most, of the 
ckward pupils should be given an increasing amount of 
dustrial arts work, and eventually, say at about the age of 
or 14, should be recommended for training in an elementary 
lustrial or vocational school. (3) Borderline Cases. This 
fers to pupils who at the time of assignment cannot with 
tainty be diagnosed as feeble-minded. Such pupils should 
given the benefit of the doubt and be assigned to ungraded 
sses rather than to special schools. Some of these pupils 
1 prove on later examination to be feeble-minded, and will 
nm be transferred to special schools. Others will prove 
be backward, and will be retained in the ungraded classes. 
cording to the above plan of organization the ungraded 
ss instead of the special schools will serve as a clearing

house, in conjunction with the psycho-educational clinic, for 
cases of doubtful mentality. 
Among the reasons why the ungraded types of pupils, par- 
ticularly those designated above as backward and the border- 
line, should not be permitted to linger in the regular grades 
are the following: first, because they interfere with the prog- 
ress of the normal pupils, second, because they cannot re- 
ceive in the regular grades the assistance which they require, 
in consequence of which, third, they become discouraged with 
their school work, form the habit of failure, and drift into| 
idleness and delinquency. 
16. It is recommended that the registration in the regula: 
ungraded classes be limited to from 15 to 25 pupils, dependin, 
on the grade of intelligence and the homogeneity of the class 
and that a sufficient number of these classes be organized 
make it possible to carry out the recommendations of th 
psycho-educational clinic, or to provide for the needs of thi 
ungraded types of pupils in the schools. 
17. These classes should be distributed in different grad 
buildings according to the varying needs in different section| 
of the city. In many schools one class will suffice, in a fe 
schools two or more classes will be needed; in some sectio: 
two or three schools can depend on one class. In most schoo! 
it will probably be advisable to keep the children in the cla: 
all day long, while in other schools different groups of chi 
dren may be taken for individual instruction in their we: 
branches during one or two recitation periods per day. 
18. Teachers and supervisors should qualify for the 
classes by pursuing courses similar to those required by teac! 
ers in special schools, and should be given an increase 
salary. These teachers must be extremely versatile; th 
should be thoroughly familiar with the curriculum from p: 
mary to grammar grades, including different forms of ha: 
work and physical training; they must be able to study 
peculiar defects and needs of each child, and to individual: 
their instruction to meet the varying conditions found.

    19. The elementary industrial or vocational school is de- 
signed to meet the industrial and vocational needs of young 
adolescents of both sexes of the following types: (1) The 
ungraded types of backward cases, as above defined. (2) 
Children of good or fair mentality who are retarded or dis- 
interested in the literary subjects of study but who have 
ability in, and inclination for, motor forms of work. (3) 
Many disciplinary cases of backward or fair mentality who do 
not respond to the literary subjects but who would respond 
to various forms of handwork. (4) Children who may not 
ibe pedagogically retarded but who look forward to a career in 
ithe crafts or trades, and who, because they may be obliged to 
leave school early for work, ought to be given opportunities 
or industrial training, should they desire them. 
20. It is recommended that a school be organized to afford 
industrial and vocational training to girls and boys of the 
bove types.

  THE PROBLEM OF THE F'EEBLE-MINDED IN [Ts 
EpucaTIONAL AND SocraL BrEarines *      
  EEBLE-MINDEDNESS is a permanent condition of 
mental feebleness, and not an active disease process} 
or a remediable malady. Consequently the problem o 
feeble-mindedness is fundamentally educational and social 
And since the schools are but the instrument of society. 
constituted to do its bidding, the interests of the school: 
and of society in the feeble-minded are identical. Thi 
is my excuse for presenting the following brief before thi 
council of “ 54 varieties ” of women’s clubs. 
There are three basic phases of the problem of th 
feeble-minded to which I invite your attention. 
The first is the obligation of society to identify an 
register as early as possible all feeble-minded childre 
born into the state. Society has not yet assumed t 
duty in a satisfactory manner, largely because of t 
failure of society to appreciate the social menace of t 
feeble-minded class. While I believe that the criticism 
well taken that we are sometimes inclined to exaggera 
the real or potential menace of this class of social mi 
fits, ? it is probably true that few other distinctly menta. 
or physically abnormal classes of persons constitute 
more serious potential menace to our social well-being a

subnormal delinquents among children are backward rather than 
ble-minded, while the notable excess in the delinquent group comp 
with the non-delinquent group of retarded children is in the backw 
category.

to our racial integrity than the feeble-minded. All 
students of social problems will at least concede that 
eeble-mindedness is one of the fundamental causes of our 
umerous social ills. It is a prolific source of poverty, 
lestitution, all kinds of crime against property and per- 
ons, alcoholism, social immorality, illegitimacy, and of 
rolifict and degenerate progeny. There are few problems 
In present-day constructive social economics which are 
ore important than the development of a state-wide and 
ation-wide policy for the compulsory official identifica- 
ion and registration of feeble-minded children, particu- 
rly all those who come from homes where the conditions 
re not such as to guarantee continuous supervision and 
pport. 
In order to achieve this result it is necessary to estab- 
h clinics or clearing houses where the feeble-minded may 
diagnosed and registered. These clinics must be 
mned by persons who are trained and experienced ex- 
rts in the subject of feeble-mindedness. While the 
inics should provide for the physical and hereditary 
laminations of the suspected cases, and of their social 
ironment, their central function must be the direct 
ting of mentality, particularly the stage of develop- 
nt of the intelligence, for there is no direct examination, 
er than psychological, of feeble-mindedness. How 
h clinics should be supported, controlled, administered, 
      
    
         
    
     
     
     
        
     
   
   
     
    
    (However, it is doubtful whether the fertility rate per se is higher 
feeble-minded than for normal women. The Kallikak family yields 
descendants in the illegitimate line (feeble-minded), but 496 in the 
al line of descent. Four hundred and thirty-seven descendants 
been traced in the Garland family on the illegitimate, defective 
as against 496 on the legitimate, normal side. In Pearson’s sta- 
s the average size of the family for various classes of normal peo-

answered. In New York City clearing houses for mental 
defectives are supported by the Police Department, the 
College of the City of New York, the New York Neurolog- 
ical Institute, Vanderbilt Clinic, and other agencies. The 
establishment of state clearing houses for the mentally 
deficient in different parts of the state was authorized by| 
the New York legislature in 1916. This represents th 
most comprehensive state-wide effort to identify th 
feeble-minded. (Since this was written the governor ha: 
vetoed the bill.) In Seattle clinics have been establishe 
in the juvenile court, in the public schools, and in the Uni; 
versity of Washington. The clinical psychologist in th 
University spends a part of his time in the state examinin 
children. In Boston clinics are supported by the munici

Philadelphia is served by the clinics in the University

schools, one in the courts, and one in the House of Co 
rection), two by the University of Chicago, and one (

established a state clinic under the jurisdiction of t

iew that the most satisfactory plan is the establishment 
f public clinics in connection with the state department 
f education and the large city school systems, because 
f the fact that all children who live long enough eventu- 
lly become charges of the public schools (aside from

use of the fact that the second fundamental obligation 
the state toward the feeble-minded can only be dis- 
arged by the schools, or by institutions which should be 
ganized and conducted as schools. 
his obligation is the proper educational care and 
aining of feeble-minded children. The adequate dis- 
arge of this obligation involves segregating the feeble- 
inded in special classes as early as they can be indubita- 
diagnosed ® and providing for them the type of train- 
A list of payehological clinics will be found in The Mental Health 
the School Child, p. 22f. 
My only fear is that the public and state schools, because of their 
salary schedules, will not be able to command the services of qual- 
id experts. Too many of the schools at the present time are satisfied 
leave this important and difficult work to amateurs — Binet testers 
inspectors of hygiene who have not specialized in the field. The 
rts, hospitals, state institutions for defectives, or public depart- 
its of charities or correction would probably more adequately com- 
ate an expert in this field than would the public schools. The head 
clinic on subnormal children should command as high a salary as 
superintendent of a state hospital, the head of a department of 
lic charities, or the judge of a court. 
Probably no one who possesses adequate practical experience in the 
cult task of closely differentiating between feeble-minded and 
ward children in a public-school system would countenance the oft 
ated statement that the feeble-minded child should be segregated

ousands of feeble-minded children who cannot thus early be diag- 
d with any degree of certainty. In fact, the diagnosis of the high-

     ing which will maximally develop those powers and apt: 
tudes which they possess and which will maximally equi 
them for earning their livelihood. There is apparently 
substantial consensus of opinion among authorities on t 
feeble-minded that it is folly to provide the same curri 
ulum of studies for them as for normal children, on t 
mistaken supposition that the proper aims to be striv 
for in the training of the feeble-minded are to resto 
them to mental normality and to a place in the regul: 
grades, for it is quite certain that these aims can ney 
be realized if the cases have been correctly diagnos: 
And yet we find that many of the special classes throu 
out the country still provide a pabulum of literary wo 
which is suitable for normal and retarded children, 
which has little value for feeble-minded children, beca 
at most it gives them merely a thin coat of literary vene| 
which, indeed, often serves to cover up their mental 
ficiency but which does not develop in them those eleme’ 
of skill which they must possess in order to support thi 
selves or contribute to their support. Because of 
high cost of maintaining special classes society v 
properly demands that no time, effort, or money sho 
be. spent on lines of training for feeble-minded child| 
which do not measurably add to their socio-indust: 
efficiency or productive skill, or which do not tend| 
render them more happy and contented in their restri 
world of opportunity. 
It is the function of the schools and institutions, th 
fore, not only to instruct or train the feeble-minded, 
also to investigate them with scientific thoroughness 
physical and mental diagnosis, and should never be intrusted t 
Binet tester, teacher, or regular medical inspector unless he has 
training for the work.

at we may learn to know definitely what lines of work 
eliminate because they largely represent wasted effort, 
d what lines of work to develop because they yield the 
‘gest practical returns. Many students, as I have inti- 
ated, believe that we can answer these questions with 
entific certainty even now, and yet I venture to say that 
e question still invites fruitful scientific inquiry. 
One of our chief drawbacks in attempting to solve the 
rriculum question for the feeble-minded has been the 
sk of periodical work exhibits, or of careful, reliable, 
rth-while individual pedagogical records of the work in 
ich different grades of feeble-minded children in the 
ecial schools have succeeded or failed after years of 
ition. Even when such individual reports have been 
ry carefully and elaborately made out year after year, 
ey have frequently been valueless because of the lack of 
reliable, scientific diagnosis of the grade and type of 
e cases covered by the reports. It is to be hoped that, 
th the new attitude which the public is beginning to as- 
me toward the schools as institutions which are designed 
h for the education of children as well as the scientific 
dy of child life, this defect will gradually be over- 
e.    
e third obligation of society is the provision of con- 
ous oversight and supervision over the feeble-minded. 
unfortunate necessity for continuous after-care arises 
im the fact that, although we can develop sufficient skill 
he higher grades of the feeble-minded to enable them 
arn their own livelihood under favorable conditions, 
lare less successful in the attempts to endow them with 
degree of prudence and foresight — that indispensa- 
lcommon sense — which will enable them wisely to take 
of their own interests, to protect themselves from the

after-care ministrations of either public or philanthro

England has a “ Central After-care Committee of the 
ritish National Association for the Feeble-minded.” 
his committee had sixteen local branches in 1909.1 One 
f the most active as well as one of the oldest local com- 
ittees (organized in 1901, now with fifty voluntary 
orkers) is the “Special Schools After-care Sub-com- 
ittee? of the “Birmingham Education Committee.” 
‘he members of this committee visit the homes of the 
entally defective children, they offer parents and chil- 
ren valuable advice, they assist the children to find 
aptable employment, they keep a record of their earn- 
igs, of their regularity of employment, of their ability 
hold positions, to take care of themselves socially, 
ancially, and morally, and of their police history.

Namely in Birmingham, Bolton, Bradford, Brighton, Bristol,

lham, and Plymouth. Manchester has an “ Auxiliary School Asso- 
ition.” 
n Austria a protective bureau is connected with the auxiliary schools 
Vienna. This bureau offers advice to parents in regard to available 
itions. In Hungary an aid society has been formed by the teachers 
ected with the Budapest auxiliary school. In Belgium a society

intains a system of outside care. In Amsterdam the auxiliary

      tained situations only for a short time, many not longer 
ian a month. Many “have varied spells of work with 
uch longer intervals of idleness, such as one, two, or 
ree years.” “ Many deteriorate rapidly when removed

me take to drink, others lead immoral lives, and many 
come unpunctual, lazy, dirty, and develop ungovernable 
mpers. Some suffer at the hands of their fellow work- 
en; others victimize their own people at home.” 
A more favorable report made in 1909 by the “ Edu- 
‘tion Committee of the London County Council” on 
149 special-school pupils who had been discharged two 
three years previously showed that 1065 were employed, 
rile the number out of employment was 384. But the 
erage weekly wages of those employed varied from only 
.26 to $1.80 weekly. A similar study made in 1910, 
sed on 258 children leaving the London special schools 
1906, showed that 43% were employed, 48% lost sight 
, and 9% unemployed. The medical officer of the Lon- 
n school board (Kerr) estimates that only one third 
the releases from the special schools will be able mate- 
Ily to contribute to their support, one third will be able 
tially to contribute if given after-care, while one third 
uld receive custodial care. The London data, however, 
licate that even these estimates are too sanguine. 
n an investigation made by the British Royal Com- 
sion on the Care and Control of the Feeble-Minded of 
harges from the special schools, it was found that only 
7 of one group of children did good work. The larger 
cent were reported lost or “ at home” and in need of 
ervision. It was concluded that, even with a selected 
up of the higher grades of special-school cases, only 
fo would be able to earn their living, 28% would prob-

  ably do so under control, while “22% would be possib 
wage earners.” 
Similar studies in Leeds showed that 45% were engag 
“ good, promising, or fair employment,” while in Live 
pool, where the supervision was said to be inadequat 
only 28% were employed. The combined statistics fro 
nine cities in England in 1908 showed that only 22% | 
the pupils who were formerly in special schools were : 
work, while 6.8% were at work irregularly. 
The industrial status of the pupils leaving the auxilia: 
schools in Germany is apparently more satisfactor 
Thus, in an investigation of the pupils who had attend 
ninety auxiliary classes in Berlin, it was found that fro 
10 to 75% were able to carry on a trade, while from 25° 
80% had died, or were kept at home, or had been cor 
mitted to an institution. In another Berlin study it w 
found that only 22% of the pupils had been sent to : 
asylum or were kept at home, while 11% had been a 
prenticed and 62% were working, but in poorly paid o 
cupations. '73% were reported as more or less useft 
but whether they were actually earning their subsisten 
is not revealed. “ Of the 74 boys and 29 girls who left t! 
12 auxiliary schools of Hamburg, 14 boys secured a 
prentice places as gardeners, bakers, cabinet makers, t: 
smiths, masons, and barbers, 177 went into the country 
servants or garden workers, 22 became errand boys 
Hamburg. Of the 14 apprentices only one could be p 
vided for in Hamburg; the others went to master work 
in the smaller cities or larger villages. Of the 29 girls 
went to homes, 1 to a school of household science, 14 
cured places as servants in the city, 6 in the country 
went to work in the industries; 2 are undecided as to p 
tions.” These statistics are not very satisfactory,

   cause no data are given (in the report at hand) of the 
average earning capacity of the children or of their de- 
gree of intelligence. The claim has been made that from 
70 to 80% of the pupils from the German auxiliary 
schools are able to make a living (Béttger). Assuming 
that this estimate is well founded, what is the explanation 
f the higher industrial competency of the mentally defi- 
ient in Germany than in England? It may be due to the 
act that industrial competition is (or was) less keen 
Germany than in England, or to the possibility, which is 
emote, that the Germans supply a more practical type of 
raining for the feeble-minded. It is undoubtedly partly 
lue, as we have seen in Chapter I, to the fact that higher- 
rade pupils are admitted into the German auxiliary 
lasses than into the English special schools, since the 
nglish education act expressly forbids the admission of 
lackward pupils into the special classes. It is also very 
robably due in part to the efficient work of the German 
fter-care Societies which exist in a considerable number 
the cities. These societies appoint a guardian for 
ch child, whose duty it is, in conjunction with the 
rents, teachers, and school officers, to protect the child 
om exploitation, to assist him in the choice of an occu- 
tion which fits his capacity, to prevent frequent changes 
occupation, and to secure for him a reliable master of 
lade. The duty of the master is to provide an efficient 
de training to the apprentices in his charge. He is, in 
ect, conducting a continuation school in his particular 
ft for the feeble-minded intrusted to his care. For the 
thful performance of this service he is given a premium

         sum of 150 M. has been given since 1865 by the Minister 
of the Interior to the master after the apprenticeship has 
been completed. In Switzerland the “ Albert Fisher 
Fund” pays premiums to masters of trade, textile over: 
seers, and others who have succeeded in training auxiliary 
school graduates for permanent occupations. 
So far as my information goes, we have in this country. 
unfortunately, no after-care committees or organization 
and no organized after-care work for feeble-minded chil 
dren who remain in society at work, and only three studie 
of the industrial competency of the children leaving ou: 
special schools. A study, made by the Public Educatio 
Association of New York, of 50 ungraded pupils, ran 
ing from ten to twenty years of age, from the publij 
schools of that city showed that at the time only 49 
were apparently able to hold permanent positions, 10 
had worked steadily for a few weeks at an average week: 
wage of $3.50, 24% had worked a “few odd days,” 
“ few ” were assisting with household duties at home, whi 
the majority were regarded as incompetent. A second ii 
vestigation of 350 pupils in the same city who had be 
out of the ungraded classes from one to eight years show 
that 24.6% were cared for at home (and probably wel 
more or less useful at home), 54.8% were employed 
wages, 8.8% had been employed but were temporarily o} 
of work, 3.7% were in institutions for the feeble-mind 
2.8% had died, 2.8% could not be traced, 1.8% were 
various institutions, 1.8% had married, and only .7 
were in penal institutions. Since it is said that th 
children had been “ certified as mentally defective by d 
qualified psychologists and physicians,” it is important

‘ ” know whether the term “ mentally defective” is used as 
synonymous with “ feeble-minded,” and if so what per 
cent of the children so classified reach the Binet-Simon 
ges of X, XI, XII, or higher. We saw in Chapter IT 
hat the classification of individuals as feeble-minded who 
each these mentalities has little warrant in fact. A study 
yy the University of Chicago Settlement of 10 pupils at 
n average age of fifteen, who had left one subnormal 
enter after having received their working papers, showed 
hat the average weekly wage was only $5.73, while three 
ere “unfit for any responsible position.” 
Incidentally we may refer to various estimates and 
tudies of the industrial competency of institutionally 
ained cases. Seguin claims that more than 30% of 
idiots ” can be taught to conform to moral and social 
w and can be trained to do the work of one third of a 
an; more than 40% can be brought to comprehend moral 
d social abstractions and to do the work of two thirds 
a man, while from 25 to 30% can be brought near the 
rmal standard of manhood and womanhood. This esti- 
te is too optimistic. According to Fernald, American 
titutions which admit only the high-grade cases (some 
these very probably being backward rather than feeble- 
nded) report from 20% to 30% discharged as abso- 
ely self-supporting, provided they have received proper 
lustrial training. The per cent is very much less in in- 
tutions which admit the lower grades. At Waverly 
ly from 10% to 15% can secure and retain self-sup- 
ting positions and spend their money prudently. (We 
e already pointed out that backward children fre- 
ntly get committed to these institutions.) On the 
er hand, 50% of the high-grade cases if trained from 
dhood can support themselves in an institution.

backward children to be committed to the institutions fo: 
the feeble-minded. 40% of the inmates at Earlwood, ac 
cording to the report, are idiots, 40% low-grade imbeciles

Binet and Simon concluded, from a study of the av 
able records of the feeble-minded girls in the school at 
Salpétrigre and of the boys in the school at the Bicétr 
Paris, that only 20% of the girls had been improved fr 
their training and only 12% had acquired enough skill

     PROBLEM OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED 347 
bemoan the fact that these figures are little better than 
conjectures, owing to their inability to get accurate data 
on the improvement these children had made in school or 
on their social and industrial careers after leaving school. 
The above rather discouraging facts — assuredly dis- 
ouraging when we are sure that the “ mental defectives ” 
re feeble-minded — support the position which I have for 
ong taken, that the public schools’ duty toward the feeble- 
inded is to identify them, segregate them in special 
chools, and then provide them with the type of training 
hich will directly and maximally equip them for practical, 
emunerative service, in state or municipal colonies. But 
present these facts on this occasion for a different pur- 
jose; — namely, for the sake of making a plea for the 
stitution of adequate follow-up work for the feeble- 
inded pupils who leave our special schools. Our efforts 
behalf of the large army of these children who must 
to work will be largely negatived unless this is done. 
order to perform this service we need the assistance of 
cial-industrial advisers or field agents, working under or 
conjunction with the psycho-educational clinic, whose 
ties should comprise: 
1. The making of vocational surveys of employments 
ailable in the community which fit the vocational capa- 
ies of feeble-minded children but which, at the same 
e, are not surrounded by social conditions which impose 
great a strain on the weak moral natures of the feeble- 
ded. 
. The placement of children in positions suited to their 
itations, and rendering them such assistance and en- 
ragement as will tend to keep them permanently em- 
ed. It is folly to assist feeble-minded children to ob- 
positions above their level of functioning. The al-   
 
-P-A-G-E-364

most inevitable result is discouragement, industrial break- 
down, and loss of position. 
8. Advising with employers for the purpose of explain- 
ing the child’s limitations, so that work fitting his level 
of functioning may be assigned him, and that he may re 
ceive more lenient and sympathetic treatment. 
4, Protecting the children so far as possible from mora 
and economic exploitation, and safeguarding them fro 
criminalistic careers when the parents fail adequately s 
to do. 
5. Advising the parents concerning measures which i 
is necessary to take in order to safeguard the child’s f 
ture social and economic welfare (which frequently mea: 
urging the need of colonization). 
6. The gathering of reliable data on the economic an 
social after-careers of the children who leave our speci 
schools. These data should include records of the chi 
dren’s earning capacity, relative amount of time spent 
employment and in non-employment, the kind of positi 
in which they have and in which they have not succeede| 
the ability to handle their financial affairs, and th 
records of delinquency or criminality. We must gath 
reliable data of this character, so that in future t 
schools may more effectively organize their efforts in 
half of the feeble-minded, and so that society may m 
wisely deal with the perplexing problems which are due 
the fact that many of its members must always rem 
children in mind although having the bodies, instincts, 
passions of adults. 
Theoretically and practically I believe that it is 
duty of the public schools to provide this service.t 
unfortunately the officials of the public schools who see

scessity for this essential service usually cannot secure 
e necessary appropriations, and so their efforts toward 
e prevention of social and industrial wreckage are ren- 
red nugatory. Let me therefore invite the attention of 
is organization of allied women’s clubs, as well as other 
‘ganizations interested in public uplift, to the large op- 
yrtunity for fruitful codperative work with the public 
hools in behalf of subnormal children. The situation 
lls for a twofold service: first, the gathering of reliable 
ita on an extensive scale of the social, moral, and indus- 
ial after-school histories of the pupils; and, second, 
sisting, guiding, and protecting the children in their 
forts to make a living and to conform to the social, 
oral, and legal standards of civilized society.

SHALL pause at the outset to call attention to 
point of difference between feeble-mindedness, bli 
ness, and deafness, on the one hand, and epilepsy, on + 
other. Feeble-mindedness is a condition of arrested 
deficient neuro-psychic development and not an active d 
ease process. While this condition sometimes results fr 
an acute illness or a severe cerebral injury to the per: 
affected — although it is probably more frequently « 
result of a morbid process or a neuropathic taint in 
ancestry — and while it may perhaps be said that it 
ways rests upon a pathological or neuropathic ba: 
feeble-mindedness itself can in no wise be regarded as 
active disease process. We can no more regard a, feel 
minded person as a sick person — unless he is afflicted w 
some disease — than we can so regard a blind or deaf p 
son who is in good health. Feeble-mindedness, blindn: 
and deafness are alike in that they are permanent 
normal conditions or anomalies, rather than active 
eases, although all these conditions may have been ca 
by diseases in the first instance. 
This is the reason why the simple forms of fee 
mindedness, which include 90% or more of the high- 
cases, do not respond favorably to causal — that 
strictly medical — treatment. In fact, there is no kn 
means of remedying or curing the simple types of fe:

mindedness by the removal of the etiological factor or by 
treating the pathological condition found in any given 
case. Simple feeble-mindedness is no more amenable to 
cure by medication or surgical interference than is con- 
genital total blindness or total deafness. Even where the 
vidence points strongly to the existence of brain lesions 
f whatever type (cysts, inflammatory or hemorrhagic in- 
juries, tuberous and lobar sclerosis, etc.), and where we 
ppear to be clearly justified in regarding such cerebro- 
athies as the causative agents of the mental deficiency, 
here is at present no known medical or surgical treatment 
hich will “ cure ” the mental infirmity. Craniectomy has 
een practically abandoned as useless; the improvement of 
utrition improves the mental state in both normal and 
ubnormal children, but malnutrition rarely, if ever, causes 
ctual feeble-mindedness and improved nutrition probably 
larely cures genuine feeble-mindedness ; the remedial treat- 
ent of infections (measles, typhoid fever, cerebrospinal 
eningitis, etc.) is of the utmost importance, but med- 
al treatment of the feeble-mindedness resulting from such 
fections is unavailing; the removal of respiratory ob- 
ruction in the naso-pharynx may cure aprosexia in nor- 
al, backward, and feeble-minded children, but it is doubt- 
1 whether adenoid vegetation will ever cause bona fide fee- 
mindedness or whether excision of adenoids ever cures 
ble-mindedness ; anti-luetic treatment may improve the 
ntal condition of a feeble-minded child suffering from 
ngenital syphilis, but I am not aware that any indubita- 
evidence exists showing that actual feeble-mindedness 
be thus entirely cured ; ? finally, it is evident that such 
atment as the correction of spinal curvatures, or dislo-

jorted by Ziehen.

    cations, or orthopedic defects of the lower limbs or muscu- 
lar contractures or plegias, while of great importance for 
the welfare and productive efficiency of the individual, does 
not directly affect the mental state of the feeble-minded. 
In the case of simple feeble-mindedness we thus reach th 
conclusion that we are dealing with a stable incurable men 
tal condition rather than an active disease or active mor- 
bific process. 
Turning now to the special types of feeble-mindedness| 
it may be said that cerebral decompression by cannula: 
drainage through the corpus callosum or lumbar punctur; 
is of value in some cases affected with the disease of h 
drocephaly, while thyroid feeding sometimes produces 
wonderful metamorphosis in cases afflicted with hypoth: 
roidism. The change, however, is more marked in t 
physical than in the mental sphere, and it is doubtf: 
whether genuinely feeble-minded cretins can be entire 
restored to mental normality, at any rate unless the trea 
ment is begun very early and continued practically inde 
nitely. The value of thyroid administration — as well 
anti-luetic treatment — for the mongolian type of it 
beciles is, I believe, entirely problematical. Finally, the 
is no known medical treatment for the cure of mental de 
ciency in the paralytic or amaurotic types of feeble-min| 
edness. 
The general conclusion, therefore, is that only in a ve 
small percentage of the total feeble-minded population 
we justified in speaking of curative medical treatme 
By “ curative medical treatment ” I mean causal treatm 
which cures feeble-mindedness by removing the causal f 
tors. Accordingly the medical problem for the vast 
jority of the feeble-minded differs in no essential from 
medical problem affecting any type of child, whe

   bright, normal, dull, blind, or deaf. Any type of child 
should have curative and preventive medical attention — 
curative attention only when he is suffering from active 
diseases, defects, or disorders, and preventive attention at 
all times in order that diseases, disorders, and defects may 
be prevented. While the feeble-minded child requires more 
preventive and more curative medical attention than the 
normal child because he is more prone to disease on ac- 
‘count of his lowered powers of resistance — at least, that 
s our belief — nevertheless the purpose of the medical 
reatment of the feeble-minded is precisely the same as for 
he normal or the backward, the blind or the deaf person; 
amely, disease prevention and health improvement. 
If these premises are correct, as I believe they are, the 
onclusion follows inescapably that the larger problem of 
he care and the amelioration or improvement of the 
eble-minded child is fundamentally the same as the prob- 
m of the care and improvement of the deaf, or the blind, 
ir indeed the normal child; it is primarily an educational 
d social problem — and only secondarily a medical 
roblem.t In other words, it is primarily a problem for 
e schools and the educator, and for society and the social 
onomist, and only secondarily a problem for the hospital 
d the physician. It is essentially a problem of identi- 
ing the feeble-minded, of diagnosing their degree of de- 
iency by psychological, educational, and social tests,” 
Confirmatory of this position are the following opinions by physi- 
ns who are experts on the problem of feeble-mindedness: Maria 
mtessori: I came to the conclusion “that mental deficiency pre- 
ted chiefly a pedagogical, rather than a medical, problem.” H. C. 
bur (1877): ‘It should be borne in mind that the essential fact of 
cy is mental deficiency: that the actual condition is an educational 
” “Tf any favorable effects are produced . . . it will ordinarily 
through the reflex action of properly adjusted mental exercises.” 
This cannot be done by anthropometric, physical, neurological, or 
chiatric (in the narrow sense) tests, or by the inspection of the

of discovering their diseases and physical defects (the work 
of the physician), of supplying appropriate mental, social, 
moral, and physical training in the light of the condi- 
tions found, and of supplying proper social control and 
industrial supervision after the period of training is com- 
pleted. 
So much for the care of the feeble-minded. Turning 
now to the question of epilepsy, which I have been aske 
particularly to discuss, the problem strikes me as some 
what different. In the case of epilepsy we are probabl.

cases of epilepsy —which while the affected perso 
may give absolutely no indication of physical sicknes

during the quiescent periods,’ manifests itself in irregu 
larly intermittent paroxysms of illness which are 
source of immediate or remote danger to the patient an 
which require the services of the skilled epileptologist 
In fact, I should regard the treatment of the epilepti 
from the standpoint of his epilepsy as a purely medic 
problem — just as I do regard the treatment of the feebl 
minded person from the standpoint of his feeble-minde 
ness, as an educational question — except for two impo: 
tant considerations: first, because of the obscure natu 
of the disease or disorder, and, second, because of its i 
curability, except in a small proportion of cases. I sh 
consider these two objections at some length.

      THE PROBLEM OF EPILEPSY 
First, in spite of protracted research by the ablest spe- 
ialists, epilepsy is still a morbus incognita — certainly 
me of the most obscure of human afflictions. The gaps 
n the knowledge of the pathology, pathogenesis, and eti- 
logy of epilepsy are so wide that it is not yet known 
yhether there is such a thing as epilepsy — that is, a 
alid conception of a unitary disease entity from the 
tandpoint of pathology or etiology, or even symptoma- 
ology — so that it would be more nearly correct to speak 
f the epilepsies than of epilepsy. The possible epilep- 
ogenic agents of epileptic convulsions are known; but the 
xact cause of epilepsy and the mechanism of the seizures 
re still unknown. The most divergent views relative to 
he causation of epilepsy are held by the ablest authorities 
n the field. 
One school regards epilepsy as a general neurosis (Lom- 
oso), or a neuro-psychosis, resting upon a degenerative 
r neuropathic predisposition. In fact, many writers em- 
loy the term “idiopathic epilepsy” as wholly synony- 
ous with hereditary epilepsy (thus Tredgold), particu- 
rly when it occurs in early life (Tanzi, Spratling,* 
earce) — an expression of racial degeneration. The re- 
Its of the statistical studies of the family histories of 
ileptics, however, vary so considerably that they cannot 
regarded as affording conclusive proof of the heredi- 
ry nature of the affection. C. A. L. Reed found a 
mplete absence of hereditary factors in all except 2% 
his '700 histories (parental epilepsy) ; Echeverria found 
hereditary predisposition in 26% of 306 cases; Gow- 
in 40% of 2222 cases; Althaus, in 40.9% ; Hughes 
mnett, in 41% ; Hamilton, in 50% (980 cases) ; Sprat- 
Spratling considers that about half of the epilepsies which occur 
‘ing the first three years are hereditary.

ling, in 56% (1070 cases); Thom, in 80% of 157 ep 
leptics (epilepsy in the parents or grandparents. Th 
number of hereditary defects was 293) ; and Kraepelin, i 
87%. When the percentages vary from 2% to 87%, i 
is questionable whether studies of this character have an 
genuine scientific value. Of course, a part of this astor 
ishing difference is due to the fact that some investigator 
include only similar heredity, while others include dissim 
lar heredity. But it is quite evident that if we accer 
generic heredity in the direct and indirect ancestral line 
as an adequate explanation of neuro-psychic abnormal 
ties, any nervous or mental disease or instability in an 
ancestor may be regarded as supplying an adequat 
causal explanation of epilepsy. Those who look fo 
slight defects through many generations and throug 
many collateral branches would undoubtedly find a ver 
large amount of neuropathic taint; while those who cor 
sider only marked defects in the immediate ancestry an 
in the closely related collateral streams would probabl 
return a small percentage. It is evident that the decisio 
as to how much to include or where to draw the line 
largely subjective. If, on the other hand, we restrict tl 
inquiry to similar heredity (epilepsy in the ancestry), t! 
large figures immediately begin to dwindle. Kraepel 
found similar heredity in only 22% of his cases (mother 
father epileptic), Reed in only 2%, and Spratling in on| 
16%. Not more than one of the above investigators fou 
any basis for Gower’s statement that “ similar heredity 
the chief cause of epilepsy.” Although epilepsy its 
would thus seem to be only one of a number of causes 
epilepsy —less important than alcoholism? according

some investigators — it is probable that most authorities 
at the present time are inclined to regard degenerative dis- 
ease or neuropathic taint in the parents as the chief or 
most frequent single cause of epilepsy (Voison, Dana, 
Gordon). Indeed, some recent heredity workers do not 
hesitate to say that epilepsy is a unit defect, due to “ the 
absence of a protoplasmic factor, explicable on the Men- 
delian hypothesis, and probably transmissible according 
o the Mendelian formula. They tell us that when both 
arents are epileptic “ all the offspring are so likewise ” 
Davenport and Weeks). 
On the other hand, a second school is equally positive 
hat epilepsy is an acquired disease. The stanchest cham- 
ion of the environmental school is Pierre Marie, who 
aintains that the causative factors of epilepsy are al- 
ays external to the patient and operate only after con- 
eption.t! The out-and-out environmentalist holds that 
ot only will this theory explain the traumatic or symp- 
matic types of epilepsy but also the essential or idio- 
athic. 'Thus the most probable cause of essential epi- 
psy is minute hemorrhages in the brain (Hughlings 
ckson), or minute disseminated cerebral lesions ? caused       
    
    
     
    
         
     
   
        
  a group of 572 epileptics Echeverria found parental intemperance 
17.5% and parental insanity associated with epilepsy in 15% of the 
ses. While Spratling found that 16% of 1000 institutional cases of 
ilepsy had epileptic parents and only 14% inebriate parents; De- 
ine found that 51.5% of the child epileptics investigated showed al- 
olic parentage, while only 21% showed parental epilepsy. Bins- 
ger found chronic parental alcoholism in 21% and parental 
ilepsy in only 11% of the cases studied. Matthew Woods claims 
tt a first and only alcoholic debauch on the part of the father at 
time of conception was the causative factor in seven cases of epi- 
sy studied by him. Whether alcoholism is the cause or the con- 
uence of degeneracy (including epilepsy) is still debatable. 
Marie, Osler, Reed, and others find very few instances of direct 
smission. 
It is reported that 40% of cerebral infantile hemiplegias become 
leptic.

    in infancy by toxins, or microérganisms, or fetal cerebro- 
pathies, often induced by parental inebriety (Tanzi), or a 
condition of acidosis edema traceable ultimately to an 
epilepticoccus (Reed), or a mechanical injury to the pitui- 
tary gland, accompanied by alterations in the region of 
the sella turcica (McKennan, Johnson, and Henniger), or 
even a psychosis whose phenomena, such as fears, dread, 
dreams, moroseness, and periodical paroxysms, are trace- 
able by psycho-analysis to infantile desires and fears (L. 
Pierce Clark). Many of the writers of this school do not 
hesitate to say that so-called idiopathic epilepsy may be 
caused, in the absence of any hereditary predisposition, by 
any chronic intoxications, toxemias, and minute traumas, 
while some hold that it always presupposes an organi 
pathology — positions which are in direct variance wit! 
the doctrines of the heredity proponents, who argue tha 
the idiopathic type always and the symptomatic types fre 
quently, perhaps usually, presuppose a neuropathic hered 
ity as at least the primary element, and who often main 
tain that the organic pathology is a consequence of ceré 
bral injuries from gross trauma, infection, or repeate 
convulsions, while the various etiological factors serve si 
ply as proximate or exciting causes. 
When we turn to the question of the underlying patho! 
ogy of the epilepsies, it is conceded that the pathologic: 
conditions vary not only according to the type (essenti 
Jacksonian, etc.) but also according to the individual 
post mortems of individuals having the same type of sym 
toms do not always reveal a common neuro-pathology, ai 
similar conditions may be found in non-epileptics as 
epileptics. Without a history of epilepsy it would n 
be possible to conclude from a post-mortem examinati 
of the brain that a given individual was an epilept
-P-A-G-E-375
   THE PROBLEM OF EPILEPSY 859     
evertheless, most authorities would probably agree that 
e essential pathology is to be found in the cerebrospinal 
stem. i 
Conceding thus much, however, there is still lack of 
rreement as to the precise locus or identity of the epi- 
stoid center. Most epileptologists would, no doubt, lo- 
te the disturbance in the cerebral cortex (thus Tanzi, 
unson). One authority (Spratling) believes that the 
at is in the sensory cells of the second layer of the cor- 
x—he regards epilepsy as a “diseased state of the 
asory elements of the cortex,” due to a neuronic virus. 
hers believe the explosive impulses originate in the cor- 
ra striata (Beier), in the pons variolii (Pearce), in 
e cornu ammonis (due to sclerosis), or in the medulla 
farshall Hall, Shroeder, Van der Kalke, Nothnagel), or 
the conduction paths (Reed).* 
There is considerable agreement that almost any excit- 
x factor may serve as the epileptogenic agent. Nay, 
re: most authorities posit a toxic pathogenesis. But 
re is little agreement as to the essential nature of the 
ic substance. The substances suggested are almost 
umerable: — uric acid (Haig), cholin in the blood 
onath), carbonate ammonia (Krainsky), ethereal sul- 
tes (Herter), auto-intoxication of intestinal origin, 
avated particularly by a protein diet (Evans), spe- 
infection from a gas-forming bacillus, caused by in- 
inal obstruction (C. A. L. Reed), and a nuclear poison 
he neurones (Spratling). 
ince there is such marked disagreement in respect to 
essential etiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of epi- 
t would be bootless to attempt to enumerate the almost innumer- 
fanciful convulsive zones which have been proposed: epilepsy has 
been regarded as a storm of the “ pubic nerve” or of the branch 
lying the clitoris (Baker Brown).

  lepsy, we should not be surprised to find grounds for o 
second objection; namely, that little hope can be « 
tended in the present stage of the science of epileptolo 
for the radical cure of epilepsy. It is true that the m 
extravagant claims have been, and still are, made for | 
numerable drugs and heroic mechanical and surgical p1 
cedures — from the administration of crotalin to col 
tomy, lithotomy, tenotomy of the external recti, remo 
of the clitoris, gonadectomy — but the sad fact rema 
that there is as yet no generally accepted curative cau: 
treatment of epilepsy. The estimates of the percenta 
of cures, including the spontaneous recoveries, vary fr 
8 to 15% — and many of these reported cures have prov 
illusory. ‘Cured ” cases have frequently broken out w 
unabated violence after a quiescent period of several yee 
— 80 years in one instance on record. 
The recognized treatment of epilepsy is still almost « 
tirely symptomatic. There are numerous depresso-mot 
drugs which prevent or abort seizures, but they seldom 
ever cure the affliction, and they usually produce the cl: 
sical deleterious mental and physical after-effects of bi 
mism.? For this reason many, perhaps most, epilepto 
gists only use the drug treatment in emergencies. T! 
obtain better results in the long run from hygienic me 
ures; the regulation of the diet (especially the reduct 
of proteins, or nuclein-body foods, or foods causing au

in the traumatic than in the idiopathic cases (Weispfen- 
ing). Very few of its strongest devotees claim that it is 
ffective unless undertaken before the seizures have become 
ed as habits, while some writers regard the good effects 
s mental rather than physical (Woods). Most authori- 
ies probably consider that there is little prospect for cure 
x improvement when the heredity is bad, when the men- 
lity of the patient is considerably impaired, either as a 
sult of primary arrest of neuronic development or of 
condary neuronic degeneration, when severe convulsions 
ve continued for a long time, and when the onset occurs 
rly in life. These statements are doubly significant in 
ew of the fact that epilepsy is a disease of early life — 
5% of William Gower’s cases developed before the age 
three years and about 75% before 20; 38.5% of 
ratling’s cases developed under 10, 43.5% from 10 to 
, or 82% under 20 — that its most frequent coexistent 
plication is primary feeble-mindedness, and that its 
st frequent permanent after results are intellectual ar- 
t or degeneration or disorder, and derangement of the 
lotions, disposition, and character. 
ccording to Wildermuth 30% of idiots suffer from 
lepsy. 'Tredgold found as a result of the examination 
00 institutional cases of feeble-mindedness without evi- 
ce of gross cerebral lesions that convulsions occurred 
7%. (0% of the cases with gross lesions had con- 
ions indistinguishable from epileptic seizures. The 
entage among the feeble-minded was 11, among the

quently superposed upon a background of feeble-minde 
ness or weak-mindedness. Not only so, the constant rep 
tition of seizures tends to produce progressive ment 
deterioration, either in the form of secondary amenti 
mental enfeeblement, or epileptic dementia, although 1 
effects differ greatly according to the age of onset, t! 
stamina of the individual, and the type and severity 
the convulsions. Some individuals will resist repeat 
attacks for 30 or 40 years without serious mental impaij 
ment, while others become amented or proceed to termin 
dementia in a few years. Tredgold finds that about 3.5 
of the feeble-minded suffer from epileptic amentia, wh 
for the “ majority of cases dementia is but a question 
time.” Spratling estimates that 50% of epileptics 
come feeble-minded; Tanzi that 80% become “ menta’ 
impaired” after years of repeated fits; while Russ 
Reynolds maintains that there is probably impairment 
intelligence in all cases. Accordingly if we add toget 
those who suffer from primary and secondary amen 
and those who terminate in epileptic dementia it is ¢ 
tain that a large percentage of epileptics grade definit| 
as feeble-minded.

It is not asserted, of course, that there are not some 
ight epileptics, or that epilepsy and genius are abso- 
tely incompatible. Indeed, according to Lombroso’s 
eory, genius is a sort of epileptic neurosis. Historical

love the rule.

tim of temperamental obliquities. In fact, some au- 
rities feel that temperamental obliquities are even more 
valent than intelligence defects, affecting not only 
se who are mentally deficient but also those who are 
al in intelligence. Epileptics as a class — from 75% 
80%, according to Spratling — are emotionally un- 
le, fickle, mendacious, gloomy, sulky, querulous, irri- 
le, egotistical, impetuous, violent, treacherous, intract-

able, sometimes criminalistic, fanatical, or excessively re 
ligious, and subject to outbursts of anger or murderou: 
frenzy (epileptic furor) on slight provocation. Whil 
these emotional outbursts sometimes indicate epilepti| 
equivalents, they usually represent permanent alteratio: 
of character with or without actual psychoses. A certai 
‘percentage of epileptics are also distinctly permanent] 
or periodically psychotic. 
In view of the above facts, namely, the obscure natu: 
of the affection, its incurability, and its permanent ps 
chopathic, psychasthenic, and sociopathic sequale, I ca 
not agree with Binet and Simon that the problem of ¢ 
lepsy — at least in the present unsatisfactory state of i 
therapy —is “essentially medical.” Tanzi, accordi 
to my views, has stated the situation more fairly: ‘“ E 
leptics require not only medical treatment but also, a’ 
perhaps even more, care and supervision.” While, the 
fore, I do not wish to minimize the value of the medi 
care and supervision of the epileptic by the skilled 
leptologist,— in fact, I deem such supervision absolut 
essential so long as the epileptic continues to suffer fr 
severe or frequent repeated convulsions,— it is clear 
my mind that society will not do its duty by the individ 
epileptic until it provides him with the type of educatio 
and social training and care which will tend to make 
maximally self-supporting, and until it supplies the f 
of benevolent restraint and occupational provisions w! 
are necessary both in the interest of the well-being of 
person afflicted and the welfare of society. 
It is obvious, however, that we cannot plan wisely 
economically for the training of epileptics without 
ducting careful investigations of their mental and p 
gogical characteristics and aptitudes. In the hop

    365     THE PROBLEM OF EPILEPSY 
ntributing further insight into the educational needs of 
e epileptic I carried out during the first five months of 
11 an extensive series of psychological tests, each set 
ranged in five series, on a squad of epileptic school chil- 
en in the New Jersey State Village for Epileptics and 
a group of children in the public school in the neigh- 
ring town of Hopewell. The epileptics included the 89 
ightest pupils in the school. But this number was re- 
ced to 80 (16 boys and 14 girls), due to the inability 
6 to perform the tests (owing to low mentality), to 
e irregular attendance of 2, and to the death of 1 
y: 
It was intended to examine 120 selected cases from the 
blic school (to be referred to as normal children), two 
ch dull, average, and bright boys, and two each dull, 
erage, and bright girls from each grade from the sec- 
d to the eleventh (or the third high), which was the 
thest class in this school. The experiment, however, 
to start with 99 pupils, and of these it was necessary 
reject 23 from the final summary, mostly because they 
e absent two or three times during the tests (the rec- 
s of children absent more than once were rejected), 
ing 76 cases, $9 girls and 37 boys. The tests were 
m as group tests once a month to these two sets of 
dren under identical experimental conditions and dur- 
corresponding hours of the day — first group at 9 
+, second group at 10 a.m., and third group at 11 a.m. 
he following facts regarding chronological and mental 
and pedagogical status, gathered at the beginning of 
xperiment, will show in a general way the comparative 
ing of the two groups.

(from 10.83 to 24.25); and of the epileptic group 15. 
The average chronological age of the public-school be 
was 11.47 (from 7 to 17.08 years), of the girls 12.31 (fr 
1.25 to 1'7), and of the public-school group 11.80. TI 
the normal boys averaged 3.09 years younger than { 
epileptic boys, the normal girls 3.45 years younger th 
the epileptic girls, and the normal group 3.31 ye 
younger than the epileptic group. Only 26.06% of 1 
epileptics as against 63.1% of the normal children w 
12 years or less. On the other hand, 73.3% of 
epileptic but only 36.8% of the normal were over 12 ye 
old. Whatever advantages attach to greater age 
maturity were decidedly in favor of the epileptics. 
The average Binet-Simon age was 10.1 for the epilep 
boys (median 10.2), 9.7 for the epileptic girls (med: 
10.4), and 9.9 for both sexes. The average amount 
B.-S. retardation was 4.3 years for the boys, 6.0 for 1 
girls, and 4.8 for both sexes. 12.5% of the boys (2 cas 
had a mentality of 8 years;1 18.7% (3) of 9 years; 50 
(8) of 10 years, and 18.7% (3) of 11 years; 28.5% ( 
of the girls had a mentality of 8 years; 14.3% (2) o 
years and 57.1% (8) of 10 years. In other words, 2 
(6) of all the epileptics had a mentality of 8 years; 16. 
(5) of 9 years; 53.3% (16) of 10 years, and 10% (3

limit of feeble-mindedness, only 31.3% (5) of the boys, 
2.8% (6) of the girls, and 36.6% (11) of the whole 
coup were feeble-minded. Neither of these two stand- 
rds, however, is strictly applicable to this group, for 
easons that cannot here be detailed. According to my 
wn estimate made at the time, 64.3% (9) of the girls, 
2.5% (10) of the boys, and 63.3% (19) of the whole 
oup were feeble-minded. All would belong to the high- 
ade cases (morons). 
While the Binet-Simon tests could not be given to the 
blic-school children, I believe we are justified in regard- 
ig them as a fairly representative normal group, as in- 
cated by the pedagogical status (see the following para- 
aph). On the supposition that the average mentality 
the normal group was about the same as the average 
ronological age, the normal boys averaged 1.37 years 
her in mentality than the epileptic boys, the normal 
Is 2.61 years higher than the epileptic girls, and the 
irmal children 1.9 years higher than the epileptic chil- 
mn. The difference in the intelligence status is very 
ch less than the difference in the pedagogical status 
ween the two groups, as shown by these figures. 
‘he average amount of pedagogical retardation for the 
leptic boys was 7.0 years and for the girls over 7.3 
rs (average 7.2), while the corresponding figures for 
normal boys and girls were .08 and .68 (average .39 ').

amounts ranging from one to two years. All of th 
epileptics were retarded in amounts ranging from tw 
years for the girls (one case) and 4 years for the boy: 
(two cases), to 10 years plus for the girls (2 instances 
to 9 years for the boys (4 instances). On the other han 
35 normal children (23 girls and 12 boys) were retarde 
from one to 4 years (one case) for the girls and from on

the girls were in the first grade, 35.7% in the second, ai 
35.7% in the third; 30% of the entire group were in t! 
first grade, 30% in the second, and 40% in the thi

average school grade of the girls was 2.3 (median 2.), 
the boys 2.1 (median 2.), and of the whole group

These facts show clearly that the pedagogical superior 
of the normal children is distinctly greater than t 
mental superiority. Evidently the epileptic children 
unable to function even approximately at their me 
level in the work of the schools.

ask the question: How do the epileptic and normal

hope to do here is (1) to compare the “average effi- 
ciency” (final average) of the epileptic group in each 
est, regardless of sex, with the “ average efficiency ” of 
he normal group in the corresponding test, regardless of 
ex. We shall base the average efficiency on the general 
verage for the five series of tests in each set, so that the 
verage efficiency represents the averaging of all the 
cores made by all the subjects in the five monthly repeti- 
ions of each test. These averages certainly should yield 
reliable representative value by which to compare each 
‘coup in the tests in question. (2) We shall also com- 
are the “ average improvement ” made in each test dur- 
ig the last four months. That is, the score made each 
cessive month by each child in each test will be com- 
lared with the score which he made during the preceding 
onth in the same test. The gains and losses made by all 
e epileptic and normal children will then be separately 
eraged and compared. We shall thus secure measures 
the average efficiency during five months and the aver- 
amount of monthly improvement made in each test by 
ch group of children. The “ Epileptics’ comparative 
ciency ” is obtained by dividing the normals’ score into 
le epileptics’ score. 
The results are shown in detail for each test in tabular 
d graphic form on pp. 370 to 875.

2. In only 81.2% of the tests (5 tests) did the 
ileptics show more than 50% of normal efficiency, in 
% of the tests (11) they failed to reach 50% of nor- 
al efficiency, while in 50% of the tests (8) they failed 
reach 35% of normal efficiency. While the epileptic

e epileptics thus graded decidedly lower by these tests 
lan by the Binet-Simon scale, on the supposition that the 
lerage mental age of the normal group approximately 
‘responded to their average chronological age. On this 
umption the average mentality of the epileptics was 
9% of the normal group — or 86.7% if we assume that 
mental retardation of the latter corresponded to their 
agogical retardation (.89 of a year). This surpris-

     ingly large difference between the Binet rating and the 
rating by the pooled results of the individual tests indi- 
cates either that the clinical rating by the Binet scale is 
very inaccurate, or that the epileptics do relatively mor 
poorly when tested in groups by means of written tests. 
Without attempting to decide this question here, it is sig 
nificant that the epileptics graded distinctly lower i 
pedagogical status than in mental status as determined b 
either of our two psychological measuring scales. Thei 
average pedagogical status was 35% of the pedagogical 
status of the normal group when based on the averag 
school grade and 33% when based on the median scho' 
grade of each group. 
8. The epileptics are most efficient in the tests base 
on the simpler mental processes: perception, motor r 
action, immediate reproduction of memorized digits an 
observed objects, and imagination. They showed 80 
efficiency in the simplest motor speed test (drawing ci! 
cles), but only 67% efficiency in the A-test, which requir 
a choice reaction based upon rapid and accurate perce 
tual discrimination. In the imagination test, where th 
were free to write anything suggested by the ink blo 
they “saw” half as many objects in the ink blots as t 
normal children did. The scoring in this test, however, 
based on a quantitative and not a qualitative standar 
hence the figures tell us nothing about the quality of t 
imaginative constructions. 
4, Contrariwise, the epileptics are most deficient in t 
tests based on the higher thought processes: writing wo: 
of opposite meaning, constructing sentences containi 
three supplied words, constructing words from three s 
plied letters, adding ten one-place digits (particula:

rectly added), although the latter would by some be re- 
garded as a mechanical test. Relatively the most difficult 
tests for the epileptics were the antonym and sentence- 
construction tests, the first of which demands the ability 
rapidly and accurately to analyze a series of concepts and 
o supply a series of correct associates, and the second 
f which demands fertility of thought and invention — the 
bility to incorporate three ideas (words) into a succes- 
ion of independent complex thought units (sentences). 
he low degree of efficiency of the epileptics in these 
ests is, no doubt, partly dependent upon the retarded 
ate of ideational activity which seems to characterize 
lhe mind of the average epileptic. This is indeed indi- 
ated by the spontaneous association test, in which they 
ow only 33% of efficiency. Of course, the low efficiency 
this test may be partly due to retardation in writing, 
x epileptics do somewhat better, I believe, in oral asso- 
ation tests. In the Binet-Simon association test the 
mber of words uttered was as follows per B.-S. age from 
to 12 for a larger number of epileptics: 33.4, 43.6, 
.8, and 59.9.1 I shall hope to give corresponding data 
r non-epileptics at some future date. However, those 
o have had extensive experience with epileptics know 
w very slowly the minds of many of them work. 
While the epileptics did fairly well in the tests of im- 
diate memory (except the recognition test), they did 
atively more poorly in the tests of remote or deferred

41% efficiency, as compared with 67% efficiency in the 
immediate memory of the objects. Their efficiency in the 
remote memory of pairs of logically associated words was 
34%, compared with 37% in the immediate reproduction 
of the words. This result confirms the observation fre- 
quently made by epileptologists respecting the lack of 
tenacity in the memory of epileptics, and by teachers of 
epileptics, who find that epileptic children, although the 
frequently are able to assimilate subject matter and re 
produce it instanter, seldom retain it for any length o: 
time. When epileptics are compared with normal chil 
dren, it is thus found that their impressionability of mem 
ory is relatively higher than their tenacity of memory. I 
is probable that the defective retentiveness of epileptics i 
frequently due to the fact that the convulsions obliterat 
the cortical impressions left by past experiences,    
   
        
       
     
   
     Comparative Improvement 
5. That the epileptics improved from sitting to sittin 
in spite of their low degree of efficiency is clearly indicat 
by the comparative-improvement figures in all the tes 
in which these are available. In fact, in one test t 
epileptics actually improved more than the normal chij 
dren. Strangely, this was in the scholastic test, the a 
dition test. The superior gain of the epileptics in t 
test might be explicable on the assumption that adding 
a purely mechanical operation dependent upon the abili 
to retain rote or memoriter associations, and yet we kn 
that high powers of concentration and possibly of id 
tion are essential for rapid and accurate results in ad 
tion. It is interesting to note that neither the epilept 
nor the normal children gained consistently in all the 
tings of this test. Not only so, the normal children ac

ally suffered a slight loss when the scores were based only 
m the columns correctly added. An analysis of the com- 
lete tables (not published here) indicates that the greater 
ain of the epileptics was at least partly due to the small 
cores which they made during the first two sittings. 
ince the epileptics functioned on a low plane in this test, 
here was of course room for considerable improvement. 
In one test also, the canceling of the A’s, the epileptic 
nd the normal made exactly the same amount of gain. 
ere both groups made a slight improvement in each suc- 
ssive sitting. As we have seen, the epileptics ranked 
latively high in comparative efficiency in this test. In 
ly two other tests did the epileptics’ gain even approach 
e gain made by the normal pupils: immediate memory 
memorized digits (83% ) and immediate recollection of 
served objects (87%). It is apparent, therefore, that 
e epileptics gained most in the tests of the simpler men- 
1 processes: — perception, observation, reaction, and 
te memory. In the more significant memory test, the 
mediate reproduction of logical word associates, the 
ileptics’ comparative improvement amounted to only 
%, while in the spontaneous association test (rapidity 
thought) it reached only 36% and in the antonym test 
% of normal efficiency. When all the improvement 
res for all the eight tests are pooled, it is found that 
epileptics gained 64% as much as the normal pupils. 
t is, the epileptics’ efficiency in all the tests was some- 
t less than one half of that of the normal children, 
lle their improvement was somewhat less than two thirds 
he normal gain. The reason that they ranked rela- 
ly higher in percentage of gain than in percentage of 
iency may be due to the low efficiency status itself:

   Pedagogical Application

reached only the second school grade, although th 
average mentality by the Binet-Simon scale was almost t 
years. We have seen that their comparative pedagogi 
status was distinctly lower than their comparative men 
status when judged by the separate serial tests, and es 
cially when judged by the Binet scale. We have seen thi 
comparatively, the average amount of monthly impro 
ment made by the epileptics in the psychological tests 
considerably greater than their efficiency status compa: 
with the normal standards, but this large improvement 
partly due to the low degree of efficiency itself and it 
curred in the tests of the simpler mental processes.

     STATE Provisions FoR DEFECTIVE CHILDREN 
Introduction 
N 1911 Ohio appointed a “ commission to revise, co: 
solidate, and suggest amendments to the statute la) 
of the state of Ohio which pertain to children,” with pa 
ticular reference to-the unification of “ the present la 
pertaining to illegitimate, defective, neglected, depende 
and delinquent children, and to their treatment, ca 
maintenance, custody, control, protection, and refor: 
tion.” ‘This commission, which apparently consisted 
two members, made its report to the Ohio legislature 
1913. The report, aside from a brief introduction, c 
sists of a draft of proposed amendments to the Ohio st 
utes.? 
New Hampshire by an act of its legislature, appro 
April 15, 1913, appointed a Children’s Commission to “ 
vestigate all matters relating to the welfare of the depe 
ent, defective, and delinquent children of the state, e 
cially the questions of orphanage, juvenile courts, de 
tion homes, desertion, physical and mental degener:

    ains a digest of the state’s laws relating to children. The 
xpenses of the commission were partly met by state ap- 
ropriations and partly by private contributions.* 
In 1915 the National Conference of Charities and Cor- 
ection appointed a Committee on the Standardization of 
hildren’s Laws. The aim of this committee is to co- 
perate with social workers in the different states of the 
nion, in order to secure the enactment of legislation 
hich shall make the conditions for the care and training 
if children as uniform as possible in all sections of the 
untry. 
Children’s Commissions were appointed in 1915 in Mis- 
uri, Illinois, and Minnesota, for the purpose of revis- 
g, amplifying, and codifying the laws of those states 
lating to children. These commissions will report to 
e legislatures of 1917. 
The original Children’s Code Commission of Missouri 
msisted of a committee of three senators, appointed by 
senate, with an appropriation of $1500. The appro- 
iation, however, through some flaw, was found to be 
alid, and hence the committee was dissolved. A number 
social workers and other persons interested in the wel- 
e of Missouri children then petitioned the Governor to 
oint a volunteer commission, without pay. The 
lvernor, acquiescing in the request, asked twenty-three 
sons from different parts of the state to serve on such 
mmission. The work of the Commission has been done 
ely through the activities of the seven following sub- 
mittees : present laws, public administration, delinquent 
dren, defective children, destitute and neglected chil- 
» health and recreation, and child labor and education.

  884 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
The Commission has submitted its report to the 1917 
legislature.+ 
The following article, which embodies the complete re: 
port of the chairman of the Committee on Defective Chil: 
dren, is reprinted here for the following reasons: 
1, Owing to the limited funds available it has been pos 
sible to print only a limited edition of the “ Code.” 
2. For the same reason it has been necessary to co’ 
dense the more lengthy committee reports, in consequenc| 
of which some of the material facts and supporting ar 
ments presented in the individual reports are presente 
very imperfectly or not at all in the Code. Moreover, 
considerable number of alterations have been introduc 
into the text, in order to make the different reports u 
form. 
8. The Commission has not prepared bills for all t 
recommendations made by the different committees, f 
several reasons. (1) It would be necessary for the legis]} 
ture to vote a considerable appropriation of money 
order to give practical force to many of the recommen: 
tions. It was felt that the necessary appropriations co 
not now be secured because of the present crippled con 
tion of the state’s revenues, and that to draft recommen 
tions involving heavy financial obligations into bills wo 
endanger the passage of the Code. Consequently none 
the recommendations included in the “ bills ” which will 
presented to the legislature need necessarily involve 
expenditure of money. However, the Commission inv 
favorable legislative consideration of several “ expensi 
recommendations, including the recommendations prop 
in this report for the enlargement of the state facilities 
the care of the feeble-minded and the epileptic and for

stablishment of a state Bureau for Mental Defectives. 
2) It was felt that favorable legislation could not be se- 
ired on some of the recommended measures, or if secured 
ould not be enforced, and that therefore to include such 
easures might jeopardize the passage of the entire Code. 
‘his feeling, for example, was entertained toward the pro- 
osals for sterilization (made in this report) and birth 
trol. (3) Some of the recommended measures were 
mnsidered by some to bear only indirectly on children, 
nd are now being sponsored by other bodies. They were, 
1erefore, omitted from the Code. This applies to the 
commendations made in this report regarding the ap- 
ointment of the superintendent of the institutions for 
1e feeble-minded and epileptic on a basis of professional 
ympetency, and the placing of the educational work in 
1e institutions for the feeble-minded, epileptic, juvenile 
slinquents, blind, and deaf under the supervision of the 
tate Department of Education. Many of the reforms 
rgently needed in the state cannot be accomplished until 
new state constitution has been adopted. Both of the 
ding political parties last fall declared themselves in 
vor of a revision of the constitution. 
4. The demand for reprints of our preliminary report 1 
s exhausted the available supply. This report was less 
prehensive than our final report. Owing to the efforts 
being made in many states to provide more favorable 
ditions for the protection and improvement of de- 
itive children, it has seemed well to make available this 
ort on defective children in its complete form, since the 
ater part of the recommendations here made are ap- 
able to most of the states of the Union.

RECOMMENDATIONS ON DEFECTIVE CHILDREN 
A. THE FEEBLE-MINDED 
I. The Present Situation in the State with reference to 
the Feeble-minded 
On the basis of one of the older and more conservative est 
mates of one feeble-minded to every 600 persons in the gener: 
population,— and many authorities regard this estimate : 
entirely too conservative,— there are 6000 feeble-minded pe 
sons in the state of Missouri.? Of these 6000, only 588 - 
and this includes 162 epileptics — were confined during tl 
month of September in the state institution which has bee 
specifically erected for their care; namely, the Missou 
Colony for the Feeble-Minded and Epileptic. The rest « 
the feeble-minded who have been placed under permanent « 
temporary restraint are improperly confined in the public « 
private hospitals for the insane, the jails, reformatories ar 
prisons, the infirmaries, and private homes or institution 
1 In the preparation of this report various items of information hi 
been secured through correspondence with the following persons: 
perintendent R. P. C. Wilson, Missouri Colony for the Feeble-Min: 
and Epileptic; Superintendent S. M. Green, Missouri School for 
Blind; Superintendent J. S. Morrison, Missouri School for the De: 
Superintendent Joseph Sparks, Joplin Public Schools; Miss Julia 
Stimson, Head Department of Nursing and Social Service, Washin; 
University Dispensary; Mrs. F. W. Baumhoff, National Presid 
United Workers for Cripples. 
2 According to an estimate published in 1911, Missouri then 
11,427 feeble-minded persons, while according to another estimate m 
in 1914 Missouri at that time should have had 38,260 feeble-min 
children between the ages of 6 and 21. We feel that our own esti 
is more within the mark.

       Many feeble-minded delinquents are temporarily confined in 
correctional institutions, only to be restored in due time to 
full freedom, although they do not possess the capacity to 
conform to the laws and customs of society. No data are 
available by which we can accurately determine how many 
feeble-minded persons are permanently or temporarily con- 
fined in the different classes of institutions maintained 
throughout the state. But it is probable that it does not ex- 
ceed 1500, thus leaving at large in the state on a conservative 
stimate 4000 feeble-minded persons. It is probable that not 
ver one half of these are properly supported, safeguarded, 
nd controlled at home, leaving 2000 neglected, dependent, un- 
rotected, or delinquent feeble-minded persons at large in 
ociety, who, for their own good and for the protection of the 
tate, should be permanently sequestered in institutions and 
olonies especially established for their training, care, and 
control, and for the utilization of their services. Dependent 
nd neglected feeble-minded persons at large in the state al- 
ays constitute a heavy economic burden and often an actual 
potential moral and eugenic menace to society, because of 
eir incompetency and irresponsibility and their frequent 
mdency to drift into vicious and criminal careers and to 
‘ing forth feeble-minded progeny. 
The provisions which the state has made for the proper 
aining, care, and control of this class of incompetents is 
fully inadequate. Less than 10% of our feeble-minded 
ulation is confined in our colony for the feeble-minded. 
me of Missouri’s prominent neighboring states has pro- 
ed such meager institutional accommodations for its feeble- 
inded wards. The state of Minnesota cares for one feeble- 
inded person in its large colony for the feeble-minded to 
ty 1281 persons in the general population of the state. 
e corresponding figure for Iowa is 1 to 1504; for Indiana, 1 
2207; for Kansas, 1 to 3493; and for Illinois, 1 to 3883. 
ssouri, on the other hand, cares for only one feeble-minded 
son in the institution at Marshall to every 6977 in the

       general population (these calculations are based on the enu- 
merations given in the Report of the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion for 1918, Vol. II, p. 671). 
The fact is that there is no state in the Union of the same 
population and wealth as Missouri, with possibly one excep- 
tion, which has provided such meager institutional facilities 
for the care of the feeble-minded. This is shown by the fol- 
lowing data which were secured through correspondence wit! 
state officials during the month of October this year.1_ Massa 
chusetts at that time housed 2900 feeble-minded and epileptic 
in two institutions for the feeble-minded, one colony annex; 
and one epileptic colony. If Missouri provided the same ac. 
commodations as Massachusetts in proportion to population| 
she would care for almost the same number. Massachusett 
is caring for almost 500% more than this state. Iowa pro} 
vided accommodations in one institution for 1185 feebl 
minded and 299 mentally deficient epileptics, or a total o| 
1484, and has under construction a separate colony for ep! 
leptics which will be ready next summer. If Missouri did 
well as Iowa in proportion to population, she would now pr 
vide institutions for over 2200 feeble-minded and epilept 
inmates. Iowa now does almost 400% better than Missow 
Pennsylvania provided beds for 3984 inmates, of whom 33 
were feeble-minded and 600 epileptics, in three institutions f 
the feeble-minded, including one semi-public institution, a’ 
in one colony for the feeble-minded, while a separate villa, 
for feeble-minded women is now being constructed. If M: 
souri did as well as Pennsylvania in proportion to popu 
tion, she would care for about 1700 feeble-minded and epil 
tic. Pennsylvania does almost 300% better than Misso 
The true figure, however, is somewhat less than this, as 
semi-private institution contains inmates from outside of 
state. New York had accommodations for 6000 feeb

    minded and epileptics in five institutions for the feeble-minded 
and one institution for the epileptic. If Missouri did as well 
as New York in proportion to population, she would now care 
for about 2100 feeble-minded and epileptic instead of less 
than 600. New York does 350% better than Missouri. Ohio 
had an enrollment of 3992 patients, of whom 2321 were feeble- 
minded and 1671 epileptic, in one institution for the feeble- 
minded and one for the epileptic. If Missouri did as well as 
(Ohio in proportion to population, she would now have state 
ccommodations for about 2800 feeble-minded and epileptic. 
hio does about 475% better than Missouri. I do not wish 
0 be understood as implying that we have the same ratio of 
eeble-minded and epileptics as some of the states mentioned 
bove, but there can be no doubt that our institutional facilities 
re utterly inadequate. 
The situation is similar with respect to the public-school 
aining of the feeble-minded in Missouri. Only two cities of 
e state, St. Louis and Kansas City, afford special educa- 
ional provisions for the feeble-minded. Both of these cities 
pport special classes or schools for the feeble-minded and 
graded classes for the backward. The need for such classes 
imperative in all sections of the state. 
The provisions afforded by public agencies in the state for 
ie proper psychological and educational examination, diag- 
sis, and classification of mentally exceptional children are 
tirely inadequate. The public schools of St. Louis are the 
ly school system in the state which maintains a psycho- 
lucational clinic for the examination of mentally deviating 
ildren, although Kansas City is applying psychological tests 
an aid in the classification of subnormal school children. 
e juvenile court of Kansas City is the only court in the 
te which maintains a mental clinic at public expense. The 
enile court of St. Louis receives limited services from 
lunteer examiners. So far as the data at hand indicate, 
se are the only public clinics in the state specifically estab- 
ed for the examination of feeble-minded and backward

                           children — although some of the hospitals and dispensaries 
are attempting to deal with the problem. Chicago has six 
psychological clinics, three being supported by public funds, 
while Cincinnati has three, all supported by municipal funds 
and all manned by psychologists. Illinois, Ohio, Connecticut, 
and other states maintain state psychological clinics, while 
many state and private universities also support such clinics. 
II. Recommendations 
In order that the state may be better able to cope with the 
problem of the feeble-minded, it is recommended that the fol- 
lowing laws be enacted: 
We would first call attention to the new Illinois law fo’ 
the legal commitment and permanent segregation of the feeble 
minded, effective July 1, 1915. We recommend that th 
essential provisions of this law be incorporated into the Mis 
souri statutes. We shall merely emphasize a few of th 
more desirable alterations and additions needed in Missouri. 
1. A law should be enacted providing for more adequat 
state facilities for the support, training, and continuous e 
ployment of the feeble-minded juveniles and adults of the stat 
who require state care. The law should include the thre 
following provisions: 
(1) The conversion of the Missouri Colony for the Feebl 
Minded and Epileptic into the Central State Colony for t 
Feeble-Minded, and the enlargement of the institution to 
capacity of 1000 inmates. This central institution shou 
combine the features of an asylum for the helpless, unit 
provable juvenile and adult cases (custodial admissions), 
workshop and farm colony for the employment of the mo 
capable feeble-minded adults and children who have alrea 
been trained for productive work, a school for the traini: 
of trainable children from the western part of the state; a’ 
a permanent home for those delinquent types of the feeb! 
minded who can be controlled without recourse to prison 
straint. This institution should provide abundant faciliti 
 
-P-A-G-E-407
   DEFECTIVE CHILDREN 391     r the maximal employment of inmates of all degrees of 
pacity in workshops and on the farms. It should be pro- 
Jed with an ample acreage of good farm lands. 
It is recommended, accordingly, that the word “ epileptic” 
eliminated from the present statutes: Sections 1500 to 
09, Revised Statutes of the State of Missouri, Vol. I, 1909, 
that the institution will be reserved exclusively for the 
re of the feeble-minded, while the epileptic should be col- 
ized in a separate institution, as recommended hereinafter. 
Separate institutions should be established for the care of 
e feeble-minded and the epileptic, because while the social 
d educational care of these two classes have certain elements 
common, the problems are quite different. The problem of 
e feeble-minded is fundamentally educational and social, 
d only secondarily medical. The medical care required by 
eble-minded children does not differ in kind from the med- 
1 care required by backward or normal children. In both 
ses it is a question of preventing or curing defects and dis- 
ses and safeguarding health. It is not at all a question of 
ring the state of feeble-mindedness as such by medical 
sasures, because feeble-mindedness in the vast majority of 
es is a condition and not a malady or disease which can be 
ed by medical or surgical treatment. Feeble-mindedness 
rely admits of melioration or improvement by hygienic, 
sical, sensorimotor, industrial, intellectual, and moral train-

asking the state to give to the feeble-minded. Moreové 
epileptics, owing to their impetuous temperament, irrital 
disposition, and frequent outbreaks of violence, do not ma 
good companions for. the feeble-minded. Practical experien 
shows that the epileptic is a disturbing element in an ins 
tution for the feeble-minded. They introduce discord and di 
content. Many states, recognizing that the humane trez 
ment of these two classes according to modern ideas is ft 
thered by their segregation, have already established separa 
colonies for the feeble-minded and the epileptic. Amor 
these states may be mentioned Massachusetts, Connectict 
New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, a1 
Kansas. 
Section 1505, Revised Statutes, Vol. I, 1909, defining t 
eligibility qualifications of the superintendent, which mere 
stipulates that he shall be “a well-educated physician, and 
graduate of a legally chartered medical college, with an e 
perience of at least five years in the actual practice of | 
profession, including at least one year’s actual experience in 
general hospital,” should be amended so as to provide that t 
superintendent of the colony shall be a technically train’ 
physician, or educator or psychologist or sociologist of exec 
tive ability and of unquestioned probity who has already spe 
at least three years in the scientific and practical study 
feeble-mindedness, especially in its educational, industrial, a1 
social aspects. 
A regular medical education and experience in general mi 
ical practice and in a general hospital do not constitute a 
preparation either for the diagnosis of feeble-mindedne| 
which is psychological and social, or for its essential tre 
ment, which is educational, industrial, and social and 
medical, as further explained hereinafter. The essen 
qualifications of a superintendent of an institution for 
feeble-minded is that he must be a specialist on feel 
mindedness.

    portant position as the superintendency of an institution for 
the feeble-minded, in the hope that he will gradually familiar- 
ize himself with the duties of the position and with the 
problem of feeble-mindedness, is just as inconsistent as to 
ppoint some one to a judgeship who has no legal training or 
s to appoint some one to the superintendency of a city school 
yystem who is not a professionally trained educator. The 
umane, efficient administration of work with the state’s un- 
ortunate children demands that this position be removed from 
he pale of political accident and that the appointment be 
ade purely on the basis of professional efficiency. 
It is recommended that the system of appointing the super- 
tendent be so changed as to lodge this power in the board of 
lontrol of the institution, or in a central board of control of 
ate institutions, if created (or, better still, in a civil service 
mmission). ‘The appointment should provide for permanent 
nure of office, so long as the incumbent renders faithful, effi- 
ent, honest service. 
(2) The establishment of a school and colony, on the 
ttage plan, to accommodate from 250 to 500 inmates, and 
be located near the city of St. Louis. While this institu- 
mn should be designed primarily as a school, to afford train- 
ig for unsupported and neglected educable feeble-minded 
ildren from school districts which do not afford proper 
ovisions for the training of these children, resident in the 
stern part of the state, it should also admit as many of the 
ther grades of feeble-minded youths who have already been 
ined and high-grade feeble-minded adults from the eastern 
rt of the state as can be employed in the shop and farm 
rk of the institution. Low-grade custodial and asylum 
es (idiots and low and middle grade imbeciles) should not 
admitted to this institution, as this would convert it from 
istinctly educational to a custodial institution. Custodial 
les should be sent to the asylum division of the main insti- 
ion.

   center of population is very pressing. Many parents are very 
reluctant to send their weak children hundreds of miles away 
from home. They want them near by, so that they may visit| 
them occasionally. 
Administratively this institution might be organized as a: 
annex or auxiliary of the central colony, in order to reduc 
overhead expenses. The administrative officer in direct charg 
of the institution, however, should be a technically traine 
educator who has specialized on the training and care o 
feeble-minded children. The method of his appointmerit an 
the tenure of office should be the same as already suggeste 
for the superintendent of the central colony. The subordina 
officers should be selected by the head of the school, with th 
concurrence of the board. The medical services require 
should be performed either by a resident physician or by nea: 
by physicians who should be subject to call when needed. 
There should be ample arable lands and sufficient wor! 
shops to provide opportunities for training the children j 
various hand crafts as well as in agricultural pursuits and f 
providing profitable employment for the adolescent and ad 
workers. The institution should be made to contribute 
much as possible toward its own support. 
The present provisions with respect to “state”. ai 
“private” inmates at Marshall should apply to this insti! 
tion. i 
(3) There should be established from time to time peri 
nent or temporary camps in those parts of the state wh 
there are waste lands to be cleared and improved. To th 
camps, which should be under the general administration 
the superintendent of the central colony, should be transfer: 
from the two above institutions older adolescent and ad| 
feeble-minded wards of various grades of capacity whose lal 
can be profitably employed in the improvement and tilling 
the soil. Some of those lands after they have been impro 
may be sold by the state at a profit, while other lands ma 
permanently farmed by the wards of the state. Other cai

ing squads may be employed as aids in the construction of 
public roads and in the work of reforestation. 
The value of these camps consists not merely in affording 
healthy outdoor employment for the state’s wards but in yield- 
ing revenues for the support of the state institutions. A 
system of exchange of agricultural products and manufactured 
commodities should be established between various state insti- 
tutions. . 
Lest the above proposals should appear extravagant to any 
me, let us say that they are in reality exceedingly moderate. 
e have tried to be very conservative in our estimates. We 
re recommending institutional accommodations for only 1500 
r 1600 inmates. We feel quite certain that if all the feeble- 
inded were transferred from the improper types of insti- 
sutions in which they are now confined and placed in these 
stitutions their capacity would be immediately taxed. The 
lame thing would happen if all the dependent, neglected, and 
lelinquent feeble-minded at large in society were committed to 
e institutions. The number of applicants on the waiting list 
Marshall now amounts to 800. During the last few years 
e number has varied from 400 to 800 every year. 
2. The present permissive statutes for the admission of 
eble-minded persons to the institution at Marshall, Section 
08, Revised Statutes, Vol. 1, 1909, should be amended so 
to provide for the legal and compulsory commitment to, 
d permanent retention in, the above state institutions, 
ools, or colonies, or similar privately conducted institutions 
ich have been qualified and licensed by the state, of all 
ble-minded persons in the state who are dependent, neg- 
ted, or who do not receive proper supervision, protection, 
port, or control by parents and guardians, or who threaten 
become an industrial burden or a social menace to the com- 
nity. The law should be specific in the enforced commit- 
tt of not properly protected feeble-minded girls and women 
child-bearing age, who frequently become the mothers of 
itimate children, many of whom are also feeble-minded,

   and of feeble-minded juvenile and adult prostitutes, criminals, 
and delinquents. The mandatory provisions should not apply 
to feeble-minded children of parents or guardians who are 
willing and able properly to restrain, protect, and support 
their children, and who do so. Feeble-minded persons, how-| 
ever, who are properly controlled may be legally committe 
should the parents or guardians so desire. 
It is recognized everywhere that it is impossible adequatel, 
to cope with the many serious social problems caused by thi 
presence in society of irresponsible and uncontrolled feeble 
minded persons, until laws are enacted to provide for thei: 
enforced commitment. The recognition of this fact led to th 
enactment of the Illinois commitment law, which provides fo 
the mandatory commitment and permanent detention of feebl 
minded persons upon the filing of a petition before the cou 
of jurisdiction and upon the hearing of the same by the cow 
after the alleged feeble-minded person has been examined bj 
a commission appointed by the court. The enactment of th 
law has had a most wholesome effect in that it has led to t 
enforced commitment of a large number of dependent, ne; 
lected, and criminal feeble-minded persons, who would othe 
wise have remained at large in the state. The number 
commitments amounted to 304 cases during the first sev 
months in which the law was operative. 
8. The law should be so drafted that no person may 
committed to a state institution for the feeble-minded who 
not been legally certified to be actually feeble-minded. 
feeble-minded person in the meaning of the law is one 
is afflicted with mental deficiency dating from birth or fr 
an early age, so pronounced that he is incapable of living 
independent existence in society because of such deficiency 
therefore requires external support and supervision. 
Any one committed as feeble-minded who later proves to} 
not feeble-minded should be discharged from the institu 
as soon as this fact becomes evident. 
Persons committed to an institution for the feeble-min

   should be subjected to a thorough psychological examination 
to determine their mental status. Doubtful cases should be 
referred to the bureau for mental defectives, if created. 
The need of this enactment is evident. Children who are 
not feeble-minded are sometimes committed to institutions for 
he feeble-minded, either because they have been mistakenly 
iagnosed as feeble-minded or because parents or guardians 
ant to get rid of them. A feeble-minded institution is not 
he proper place for the rearing of normal or backward chil- 
ren. Such children may never reach their normal stature 
f reared amid the limitations of institutional life, so that 
ey may thereby become doomed to perpetual dependency. 
hey should not be retained in an institution for the feeble- 
inded. 
4. Section 1508, Revised Statutes, 1909, should be amended 
as to provide that the legal certification of feeble-minded- 
ss should be made only by competent authorities on feeble- 
indedness and mental backwardness. The following types 
experts, in harmony with the recent Illinois law, should be 
signated by the law as competent legally to certify to feeble- 
indedness: (1) examining psychologists who have special- 
d on feeble-minded and backward children, and (2) physi- 
ms who have been trained in individual psychology and 
0 are experienced in the differential diagnosis between 
ble-mindedness and backwardness. 
t is necessary to point out that feeble-mindedness is a 
te of mental feebleness and not a disease or necessarily a 
te of bodily feebleness. It is impossible, accordingly, to 
ose feeble-mindedness by the ordinary physical or neuro- 
ical tests. It can only be diagnosed by psychological tests 
social criteria. Because the recognition of feeble-minded- 
is not easy, in consequence of which backward children 
frequently diagnosed as feeble-minded and treated accord- 
ly, or vice versa, and because the means available in the 
for making adequate psychological, educational, and so- 
diagnoses are wholly inadequate — in fact, in many coun-

   ties of the state there is as yet no one qualified to pass on 
the high-grade borderline cases — it is recommended 
5. That there be established one or more bureaus for men- 
tal defectives, according to one of the following proposals: 
(a) A large central bureau or clearing house, with an ade: 
quate staff and substations in various parts of the state, to b 
affiliated with the state department of education, the stat 
department of charities and correction, and possibly the stat 
university. 
The functions of this bureau should be to aid the courts 
institutions, and public schools of the state accurately to dia; 
nose and classify mentally, socially, and educationally al 
normal children and to proffer advice in regard to the educ 
tional, hygienic, and social care of such children. Th: 
bureau, so far as possible, should certify candidates for co 
mitment to the institutions for the feeble-minded. Questio: 
able persons who have been committed without such certific 
tion should be examined later. We shall emphasize mere 
two of the reasons for the establishment of this bureau: 
First, in order that the state may economically educate jj 
children according to their several needs, it is necessary th 
all the feeble-minded and seriously backward children in t| 
schools should be diagnosed and classified as early as possib 
so that they may be provided with the types of instructij 
which will fit their peculiar needs and so that they may be 
moved from the regular grades where they hamper the w: 
of the normal pupils. The attempt to educate the fee 
minded and seriously backward children in the regular gra 
results in an annual loss to the taxpayers in this state of t 
of thousands of dollars for wasted instruction. Through 
ministrations of this bureau the money lavished on useless 
struction would be made to yield its fair return by prop 
directed educational endeavors. The expense of the bu 
would represent only a small part of the eventual return: 
increased educational efficiency. It is evident that 
school districts cannot afford to establish their own bur 
The state must come to their aid.

       Second, in order that the courts and institutions of the 
state may render efficient service, it is necessary that the chil- 
dren presenting evidences of mental abnormality, who come 
before the courts or who are committed to institutions, should 
be properly diagnosed with respect to their mental capacity. 
It is especially necessary for the judge to know whether a 
child is feeble-minded and irresponsible, or merely backward 
and responsible; or whether a child is insane or psychopathic 
to such an extent as to render him irresponsible. The number 
of feeble-minded irresponsibles is larger among both juveniles 
and adults than the number of insane or psychopathic irre- 
sponsibles (while the number of backward responsibles is 
larger than the number of feeble-minded irresponsibles) ; 
hence the largest problem of differentiation is between normal- 
lity, backwardness, and feeble-mindedness. No disposition of 
la questionable juvenile-court case (or an adult-court case 
ither) should be made until the facts are known with respect 
o the individual’s mental capacity and responsibility. If 
hildren have been committed to institutions without adequate 
xamination, the state should provide the means for a scien- 
ific examination when there is any question as to the indi- 
idual’s mental normality. Many communities cannot afford 
is service. The state should aid them. 
The director of this bureau, to be permanently appointed 
a non-political efficiency basis, should be a clinical psychol- 
ist and an educator, technically trained for the work, who 
s at least five years of practical experience in schools and 
stitutions, in the diagnosis, social care, and educational treat- 
lent of the mentally backward, feeble-minded, and delinquent. 
lhe probable cost of this bureau if it were established on a 
ale sufficiently comprehensive to meet the needs of the 
ools, institutions, and courts in those sections of the state 
ere the needs are not already met by local clinics would be 
m_ $15,000 to $20,000 a year. 
(b) A second plan would be to establish two smaller and 
lependent bureaus, one to serve the public schools of the
-P-A-G-E-416
  400 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
   
   
     
   
            
    
    
    
   
     
    
       
     state and one to serve the courts, police systems, and institu- 
tions. The qualifications of the director should be the same 
as stipulated for the director of the central bureau above (a). 
The cost of conducting these bureaus, if so organized as to 
serve all sections of the state now without this service, would 
probably amount to the same as the cost of the large central 
bureau. 
(c) A more modest plan, which represents the minimum 
recommendation, and which seems to us most feasible in the 
present stage of the work in the state, is to establish on a 
smaller scale a bureau for mental defectives in the extension 
division of the state university, with a director whose qualifi- 
cations should be the same as those given for the director of, 
the central bureau in (a) above, to be appointed by the board| 
of control of the institution, under the same terms of service} 
as apply to faculty appointments in the university. The sta 
should include one clerk. As the work develops one or mor 
assistants should be added to the staff. The work of th 
bureau should include the following: the examination of re 
ferred school, institutional, and court cases in different part: 
of the state, according to the time available; the offering o 
instruction in the university and the dissemination of informal 
tion through the state through bulletins or otherwise; an 
the gathering of data and the undertaking of investigatio 
bearing on mentally deficient children. This bureau in ti 
should serve the ‘‘ human interests ” of the state, just as t 
state’s agricultural interests are now served by the state scho 
of agriculture through its resident, extension, and field a 
tivities. If we are justified in making large annual appr 
priations to help our people to reduce waste and inefficiency 
agriculture and stock raising, we are equally justified in as 
ing the state to help them reduce waste and inefficiency in t 
rearing and handling of children. 
6. Petitions for the commitment of the feeble-minded m 
be filed by parents, guardians, officers of courts, departme 
of public welfare and correction, and schools or by any

   sponsible citizen of the state, such petitions to be filed with 
the judge of the courts provided hereinafter. Said petitions 
shall indicate whether or not said alleged feeble-minded person 
is properly supported and supervised and whether or not the 
parents or guardians are able to contribute, and in what 
amount, to his support. Upon receipt of the petition the 
judge shall order an investigation to be made by an officer of 
the court touching the facts alleged in the petition, or require 
in lieu thereof that the alleged facts be verified by affidavits 
lof responsible persons familiar with the conditions. He shall 
lalso order an examination to be made by one or more quali- 
ied psychological or medical experts of the mental condition 
f the alleged feeble-minded person, if such an examination 
as not already been made by an expert acceptable to the 
ourt. 
7. The hearings of petitions for commitment may be before 
uvenile courts or circuit courts. Commitment shall be or- 
ered by the judge of said courts, if the facts alleged in the 
etition have been verified and the person has been properly 
lertified as feeble-minded. 
8. No committed person may be removed, discharged, or 
ansferred except on the recommendation of the superintend- 
t of the institution, the secretary of the state board of 
arities and correction, and the director of the state bureau 
x mental defectives (if one is established), or their duly 
thorized deputies. Discharges should be made by the court 
commitment. 
9. Feeble-minded prostitutes should be cared for perma- 
mtly in detached cottages in the Industrial Home for Girls 
Chillicothe, or in detached cottages in the central colony 
the feeble-minded, until a separate institution is erected 
their care. 
10. It shall be mandatory upon every school district in the 
te to establish special classes or schools for feeble-minded 
dren when there are ten such children in any given school 
trict. The suggested enrollment should be fifteen pupils in
-P-A-G-E-418
402 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
     
                
    
   
   
    
     
      
     
    
    
        
   each class. In case the means for accurate diagnosis cannot 
be made available in the different school districts, the law 
should provide that a special class must be organized when 
there are ten or more pupils of 12 years of age and less who 
are pedagogically retarded over three years, although it is 
recognized that some pupils retarded less than three years in 
their school work would be feeble-minded, while others re- 
tarded more than three years would be backward. The state 
should make an annual grant out of the school funds of $300} 
for the maintenance of each special class established unde: 
this law. The state of New Jersey appropriates $500 an: 
nually for the support of each special class, while Minnesot 
grants $100 for the education of each child in a special class. 
When the number of feeble-minded children in a given dis 
trict is not sufficient to organize a class, they should be sen’ 
to the state schools. 
11. While it is essential to remove feeble-minded childre 
from the regular classes where they waste their time and o 
struct the work of the normal children, it is also desirable t 
place children who are pedagogically or mentally backwar 
but not feeble-minded, in ungraded classes where they can 
given the individual attention and the type of training whic 
they require. By the special help afforded in the ungrad 
classes many of these children can be restored to normality, a] 
of them will receive more benefit than they would derive fro 
the instruction afforded in the regular grades, while, at t 
same time, the normal children are benefited by the remov 
of the slow pupils who retard the work of instruction. 
It is therefore recommended that separate ungraded class 
be established for mentally and pedagogically backward ch 
dren who are not feeble-minded. The enrollment in su 
classes should vary from 15 to 25 pupils. Whenever it 
possible to establish two special classes, one should be devo’ 
to feeble-minded children and the other to backward childr 
It is inadvisable to train feeble-minded and backward c 
dren in the same classes. This practice should only be co 
tenanced when only one class can be established.
-P-A-G-E-419
  DEFECTIVE CHILDREN 403 
12. There should be instituted a system by means of which 
the names and addresses of all children who are suspected of 
being feeble-minded and of being candidates for a special 
class should be annually reported to the proper state officer. 
These names should be reported at a stated time from all the 
public schools of the state (and preferably from all the 
parochial and private schools as well). The lists should be 
sent to the state bureau of psychological diagnosis, if one were 
established, or to the state department of education. Since 
it would be impossible for most of those reporting to determine 
definitely which children are feeble-minded, it would be nec- 
essary to follow some arbitrary convention; e.g., all children 
twelve years of age or less who are retarded in their school 
work over three years should be reported as suspects. It 
would be desirable to have as many as possible of these sus- 
ects, or the worst of them, examined by the proposed state 
ureau of psychological diagnosis, in case the schools them- 
elves did not maintain a psycho-educational clinic, in order 
o determine whether they are feeble-minded or backward. 
ne purpose of this registration is to secure a complete file of 
ll dependent and delinquent feeble-minded children when 
ey leave the schools of the state. 
13. An enumeration of the number of feeble-minded persons 
the state should be made by the bureau for mental de- 
ctives, if created, or by the state board of charities and cor- 
ction, said enumeration to include the feeble-minded at large 
society, in the elementary schools, in the different penal 
id eleemosynary institutions, and in the county infirmaries, 
x the proper conduct of which by qualified investigators 
ere should be appropriated the sum of $5000. 
B. THE EPILEPTIC 
I. The Present Situation 
While no exact data are available as to the number of epi- 
tics in Missouri, it is probable, based on a conservative

    estimate, that the number does not fall short of 2000, and that 
at least 1000 of these are dependent, neglected, or delinquent. 
The state has thus far made very meager provisions for the 
care of its epileptic dependents. The colony at Marshall, 
which was erected for the care of both the feeble-minded and 
the epileptic classes, contains only 162 epileptics. No more 
can be admitted because of lack of accommodations. A con- 
siderable number of epileptics are confined in the various 
hospitals for the insane, the county infirmaries, the jails, re- 
formatories, and prisons. Probably most of them are at large 
in society, where they frequently are a heavy burden to the 
family, and a potential, and often an actual, menace to society, 
because of their irresponsible, criminalistic tendencies, where 
frequently they cannot be properly protected against physical 
dangers, and where they are subject to imposition and abuse. 
It is recognized by all authorities on epilepsy that the bes 
treatment for the incurable types is colonization for outdoo: 
occupations under conditions providing for a regulated dietary, 
hygienic living, and healthy occupation.   II. Recommendations 
In order that the state may better cope with the proble' 
of the epileptic, the following recommendations are made: 
1. There should be established a separate state school an 
colony for the training, care, and colonization of juvenile an 
adult epileptics. As already recommended the present sta 
utes (Sections 1500, 1502, and 1508) should be amended b 
striking out the word “ epileptic.” 
2. This institution should be constructed on the cotta; 
plan, with accommodations for at least 500 epileptics, ai 
should be made self-supporting so far as possible by sh 
and farm work. .The farm should contain from 500 to 10 
acres of good arable land. The school work should pla 
the chief emphasis on practical hand and industrial trainin] 
3. The superintendent should be a technically trained e 
leptologist, who is familiar not only with the medical a

     hygienic phases, but also with the educational, industrial, and 
social phases of the problem of epilepsy. He should be ap- 
pointed on an efficiency basis, and not on a political basis, 
by the board of managers of the institution or by a board 
of control having administrative supervision of various state 
institutions. The appointment should promise permanent 
tenure, but the incumbent should be subject to removal by 
the board for cause. 
4. The commitment of the following classes of epileptics 
should be made mandatory by law: incurable dependent and 
neglected epileptics; and epileptic criminals who are demented 
and irresponsible and who can be controlled without the neces- 
sity of prison confinement. The processes of commitment 
should be the same as those prescribed for the feeble-minded. 
To this institution should be transferred epileptics now im- 
properly confined in the hospitals for the insane (i.e., those 
not dangerously insane) and in the jails and prisons (i.e., 
irresponsible epileptic criminals who can be controlled in the 
institution without confinement). 
Feeble-minded, irresponsible, and neglected epileptics 
should be committed for permanent detention. 
5. Epileptics who have been committed to the institution 
annot be released, transferred, or paroled except by the 
ction of a commission, to consist of the superintendent of the 
stitution and the secretary of the state board of charities 
nd correction. 
Cc. CRIPPLED CHILDREN 
I. The Present Situation 
It has been estimated that there are 9879 crippled children 
the state of Missouri and that the vast majority of these are 
prived of educational advantages. We do not know on 
at facts, if any, this estimate is based. According to a 
ool census of crippled children made in St. Louis in 1913, 
re were 215 crippled children attending the regular public

       406 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
grade schools of the city, and 191 who were unable to attend 
because of lack of transportation facilities. Only one child 
has been given a special chair. An investigation made by 
the St. Louis Central Council of Social Agencies which was 
reported in May, 1916, supplied data on 341 crippled chil- 
dren, as follows: 
     
        Number in school or who had finished school. . . 106 
Number in need of schooling..... 54 
Number in need of special care 84 
Number reported but not found. 718 
Number removed from the city 16 
Number deceased 3 
341 
There is not a single special class or special school, day or 
residential, or home for crippled children in Missouri. There 
are no statutory enactments bearing on the education of crip- 
pled children. There are, however, a few crippled children’s 
wards in a few hospitals, while private individuals and vari-| 
ous welfare societies, notably the International Sunshine So 
ciety and the United Workers for the Cripples, have assiste 
crippled children to attend school and to secure employment, 
and have supplied them with braces, crutches, special shoes 
and wheel chairs. The provisions afforded in the state ar 
wholly inadequate to meet the needs of a class of unfor: 
tunates who, when mentally sound, can by proper trainin 
be made self-supporting, and who, without such training, ar 
an economic burden to the community. The state has pr 
vided special residential schools for the blind, deaf, feebl 
minded, and epileptic. It is illogical and inhuman to do le: 
for a class of unfortunates who frequently are capable 
making greater progress than either the blind, the deaf, 
the feeble-minded. 
II. Recommendations 
1. The compulsory-school-attendance law should be ma 
_ applicable to crippled children of sufficient mental capacity 
profit from proper instruction.
-P-A-G-E-423
  DEFECTIVE CHILDREN 407 
2. Special classes should be established in the public schools 
for crippled children who cannot attend the regular grades, 
whenever there are ten such children in any given school dis- 
trict. These classes should afford a differentiated program 
of work and special physical equipment to meet the peculiar 
educational and vocational needs of each cripple. Convey- 
ance to and from school should be furnished by the school 
boards, if arrangements cannot be made for this service with 
he police departments for the use of the patrol wagons, as is 
lone in Baltimore, or with the so-called “ Sunshine Societies ” 
r similar volunteer organizations. 
3. The state shall appropriate $300 annually for the 
upport of each public-school class for crippled children. 
he attendance in these classes may vary from 10 to 20 
upils. 
4. When classes for cripples cannot be instituted under the 
bove regulations, parents shall be required to provide private 
struction at home or enter the child in the state school for 
‘ippled children. 
5. A state residential school for crippled children should be 
tablished on a small scale on a fertile tract of land adjoin- 
ig a city, for the proper education of crippled children be- 
een the ages of 6 and 20, whose disability prevents them 
m attending the regular schools, and who shall be entered 
der the conditions now obtaining in the schools for the deaf 
id blind. It may be well to establish a home department

ded, who cannot be properly supported or cared for at 
es 
. The names and addresses of all crippled children in any 
en county of school age must be reported by the county 
k to the county superintendent of schools, who in turn 
t report them to the state superintendent of education, 
ler a penalty of a fine of $10 for every crippled child who 
ot so reported or who is improperly reported. In case a 
ol for cripples is established, it shall be the duty of the

D. BLIND CHILDREN 
I. The Present Situation 
There is a law upon the statutes requiring the county clerk: 
to report all blind children to the state school for the blind; 
but it is alleged that many county clerks do not comply wit 
the law, as there is no penalty attached for its violatio: 
Hence there is no means of determining how many blind chil] 
dren there are in the state, or how many blind children in th 
state are being deprived of schooling, or how many blin 
children are neglected. Moreover, the education of blin 
children has not been made compulsory by law. The sta‘ 
maintains a residential school, the Missouri School for t 
Blind, at St. Louis, which seems to be adequately organiz 
for its work. There is, however, not a single day class 
day school maintained by any public-school system in the sta 
nor are there any special day classes for children who a 
semi-blind or very hard of seeing who require special edu 
tional treatment. It is estimated that in the city of St. Loy 
alone there are from 100 to 200 hard-of-seeing public-sch 
children whose educational needs are not adequately met 
the methods and contents of instruction afforded in the regu 
grades. Nor has the state enacted legislation which will p: 
vent the large amount of blindness due to gonorrheal inf 
tion of the new-born child (ophthalmia neonatorum) and wh 
can be absolutely prevented by the enforcement of sim| 
prophylactic measures. 
II. Recommendations 
1. The compulsory-attendance law should be made ap 
cable to all blind children of sufficient mental capacit 
profit from appropriate instruction. Parents should be 
quired by law to provide for the appropriate instructio

  DEFECTIVE CHILDREN 
eir blind children at home, or in the public schools, or in 
ie state school. 
2. It is recommended that Boards of Education should es- 
blish special day classes in which appropriate training may 
> given to children with seriously and permanently impaired 
sion not amounting to blindness, whenever there is a suffi- 
ent number of children to justify the establishment of a class. 
hese classes should be provided with individual blackboards, 
id books containing large type, and the instruction should 
ypeal largely to the ear. In such classes hard-of-seeing pu- 
ls will make much greater progress than in the regular 
ades. 
8. Section 10,790, Revised Statutes, Vol. III, 1909, should 
: amended so as to provide a penalty of $10 for every blind 
ild whom it shall be found the county clerk has failed to 
port, in accordance with the statute, to the superintendent 
the state school for the blind. 
4. Section 1473, Revised Statutes, Vol. I, 1909, shall be 
nended so as to permit of the acceptance of blind children 
ss than 6 years of age when, in the judgment of the super- 
tendent of the state institution for the blind, the child has 
ficient mental capacity to profit from the instruction. The 
ucation of many blind children should be begun earlier than 
now the case. 
5. A home department should be established at the state 
titution for the blind for the care and maintenance of young 
lected or homeless blind children, who are not feeble- 
ded, until they can be entered in the school department. 
. Where a given school district does not provide for the 
ical inspection of its school children the teachers shall be 
luired by law to test the visual acuity of all the pupils, ac- 
ling to regulations to be established by the state depart- 
tt of education. Training in the proper administration of 
visual test cards shall be given in all the state training 
ols for teachers, or, when necessary, in county institutes. 
. The treatment of the eyes of all infants immediately

after birth with a proper solution of silver nitrate should } 
made compulsory by law. This simple and harmless trea 
ment will save many eyes, and thus prevent much misery + 
the individual and lift a heavy economic burden from tl 
state. 
E. DEAF CHILDREN 
I. The Present Situation 
The number of deaf children in the state is unknown f 
the reason given in discussing the number of blind childre 
Nor do we know how many of our deaf children are suffere 
to grow up without any schooling. There is no law compe 
ling deaf children to attend school. The state maintains 
residential school for the deaf at Fulton, while Kansas Cit 
and St. Louis maintain day schools. These are the only sp 
cial public schools for the deaf in the state. There is a sma 
quasi-public class of four pupils conducted in one of the pul 
lie schools of Joplin, but the parents hire the teacher and tl 
work is not controlled by the board of education. There a 
several private institutions in the state for the care and ed 
cation of the deaf. It is probable that there are scores « 
deaf children of good mentality in the state who are recei 
ing no schooling whatever, in consequence of which they w: 
remain dependents when they might have been made partial 
or fully self-supporting. There are no special public-sch 
classes for children who, while not deaf, are hard of heari: 
(although such children often attend the deaf schools), a 
who need to be instructed by the visual and oral methods a 
who require special ear treatment.    
   
   
     
        
      II. Recommendations 
   1. The provisions of the compulsory-school-attendance 
should be extended so as to apply to all mentally capa 
deaf children. 
2. Whenever there are ten or more deaf children in a gi 
public-school district, special classes should be establishe
-P-A-G-E-427
  DEFECTIVE CHILDREN 411 
which instruction adapted to the needs of deaf children may 
be given. 
8. The state shall appropriate $300 annually for the sup- 
port of each public-school class for deaf children. 
4. When classes for deaf children cannot be instituted under 
the above regulations, parents shall be required to provide 
private instruction at home or enter the child in the state 
chool for the deaf. 
5. The attention of Boards of Education is called to the 
esirability of conducting special day classes for children who 
uffer from seriously and permanently impaired hearing not 
mounting to deafness, when the number of children so af- 
icted is sufficiently large to justify the establishment of such 
lasses. 
6. Section 1486, Revised Statutes of Missouri, Vol. I, 1909, 
hich fixes eight years as the lowest age of entrance to the 
ate school for the deaf, should be so amended as to make it 
lossible to admit younger children, when, in the judgment of 
e superintendent of the institution, they have sufficient in- 
lligence to profit from the instruction. It is essential that 
e education of deaf children shall be begun early if the best 
sults are to be obtained from training in lip reading. 
7. A home department should be established at the state 
titution for the deaf for the care and maintenance of young 
glected or homeless deaf children, who are not feeble- 
inded, until they can be entered in the school department. 
. An amendment should be made to Section 10,790, Re- 
led Statutes, Vol. II, 1909, providing for the imposition of 
ne of $10 upon the county clerk for every deaf child in 
county who has not been reported, in accordance with the 
ute, by the county clerk to the superintendent of the state 
itution for the deaf. 
e would suggest that it would be more logical to have the 
es and addresses of the blind, deaf, crippled, and possi- 
the feeble-minded reported to the county superintendent 
chools, who should transmit the data to the state super-

intendent of education, who in turn would report to the proper 
officials. 
9. Teachers shall be required by law to test the auditory 
acuity of school children, under regulations laid down by the} 
state department of education in all school districts which do| 
not have departments of medical inspection. Training in th 
administration of these tests shall be given in the state train 
ing schools for teachers, or, when necessary, in county insti: 
tutes.    
    
    
         
    
    
    
               
     
   F. SPEECH DEFECTIVES 
I. The Present Situation 
The number of school children throughout the state wh 
suffer from various forms of speech defect and disorder ma 
be inferred from an investigation made by the writer in tl 
St. Louis public schools, which showed that 2.8% of all t 
pupils in the elementary and high schools suffered from so 
form of speech defect. There are thousands upon thousani 
of children throughout the state whose social efficiency a 
success in life is imperiled by some speech handicap whi 
could be corrected by appropriate pedagogical and psycholo 
ical treatment if applied in time. And yet there is no speec 
corrective class in any public school in the state with o: 
exception, a small class organized in the St. Louis schools 1. 
year to meet the needs of some of my clinic cases. There 
few forms of corrective pedagogy which yield larger retu 
than the correction of speech defects. It is estimated 
authorities in this field that from 75% to 85% of speech 
fectives can be cured if given timely treatment. 
II. Recommendations 
The public schools of the state should be required to pro 
corrective training for children having speech defects. Sc 
of the defects could be handled by the regular classr 
teacher, while other defects would require the skill of 
cially trained speech teachers.

   Elementary teachers, particularly in the lower grades, 
should be trained to treat the simpler forms of articulation 
defects (lisping), while the larger cities or counties should 
lemploy qualified teachers who should devote their time ex- 
lusively to the correction of speech defects. 
G. UNSTABLE AND PSYCHOPATHIC CHILDREN 
I. The Present Situation 
The potently insane or mentally disordered children of the 
tate are committed to the state or municipal hospitals for the 
sane or the state institution for the feeble-minded and epi- 
ptic. Undoubtedly unrecognized insane children are to be 
und in the homes, in the state institutions for juvenile de- 
quents, and in the county infirmaries. While custodial care 
n be provided for children who have already become men- 
ly disordered,— although it is to be feared the children are 
t always properly grouped in the wards,— little attempt 
s been made in the state toward discovering unstable chil- 
len who are developing mental disorders, the progress of 
ich could frequently be arrested by the timely application 
proper preventive measures. 
II. Recommendations 
. There should be established in connection with the hos- 
1s for the insane, observation or psychopathic wards where 
tally unstable or incipiently insane children (as well as 
Its of the same type) may be sent for observation and 
ly, and for preventive and curative treatment, both edu- 
ional and hygienic. Public-school authorities should be 
d to make special efforts, through their departments of 
ical inspection and psycho-educational clinics, to discover 
dren of this type, in order that they may be referred for 
ed observation or in order that the school work may be 
ted to meet their peculiar needs.
-P-A-G-E-430
  414 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
2. Insane children now confined in improper institutions or 
retained in their homes should be transferred to proper wards 
in the institutions for the insane. Restorable types shoul 
not be confined with incurable adults. Children so confine 
should be given appropriate educational training by qualifie 
teachers, to be supported out of the state school funds. 
       
       
    
     
    
         
   
      
    
    
        H. MISCELLANEOUS RECOMMENDATIONS 
Educational Supervision of State Schools 
The educational work in the state institutions for the feebli 
minded, epileptic, crippled (if established), blind, deaf (th 
has been done for the deaf), and delinquent children shou 
be placed under the supervision of the state department 
‘ education. At the present time the educational work in the 
schools is without any supervision or control by some high 
state educational authority. 
The Control and Elimination of Defective Children 
I. The Present Situation 
The state of Missouri has taken no steps as yet toward 
control, reduction, or elimination of its neuropathically tain 
or hereditarily defective or degenerate classes, except tha 
has made partial provision for the temporary or perma! 
segregation in separate wards in institutions of some of 
defective males and females. But institutionalization o 
a means for the prevention of the mating of degenerates 
so long as they are effectively confined. It is recogni 
however, that the reduction of the degenerate classes cai 
be wholly accomplished by institutional restraint, partly 
cause we shall probably never obtain enough institution: 
care for all of our degenerates. Further aid can be obta| 
from the practice of enforced sterilization of degenerates 
the enforced prevention of the mating of persons suff

   from transmissible diseases. Vasectomy (and possibly the 
more recent X-ray treatment) offers a rapid and painless 
means of effectively sterilizing the male, which is not only 
harmless, so far as present evidence indicates, but frequently 
improves the physical and mental condition of the person so 
treated. The corresponding surgical operation on the female 
is harmless, although more cumbersome. 
II. Recommendations 
1. The sterilization by vasectomy and the corresponding 
operation on the female, or by any other method which may 
later be found equally effective, expeditious, and harmless, 
should be legalized and enforced on the following anti-social 
lasses who are hereditary degenerates or social and industrial 
ccompetents: the feeble-minded, the insane, the epileptic, sex- 
al perverts, rapists, confirmed drunkards, confirmed crim- 
mals, and so-called moral imbeciles. Persons to be thus op- 
rated upon under state auspices must be officially certified 
s hereditary degenerates or as unfit to assume the: responsi- 
ility of parenthood, by an official commission to consist of 
e secretary of the state board of charities and correction, 
e director of the bureau for mental defectives, if established, 
e superintendent of the institution in which the person may 
an inmate, and the secretary of the State Board of Health 
a properly qualified physician selected in his place, or by 
operly qualified persons at least one of whom must be a 
alified physician, deputized to serve in the place of the 
ove officials. This statute should not be construed as re- 
iring state certification of persons who voluntarily seek 
rilization at the hands of private medical specialists. 
2. Marriage should be prohibited between persons suffering 
m transmissible disease of a sexual nature, until cured of 
h disease, between blind and deaf persons who have not 
t been sterilized, between the feeble-minded, and between 
incurable and degenerate types of the insane and epileptic.
-P-A-G-E-432
  416 PROBLEMS OF SUBNORMALITY 
8. Persons suffering from syphilitic infection in its active 
form should be placed under quarantine until free from the 
danger of transmitting the infection. It shall be the duty of 
physicians to report all such cases coming under their ob- 
servation to the nearest public-health officer, under penalty 
of fine or imprisonment for failure so to do.

   CHAPTER SEVEN 
Tue Hycrene or EKuGENic GENERATION * 
THE PROBLEM OF PREVENTION 
N Chapters IV and VI we discussed the obligation of 
society toward the feeble-minded already born into 
the state. In this chapter we shall consider the question 
of the prevention or elimination of the feeble-minded. 
Eugenics or generative hygiene is preventive individual 
land race hygiene raised to the nth power. No measures 
or individual or collective betterment are more funda- 
ental than the hygiene of generation. To be well born 
is the fundamental prerequisite of being well bred. Gen- 
rative hygiene contemplates not only the regulation of 
he function of mating, but also the establishment of those 
onditions which will insure normal healthy generative 
rocesses in the father and mother. In addition to the 
quirement of eugenic marriages, it is also necessary to 
feguard the health and development of the fetus. More- 
ver, since the prenatal and postnatal child are one and 
e same indivisible person, we should not draw the line of 
eavage too sharply between the eugenical and euthenical 
ctors of development. We do not think that it is prac- 
able to draw a sharp eugenic line between, on the one 
nd, the hereditary prenatal factors and, on the other 
nd, the environmental prenatal (congenital) and post- 
tal factors of normal development. We believe with 
edgold that it is “absurd to contend that the germ

plasm is immutable,” that it leads a “charmed life,” 
immune from the vitiating influences of the environ- 
ment, 
In practice generative hygiene cannot be narrowly cir- 
cumscribed by academic distinctions, but must comprise 
all the orthogenic factors which condition normal develop- 
ment prior to and during conception, during the period of 
gestation (and possibly during the first postnatal period 
of life, at least so far as concerns the item of breast feed- 
ing). ‘Time limitation compels me to restrict my remarks 
to the consideration of those hygienic measures the appli- 
cation of which will make for the improvement of the in- 
born qualities of men, certainly as affects congenital traits, 
if not the hereditary, in the narrow Galtonian sense of the 
latter term. I shall state and attempt briefly to suppor 
four fundamental theses. 
1. Society should prevent degenerate or anti-cugenica 
matings. It is alleged that 30% of the general popula 
tion are carriers of neuropathic defects, that 15% of th 
present generation produces 50% of the next generatio: 
and that this producing minority represents the poore 
lower or eugenically inferior elements of the populatio’ 
Tredgold claims that 80% of feecble-mindedness is due t 
a “ neuropathic inheritance,’ while Goddard holds that 
least two thirds of the feeble-minded have inherited the 
defect. Without attempting to determine whether the 
estimates are accurate, it is at least true that heredity 
one of the most potent factors in the pathogenesis 
feeble-mindedness or degeneracy. There appears to 
substantial agreement among students of race betterme 
that palpable degenerates should not be permitted 
marry. But, on the other hand, there is less agreeme 
among clinical workers that the eugenically unfit can

diagnosed infallibly, or even to a measurably satisfactory 
extent. 
So far as relates to mental degenerates there are now in 
general use two methods of study by which it is hoped to 
make eugenic diagnoses: first, the hereditary study of an- 
cestral strains by the methods of heredity research; and 
secondly, the psychological observation or testing or study 
of the level of intelligence and of mental deviation. 
Present-day heredity studies are usually conducted with 
either a distinct Galtonian or a Mendelian bias. Accord- 
ing to Galton’s law of ancestral inheritance, one half of the 
individual’s heritage comes from the two parents (that is, 
lone fourth from each parent), one fourth from the four 
andparents (i. e., one fourth of one fourth, or one six- 
eenth, from each grandparent), one eighth from the eight 
reat grandparents (one eighth of one eighth, or one sixty- 
ourth each), etc. This law was believed to express 
ith fair accuracy the relative contribution made by the 
ifferent ancestral lines to the individual’s inherited traits. 
he law, however, did not attempt to explain the mechan- 
m of heredity. 
From a series of experiments in artificial cross-fertiliza- 
ion of common peas (which normally are self-fertilizing 
Ind which are not cross-fertilized by insects), in which he 
aced the transmission of particular characters through 
veral generations of crosses, the Austrian abbot, Mendel, 
nounced a principle of heredity in 1865 which, however, 
mained hidden until it was rediscovered independently in 
00 by DeVries, Carrens, and Tschermak. Mendel found 
at when a strain of tall peas (about six feet in height) 
s artificially crossed with a strain of dwarf peas (about 
e and a half feet tall), all the hybrid peas of the first 
al generation (called F-1) were invariably tall, Tall-

ness was found to be dominant ! and dwarfness recessive? 
When these tall hybrid peas of the first generation were 
mated, the offspring (F-2) were either tall or short but 
never intermediary. There were always approximately 
three times as many tall as short peas, the typical Men- 
delian ratio when one pair of characters is involved. 
Finally, when the seeds from the second hybrid generation 
were separately harvested and sown, it was found that the 
dwarf recessives bred true, producing nothing but dwarfs, 
but the tall peas, like the original tall hybrids, produced 
tall and dwarf peas in the ratio of 3 to 1. The same 
principle obtained in all other experiments, where the in- 
heritance of an alternative pair of characters was con: 
cerned. Successive crossings yielded only three kinds o 
individuals: dominants which bred true, dominants whic 
bred both dominants and recessives in the ratio of 3 to 1 
and recessives which always bred true. 
These and many later experiments have led to the con 
clusion that hereditary characters are independent an 
unitary and that the units or factors ® contributed by th 
parents segregate in the germ cells, so that they do no 
exercise any influence upon one another. In the cross b 
tween the tall and dwarf peas, one parent contributes t 
the offspring a unit of tallness, and the other a unit 
dwarfness. Since these units or factors exist in separa 
condition in the zygote (product of the union of t 
mature germ cells, or gametes), half of the germ c 
     
   
            
       
         
      
    
   
   
      
   1 When a character from one parent appears in the offspring to 
exclusion of the contrasted character from the other parent, it is call 
dominant. Brown eyes are dominant over blue eyes. 
2A character from one parent which remains undeveloped in 
progeny when it is associated with the corresponding dominant fr 
the other parent is called a recessive. 
8 A factor or a gene is a determiner of a particular hereditary qr 
ity.

(gametes) are tall bearing and half are dwarf bearing. 
A given germ cell will thus carry the factor for the one 
or the other of the two alternate characters,! but not a 
common factor for both. Accordingly in the third genera- 
tion two distinct characters will emerge. The separation 
of the units occurs both in the sperm and the eggs, and has 
been correlated with the separation of the chromosomes, 
which are regarded by some investigators as the bearers of 
the determiners. When the character is represented by 
two determiners, one from each parent, it is called duplex; 
when only one parent contributes a determiner, the char- 
lacter is simplex; and when the determiners are absent, it is 
ulliplea, 
The Mendelian theory has been applied to the explana- 
ion of the inheritance of a large number of characters in 
lants and animals and, particularly in the United States, 
o a large number of mental and physical traits in man, 
cluding such complex conditions as feeble-mindedness, 
pilepsy, insanity, and other equally complex anti-eugenic 
ental states. Some Mendelians have asserted that, given 
rtain conditions of ancestral strains, it is possible to 
recast with almost mathematical precision the relative 
cidence in future generations of normality and abnor- 
ality, feeble-mindedness, insanity, and epilepsy. We are 
Id that feeble-mindedness is a unit trait, that it behaves 
e a recessive, following the Mendelian ratio, that when 
o feeble-minded persons are mated all the children will 
ewise be feeble-minded, that when a feeble-minded and 
perfectly normal person are mated the children will be 
rmal but carriers of feeble-mindedness, and that when 
© carriers marry 25% of the offspring will be defective 
ile 50% will continue to be carriers. 
One of a pair of opposite characters is known as an allelomorph.

These views, regarded by many as extreme and pre- 
mature, as applied to human heredity, have been vigor- 
ously combated, particularly by the workers connected 
with the Galton Laboratory. The exhaustive analysis and 
searching criticism by Heron? of American investigations 
of epilepsy, insanity, and feeble-mindedness is in point. 
Heron is particularly severe in his criticism of the methods 
employed of tabulating and charting the data and inter- 
preting the results. While we cannot quite subscribe to 
all of Heron’s conclusions, our observation of the work of 
heredity field workers and our study of the hereditary 
data gathered on the mentally abnormal cases which have 
passed through our clinics have made us suspicious of the| 
adequacy of the ordinary methods of gathering human| 
heredity data. These data are usually gathered by teach: 
ers, nurses, or social workers who have been given a shor 
course on heredity field work and possibly a short. cours’ 
on mental tests. Rarely have they been gathered by th 
technically trained biologists or biometrists or by clinical 
psychologists or physicians trained in genetics. The ex; 
pert geneticist or psychologist has, rather, devoted hi 
time to tabulating and interpreting the data gathered b 
the lay field workers, or to interpreting the data which tl 
field workers have both gathered and tabulated. 
But it seems to us that the most important part 
heredity research —the crux of the whole question 
issue — is the first-hand accumulation of accurate dat: 
the accuracy of which is capable of satisfactory scientii 
demonstration and verification. No amount of expertne| 
in the study of tabulated data will atone for, or take t

place of, uncertainty or error in the original data them- 
selves. It is indeed a far cry to assume that lay workers 
who do not possess a thorough grounding in the canons 
of scientific induction or in the general methods of scien- 
tific research — in the methods of accurate scientific ob- 
servation and experimentation, in the methods of accurate 
collecting, analyzing, verifying, evaluating, and interpret- 
ing facts — and who are only partly trained in the science 
of psychological, physical, and hereditary diagnosis, are 
able to determine from interviews with parents, relatives, 
friends, court officers, physicians, and clergymen the 
proper mental classification of a given ancestor, and that 
they are able to determine whether or not the condition 
found is due to hereditary factors and exactly what is the 
character of these factors. Nor do we think that it is 
ossible in a very large number of cases for the lay worker, 
r even the experienced examiner, to determine by a con- 
ersation with the subject himself whether he is or is not 
eeble-minded, even, in many cases, with the aid of the 
inet scale. Merely on the basis of interviews we should 
ot be able to say that more than a dozen of the thousands 
f parents who have brought feeble-minded and backward 
hildren into our clinics have been feeble-minded. By this 
rude means it is impossible to determine in a preponderant 
umber of cases whether the person is feeble-minded, 
rderline, or backward. Our own experience tends to 
ow that the accurate determination of the etiological 
reditary factors of mental abnormalities is frequently 
st as difficult, abstruse, and technical as the scientific 
fferential diagnosis of bodily diseases or mental devi- 
ions, and that the one essential preliminary condition to 
king reliable hereditary diagnoses is prolonged training 
heredo-biology and heredo-psychology. Moreover, if  
-P-A-G-E-440

the investigator must also classify the individuals under 
investigation, he must be skilled in mental and physical 
diagnosis. Many heredity charts have been constructed 
on insecure foundations. The fact that scholarly 
minds have examined with keen critical scrutiny the 
postulated facts which have been gathered for them cannot, 
as we have said, remove this primal insecurity, first, be- 
cause they have not had direct access to the persons who 
have been classified and have therefore been unable to 
verify the diagnoses by a first-hand examination ; and, sec- 
ond, because, even assuming that the fraternities have been 
accurately diagnosed, it is frequently impossible to deter- 
mine whether or not there is any causal connection between| 
the mental abnormality found in a forebear and the menta 
abnormality found in an offspring. The mere fact tha 
feeble-mindedness exists in the direct or indirect ancestra’ 
lines does not prove that it is the cause of feeble-minded: 
ness in the descendants. The contrary reasoning is base 
on the fallacious assumption that what goes before mus: 
necessarily be the cause of that which follows, that whe 
an antecedent resembles a consequent it must be the pro| 
ducing agent of the consequent, although, as is well know 
there may be no causal relation whatever between seque 
tial events. We must clearly recognize that there is fr 
quently a plurality of causes responsible for any case 
biologic variation, and no one but an experienced expert 
and quite frequently not even the best trained expert 
can determine indubitably which is the cause or which 
accidental antecedent or accompaniment. Our best effor 
in this field are frequently little better than guarded co: 
jectures. In our clinics we are constantly confront 
with such cases as this: a feeble-minded child with dip 
theria or typhoid at, say, three, and with a grandfat

     HYGIENE OF EUGENIC GENERATION 425 
or uncle or cousin who is alleged to be “ feeble-minded,” 
“not exactly right,” “queer,” or “ peculiar.” What is 
the primary etiological factor? How should such a case 
be charted? As inherited or acquired feeble-mindedness, 
or as acquired feeble-mindedness resting on a neuropathic 
background? ‘There is no unequivocal reply; it is fre- 
quently impossible to come to any definite conclusion. 
We must take care lest we fall into the smug belief that 
heredity diagnoses are so easy that they can be made 
by any one, or that we have located the causative agent 
when we have put a certain square or circle upon a chart. 
There are hundreds of thousands of mentally abnormal in- 
dividuals in whom the etiological factors lie concealed in 
deepest obscurity. It is the duty of every sincere eugenist 
elentlessly to combat careless or unscientific heredity work 
while it is also his duty to commend and encourage the 
eally good work done, and there is a good deal of valu- 
ble critical research now being prosecuted in this field — 
ecause it is being accepted at its face value by the un- 
ritical, and because it may therefore lead to the enact- 
ent of precipitate legislation which in the end must bring 
iscredit upon the science of eugenics. 
The belief that any so-called heredity field worker is 
mpetent to make scientific diagnoses after taking short 
urses on heredity field work, is akin to the dogma, 
ce promulgated, that Binet testers are thoroughly quali- 
d to make reliable psychological diagnoses of cases after 
king a summer course on subnormal children and mental 
sts. As a matter of fact, there is no psychic measuring 
d in existence by which we can automatically or mechan- 
Ily identify accurately high-grade mental degenerates or 
fectives, by which we can unerringly distinguish between 
th-grade feeble-minded and backward cases, and by

    which we can determine whether the abnormality in high- 
grade defectives is or is not anti-eugenic in character. 
But it is precisely the eugenically unfit persons who grade 
nearest the standard of mental normality whom it is most 
necessary to identify, because these individuals are the 
most numerous, they are the most prolific breeders and 
constitute perhaps the gravest social and moral offenders. 
It is quite easy to identify the lowest grades of defectives 
by existing methods, but they are often sterile and hence 
set no eugenic problem. Not only so; it is quite prob- 
able that many normal persons are carriers of trans 
missible degenerate strains, but there is at present n 
infallible method, whether psychological, hereditary, o 
medical, by which these individuals can be identified 
Moreover, germ plasm which originally was eugenicall. 
, fit probably may become impaired by external causes, s 
that dominants may be transformed into recessives, thu 
inverting the Mendelian laws. Even if Mendelism can bj 
shown to apply, so complex is the mechanism of heredit 
on Mendelian principles that with only 20 pairs of chrom 
somes it is possible to form over one million kinds 
germinal cells in the F-1 hybrid. Therefore, while we al 
believe in the dominant force of heredity and in the teac! 
ings of negative eugenics so far as concerns the preventi 
of palpably degenerate matings, we fear that the ordina: 
field worker and the ordinary mental tester are frequent 
quite unable reliably to differentiate between the euge 
ically fit and unfit, and even the scientific experts in hered| 
biology and heredo-psychology are unable infallibly 
identify all the high-grade cases of eugenic unfitness or 
cases of pure simplex or duplex normal stock. Nor 
we know that there is any experimental or scientific w 
rant for the dictum that “weakness should ma:
-P-A-G-E-443
      HYGIENE OF EUGENIC GENERATION 427 
strength.” In the first place, we do not know that there 
is any authority who can make out a reliable chart of the 
eugenically weak or the eugenically strong traits which 
exist in the parties of a given marriage union, whether 
normal or high-grade defective. In the second place, we 
know of no one who can guarantee that when weakness 
marries strength, the progeny will all be normal or that 
the weak traits will not eventually crop out as recessives 
in later generations. 
The difficulties which we have pointed out in hereditary 
land psychological diagnoses may be reinforced by refer- 
nce to a recent clinic case: 
A young man of Russian-German descent, 21 years 1 
onth old at the time of the examination in January, 1914, 
he fourth of six children, born in Pennsylvania, removed 
o Germany at the age of six, remained there eleven years, 
eturning to America four years ago. 
The history of the case indicates that he was born on 
ime, but the birth conditions were difficult, requiring an 
strumental delivery after 48 hours of labor; that anima- 
on had to be established by slapping; that the mother was 
ry nervous during gestation; that the child was very 
ny for some time after birth; that he was bottle-fed; 
at he was unable for some time to assimilate various 
ificial foods, but finally began to grow rapidly on 
ellin’s Food and Swiss condensed milk. 
At four he had whooping cough, and hurt his head 
erely by running against a hinge on a door, which ren- 
ed him unconscious for a while, but he apparently re- 
ered. At five he fell into a lime kiln, but only his hands 
re slightly burned before he was rescued. Somewhat 
er, after his removal to Germany, his caretaker re- 
ted that he had had a strange spell: crying out in his

    sleep, kicking, and jumping out of bed in a frenzy of ex- 
citement, although apparently unconscious throughout the 
entire performance. Spells of crying and kicking, without 
any attempt to wander about in the room, recurred several 
times during the following two weeks. (The boy reported 
that he had had an epileptic seizure at a much later date.) 
A short time after these occurrences he was vaccinated. 
After the operation his arm swelled greatly, and became 
discolored with dark blue spots. He was obliged to have 
it bandaged and supported on a table for a week. At 
seven he had measles; and at fourteen it was believed that 
he practiced self-abuse for a time. 
As a child and a youth he was more or less queer: h 
never took any interest in games or sports, and neve 
had any intimate boyhood friendships. He had a continu 
ous record of outbursts, beating and slapping his sisters 
engaging in fights and brawls with comrades and teachers| 
of lying and stealing, and of bragging and boasting. 
His relations with his mother were almost alway, 
strained. His school history is one record of incompati 
bility and maladjustment. He entered a kindergarten i 
America at about six; the next year (in 1898) he remove 
to Germany and entered a second kindergarten, from whi 
he was dismissed because of unruly conduct. In 1899 
had a private tutor for about a year. In 1900 he w 
placed in a boarding school, but was removed because 
“could not fit in with the other pupils,” and was kept 
home for a while. In 1902, in a boys’ boarding school, 
proved to be stubborn, willful, cowardly, morally obtu: 
disobedient and disrespectful to teachers and elders. 
1903 he was permitted to remain less than a year in 
higher school for a small group of select boys, beca 
of his thieving habits. He explained that he “ stole
-P-A-G-E-445
  HYGIENE OF EUGENIC GENERATION 429 
cause the others stole from me.” In 1903 and 1904 he 
was placed in another private school. Here he did his 
best work because he became attached to one of thé in- 
structors, apparently because the latter gave him money, 
bought him toys and candy, and aided him unfairly in his 
lessons. At this time he manifested a desire to become a 
chauffeur, and rebelled against the scholastic and religious 
training. His parents suspected that there were secret 
understandings or clandestine relations between the in- 
structor and the boy, and therefore removed him to a 
private school of the aristocracy, where most of the teach- 
ers were young students. Here he was always getting 
into trouble and indulging in fist fights. He knocked a 
young teacher flat, because he claimed he did him an in- 
justice. The director then dismissed him on the ground 
hat he was not normal. He was returned home, and spent 
he summer of the same year (1906) in an informal vaca- 
ion school. Here he led a free, natural life, without 
spionage, studying nature. Here he also had his first 
mance. The young girl proposed that he kiss her, but 
e did not do so because, as he alleged, he “ did not know 
ust how.” This youthful romance upset the routine of 
is life for some time: he could neither study nor work, 
“he was always thinking of her.” 
‘While staying at home he was constantly clashing with 
s mother. She punished him severely (he was “ beaten 
til black and blue”), taunted him for his failures, 
igged at him and forced him to apply himself to intel- 
‘tual pursuits. He was so nervous and irritable that he 
uld not endure his sister’s piano practice, and accord- 
‘ly started to demolish the instrument with a hammer.

police were notified he tried to kill himself by hanging by 
a cord attached to a gas fixture. He was sent to an 
asylum for the insane, where he remained for six weeks, 
and where he was examined by three physicians, who pro- 
nounced him “ not demented ” but deficient and in need of 
protective oversight, and who counseled him to control his 
temper. 
In 1909 he was sent to a preparatory day school, but 
was unable to make his examinations, “ because he could 
not concentrate.” In spite of this uninterrupted record 
of maladaptation in various school environments, the 
mother reports that she did not see anything wrong or 
abnormal with him until the age of fourteen: the father, 
however, reports that he was not normal from the age of 
eight. He is said to have completed higher mathematics} 
and ancient and modern history, and to read English. 
German, and French, although he has “no aptitude fo: 
languages.” At this time he again expressed a desire t 
become a chauffeur. 
In 1910 he returned with his parents to America, Hii 
first exploit here was to run away from a boarding hous 
in which he had been placed under kindly supervision. Fo 
some time he led the life of a vagabond, sleeping in park 
and out-houses, and getting his food no one knew wher

Norfolk Training School he got along fairly well until he 
began to steal —“ but not,” as he again affirmed, “ before 
the others stole from me.” Here he was court-martialed 
several times for insubordination. On the battleship 
Minnesota he alleges that he was constantly teased and 
bullied by the sailors. On ship he was in disgrace most 
of the time. His entire income disappeared in fines. He 
talked freely of his “scraps” to the social worker, of 
sailors clubbing officers, of his getting possession of money 
from drunken sailors, of his attempt to desert with another 
man at Vera Cruz. Finally he knocked a lad down be- 
cause, as he says, “ he stole from me,” was court-martialed 
and dishonorably discharged in July, 1913 — after about 
two and a half years of service. The boys on the battle- 
hip took up a collection and sent him to his parents. 
His record since his return home has been one of in- 
jolence, disobedience, defiance, unemployment, and loafing. 
e left his first place, where he was taking care of a garden 
nd a horse, because he was once asked to bring some one 
ome at 11.00 v.m. After a week at home loafing and 
ob hunting he secured a job in a clubhouse, which he held 
r three weeks. This was followed by a week’s layoff 
tt home. Then he worked one week each in two hotels. 
fter holding another job for about a week he returned 
me in September. Then he disappeared for about five 
leeks. On his return he said he had been taking care of 
ickens in a country place. Here he said two men threat- 
ed to shoot him. He now took a correspondence course 
railroad engineering, but made no progress because he 
‘ailed to apply himself.” Then he wanted to enter an 
tomobile school, but clashed with his mother, became in- 
lent, struck her in the face (she spat on him, he said), 
id knocked his father down when he interfered. For

ated in the city jail for three weeks. He was released on 
parole for one year, with instructions to stay away from 
his parents. His parents supported him in a boarding 
house in another part of the city. His mother then ar- 
ranged to have him enter an automobile school. He 
backed out at first, finally entered the school, but at the 
end of the first day came home drunk, furiously angry be- 
cause he had been allowed only $5.00 instead of $8.00 a 
week for his lodging and board, and threatened to kill his 
father. 
At this point the aid of the psychological clinic was in- 
voked. The anthropometric examination showed that he 
was underdeveloped, but only to a slight extent, in stand- 
ing and sitting (particularly) stature, weight, strength o 
grip, and in lung capacity. He had a number of cariou: 
teeth. On the mental side, however, he was very consider 
ably retarded. His rating by the Binet tests was 10.6 
His memory span was decidedly limited. In the moto 
speed test (form board) he measured twelve years. Hi 
did the simpler of the Healy puzzle tests but failed on th 
more difficult one. He failed on the clock-hand test (agi

a horse weighs 1400 lbs. when standing on four legs, ho 
much will he weigh when standing on three? he replie 
“TI cannot tell you. There is more weight in certai 
parts.” To the question: If three men standing on t 
of a high tower can see six miles, how far can each o

mated that he did not need to attempt answers if he did not 
want to, and that he did not see how the testing was going 
to help him get a job. He had been induced to come to 
the clinic in order that he might have his vocational fitness 
determined. His bearing throughout was more or less ar- 
rogant, he had an exaggerated opinion of his own worth, 
said that he would not under any circumstances take a 
position in a factory or mill (it was beneath his dignity), 
and that his only interest was in the automobile business. 
He seemed to feel that his parents were wealthy, and ought 
to support him in luxury; he entertained a warped atti- 
tude toward life; seemed to be lacking in feeling dynamic; 
and manifested evident emotional instability and abnor- 
mality of disposition. He complained that he had never 
been given a chance to make good, and did not leave the 
linic in the best spirit. 
After the examination he called upon the social worker 
gain and again, although not always in a gentlemanly 
ay, pleading with her to aid him; but he made it clear 
hat he would not take any job that did not happen to 
ppeal to his fancy. Finally, in order to guarantee him a 
hance at his frequently expressed vocational choice, the 
jocial worker managed to secure funds from the Associ- 
tion for the Improvement of the Poor with which to pro- 
ide him with a two weeks’ course in an automobile school.

     work and make good the clinic could do nothing further 
for him. He seemed delighted over the prospect, and ex- 
pressed his gratitude. But he remained in the school only 
one and a half days, and during this time he learned about 
as much as the ordinary student learns in two hours. 
When seen by the social worker his feeling of gratitude 
had entirely evaporated. He said he had not wanted to 
take the course in the first place — that the social worker 
had coaxed him to take it; that he saw nothing in it for 
him; and offered as a pretext for his intention to quit, 
the fact that his tuition had not been paid, although he 
had been assured that provision had been made to take 
care of his expenses. He was told he could expect no 
further financial aid from the clinic or from his home, 
and that he would now have to shift for himself. After 
this he continued to call on the social worker almost daily, 
sometimes in a rude, surly manner, sometimes in an apolo- 
getic mood, sometimes comporting himself like a well-bred 
gentleman, sometimes leaving the house without bidding} 
good night. He made frequent appeals for anothe: 
chance in another automobile school. He likewise con 
tinued to call at his parents’ home, but was not always abl 
to gain admittance. February 3, 1914, he forced his en- 
trance through a window and stole a concert ticket, an 
on February 5, on the advice of the clinic, he was arreste 
on the charge of incorrigibility, with a view to havin; 
him incarcerated in the state reformatory for industri 
training under proper restraint. But since the jud 
failed to commit him he was persuaded to spend a wee 
in the observation ward of a hospital, and as a result 
this further study he was committed on March 8 to a 
institution for the mentally disordered. On March 12

his neck and attempted to choke him. Since the time he 
‘was disciplined for this offense his conduct has been fairly 
satisfactory. 
We have given this history in some detail because this 
boy is a fair representative of a large army of abnormals 
who are not always recognized as sufficiently abnormal to 
require special educational care or social supervision, al- 
though they are an actual or potential menace in one way 
or another to society; who are usually allowed to drift 
along until they become confirmed social parasites, vaga- 
bonds or criminals, and for whose training and restraint 
society has thus far largely failed to provide the right 
kind of institution. 
But now to the two points which we desired to illus- 
trate by means of this case history. In the first place, is 
this boy feeble-minded? Undoubtedly so, if judged. by 
the common Binet standard, for he measured only 10.6 
years. But equally certainly not, if judged by the entire 
symptom-complex. His inferiority in the intelligence 
tests is not so much due to sheer lack of intelligence as to 
is abnormal attitudes, his lack of feeling dynamic or his 
lexcessive emotivity, his incapacity or unwillingness to 
pply himself. He belongs to that large army of border- 
and cases who are not quite feeble-minded nor yet pal- 
ably insane, but which make up the group of “ unsta- 
les? who occupy the twilight zone between the distinctly 
mented on the one hand, and the mentally disordered on 
the other hand — a group of moral and mental inferiors, 
ometimes manifesting traits of high-grade moral imbe- 
ility (or heboidophrenia), and sometimes presenting the 
spects of constitutional inferiority or psychopathic con- 
itution, or masked or psychic epilepsy. These twilight 
ates between sanity and insanity and between subnor-

   mality (i.e., feeble-mindedness) and normality cannot be 
diagnosticated by mere schemes of intelligence tests. In- 
cidentally it may be said that these types of abnormal 
individuals should be diagnosed much earlier in their ca- 
reers than is usually done. They should be picked out in 
the elementary and secondary schools, and be subjected to 
appropriate educational and physical treatment. 
In the second place, is the boy eugenically unfit? Cer- 
tainly he ought not to marry as long as he remains indus- 
trially incompetent, as long as his perspective of life is 
distorted, and as long as he manifests pronounced emo- 
tional instability and violent outbursts of temper. But is 
he unfit for eugenic procreation? We are in no position 
to dogmatize about this. The ancestral history is largely 
negative in respect to neuropathic taint. One paternal 
aunt died of tuberculosis, two paternal uncles died of heart 
disease, and one maternal brother died insane. The latter 
is said to have been perfectly normal until he received a 
severe blow on the head from a falling saddle. After re- 
covery a second violent attack occurred during his honey- 
moon voyage across the ocean and was said to have been| 
brought on by seasickness. Shall we say that the taint 
of insanity was inherent, and that the accident merel. 
removed the barriers? Or shall we say that the diseas 
was of accidental origin? There is no conclusive evidenc 
for either view. 
Coming to the boy’s immediate family, we find that th 
oldest child, a sister, was prematurely born dead. Th 
mother attributes the fatal prematurity to a severe frigh 
caused by a fire which broke out in the room she was og 
cupying. The second child died at the age of one fro 
sunstroke. Her head was left exposed to a hot sun by 
careless attendant. The other children are apparent]

   HYGIENE OF EUGENIC GENERATION 487 
normal, except a sister attending a boarding school, who 
is said to be capricious, high tempered, indiscreet, and a 
flirt. She likes the sensational, and has kleptomaniac 
tendencies. The father is a well-educated, cultured gen- 
tleman who has held responsible government and ecclesi- 
astical positions here and abroad, while the mother also 
possesses a good education, having at one time taught in a 
high school. However, she is said to be very high spirited, 
and is subject to occasional violent outbursts of temper 
which often culminate in a fainting spell with loss of con- 
sciousness and stiffening of the limbs instead of convulsive 
movements. The husband reports that her hysterical 
manifestations date back at least to the time of their 
marriage. On her way to America before marriage she 
was in a shipwreck. From this experience she suffered 
a severe nervous shock. Shall we say that the abnormal 
manifestations of the mother are hereditary or that they 
are due to the severe nervous shocks caused by fright 
experienced in a shipwreck and in a fire? An unequivocal 
answer is scarcely possible. Shall we say that the abnor- 
malities of the son are due to a neuropathic taint trans- 
itted by the mother, or that it is due to difficult birth, 
© the head blow received at the age of five, to the pun- 
shment he received from his mother, and to the influence 
f her abnormal behavior, or to a combination of environ- 
ental and hereditary factors? Is it not clear that when 
he factors are so complicated as in this case — and this 
ase is typical of thousands of others —we cannot be 
lure of the pathogenesis? Who would be willing to affirm 
at this boy if he could be trained to live a normal life 
ind if he married a normal girl, would be unfitted for eu- 
enic procreation? Who of us could demonstrate a priori 
at he would or would not be so fitted? The fact is,

     eugenic diagnosis is not far enough advanced to permit 
of unequivocal answers in thousands of cases difficult to 
diagnose. 
While it is important, therefore, that we clearly recog- 
nize the difficulties involved in the correct diagnosis of 
anti-eugenic stocks, so that the problem may receive con- 
tinued critical investigation, we should not forget that the 
most important factor, or at least one of the most impor- 
tant factors, in eugenical hygiene is the prevention of 
the propagation of inherently, that is hereditarily, weak- 
ened, defective, and degenerate strains.’ 
2. Society should adopt measures to prevent the syphil- 
ization of the unborn child. Numerous investigations 
have been made to determine the influence of parental 
syphilis upon the fetal and post-fetal child, but the re- 
sults have often led to disagreement and controversy. 
That parental syphilis is at least one of the causes of 
the abortion, miscarriage, or early mortality of many 
both eugenically fit and unfit infants seems to us to be 
strongly indicated by the available evidence. The impor- 
tance of this conclusion, if true, may be judged from the 
following figures: 
According to the best estimates, from one fifth to on 
fourth of all the children born die before the age of on 
year, and one third before the age of five years. At leas 
one third of infant mortality is due to prenatal causes, t 
prematurity and still-births. If the prematures (all in 
fants weighing less than five pounds) weigh only fou 
pounds or less, 98% of them die, unless they are proper] 
cared for in incubator hospitals (in such hospitals i 
France the mortality rate has been reduced to from 15 t 
25%), while if they weigh somewhat over four pounds th 
mortality varies from 15% for breast-fed to 41% fo

   HYGIENE OF EUGENIC GENERATION 489 
bottle-fed infants. Fully one half of the deaths within 
the first month of life in New York City in 1911 to 1912 
were due to prematurity or congenital weakness (Henry 
Koplik), while 80% of the deaths in the first week in the 
state of Michigan from 1910 to 1912 were due to pre- 
maturity, deficient vitality, and congenital malformations. 
The percentage of still-born in Germany in 1906 amounted 
to 3% of all births, and in New York City in 1911 and 
1912, 5% (Henry Koplik). The proportion of prema- 
tures, still-births, and births which barely escape these 
conditions varies greatly in different localities but it is 
thought to be increasing in all civilized countries (Kaye). 
In certain districts in England the number of still-births 
increased from 47.3 per 1000 in 1901 to 56.3 per 1000 
in 1905. 
Now, since prenatal syphilis may be transmitted with 
ull virulence to the offspring and since it is almost cer- 
ainly transmitted when the mother suffers from the sec- 
mdary symptoms, it would be strange if it did not some- 
ow affect the causation of prematurity, still-birth at 
erm, congenital debility, and early infant mortality. 
ositive studies indicate that it exerts a very perceptible 
fluence. 
One authority finds that when the father is infected, 
early 40% of the babies perish, while the mortality when 
e mother is also infected, ranges between 60 and 80%. 
me third die within the first six months, while the chance of 
ing under fifteen is seven times greater for the syphilitic 
an for the non-syphilitic (Prince Morrow). Of 206 
philitic pregnancies in France, abortions occurred in 36, 
ill-births in 8, and deaths soon after birth in 69, giving 
mortality of 55%. Fifty of the living children were 
philitic, while only 43 were in good health (Jullien).

   In another group of 154 syphilitic pregnancies, there were 
120 abortions or still-births, 26 deaths soon after birth 
and only 8 survivals (Le Pileur). In the Foundling Asy- 
lum in Moscow, the mortality among 2088 syphilitic in- 
fants amounted to 70%. One authority maintains that 
the number of still-births among illegitimate children 
amounts to 50% more than among those born in wed- 
lock, but another writer (Weinberg) states that the dif- 
ference amounts to only 1%. The latter investigator, 
however, admits that the illegitimates suffer from con- 
genital debility — undoubtedly due in part to syphilis in- 
fection — and are thus more predisposed to morbidity, 
inanition, atrophy, and gastro-intestinal disorders which 
lead to death later. Moreover, it is to be remembere 
that there are thousands of abortions of illegitimates tha 
never become a matter of record. It is probably true tha 
most congenitally syphilitic children are healthy at birt 
and do not show the symptoms until between the first an 
sixth week. Nevertheless, it is more difficult to cure in 
fantile than adult syphilis and more difficult to cure th 
congenital than the acquired type. Indeed, debilitate 
children, whatever the cause of the debility, offer littl 
hope for progressive amelioration. Thus the death r 
ductions in New York City during the last thirty yea 
amounted to 70% for contagious disease, 88% for re 
piratory diseases, 37% for diarrhea cases, but only 4 
for congenital debility cases. The susceptibility of syph 
litic children to the following diseases is said to be great 
than for non-syphilitic children by the ratios indicated:

80% of the cases with tubercular hip disease, 40% of 
the cases with gastroenteritis, and 60% of the cases with 
tubercular meningitis are congenital syphilitics (Prince 
Morrow). Congenital syphilis and parasyphilitic condi- 
tions lessen both the constitutional and local resistance 
and leave many, if not most, of the surviving children 
delicate, thin, poorly nourished, suffering from bone dis- 
orders and malformations, and with delayed development 
of dentition, speech, walking, physical growth and pu- 
berty. The arrest at times amounts to actual infantilism. 
At three or four the child may be without teeth, and at 
ten or eleven he may have the physical growth of the six- 
year-old. In intelligence or mortality he sometimes be- 
comes imbecile or insane, or a moral degenerate or per- 
ert. 
Although the evidence is not conclusive, congenital 
yphilis is probably one of the causes of insanity (of 25% 
f inherited insanity, say some) and feeble-mindedness. 
me authority found a syphilitic family history in 80% 
f 40 carefully investigated cases of juvenile dementia 
* juvenile general paralysis °— F. W. Mott). This af- 
iction is now generally conceded to be due to syphilis. 
‘he mental arrest often does not become patent until the 
eriod of second dentition. These cases ordinarily un- 
lergo rapid progressive deterioration. A special rela- 
ion has been found by some investigators between congen- 
al syphilis and imbecility with motor paralysis (Plaut, 
Leslie Gordon) and hydrocephalus. Some authorities 
lieve that parental syphilis is the cause of mongolism 
utherland, H. C. Stevens), while this is denied by other 
vestigators (J. E. McClelland and H. O. Ruh). Aside 
liom the above types, the réle of congenital syphilis is 
ought to be just as important in the production of the

   simple form of feeble-mindedness as of any of the special 
types. A careful study of the family histories of 90 fee- 
ble-minded patients over sixteen years of age showed that 
one or the other of the parents were syphilitic in 14.4% of 
the cases (E. B. Sherlock). On the other hand, in an in- 
vestigation of 2400 pauper idiots in London, clear clinical 
evidences of congenital syphilis were found in only 1.17% 
of the cases, although it was suspected in a larger number 
(G. E. Shuttleworth and F, Beach), and in another in- 
vestigation in only .6% of 4830 cases (G. F. Still). 
Other investigators give the percentage as 2 (Langdon 
Down, Kerlin) and 2.5 (A. F. Tredgold). There are, 
of course, many cases of congenital syphilis which can be 
recognized only with difficulty, even with the aid of re- 
fined laboratory technique. Were these cases added the| 
percentage would probably be somewhat increased. Posi: 
tive Wassermann’s have been secured in the followin 
proportion of cases by different investigators: in 15.4%| 
of 330 idiots, although only 3% could be classed as syphi 
litie suspects (H. R. Dean) ; in 30% of 246 cases (Ra 
viart, et al.) ; in 60% of 105 cases (Fraser and Watson) 
in 21.3% of 262 cases (Kréber); in 45% of 20 case 
(Chislett) ; and in 22% of 361 institutional cases (2 plu 
in the blood or spinal fluid), selected at random, the pe 
centage being 22 for idiots, 24 for imbeciles, 15 for m 
rons, and 31% for backward cases (H. F. Freemmel 
Other writers report the following per cents of positi 
reactions: 1.5% (Thomsen, et al.), 4% (Dawson 
10% (Rees Thomas), 13.2% (Lippmann), 14.6% (A

ings by different workers. These discrepancies are pro]

     HYGIENE OF EUGENIC GENERATION 443 
ably more largely due to differences in the Wassermann 
technique and the standards employed than to in- 
herent differences in the subjects, although it is recog- 
nized that more positive reactions are obtained in 
early life. The Wassermann reaction perhaps is not 
an absolute specific for syphilis, because it can also be 
elicited in other diseases. The reaction is positive in yaws, 
recurrent fever, malaria, trypanosomiasis, frambesia; 
sometimes in tuberculosis, diabetes, and malignant disease ; 
nd sometimes transiently in scarlet fever, pneumonia, and 
oliomyelitis, in which diseases it disappears after the 
risis while it is never found in the cerebrospinal fluid. 
he positive reaction in some of these diseases may, of 
‘course, be due to the presence of syphilis. Nevertheless 
lhe more conservative investigators have reached the con- 
lusion that only a careful 2 or 8 Wassermann is pathog- 
omonic of syphilis. 
We believe that parental syphilis is one of the causes of 
eble-mindedness, but we do not think that it is possible 
our present stage of knowledge to say just how impor- 
nt this factor is. This question probably cannot be 
tisfactorily settled until we have gathered extensive 
rallel data for normal cases. Several congenital syphi- 
ic juveniles whom we have examined have suffered no 
ntal impairment, but the majority have been more or 
s mentally arrested, although not feeble-minded. 
Gonococcus infection is probably the chief cause of 
rility, and of 75% of infant blindness. The sterility 
the blindness probably affect the fit as well as the 
it stock in equal measure. We know of no cases of 
le-mindedness caused by this disease. 
ll in all, venereal diseases constitute, we believe, one of 
arch destroyers of human stock which may be in-

       herently noble and in every way eugenically fit. The 
racial injury is just as positive even if the hereditary 
qualities are but slightly affected. One of the important 
eugenic measures, therefore, is the desyphilization of the 
human race. The campaign against the black plague} 
would be easy if human beings could be persuaded to liv 
virtuous lives. But many persons cannot be persuade: 
thus to live by the logic of fact or by appeal to con 
science and must therefore be brought to bay, so far a 
possible, through the instrumentality of prohibitive legis 
lation. The fight must go on until laws have been place 
on the statute books everywhere requiring the registratio: 
of infected persons, together with the prohibition of ma: 
riage or intercourse between such persons until they ar| 
cured. If this does not prove effective, we may, for t' 
sake of the preservation of racial purity, be forced to fo 
low the example of the army surgeons in various civiliz 
countries who compel soldiers who will not live within t 
moral law to use prophylactics. This practice may n 
conform to our traditional principles of morality, but 
seems to me that humanity is in the process of evolvi 
a new ethical code based upon eugenical imperativ 
Any measure will merit the eugenical sanction if the ul 
mate result is the permanent improvement or preservati 
of the human stock. Is not the enforced use of vener

   HYGIENE OF EUGENIC GENERATION 445 
to two important conclusions: first, that parental alco- 
holism is almost a negligible factor in eugenic procrea- 
tion; and, secondly, that practically all of the earlier 
investigations purporting to show the evil hereditary ef- 
fects of alcohol are irrelevant or worthless. While ad- 
mitting that the investigations of human alcoholism rather 
suggest than indubitably demonstrate that alcohol is a 
race poison, it seems to us that many of the conclusions 
based on animal experimentation amount to positive 
demonstration, and that the results thus reached can be 
pplied analogically to the question of human heredity. 
Most suggestive, as indicating the possibility of injur- 
ing the reproductive and somatic cells of the offspring 
y parental indulgence in alcohol, are certain experiments 
nm normal guinea pigs which were obliged to inhale con- 
rolled quantities of the fumes of alcohol or ether for six 
lays weekly during extensive periods of time, amounting 
three years in some cases. In order to secure normal 
ock for this experiment, pigs were first tested by nor- 
al matings. The treatment did not affect the health 
development of the pigs. The alcoholized males and 
males, as well as the unalcoholized descendants of alco- 
lized parentage, were mated with both normal and alco- 
lized stock. 
The results showed that “an alcoholized male guinea 
almost invariably begets defective offspring even when 
ted with a Nigorous sonusl tna aeat thas the ef- 
ts were nearly as bad on the second generation (Stock- 
). Of 103 full-term matings 42% gave negative 
ults or early abortions, 13.5% gave still-born lit- 
's, 45% resulted in living litters, containing 89 young 
whom only 58% survived. On the other hand, the 
control normal matings gave 94% of full-term litters,

about 14% of still-born litters, 91.5% of living litters, 
containing 60 young of whom 93% survived. The pro- 
portion of alcohol in the testes and in the ovary compared 
with the proportion in the blood has been found to be as 
2 to 3 and 8 to 5, respectively (Nicloux and Renauet). 
Alcohol, therefore, apparently can act deleteriously di- 
rectly on the spermatozoa and eggs before or during th 
period of impregnation. 
Studies of human alcoholism indicate that alcohol pro 
duces almost instantaneous changes in the constituents o: 
the blood (Richardson), lessening the normal resistanc 
of the red corpuscles (Laitenen) and producing tempo} 
rary paralysis of the phagocytes (Metchnikoff), while i 
women it may also temporarily paralyze the ovum an 
produce ovarian degeneration (Lancereaux). In ti 
male alcohol has similar effects on the blood and t! 
spermatozoa and leads to testicular degeneration or atr 
phy. In 89 chronic alcoholics atrophy of the testicul 
tissue was found in 37 cases (Weichselbaum), while az 
ospermia was found in 60% of autopsied alcoholics ( 
monds). 
If the above conclusions are correct, alcoholic ind 
gence before and during conception and maternal ind

in order to lessen the pains of childbirth. Although a!

    manifest diminished power of growth. The difference be- 
tween the weights of babies of drinkers and abstainers has 
amounted to 3.6% and 4.4% for boys and girls, re- 
spectively, while at 7 and 8 months the corresponding fig- 
ures amounted to 2.2% and 7.2%. 
That there is a causal relation between alcoholism and 
sterility, abortion, prematurity, still-birth, inability to lac- 
tate, infant mortality, and degeneracy is indicated by nu- 
merous studies. Of 107 English women investigated who 
died of alcoholism before the age of 29, 8 bore no chil- 
dren, while 99 bore only 6 delicate and deformed children. 
But twenty-nine vigorous children were born to these 
mothers before they became alcoholic (Lonnet). A simi- 
lar inquiry based on thirteen inebriate women showed that 
the children born before the onset of the inebriety were 
normal, while those born after its onset were ‘ weak- 
minded” (R. J. Paris). Of the 600 infants born of 120 
female inebriates in whom the factors making for degen- 
leracy (such as tuberculosis, nervousness, syphilis) were 
liminated except alcoholism, 55.8% were still-born or 
ied before the age of two, mostly of convulsions, and the 
ortality was 21% times greater for these infants than for 
nfants of sober mothers (W. C. Sullivan). During the 
eriod from 1874 to 1904 the still-births from each 1000 
onceptions in France amounted to 5.36 for certain ab- 
inthe districts (southern part), 4.48 for certain alco- 
olic districts, but only 3.62 for certain non-alcoholic dis- 
icts (Henri Schmidt). 
Of 57 children of 10 alcoholic families, only 15% were 
tirely normal, while of 61 children of 10 non-alcoholic 
arents 82% were entirely normal. 85% of the alco- 
lized progeny were idiots, epileptics, choreics, dwarfs,. 
formed, or died in early infancy (Demme). A study

    of about 20,000 children from 5846 families indicated in 
general that the percentage of miscarriages and deaths 
varied with the amount of alcohol consumed (Laitenen). 
The percentage of miscarriages among total abstainers 
was 1.07, among moderate drinkers 5.26, and among 
drinkers 7.11. On the other hand, it has been shown 
that the number of deaths and miscarriages has decreased 
as national sobriety has increased (English study). 
The vitality or chances for survival are less for the 
children of later pregnancies of maternal inebriates. 
Thus the mortality among the first born of a certain 
group of alcoholic mothers was 33.7% as against 72% 
among the sixth to ‘tenth born; while the number of still- 
births among the first born was 6.2% as against 17.2% 
for the later pregnancies. The injury which alcohol ex- 
erts upon the generative processes apparently increases| 
with time. 
Both paternal and maternal alcoholism imperil the abil 
ity of mothers to nurse their offspring. Of the daugh 
ters of a given group of confirmed topers, only 21% wer 
able to nurse their babies. In a group of non-habitual 
drinkers, 50% of the mothers retained their nursing ca 
pacity, while only 2.6% of daughters of confirmed pater; 
nal drinkers were able to lactate (Bunge). Whateve: 
impairs natural nursing is of moment to eugenics — or a| 
least to racial well-being — owing to the vital relation 
breast feeding to the normal growth and development 
the infant. 
In a German investigation covering the first five yea 
of the children’s lives it was found that not a single dea 
had occurred among 109 breast-fed children from 
families, while during the corresponding period every oy 
of 33 families in which the babies were all bottle-fed h

   lost one or more infants. In another group of 29 families 
with 85 breast-fed infants and 109 bottle-fed, all the 
breast-fed were alive at the end of eleven years, while 57% 
of the bottle-fed were dead. A third group of 13 fami- 
lies contained 48 breast-fed infants, all alive at the end 
of ten years, and 23 bottle-fed babies, all dead at the end 
of the same period. In certain districts in Austria where 
mothers are accustomed to giving the babies the breast, 
from 16 to 17 out of every 100 born alive die during the 
first year, from 6 to 7 die during the first month, while 
the number of still-births is from 9 to 15 per 1000. In 
other districts (apparently industrial) where breast feed- 
ing is abandoned during the period from the first to the 
fifth month, the mortality is from 18 to 23 during the first 
year, 6 to 8 during the first month; while the still-births 
number from 20 to 41 in 1000. The mortality among 
breast-fed infants less than nine months old which came 
under the supervision of the Board of Health of New York 
‘ity in 1907 amounted to 25%, while the mortality among: 
he artificially fed was 74.9%. Of 3000 infant deaths in 
irmingham, the rate for the breast-fed was 8 per 1000, 
hile for the artificially fed it was 252. One authority 
stimates the mortality of the bottle-fed as three times 
hat of the breast-fed (C. L. Wilbur), another from eight 
‘o ten times (Collins H. Johnston), and a third fifteen 
limes. While there has been considerable improvement in 
e art of artificial feeding within recent years, and while 
e decrease in the mortality of nursing babies cannot be 
holly due to the influence of the mothers’ milk but to 
vorable factors which go with nursing but do not go 
ith bottle feeding, there is no doubt that the milk of the 
other is the natural food for the baby. The mother’s 
east is not only the best instrument at our command for

   combating fatal issue, but it is the source of the prime 
nutritive elements upon which to rear a strong and hardy 
stock. There is no specific superior to the mother’s milk 
as a prophylactic against acute infectious diseases, intes- 
tinal catarrh, scurvy, rickets, marasmus, soft teeth and 
bones, and retarded development. Breast-fed babies grow 
more rapidly than bottle-fed, the former doubling their 
weight at the end of the fifth month and trebling it at the 
end of the twelfth month, while the latter require a year to 
double, and treble only in the course of the second year. 
These truths need to be dinned into the ears of the 
motherhood of America, for there has been a growing 
tendency for years to substitute artificial feeding for nat- 
ural nursing, particularly in the centers of congestion. 
In the majority of cases the reluctance of mothers to 
nurse their babies is due purely to social and psychological 
causes; to a combination of indolence, selfishness, the de- 
sire to pursue pleasure at all hours, in and out of season, 
in drawing rooms, theaters, teas, and clubs, and the shirk- 
ing of any duty that interferes with the regular satisfac-| 
tion of such desires; and, finally, subservience to the Zeit 
geist: the apish adherence to the conventions, fads, an 
fashions of the day no matter how trivial, ridiculous, bar 
barous, or eugenically indefensible. Presupposing hy 
gienic preparatory care, it rarely happens that mother

To uproot, in a measure, some of these noxious psychi

indefensible, unless breast feeding is contraindicated, and 
that the only contraindications in the mother to nursing 
are certain cardiac disorders, eclampsia, nephritis, serious 
anemia, tuberculosis, pregnancy, prolonged infection, and 
possibly various acute infections, epilepsy, and insanity. 
Personally, I believe that a race of naturally nursed peo- 
ple will, all in all, be more eugenically fit than a race of 
artificially fed people. I am not sure that unwilling moth- 
ers can be legislated into hygienic practices by the impo- 
sition of fines upon those who can but will not nurse their 
babies, and I would advocate the enactment of such laws 
only as an extreme measure. But I do feel that the eu- 
genic appeal should be presented and that, if properly 
presented, it cannot fail to stir countless mothers to per- 
form more conscientiously their physical duties to their 
dependent offspring. 
The weight of evidence seems to indicate that parental 
alcoholism may produce at least a certain amount of men- 
tal and moral deficiency, disorder, or degeneracy in the 
offspring. The réle of the alcoholic factor, however, is 
very differently estimated by different investigators, and 
various surveys have given flatly contradictory results. 
40% of the pupils in the special classes for deficient 
children in London and Birmingham were found to have 
intemperate parents, while the corresponding per cent for 
upils of the same age in the regular classes was only 6%. 
n another inquiry 82% of school children doing satis- 
‘actory work were found to have alcoholic parents and 
% abstaining parents; while 85% of the pupils doing 
msatisfactory work had intemperate parents and only 
5% abstemious parents. Of 6624 pupils studied in 
901 in the New York schools who had alcoholic parents, 
3% were laggards (“ dullards, very deficient, and de-

ficient ”), while only 10% of 13,523 children of abstain- 
ing parents were laggards. The alcoholic habits were 
traced through three generations for 3711 children. In 
the families which were free from alcoholic taint, 96% 
of the children were proficient while 18% had some organic 
or nervous abnormality and only 4% were classed as lag- 
gards. On the other hand, in the alcoholically tainted 
families, 77% of the children were dullards, 76% had 
nervous or organic disorders, while only 23% were pro- 
ficient (Alexander MacNicholl). 
In an academy in Utah the students of narcotized par- 
entage required about one year longer to graduate from 
the grades and averaged one year and seven months older 
in the academy than their classmates (J. E. Hickman). 
The percentage of parental alcoholism found in the 
study of 1200 English institutional feeble-minded cases va- 
ried from 13.2% (Royal Albert Asylum) to 19.5% (Da- 
renth,— Shuttleworth and Beach) ; 7.7% of 250 defective 
children in Manchester gave a marked alcoholic history, 
while no other factor was discernible in 1.9% of the cases 
(Lapage). A very careful investigation into the family 
histories for three or four generations of 150 cases living 
in and around London showed paternal inebriety in 46.5% 
of the cases, although five-sixths of these showed a prior] 
neuropathic heredity (Tredgold). A comparative study} 
of the family histories of 250 mentally defective and 10 
normal children in Birmingham indicated alcoholic parent 
age for 41.6% of the former and 22% of the latter group 
Parental alcoholism was found in 62% of 1000 Frenc’

gian group (Karl Looft), and in 11% of German (Kind

sylvania institution, 14% gave a history of chronic alco- 
holism in one or both parents (J. M. Murdoch). In 
other American investigations, the per cent of parental 
alcoholism has been found to be 38 (Kerlin) and 50 
(Howe). 
It is reported that in some wine-growing cantons in 
France and in wine-growing districts of Austria the 
schools have been flooded with an army of laggards seven 
years after good wine years. In a study based on 8196 
feeble-minded children in Switzerland, the conception in 
the majority of cases took place during the periods of 
greatest debauch (New Year’s, the Carnival, and the 
grape harvest: Bezzola). 
In Chapter V we have already given the results of a 
number of studies which have been interpreted as indi- 
cating that parental alcoholism produces more epilepsy 
than parental epilepsy itself. 
That mental defectiveness and alcoholism are frequently 
associated admits of no doubt. But there is considerable 
diversity of opinion as to whether the antecedent condi- 
tion is alcoholism or mental defectiveness. The Galton 
workers strenuously maintain that the causative factor is 
defective, neuropathic heredity, and that inebriety is 
merely the effect. All careful observers of mentally de- 
generate stocks know that degenerates manifest an ex- 
cessive propensity for alcohol — a sort of hereditary alco- 
olic diathesis — as well as an extreme susceptibility to 
its demoralizing influence. But this tendency must itself 
e explained. May it not be that ultimately the alcoholic 
endency of degenerates is resolvable into the alcoholic 
abits of generations of ancestors? 
Not the least pernicious accompaniment of parental 
Icoholism is the drugging of children with alcohol by par-

ents who are addicted to its use. Of large numbers of 
children investigated in New York, 27% of those rated 
“ good and prosperous” as against 50% of those rated 
“ poor ” consumed some form of alcoholic beverage. Only 
30% of the good pupils had drinking parents as against 
85% of the “ poor” (MacNicholl). Small quantities of 
wine administered experimentally to 20 children between 
six and fifteen years of age produced mental impairment 
after its use (Maurice Kende). An examination of 591 
Viennese school children showed that the best scholarship 
certificates were held by those who entirely abstained from 
alcoholic indulgence, while the poorest certificates were 
held by those who took alcohol two or three times a day 
(Hercord). In Hungary, children are frequently found 
in school in a dazed condition due to the use of alcoholic 
beverages. In the London County Council Schools 40% 
of the children investigated under the age of eight im- 
bibed alcohol more or less regularly. In one school of 300 
pupils, 11.8% drank daily, while 34.1% drank occasion- 
ally. Recently, in examining children in a western Penn- 
sylvania city, we were struck by the fact that most of the 
children had unusually small heads and were deficient in 
stature. The head girth of many boys from thirteen to 
fifteen years of age was like that of a five- or six-year-old 
child. Out of twenty-one cases examined seven were 
feeble-minded. Many of these were children of Hungarian 
immigrants who, judging by the available reports, were 
addicted to excessive indulgence in alcohol. We have 
often discovered during the examinations in the St. Louis| 
schools that a considerable number of the pupils indulge 
in alcoholic beverages. Some children have admitted tha 
they have been given more or less beer, wine, or whisk 
since the early days of childhood. In order to secur

complete data on all the members of a special group, I 
asked the teachers in all the special schools to make in- 
quiries among the children as to their habits in respect to 
the use of alcoholic beverages. ‘The reports gave the fol- 
lowing results:

It is necessary to explain that these statistics include 
children who indulge only infrequently in alcoholics, per- 
haps once a day or two or three times a week, and fre- 
quently only in small quantities. Nevertheless, it is sur- 
prising to learn that over half of our special-school chil- 
dren, who already are seriously handicapped in native 
mental equipment, and who are exceedingly susceptible to 
the baser influences of alcohol, are using beer, 27.1% 
wine, 12.8% whisky, and 19.6% two or three of these 
rinks. The frequently observed diurnal fluctuation in 
he working capacity of these children and the stuporous 
ondition in which they sometimes come to school can, no 
loubt, sometimes be ascribed entirely to alcoholic narco- 
is. One teacher reported that one of her younger pupils 
as “dopy ” all the morning from the effects of a glass of 
eer taken at breakfast time. Much of the mental and 
hhysical torpor, scholastic retardation, and proneness to 
fectious diseases of school children is due to precocious 
ebriety. Precocious inebriety is, no doubt, also partly 
lesponsible for the social and industrial inefficiency of

many adults. Juvenile alcoholism is essentially anti- 
eugenic. 
Our own conclusions of the relation of alcohol to cu- 
genics may be summarized as follows: children conceived 
in drunkenness frequently come into the world with di- 
minished powers of. mental and physical development 
(sometimes resulting in pronounced infantilism), with 
lessened immunity to diseases of an infectious origin (e.g., 
tuberculosis, pneumonia, diphtheria), and with increased 
predisposition toward the development of nervous disor- 
ders, peevishness, infantile marasmus, infantile colic, cari- 
ous teeth, bodily deformities and disharmonies, convul- 
sions, inanition, and mental and moral abnormalities. 
Sometimes parental alcoholism slays the progeny out- 
right ; sometimes it dooms it to temporary or lifelong in- 
validism, inefficiency, dependency, and mental and moral 
bankruptcy. Children fed on alcohol before they are 
born cannot be regarded as fit progenitors of a race of 
men and women healthy in body and mind. At the same 
time, we believe that it is an exaggeration to maintain that 
even if we could eliminate the entire army of eugenically| 
unfit with one fell swoop, two or three generations of in 
ebriety, gonorrhea, and syphilis would restore the ori 
inal number of degenerates. To reach the eugenic Uto 
pia we must do more than restrict the evils of inebriet 
and venereal infection. We must make it impossible fo 
persons to breed who suffer from transmissible defects} 
whatever the cause of the defects may be. 
4. From the standpoint of the eugenic ideal it is desir 
able to prevent procreation during the periods of physi 
logical immaturity, and of involution, and to preven 
over-many or unwilling conceptions. Precocious ma:

     HYGIENE OF EUGENIC GENERATION 457 
progeny, to retard the development of the fetus, or to 
issue in sterility. Statistics indicate that the highest per- 
centage of child mortality occurs when the pregnancies 
take place at or before the age of 16, and the lowest when 
they take place between 29 and 32 (Quetélét). Based on 
a study of the families of English peers, the percentages 
of children dying before attaining a marriageable age were 
as follows: for parents 15 years old at time of marriage, 
85% ; for those between 16 and 19, 20%; for those be- 
tween 20 and 23, 19% ; and for those between 24 and 27, 
12% (Sandler). As regards weight, one investigation 
showed that when mothers at the birth of their first child 
were under 20 years and weighed less than 120 pounds the 
children were of inferior weight (Schafer). A second in- 
vestigation showed that the first-born males of poor 
mothers between 14 and 16 years of age average only 
about 67% pounds ($124 grams) as against '7%40 pounds 
(3310 grams) for the first-born males of mothers of the 
same class between 30 and 35 (Sigismund Peller); while 
la third investigation indicated that those children weighed 
the most who were born of mothers between 25 and 30 
(Matthews Duncan). Deficiency of weight at full- 
erm birth means retarded or arrested development in 
tero. 
Not only so, the fertility rate seems to be higher for 
hose who marry during the more favorable child-bearing 
ears. The average number of births for each family of 
nglish peers was as follows: for those marrying at 15, 
.40; for those marrying between 16 and 19, 4.63; be- 
ween 20 and 23, 5.21, and between 24 and 27, 5.43 
Sandler). Moreover, the claim has been advanced that 
ost famous men have been begotten between 25 and 36. 
thus appears from several points of view that the eu-
-P-A-G-E-474

       genic age for procreation is between 25 and 35. The 
marriage legislation of the ancient Spartans indicates re- 
markable prescience of eugenic laws. The Spartans by 
legislative enactment established 25 years as the age for 
the beginning of procreation. It is not certain that it 
will be to the advantage of the race to defer marriage to 
the middle twenties so far as concerns the mass of the 
population (marriage is frequently an effective prophylac- 
tic against eroticism and vice), but eugenically it seems 
advisable to restrict generation to the period which is 
“biologically most apt” for child bearing. At any rate, 
this is a question which it is well worth while for the 
eugenist to subject to unbiased and fearless scientific in- 
vestigation. 
Too frequent pregnancies are also anti-eugenic. Thus 
it is known that very short intervals between pregnancies 
upset the progressive increase in weight which is known to 
occur from the first to the last born (average weight of 
1729 first born, 3254 grams; of the second and subsequent 
births, 3412 grams — Ingerslevs), while long intervals do 
not disturb the increase (Wernicke). There are numer- 
ous women who are in an almost chronic state of semi- 
invalidism because of the strain and exhaustion incident to] 
frequent parturition. Many women who are nervous, 
exhausted, anemic, or run down cannot bear healthy, vig 
orous children, and it is eminently humane and in accor 
with scientific and eugenic principles to relieve them of th 
burden. We know that by giving expectant mothers 
ten-day rest period before confinement the weight of th 
newly born can be increased 10%. The cause most fre 
quently ascribed to Mongolian imbecility is uterine e 
haustion. In a considerable number of our clinic case} 
of backward children we have been able to find no othe

       HYGIENE OF EUGENIC GENERATION 459 
factor than the nervous exhaustion of the mother during 
gestation. 
Not only so, there are hundreds of thousands of families 
producing a progeny too multitudinous for their bank 
account. As a consequence the children grow up in 
squalor, inadequately fed and clothed, poorly safeguarded 
from moral contamination and physical injury, and indif- 
ferently disciplined and educated. Moreover, the parents 
involuntarily transmit their poverty as a social heritage 
to their offspring. Poverty tends to increase with the 
number of children, at least under modern urban condi- 
tions. Since the children are forced to go to work before 
they have been trained to the point of social and industrial 
efficiency, they are obliged to engage in unskilled labor 
which offers practically no opportunity for advancement 
with increasing maturity, and which, while it may yield 
returns sufficient for the needs of one person, will not pro- 
vide food and shelter for the large family which seems to 
be the birthright of the degenerate and the poor. The 
associations for the improvement of the poor know only 
too well that the inadequately trained children of the poor 
ho.are forced into early employment are rarely able to 
arn a family wage in a modern urban industrial environ- 
ent. 
Again, many of these poor children — as well as chil- 
ren born in better circumstances — are unwelcome ar- 
ivals. The parents frankly did not want them, and be- 
use they were not desired, the children are neglected or 
bused. To prevent their birth, attempts are frequently 
ade to abort them, sometimes successfully, sometimes 
msuccessfully, and sometimes to the permanent injury of 
e mother or the child. The public at large has no idea 
the great number of unwelcome embryos which are mur-

dered year in and year out, of the number of premature 
births or still-births which are directly due to instrumen- 
tal interference or the use of abortifacients, and of the 
number of infanticides which are committed by parents of 
unwelcome children, for the greater number of illegal 
abortions never become a matter of record. It is claimed 
that the abortion rate is increasing in all civilized coun- 
tries (Kaye). Since 1870 the number of abortions, still- 
births, deaths from prematurity, and the sale of abortifa- 
cients have greatly increased in England. Among 14,000 
confinements in 1904 and 1905 there were 49 miscarriages 
to every 1000 labors — how many of these were due to 
attempted interference with normal generation no one can 
say. The number of women brought to Berlin hospitals 
for treatment after abortion (exclusive of syphilitic 
cases) amounted to 317 in 1900, 841 in 1910, and to 
1694 in 1918. This increase of over 500% in 13 years 
was mainly among younger women (Bleichréder). 
A concrete case recently came to our notice, that of a 
married woman who had been deliberately and successfully 
aborting her unborn children for years. She failed, how- 
ever, in her last attempt and it is alleged that she now 
often neglects her unwelcome child, sometimes leaving it| 
to squall for hours at a time. One of the saddest trag- 
edies of life is to permit the birth of unwelcome children 
but there are no more heartless crimes recorded in th 
annals of man’s brutality to man than infanticide or th 
annihilation of the unborn innocents who have becom 
quick with life. No nation in antiquity or in moder 
times has ever been able to enact criminal statutes suffi 
ciently terrifying to suppress the practice of abortio 
just as no statutes ever have or ever can be enacted tha 
will effectually suppress the prompting of the sex ii

stinct, or the exercise of the marital functions between 
countless pairs of mates who ought not to beget children. 
These facts suggest the query whether it is not in the 
interest of social morality to instruct people in the use 
of harmless regulatives or to encourage the practice of 
sterilization, especially in the harmless forms of vasec- 
tomy and fallectomy. The objection to vasectomy is 
largely, if not entirely, sentimental: the mutilation of an 
alleged sacred function. Nature herself, however, does 
not regard the function as sacred: she sterilizes both the 
man and the woman who will not live within the moral 
law. The compulsory sterilization of all who ought not 
to beget children and the optional sterilization of those 
who do not want children may some day become the prac- 
tice of the land. The objection to enlightenment in the 
use of harmless regulatives is based on the fear that we 
should all lapse into libertinism and that the population 
would become decimated. But does the fear of venereal 
infection and of illegitimate issue now deter men and 
women from illicit indulgence? We do not believe that 
fear of consequences exercises any considerable restrain- 
ing terror on those who will not live within the moral law. 
eople who now live moral lives would probably do so 
nder any other system of privileges or penalties. Possi- 
ly the results would tend to a slight decrease in the 
opulation. But even relative depopulation is better 
han degeneration. Limitation of offspring is better than 
orruption, pauperization, or criminalization. Moreover, 
lhe depopulation would principally affect the lower social 
trata — and this would be a blessing rather than a curse 
because the practice of birth-control is now very wide- 
read in the higher social strata. Yet so barbarous are 
e laws of our country that should any one attempt to

           give specific advice to those who most need it, he would 
be given a term of from five to ten years in prison. It 
is otherwise in various European countries, where scien- 
tific books may be circulated through the mails and where 
hygienic advice on the limitation of offspring may be, and 
frequently is, given in public lectures. Thanks to the 
science of eugenics it is now possible even in America to 
discuss in a broad scientific spirit at least the foundations 
and implications of the sex relationship. Not only so, 
the ethics of the future will increasingly get its sanction 
from eugenics. When the ethics of eugenics has become 
ingrained into the psychic warp and woof of the leaders 
of thought and action, some of our barbarous laws and 
practices will be relegated to the limbo of the past. Eu- 
genics is not merely a biological conception of life: it is 
a system of dynamic ethics that must function in the 
workaday life of the people.

School Training of 
Defective Children 
By Henry H. Gopparp 
  
‘HE problem of caring for mentally defective 
children is now meeting with more general 
recognition since Dr. Goddard and other psychologists 
have estimated that at least two per cent of school 
children are below normal. That the presence of such 
children in classes for normal children seriously 
handicaps both teachers and pupils; that the means 
of discovering defective children are at present in- 
adequate; that the care and training of such children is 
not, in most cases, properly understood; and finally, 
that the danger, both to themselves. and to society in 
general, of allowing them to grow up at large is very 
great;— these are facts which the educational world is 
called upon to face and to deal with. For, whether the 
problem be rightfully a medical or an educational one, 
the public school system at present is charged with 
caring for defective ‘children. In School Training of 
Defective Children, Dr. Goddard considers the way in 
which the schools are carrying this responsibility and 
offers suggestions for future procedure.   Cloth. Illustrated. xxiit+98 pages.

GOVERNMENT ann POLITICS 
OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE 
By Frrrz-Konrap Kricer 
Doktor der Staatswissenschaften ( Tibingen), m.a. (Nebraska) 
  This book is the result of years of careful study, and in its 
preparation a mass of German first- and second-hand sources 
has been used, which has not been used heretofore by Ger- 
man or English writers. Furthermore, many chapters cover 
questions not systematically treated in any previous book 
written in English; e. g., population and territory in their 
relation to German politics, the nature of the Empire, party 
principles, the chancellors, etc. In short, this is the first 
systematic monograph in English dealing with the politics of 
Germany. There is a critical bibliography, covering thirty- 
three pages, at the end of the book; two colored charts and 
eight colored half-tones. 
Cloth, xii-+340 pages. Price $1.00. Mailing price, $1.20. 
The Government Handbooks are planned for the double pur- 
pose of supplying college classes in government with handy, 
authoritative texts and of furnishing the public with convenient 
volumes for reading and reference. The plan is to cover the 
important governments not only of Europe but of other parts of 
the world and certain colonial dependencies. Each volume 
will be written by a specialist in the history and institutions of 
the country concerned, and from first-hand knowledge of actual 
conditions. Send for the pamphlet announcing the series.

A Survey of a Nonsectarian Movement 
to Encourage Bible Study 
By CLARENCE ASHTON WOOD 
THE author of this timely volume has made a thorough- 
going study of the problem of religious education and 
has set forth in most interesting form in these pages the 
results of his investigations. 
Complete information is given concerning the growth and 
development of the movement to give academic credit for 
Bible study carried on outside of school, either in church 
and Sunday schools, vacation Bible Rchnols or Young 
Men’s and Young Women’s Christian Associations. 
The success of the plan in Colorado, Kansas, North 
Dakota, Alabama, and other parts of the United States 
where it is in operation is described and the movement 
is discussed in all its various aspects. 
Educational and religious workers everywhere will find 
this informing book an indispensable addition to their 
libraries, and all laymen interested in the religious educa- 
tion of young people will derive profit from a considera- 
tion of the facts here set forth. 
Included in the volume are a complete bibliography of 
the literature of the subject, syllabi used in a number 
of states as a basis for the work, and specimen sets of 
examination papers used in granting credit for Bible study.

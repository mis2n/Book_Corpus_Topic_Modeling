State Superintendents of Public Instruction. 
The office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction was 
created in 1835, and by an Act of the Legislature of 1843, which 
went into effect in 1844, the office was abolished. The folow- 
ing Superintendents were elected by the Legislature : 
Rosert H. McEwen, 1835-1840.

Scorr Terry, 1841-1844. 
From 1844 to 1867 the State Treasurer was ex-officio Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction. In 1867 the office was again 
created. The following Superintendents were elected by the 
people, and served for the respective periods shown below: 
Joun Eaton, Jr., 1867-1869. 
A. J. Trpron, 1869-1871. 
In 1870 the office was again abolished and the duties devolved 
upon the State Treasurer, who was made ez-officio Superintend- 
ent of Public Instruction. In 1878 the office was recreated, and

REPORT 
The report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction 
for the year ending June 30, 1901, is as full and comprehensive 
as it can be made under existing laws and conditions. Its 
preparation hag meant much earnest and persistent work. Re- 
ports from Superintendents—both city and county—upon which 
this report is based are obtained, in many instances, after re- 
peated and oft-repeated requests. A large number of these 
officials cheerfully and promptly comply with the law in making 
and submitting quarterly and annual reports, and it is not my 
purpose to censure those who have been diligent in the discharge 
of a public duty. The statistics appearing in the appendix will 
indicate which officials have done their duty and to what extent 
otliers have been either careless or slothful in their work. The 
State Superintendent should have authority beyond question that 
would enable him to obtain from each source every character of 
information necessary for the preparation of his annual report 
to the Governor, and through him to the Legislature and the 
people. This report covers every branch of our public schools 
in Tennessee of every character and gives definite and interest- 
ing information concerning the management and present condi- 
tion of all institutions in the State supported entirely or in part 
by the State. While our schools are deficient in many respectis, 
especially in the length of terms and salaries of teachers, I have 
not thought it necessary nor commendable to parade our short- 
comings, or apologize for what we have done. 
The public school system, as it exists in Tennessee today, was 
established since the war between the States, and its progress and 
development, while seemingly slow, has been retarded at every 
step by conditions in the State at the close of the war. That 
conflict destroyed property, devastated homes and plantations 
19
-P-A-G-E-23
and left the people financially unable to undertake the establish- 
ment of a great system of education. It was necessary, then, 
that the soldier-citizen turn his attention to business pursuits in 
order to regain lost fortunes and rehabilitate a great State. [t was 
a wise Legislature and the representatives of a great people that 
planned our present system and enacted into law, a third of a 
century ago, an act which was the real beginning of public free 
education in Tennessee. Not only did the citizens of the State 
at that time feel their inability from a financial standpoint to 
do more than was contemplated in the original act, but they 
realized that almost 100,000 children of their former slaves were 
charges of the State for whom some provision should be made. 
Not only, therefore, did the taxpayers, through their representa- 
tives, provide a free system of education for their own children, 
but they guaranteed like schools and equal opportunities to the 
unfortunate children of the colored race. That was a serious 
problem then, and the weight of this responsibility and the doubt 
in the public mind as to what should be done for the colored 
children has not lessened with the years. _ The public schools of 
Tennessee are equal to those of any Southern State and the 
results of our system, taking into consideration the conditions 
existing when it was first established, the large number of non- 
taxpaying colored citizens provided for and our taxable property, 
will compare favorably in money spent, work performed and 
general results shown with many States in the Union. Cit was 
our misfortune that the war destroyed our property and pauper- 
ized. our people, and at the same time left upon us the responsi- 
bility of not only educating the children. of the white race, but 
those of the colored as well. It should be borne in mind that 
those who were freed in the sixties were not property holders, 
and today contribute but an insignificant sum toward maintain- 
ing our school system and defraying the actual expenses of train- 
ing their own children. Those who have aspired to criticise 
Tennessee’s public schools have disregarded the many thousands 
of helpless, moneyless colored citizens and their offspring, who 
_are largely responsible for the unfavorable showing made in our 
statistical tables. Take from our schools the colored students 
20
-P-A-G-E-24
which we are educating and deduct from our statistics the more 
than 90,000 children of that race, and then give to the whites the 
money that is being yearly expended for the education of the 
colored, and it would readily be observed that much has been 
accomplished in this State and that much more gratifying results 
would be shown in the immediate future. Critics, especially 
those residing in this State, who find market for their criticisms 
elsewhere, have been either wilfully or ignorantly blind to condi- 
tions as they exist here. ‘The New England States, with which 
Tennessee is sometimes compared to our discredit, prospered by - 
the war which destroyed our property and impoverished our 
people, and since its conclusion have had none of the racial 
troubles to deal with and know nothing of the expense of taxing 
themselves for the purpose of educating the children of an- 
other race which contributes practically nothing to that cause. 
We should not be asked why we have done so little, but are en- 
titled to congratulations because of our progress under unfa- 
vorable conditions. Our public schools are supported almost 
entirely by direct taxation of the people, and every taxpayer 
contributes his pro rata of the expenses of our system: We 
have neither lands nor endowments, and our schools are a con- 
tinual charge upon the property holders of the State’) Na- 
tional legislation has not increased the value of our taxprodue- 
ing property nor encouraged the investment of capital and the 
building of large properties in this State from which we could 
_ expect to receive annually large sums of money, as elsewhere. 
The entire taxable property in the State, including that upon 
railroad, telephone and telegraph companies, amounts in round 
numbers to $400,000,000. The funds for the maintenance 
of our public schools in the cities, towns and districts are de- 
rived from the tax levied by the State and counties upon this 
valuation of property, together with the revenues derived an- 
nually from our permanent school fund. The permanent 
school fund amounts to $2,512,500, upon which the State pays 
6 per’cent. per annum, semi-annually. Tlie Legislature has 
the power to levy taxes for school purposes and the same power 
is conferred upon incorporated cities and towns, and upon the . 
21
-P-A-G-E-25
County Courts. Neither the civil nor school district has — 
specific authority to levy taxes for publie school purposes. The 
last Legislature passed an act authorizing the Tenth Civil Dis- 
trict of Wilson County to vote school taxes. This law has not 
been tested in the courts and it has not, therefore, been ascer- 
tained whether or not even the Legislature can confer such 
powers upon a district. The tabulated statements in this 
report show the total number of children in the State of public 
school age—i. e., between the ages of six and twenty-one years 
—to be 753,198. Of this number 559,349 are white, and 
188,173 are colored. | The total enrollment of white and col- 
ored is 488,655; of this number 385,006 are white, and 103,649 
are colored. This shows a decrease in the number of students 
~ in the State, but an increase of several thousand in enrollment. 
Tt is not necessary for this report to show why there is a de- 
crease in enumeration, but the fact that there is an increase 
in enrollment it very gratifying. The average school term is ~. 
a little less than five months; the average salary paid teachers 
per month is $28.60; the average cost per pupil for the entire 
public school term is seventy-four cents. This is very much 
cheaper than in many States, and a reduction in this State of 
thirty-three and one-third per cent. It will be observed that 
there is a slight. decrease in the amount paid teachers for sal- 
aries and a like decrease in the number of days taught. I 
have from time to time urged Superintendents, Directors and 
teachers to stop the schools when the funds were exhausted and 
suggested that, as a business proposition, neither teachers nor 
directors could afford to run the schools and incur expenses 
unless money would be in the treasury on pay day in sufficient - 
sums to meet the warrants. This accounts mainly, if not en- 
tirely, for the slight decreases above referred to. The total 
number of public schools in the State is 7,939; of this number 
6,257 are for which children and 1,682 are for the colored. 
We have 5,239 white primary schools; 924 white secondary ; nn, 
4,542 colored primary; 82 colored secondary; 94 city 8thools 
for the white; 58 city schools for the colored. The total 
pumber of teachers employed is 9,484, which is the largest 
22
-P-A-G-E-26
teaching force ever employed in the history of the State. This 
is an increase of 279 teachers since the publication of the last 
report of this office. The teachers employed are: White 
males, 3,981; white females, 3,562; colored males, 915; col- 
ored females, 1,026. The total number of school houses in the 
State is 7,241; of this number 5,709 are frame; 1,159 are log; 
968 brick. It will thus be observed that from year to year a 
large number of the old-time log school houses are giving place 
_to new and modern brick or frame buildings. We erected 
during the year 205 new school houses. The total value of all 
public school property in the State is $3,691,068.77. It must 
be remembered that these figures represent simply the value of 
such property as is entirely owned and controlled by officials 
of our public schocl system and do not include any of our 
valuable private school, college or university property. This 
shows an increase in the valuation of school property during 
this year of $627,501.03. The total number of school districts 
in the State is 3,164. An increase in the number of school 
districts gives cause for serious regret. No one thing of 
seemingly small importance does more to retard our public 
schools and to lessen their efficiency than the continual changes 
in district lines, the creation of new districts, and the sub- 
division of old ones. School districts and civil districts should 
be co-extensive. 
The total number of State Institutes, lasting one month each, 
were ten; seven for white teachers and three for colored. 
There were County Institutes held in the various counties in 
the State, and the total number of County Institutes, county 
teachers’ meetings and teachers’ associational gatherings were 
652, which is an increase. The subject of State and County 
Institutes is fully discussed in the appendix to this report. 
It will be observed by a study of the statistical tables and a 
comparison of the general summary with those of other years 
that more money has been expended for the purchase of- school 
grounds and the erection of school buildings than heretofore. 
There is no regularity about these expenditures, because a con- 
dition that would necessitate ‘the erection of a school building 
23
-P-A-G-E-27
in a certain district this year, would not call for a like expendi- 
ture the year following. On the other hand, when there is 
a large expenditure of public funds for the purchase of grounds 
and the erection of school buildings, it means necessarily a 
reduction in the expenditure of money for teachers’ salaries 
and a shortening of school terms. Corresponding the total 
receipts for all public school purposes were $2,615,033.51, an 
increase in receipts of $100,746.32; and the expenditures 
amount to $1,811,453.59. This is a decrease of $60,406.59 | 
in expenditures. This leaves a balance on hand at the close 
of the school year of $812,535.49. Especial attention is called 
to many increases, as shown in this report, in our city and town 
schools. | They increased in numbers, in enrollment, in daily 
attendance, in the number of teachers employed and the amount 
of money expended upon public school property. The cities of 
the State are erecting substantial, modern and commodious 
school buildings which will favorably compare with similar in- 
stitutions throughout the country. 
It will be noticed that all children between the ages of six 
and twenty-one years are enumerated as public school pupils. 
This makes a large scholastic population in the State. It 
will be further noted that a great number of those enumerated 
are never enrolled as public school pupils. The reason they 
are not so enrolled, in most instances, is, that after passing 
the age of seventeen or eighteen years, the student has either 
completed the school course or quit school entirely. There 
was no necessity originally, and even if there had been a ne- 
cessity then, there is none now, for extending the school age 
beyond eighteen or nineteen years. It is only the excepted 
case when you find, in free schools nowadays, a young man 
or young woman more than twenty years of age. The publie 
schools are primarily for the training of the youth of the ~ 
country. It was the purpose of their founders to give free 
training to every boy and girl in the district in the primary 
branches. Later, secondary schools were established as condi- 
tions demanded, but the large number of students of both races 
who are educated in the public’schools at all are those who 
24
-P-A-G-E-28
attend from year to year the primary schools. This is more 
especially true of those in the rural districts than in the cities 
and towns. If our school age was from six to eighteen instead 
of from six to twenty-one years no one would suffer because of 
the limitation; the statistics would no longer be misleading; 
we would have a larger enrollment of those actually enumerated 
and a better showing would be made in both enrollment and at- 
tendance. I refer. to this, not that it affects the individual 
who has attended the school, or will do so, but to call your 
attention to a condition which subjects our schools to unjust 
criticism on the part of unadvised crities and unfriendly critics, 
who are advised of the real facts. It is not my purpose to rec- 
ommend anything which would mean the exclusion of a single 
pupil in the State or the denial to the humblest citizen every - 
right and opportunity to obtain an education. I do emphasize, 
however, the fact that. statistics on this subject under present 
laws are misleading. These observations are made after a 
careful study of reports of city and county superintendents, 
which bear me out. fully in these suggestions and conclusions. 
To this statement may be added the further fact, that our large 
colored population makes an unsatisfactory showing of actual 
conditoins, as compared to other States that have no negroes. 
Omit from statistical tables those of both races who have ceased 
their attendance upon public schools or completed the public 
school course and it is readily observed that our percentage of 
enrollment is larger than that of many States, not only in the 
South, but in the Union. The people being compelled to sup- 
port public schools by direct taxation, have been unwilling, in 
the past, to submit to an increase in the tax rate sufficient in 
amount to guarantee good schools in all communities for_ten | 
_months in the year. It was certainly the purpose of those 
honorable representatives in the Legislature of 1878 to provide 
a system of schools which would ultimately give an opportunity 
to every’child in the State to obtain an education free and to 
have an opportunity of attending school ten months.in the year. 
I am not. prepared to say that public sentiment in some places 
would warrant this action by either the Legislature or the 
25
-P-A-G-E-29
County Courts at this time. I believe, however, that a ma- 
jority of the intelligent and patriotic citizens of the State are 
willing; in fact, would be glad, if those having the power to 
do so would levy taxes sufficient in amount to guarantee the 
ten-month term. Neither Legislature nor County Court would 
dare undertake it unless convinced that such action would meet 
with public approval. Jt has, therefore, been the purpose of 
those connected with school affairs to bring this subject promi- 
nently before educational bodies and assemblages of citizens of 
every locality in the State. As to the wisdom of this course 
at this time, there are misgivings with some, but that it will 
ultimately be done JT have not the slightest doubt. Tennessee 
will not take that stand among the States of the Union, our 
teachers and educational interest will not have that rank de- 
sired, teachers will not be given the salary to which they are 
entitled and the children of the State will be neglected and 
denied proper training in many localities until a ten-months 
school is established in every district in the State. There is 
no interest of greater importance to the people than that of 
public schools. There is no investment which the state can 
make that will do more for the citizen, for society and for the 
State than the perfecting of our publie school system. 
Education and civilization of the people go hand in hand, 
and the prosperity of the State, the happiness and contentment 
of its people, are largely dependent upon them. Our schools 
are free; equal opportunities are extended to children of every 
class and condition in life, and the one paramount question 
which addresses itself to our people and their representatives, 
is that of appropriating, annually, sufficient funds for longer 
terms, better salaries and higher standard of teachers. 
I have already indicated my belief that public schools were 
originally established for the education of the masses in the 
primary branches. Every child in the State can attend some 
school for a brief period, at least, and almost every one of them 
does. It is only a small percentage, however, of the children 
of the State who attend school beyond the fifth and sixth grades 
of study. As the primary subjects, therefore, are to be studied 
26
-P-A-G-E-30
by the almost 800,000 children of the State, it is of the utmost 
importance that our system of primary teaching be greatly im- 
proved. Every facility should be employed, every exertio: 
sade, that is possible, to secure better primary teachers and t. 
guarantee more favorable conditions for teaching the elemen- 
tary subjects to children. They should be taught how to read 
well. They should be taught to spell, and spell correctly; and 
there is no reason why every child in the State should not be 
taught to write a legible, business hand. The mistake in teach- 
ing in this State has been the desire of both teacher and patron 
to hurry the child away from the primary subjects, which they 
have not thoroughly mastered, to more advanced grades for 
which they are, in most cases, unprepared. ‘The system of 
promotion of pupils is not satisfactory and the practice of rush- 
ing them from the first grades to the higher ones is making 
ineffective the efforts to properly instruct in many instances. 
The boy who is not properly taught, at some time, the subjects 
embraced in grades one, two, three and four, will never under- 
stand the more advanced grades and will fail entirely to appre- 
ciate instruction in them. Every encouragement should be 
given the teacher who earnestly, energetically and hopefully 
labors from year to year in the laudable effort to properly teach 
the simpler subjects to the smaller children of the State. 
Neither Superintendents nor Directors have appreciated here- . 
tofore, as they should, the importance of selecting the very best 
teachers and maintaining a higher order of primary schools. 
It is too much the custom in the State to employ young and 
inexperienced persons, at small salaries and for short terms, to 
teach the primary classes and give the larger salaries and longer 
terms to older and more experienced teachers; who devote their 
time to teaching the higher grades. I would rather my child 
would read English well than to attempt to read any other lan- 
guage; I would rather she would spell well and write well than 
to take chances, without proper primary training, to master 
the diffienlt problems in Algebra, Geometry, and the higher 
mathematics. I have no complaint to make and no criticism to 
offer against the practical teaching of these or any other sub- 
27
-P-A-G-E-31
_ free and open to every boy and girl, it matters not what condi- 
tions of life may surround them. Public high schools are ad-) 
vocated because they will give additional training to a class of } 
students who would otherwise be unable to obtain it. The 
building of these schools in each county means the establish- 
ment of a home school for all those who complete the course of 
study as prescribed for the district public school. They not 
only give an opportunity to those who desire to attend a school 
of high grade, but will in fact stimulate many and encourage 
attendance because of their proximity to pupils who would 
otherwise abandon the hope of other study. It is argued that 
these schools should not be established because our primary and 
secondary public schools ard not perfect in many respects. 
Grant this to be true, I am of opinion that nothing will do more 
for every department of education and especially the district 
school than the maintenance of a high school with an advanced 
course of study. This school will train teachers for school 
work; it, will educate young men to take the places of the 
inefficient. teachers against whom complaint is made. The 
high school will aid materially in agitating educational interests 
and exciting the public to the need and importance of im- 
provement in every department of our public school system. 
The Act of the Legislature of 1899 authorizing County Courts, 
through a commission of seven menabers, to establish and main- 
tain one or more high schools in each county is a wise measure 
and has my unqualified approval. The Court is empowered 
to levy special taxes for the purpose of establishing these in- y 
stitutions. It is especially provided that no part of the general ¥ 
public school fund shall be used for this purpose. It will 
readily be observed, then, that tha high school will make no 
drafts against the fund for the districts, but that it must depend 
for its existence entirely upon the levy made by the County 
Court. It has been said that while this high school would be 
good for some counties; it-is-not-needed in_others, and that still 
others would n not support it. Gie county high school is a spe} 
cies of local self-government, antthere is no connection betwee 
thoestabtishment of a school of this character in one county an 
30
-P-A-G-E-32
an adjoining county. If, in the judgment of the County Court, 
the public interests justify such action the school may be pro- 
vided for, while in another county where conditions appear ditf- 
ferent the County Court can certainly exercise its own discre- 
tion. “There is nothing in the suggestion that a high school 
should’ be given to cach district for the reason that the district 
would not furnish sufficient students to justify it, and, further- 
more, in many counties one or two high schools would be ac- 
cessible to most of those students qualified to enter it. If no 
high school is provided, then what method shall we suggest for ! 
the education of the hundreds who annually complete our pres- / 
ent public school course? Such students are not thoroughly 
qualified for business and are certainly not prepared for en- 
trance into any reputable university, without a preparatory 
department. If the county high school is not established, then] 
the State has failed to provide any training, beyond the ordi- < 
nary public school, for a great majority of its citizens. It is 
trua that we have many private schools, colleges and universi- 
ties which are a eredit to the State. The sons and daughters 
of those who have prospered can be educated in these institu- 
tions, but the high school, which I urge and have advocated 
everywhere, is a school where the poor man’s son will have an ~~ 
equal opportunity with those of others in more favored condi- 
tions in life. A high school, without tuition fees, will be 
Liberally patronized where a private school with reasonable 
charges would be a financial failure. The establishment of 
county high schools has been too long neglected and it requires 
now this one additional step to complete our system as its 
founders certainly intended. With the high school in op- 
eration we will then have one continuous system, beginning 
with the primary school in the district, and extending through 
the secondary, the high school and then ending with the State 
University, the Normal College, or some similar institution of 
learning. 
A: careful examination of official reports, a personal ob- 
servation of school work in the State, and an intimate acquaint- 
ance with students of all our institutions and the character of 
31
-P-A-G-E-33
training given, convinces me that education in this State, in the 
public schools, high schools, colleges and universities is not 
“in every respect as it should be. ‘Too many graduates are not 
fitted for any character of business; too often it is the case 
that an institution of standing grants diplomas to its students 
and turns them out upon the world aimless and helpless. Our 
courses of study are not as practical as the age demands and the 
training in our schools often fails in its real purpose. I care 
not by what name you may designate it, but the teaching of in- 
dustrial pursuits in some form in our schools, in my opinion, is 
imperative. The Tennessee Industrial School, at Nashville, 
has a course of study similar to that in high grade private 
schools and preparatory institutions, and it also gives special 
training in many industrial pursuits. A student completing 
the course in that institution is fitted, always, for one calling, 
and in most cases for more than one. The hand, the eye, and 
the ear are trained in this institution. Its success and re- 
markable growth demonstrates beyond question the wisdom of 
such a course. Technical and industrial education is given in 
our State University; Tulane University, Louisiana; the Uni- 
yersities of Illinois, Wisconsin, Alabama, Texas, Colorado, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Iowa. This character of instruction 
is given in Purdue University, Indiana; Girard College, Penn- 
sylvania; Denver College, Colorado; Cooper Institute, New 
York; Cornell University, New York; Stephens Institute of 
_ Technology, New Jersey, and some phases of the subject receive 
practical attention in many other institutions throughout the 
country. Time and experience have demonstrated, beyond 
controversy, the practical utility of this department in the 
institutions named. We should educate young men for busi- 
ness pursuits as well as in the ordinary school curriculum. 
Industrial education, manual training or practical instruction, 
under whatever name it may be known, is the requirement of 
our times and will do much for the great student body of the 
State. Our people are slow to begin this work because it is a 
new departure with us, and I take this opportunity of bring- 
ing this important work to the attention of educators and citi-   
32
-P-A-G-E-34

1881--B2.
-P-A-G-E-35

-P-A-G-E-36
zens. If the Governor would make proper recommendation to 
the Legislature on these matters I believe the work would be 
commenced at once and necessary legislation could be secured. 
When the average student quits college he does not know how 
to do anything well, and wonders what he ought to do, The 
Legislature should provide a method to meet this condition and 
should have the children of the State taught what to do, and 
the best way to do it. 
The appendix to this report contains much valuable and in- 
teresting information concerning the management, progress and 
present condition of our State institutions. 
The Peabody Normal College, to which the State makes an’ 
annual appropriation, was never in a more flourishing condi- 
tion. The Tennessee Industrial School, the School for the 
Blind, and our State School for the Deaf and Dumb, are be- 
ing liberally cared for by the Legislature, and every dollar thus 
appropriated, in’ my opinion, is being wisely and judiciously 
expended. The State University at Knoxville is more largely 
attended than heretofore, and the report of that institution 
shows a very encouraging condition. I doubt if there is that 
interest and State pride manifested in this institution as it is 
entitled to receive as the one university of the State. This is 
a matter that addresses itself to the earnest and careful con- 
sideration of the Legislature and the Board of Trustees of the 
University. Especial attention is directed to the large num- 
ber of private institutions and the interesting statistics which 
this report contains. While this department was established as 
an agency of the public schools, I have not deemed it improper 
to collect and include herein, statistics concerning our private 
schools and universities. We have in Tennessee a large num- 
ber of colleges and universities, for the education. of young men 
and young women, which rank favorably with the best institu- 
tions of the country. They are the pride of our State and the 
public schools are the great harvest fields from which these 
institutions receive annually their greatest number of most 
earnest and hopeful students. 
Public schools have been established, under similar condi- 
33
-P-A-G-E-37
tions with the white, for colored children in every county in 
the State. They are taught by instructors of the colored race, 
and the attendance of their children is even better than the 
white. The methods of instruction employed are similar to 
‘those for the opposite race. I find, however, that only a small 
percentage of the colored children of the State have accom- 
plished much in school, beyond the subjects of reading, writing, 
arithmetic and a slight knowledge of history and geography. 
All that has been said and that can be suggested concerning 
industrial education for white children is doubly true of the 
negro. His greatest endowments are along the lines of indus- 
trial and manual subjects. He ought to be taught that work 
is honorable, and that he who expects to earn a livelihood, in 
that race, must work, and work with his hands. I believe that 
the hope of the colored race is in industrial education. It is 
a mistake for the people of ‘Tennessee to permit this important 
matter to be neglected, in the efforts of educators to give ad- 
vanced or higher education to the children of the colored race. 
It is far better for them that they be taught to work, that they 
be taught that work is honorable and desirable, and that they 
he given to understand that their greatest opportunities lie 
along these lines, than to delude them and indulge them in the 
hope that they will find the classics useful, or the professions 
advantageous. They will find their greatest contentment and 
prosperity in the field, on the farm, in the work shop, in the 
factory and the mine; and their training should be of this 
character. Another question, all important to them, and with 
which they, as a race, must deal, is that of social and moral 
conditions, Their schools should establish a high order of 
moral character. Their children should be taught to respect 
and observe, not only the laws of the land, but those of 
society and good morals as well. Leaders in their race rec- 
ognize these things to be true and they should be encouraged in 
their efforts to give proper instruction on these subjects. The 
State from year to year makes appropriations for scholarship 
_ students to the universities for the colored in Tennessee. Re- 
ports from these institutions show large attendance, increased   
    
84
-P-A-G-E-38
interest and great improvement in the methods of instruction. 
_ Separate schools, public and private, are provided for the two 
races. The last Legislature very wisely passed an act prohibit-} 
ing co-education and the teaching of children of one race by { 
instructors of another. This act recognizes a well-established ~ 
and unchangeable social condition. The white people of the 
State will not permit the teaching of white and colored children 
in the same schools, and those of the colored race do not desire _ 
it. We have two distinct races, and the law wisely provides 
that in our schools, as is the case in society, they shall remain, 
in all respects, distinct and separate. 
Less than three years ago, under act of the Legislature of 
“1899, text books were adopted on all subjects for use of the 
children in the public schools of the State. This necessitated 
many changes and much confusion and inconvenience at the 
outset. The books selected, however, were of recent edition, 
excellent’ subject matter and mechanical execution. ‘They were 
equal in all respects to those in general use at the time of this 
adoption. The text book law, therefore, gave the children of 
the State books equal to those in former use and secured uni- 
formity everywhere. I deem uniformity in the text of great 
value to the schools. It is not only valuable to the school but 
cheaper to the patrons. ‘The book purchased at the beginning 
of this adoption was good, then, for a period of five years in 
any school of the State. The boy moving from one community 
or county to another was not forced to purchase new books, as 
under the old system. Changes now in either directors, 
trustees or teachers do not cause a change of text books. These 
changes avoided are a saving of great annoyance and much 
expense. The reduction in the cost price of books is more than 
thirty per cent., and as we have a scholastic population of almost 
500,000, it will readily be observed that a saving of more than 
thirty per cent. on all the books purchased by these children 
during a period of five years will amount to a very large sum 
ef money. The law has been tested by the Supreme Court and 
declared valid and constitutional. The books adopted are giv- 
ing general satisfaction, and I believe that the people of the 
State are content with the law and its operations.

-P-A-G-E-39
The last Legislature gave a liberal appropriation to aid 
County and State Institutes. This appropriation has enabled 
this department to provide for State Institutes for teachers 
in the three Grand Divisions of the State and at such places as 
were deemed accessible to a large number of teachers. Teach- 
ers, being poorly paid, have felt themselves financially unable 
to attend many meetings of this character. There is increased 
interest, however, among them, and every reason to believe that 
the work of these Institutes will reach a larger number in the 
future and accomplish great good for the profession. County 
Superintendents have been given aid in their County Institutes 
in almost all the counties. There is no expenditure of public 
money as fruitful of good results as this brief work in the 
counties. The schools of Tennessee will be taught in the future 
by those teachers who are punctual in their attendance and 
actively participate in County and State Institutes, and other 
educational gatherings. The Public School Officers’ Associa- 
tion, which convenes annually in Nashville, is accomplishing 
much for the schools throughout the State. Recent. amend- 
ments to the school law, perfecting that instrument, originated 
almost without exception in this body. Jt is the great annual 
reunion of Superintendents, Directors and teachers. The at- 
tendance is increasing yearly, and the work broadening. The 
State Teachers’ Association, representing every department of 
public and private schools, convenes annually at Monteagle. 
The attendance is better than heretofore, but it is uot yet. one- 
half so full as it should be. Much indifference to its sessions 
and work certainly prevail with teachers, especially those en- 
gaged in private school work. The program this year embraced 
subjects of vital importance and the discussions were pror 
ductive of much good. A synopsis of the proceedings of all 
these bodies appear in the Appendix to this report. 
I have urged continually and with gratifying results, that the 
best and most capable men be selected as Directors, teachers 
and Superintendents. The power of District Directors in the 
control and general supervision of the district schools is almost 
without limitation. The Director employs the teacher, fixes his 
36
-P-A-G-E-40
salary and determines the beginning and ending of school terms. 
He builds school houses, controls school property, and expends, 
as he thinks best, the public school fund. Clothed with so 
much authority he is necessarily charged with corresponding 
responsibilities. | Enterprising, public- spirited, substantial 
citizens of intelligence and high character should be selected in 
the districts. The law providing for the examination of County 
Superintendents has proven to be a wise and satisfactory meas- 
ure. A better class of more capable superintendents has been 
elected in many counties. I believe that superintendents of 
today surpass in ability and efficiency those of other years. I 
have urged them to raise the standard of teachers; to license 
none except those of capacity and character. Strict examina- 
tions—examinations that are thorough, practical and impartial 
——are the surest guarantees of efficiency. The examinations 
should be of such character as to test the efficiency of teachers, 
and the rules should be of such strictness that incapables would 
not be licensed. The Superintendent for the county acts under 
instructions of the State Superintendent, and the instructions 
issued from this department this year, if obeyed, will permit 
the licensing of no teacher who is not worthy and qualified. 
The teachers of Tennessee, present and past, are entitled to 
whatever credit is due any class for our successes in school 
work. Poorly paid and for only brief terms, they have, with 
commendable earnestness and energy, accomplished much for 
the State. School teaching is a great profession and is worthy 
the best efforts of our best citizens. The Legislature should no 
longer neglect the teacher, but should, by appropriate legislation, 
provide funds sufficient to pay reasonable compensation to com- 
petent teachers. The Legislator who secures longer terms of 
school, better salaries for teachers, gives greater opportunity to 
the youth of the State and renders the State and society a pa- 
triotie and inestimable service.

Dear Sir: I beg leave to submit herewith in accordance with 
your requirement a report of the work of the State Peabody 
Institute held at Cookeville this summer. 
The selection of Cookeville as a suitable place for holding an 
institute of such length, was a happy one. The town is of such 
size that it can easily entertain as large a crowd of teachers as 
is usually in attendance. The water is excellent and the cli- 
mate is healthful. It is a delightful place for the weary and 
overworked teachers to assemble for study and the interchange 
of ideas. The institute commenced June 10, and extended 
through a period of four scholastic weeks. |The enrollment, 
which did not inelude every person who came into the insti- 
tute, was fair, but not so large as is should have been. While 
an improvement has been made in regard to the conflict in the 
time of holding the state and the county institutes, it is greatly 
to be desired for the good of the children, the teachers and 
the cause of education generally in the state that the number 
of conflicts may be reduced toa minimum. In fact, indications 
are not wanting which point to the dawn of a more hopeful day 
when the educational forces of Tennessee will move forward 
shoulder to shoulder in the common cause of education. If 
101
-P-A-G-E-113
all the superintendents of the various counties could realize how 
great have been the results for good to the teachers and children, 
of the efforts put forth by the state, and could they know how 
much more effective their own teachers would be by availing 
themselves of such privileges, they would doubtless feel the 
necessity of so arranging their institutes that the state institutes 
might supplement the good results produced by their own. It 
would give great momentum to the progress of the profession if 
the ten thousand teachers of Tennessee could have the oppor- 
tunity of spending a few weeks at least in being instructed in 
and in studying the principles, methods and problems of educa- 
tion. The demand for such education and training is impera- 
tive. The greatest educational want felt in Tennessee today, 
and she is far from being alone in this respect, is a lack of a 
sufficient number of well-educated teachers for her public 
schools. The state has done little, comparatively, to satisfy 
this long-felt want. Great credit is due you, sir, for the in- 
crease in the recent appropriation for institutes. Five thous- 
and dollars is indeed small for such a cause. Jt seems that 
we, as a state, have been acting on the principle that teachers 
- are born, not made, but while nature has been more generous to 
some persons than to others, the men and the women who are 
wielding the greatest influence in building the character of the 
youth of the land are those who have educated themselves for 
the profession. Where nature has not been so lavish in the 
bestowal of her gifts, the education in subjects and principles, 
and the training in method, must make adequate compensation. 
The exigencies of our time demand that the teacher should be 
a person of the broadest culture and one who feels the deepest 
interest in the welfare of the people. The state should encour- 
age such agencies as have a tendency to produce such culture and 
such interest. Next to a regular professional school the teach- 
ers’ institute is the greatest agency in stimulating the teacher 
to higher aims and deeper interest in his or her profession. 
While the enrollment was not large, the attendance showed 
marked interest in the work of the institute. A review of the 
work would indicate a month’s earnest labor on the part of the 
102
-P-A-G-E-114
teachers. They were attentive, interested and responsive. I 
desire to commend my colleagues, President W. N. Billingsley, 
Prof. A. G. Hall, Prof. J. J. Keyes and Mrs. Arthur S, Ran- 
som, for the able, earnest and faithful work they did in the 
institute. They are teachers whose learning was gathered from 
the stem of experience and who have the happy faculty of im- 
parting it to others with an enthusiasm that is contagious 
among teachers. Both the primary and the secondary courses 
were given.

Resolved, 1. That the thanks of this Institute be tendered to 
Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, the able and efficient State Superin-

105
-P-A-G-E-117
the influence of his strong personality and wise supervision 
since his first term of office began; that as teachers and Ten- 
nesseans we congratulate-ourselves on the fact that our state

tendent of Public Instruction, and we heartily endorse and 
commend his splendid administration; that we tender him our 
heartfelt thanks for his kindness in returning the State Pea-

for the thoroughness of his work, for his eloquent and instruct- 
ive lectures, for his ever-gentle humor and kindly bearing to-

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
COLUMBIA, TENNESSEE. 
June 17—July 12. 
Dear Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith my report, 
together with the report of our Secretary, of the State Peabody 
Institute held at Columbia for four weeks beginning June 17 
and closing July 12. 
The local committee had prepared a very excellent program 
for our opening on Monday morning, which consisted of wel- 
come addresses, songs and recitations, all of which were much 
enjoyed by the teachers and visitors. 
Miss Anna Voorhies was chosen as secretary of the Institute 
and the faculty was organized as follows: 
L. S. London, Conductor: Geography, Writing, School Man- 
agement, Geometry. 
Fred J. Page, Secretary of Faculty: Reading, Spelling, Pri- 
mary, Language, Grammar, Rhetoric. 
W. C. Lawson: Arithmetic, United States History, Algebra, 
Physics, Bookkeeping. 
A. J. Brandon: Physiology, Tennessee Tistory, Civil Gov- 
ernment, Geology, Agriculture. 
engagement in Wilson County, arrangements being made to 
have the work done during his absence. He expected to return 
to us at the beginning of the third week, but was prevented from 
being with us any more in the Institute on account of sickness. 
During his first week’s absence his work was done by Mr. Jas. A. 
Bostick, Mrs. C. W. Mitchell and Capt. R. D. Smith. Their 
lessons and lectures were practical and valuable, and were well 
received by the teachers. 
After the second week the regular instructors occupied most 
109
-P-A-G-E-121
all of the periods, but continued to receive much assistance from 
parties mentioned above, as well as other local lecturers. Dr. 
Hazel Padgett gave two or three most excellent lectures on 
Physiology, and Dr. Shodden, one on School Hygiene. These 
were very instructive and much appreciated. 
_ We enjoyed a visit from the State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction, Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, during our Institute, 
who gave us one of his inspiring and helpful talks. We also 
had visits from a number of leading school men in the state, 
some of whom made short but interesting addresses to the 
teachers. Among them were Col. John Allison of Nashville, 
Prof. W. T. Moore of Tiptonville, Profs. J. W. Sewell and A. 
C. Webb of Nashville and Prof. W. G. Dillon of Tracy City. 
The citizens of Columbia did all they could to make the 
institute a success. They made a guarantee of $500 in order 
to bring to the city a number of good lectures, from leaders 
on the platform, while we were in session. Much of this 
money they paid themselves. The local committee worked 
long and hard for our institute, and much of its success is 
due to the interest they manifested in our work. 
I cannot close this report without saying a word concerning 
the instructors selected by you, Messrs. Page, Brandon and 
Lawson. They are all practical school men, and well fitted for 
the work assigned them. Supt. Page is not only a fine 
institute instructor, but a good secretary as well. Messrs. 
Lawson and Brandon are both men: of experience and ability 
and did excellent work in their departments, but Mr. Brandon’s 
good influence was cut short only by his having to leave us 
after one week. 
The names and addresses of those receiving certificates, and 
other data, will be found in the report of our Secretary, which 
is appended. Very respectfully, 
L. 8S. LONDON, Conductor.

Report of Committee on Resolutions, 
We, your Committee on Resolutions, beg leave to submit the 
following report: 
Whereas, The session of the State Institute, held at. Colum- 
bia, Tenn., is now closing, and it having been thle occasion of 
much pleasure as well as the source of great profit to us; and 
the citizens of Columbia having spared neither time nor ex- 
pense to make the session an event to be remembered ; therefore, 
Resolved, 1. That this Institute is under obligations to the 
Maury County Teachers’ Association, through whose efforts 
we were enabled to have the Institute, and to the State Super- 
intendent for locating .it here. 
Resolved, 2. That we appreciate and thank the instructors

practical instruction, which will show itself in the improved 
work of the teachers of Maury and adjoining counties during 
the ensuing year. 
Resolved, 3. That our thanks are especially extended to the 
citizens of Columbia for the splendid course of lectures we have 
113
-P-A-G-E-127
attended, for the use of the beautiful buildings and grounds, 
and for many other courtesies. 
Resolved, 4. That we have enjoyed the music and readings by 
which our work has been enlivened. 
Resolved, 5. That we with pleasure make personal mention of 
the entertaining and instructive lectures of Capt. Smith and 
Drs. Padgett and Sheldon.

MISS MARY REAMS. 
MISS JANIE PORTER. 
_ Conclusion. 
We had an enrollment of 212 teachers. A number of those 
who desired to take the examination were debarred on account 
of not having attended the required fifteen days. However, 
sixty-six passed the required examination, receiving State Cer- 
tificates, and their grades averaged very well, indeed. 
The promptness with which the teachers attended the daily 
sessions, and their attentiveness and helpfulness at all times 
were marked, and the Institute was quite a success. 
Respectfully submitted, 
FRED J. PAGE, Faculty Secretary.

Bayer, Secretary; F. M. Bowling, 8. E. Hunt. 
In addition to the statistical report, I desire to say: 
No city in Tennessee could have done more to welcome the 
teachers than Clarksville; none could have done more to make 
their stay pleasanter or more profitable. On the other hand, 
Clarksville had the honor of entertaining one of the most earnest, 
one of the best bodies of teachers ever enrolled in an Institute. 
Too much could not be said of their faithfulness. From the day 
of their arrival to the time of their departure they were regular 
attendants upon all recitations. There were no idlers. All came . 
for a common purpose, all worked harmoniously together, and in 
that way befitting the dignity of teachers. 
The instructors, too, were faithful in the discharge of their 
duties, letting no opportunity escape to do excellent service for 
the cause of publie schools. In order to save time and enable 
each instructor to do the best possible work, the faculty met in 
called session two weeks before the Institute opened, divided the 
work, and made all plans. Mr. Bayer was elected Secretary and 
rendered most efficient service. 
The Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle and the Clarksville Times, 
115
-P-A-G-E-129
the two daily and semi-weekly newspapers, took up the mat- 
ter early and did much in the interest of the Institute. Later 
they published daily reports of the proceedings and did all any 
newspaper could do to aid us. 
Supt. J. W. Graham, Messrs. George Summey, C. D. Runyon, 
B. L. Rice, M. C. Northington, William Kleeman and J. 8. Neb- 
lett, of the city schools, kindly furnished a building free and such 
_ apparatus as was needed by the instructors. 
Mr. Holt, of the Studio Grand, at a cost of more than sixty 
dollars to himself, made a cabinet photo. of each teacher and 
from these a large group of the Institute, which was presented in 
a beautiful frame to the Institute. 
The Institute enjoyed most excellent addresses and lectures 
from the following gentlemen: Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatritk, 
State Superintendent; Rev. J. H. Lacy, of the Presbyterian 
Church, ‘Clarksville; Rev. T. C. Ragsdale, of the Methodist 
Church, Clarksville; Rev. L. N. Montgomery, of the Cumber- 
land Presbyterian Church, Clarksville; Rev. R. L. Cave, of the 
Christian Church, Olarksville; Prof. George Martin, of Vander- 
bilt University; Prof. J. D. Hoskins, of the University of Ten- 
nessee; Col. John Allison, of Nashville; Miss Annie Nichols, of 
Erin, and Supt. Graham, of the Clarksville city schools; Dr. 
George Summey and Dr. J. A. Lyon, of the Southwestern Pres- 
byterian University, of Clarksville. 
The Institute is also indebted to Supt. J. I. Allman, of Stewart 
County; Supt. D. J. MeAuley, of Houston County; Prof. 
W. L. Lawrence, of Dotsonville; and Profs. W. I. Harper and 
W.N. McKee, of the Southside Preparatory School, for efficient 
services. 
Among many other resolutions passed at the close of the In- 
stitute is the following: 
“That we congratulate the State Superintendent, Hon. M. C. 
Fitzpatrick, upon his good judgment in locating the State Insti- 
tute at Clarksville, and request him to continue the Institute here 
next year and as long as the city extends the teachers so many 
courtesies.” : 
The teachers were very much pleased with your visit and your 
116
-P-A-G-E-130
lecture, which was inspiring to everyone. And not only this is 
appreciated by us all, but everything you did to aid us in our 
work. 
Rigid regulations governed all examinations; and all ques- 
tions, while free from “catches,” were of a general and searching 
nature. No one was given a certificate except, in the judgment 
of the faculty, such person merited it and would do credit to him- 
self and the Institute wherever he taught. 
‘The Clarksville Institute has won the reputation of exercising 
such care in licensing teachers that the county superintendents of 
some adjoining counties grant county certificates to their teachers 
who make a general average of 75 per cent. or more in the State 
Institute. All further information can be found on the follow- 
ing pages Most respectfully,

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
JACKSON, TENNESSEE. 
June 10, Four Weeks. 
Sir—I herewith submit my report of the State Peabody Insti- 
tute held, under your direction, at Jackson, June 10 to July 5, 
1901. 
As has been the custom in the Jackson Institute, we organized 
a school for training teachers, made a daily programme and fol- 
lowed it. Sixteen days were devoted to instruction and four days 
to examinations. None were enrolled except those who took 
regular work of the Institute. 
Governor McMillin, Dr. Oscar Haywood, Rev. M. A.. Mat- 
thews, Rev. Dr. Hamner, Rev. Steward and Mrs. C. B. Bell 
each made an interesting and profitable address to the Institute. 
Better academic preparation before attending the State Insti- 
tutes should be urged upon the teachers. I believe it would be 
profitable to have an order from the State Superintendent re- 
stricting Institute examinations, in the primary course, to those 
who certify that they wish a certificate for the purpose of secur- 
ing a school within the year following the Institute. At present 
many instructors are overworked with examination papers of 
those who do not wish to teach, and certificates of those who do 
wish to teach are thereby much delayed. 
My associates as instructors have been faithful to duty, cour- 
teous in bearing, and filled with the zeal of genuine teachers. 
Our relations in all respects have been exceedingly pleasant, and 
their labors cannot fail of good results. 
Appended is the Secretary’s report of enrollment, attendance, 
etc., and I congratulate you on the thorough success of the Jack- 
son Institute. Very respectfully, G. R. M’GEE, Conductor.

A large number in our Secondary Course divide the work, 
taking part of the course the first year and t the remaining studies 
the succeeding year. 
The Secretary of this Institute made a permanent record of 
every teacher who has attended the Institute during the past nine 
years, and this record is now in my hands. I furnish only the 
names of those who were placed on the honor roll. Respectfully, 
JAMES L. BROOKS, Secretary.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
MARTIN, TENNESSEE. 
June 10 to July 5, 1901. 
Sir—I have the honor to submit the enclosed report of the 
State Peabody Institute held at Martin from June 10 to July 5, 
1901. 
It has been in many respects one of the most satisfactory In- 
stitutes I have attended. The large attendance of teachers and 
the interest they manifested in every exercise encouraged the in- 
structors and made their work pleasant. 
The work of my associates, Messrs. R. L. Bynum, Homer L. 
Higgs and William B. Hale, was of the highest order. As In- 
stitute instructors they proved themselves competent and faithful 
and presented their various subjects in a manner that was both 
entertaining and instructive. I could not too highly commend 
them and their efficient services. 
The Institute held two sessions daily, and the exercises were 
interspersed with music and elocution. 
In addition to the regular work, we had evening addresses and 
entertainments. Among others, addresses by Hon. Finis Garrett 
of Dresden and Col. John Allison of Nashville were especially: 
enjoyed. 
Your visit and address mark an important feature of the Insti- 
tute, and your personal interest was surely highly appreciated by 
all in attendance.

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE. 
CLEVELAND, TENNESSEE. 
June 24 to July 19, 1901. 
Sir—I have the honor of submitting my report of the second 
session of the State Peabody Institute held in Cleveland, Tenn. 
Opening—The Institute convened on the day appointed by 
you—Monday, June 24. A hearty and appropriate welcome was 
given the teachers on behalf of the citizens of Cleveland by Dr. 
Dakin, rector of the Episcopal Church, which was responded to 
by Supt. M. R. M. Burke, Supt. A. T. Barrett, and Dr. W. M. 
Graybill, of the Institute faculty. 
Place of Meeting—Through the kindness of Dr. J. A. Stubble- 
field, the committee on arrangements placed at the disposal of the 
Institute the beautiful chapel of Centenary Female College and 
as many of the recitation rooms as might be needed. A better 
place for a meeting of teachers cannot be found anywhere. 
Every convenience was at hand, and every courtesy was shown 
to visiting teachers by Dr. and Mrs. Stubblefield and by the very 
efficient and active conumittee. 
Organization—County Supt. W. R. Lawson was elected In- 
stitute Secretary, and Miss Leah Fletcher was chosen Assistant 
Secretary. Mr. Lawson was unable, because of illness and 
official work, to attend to the duties of the position, and Miss 
Fletcher, in a very satisfactory and efficient manner, kept all the 
records which are found in the statistical portion of this report. 
A committee to furnish the proceedings of the Institute to the 
newspapers was elected, of which committee Supt. McCallie, of 
the Cleveland schools, was made chairman. Thanks to Supt. Me- 
Callie, the work assigned was well done. Supt. Burke was made 
Secretary of the Faculty, and his services were efficient. 
The following programme was adopted by the Faculty and 
132
-P-A-G-E-148
approved by the Institute. It was strictly observed throughout 
the session, and gave entire satisfaction both to the faculty and 
teachers. It was the unanimous conviction of all that thorough 
and helpful work could better be done by having two sessions 
daily than by crowding all the classes assigned into one continu- 
ous period from one to two hours shorter than the two sessions 
afforded. 
8:00 to 8:15—Opening Exercises. 
8:15 to 8:20—Roll Call by Secretary of the Institute. 
8:20 to 9:00—Barrett, Arithmetic; Burke, Civics.

10:30 to 11:10—Barrett, Algebra: Graybill, U. 8. History. 
11:10 to 11:40—Gilbreath, School Law. 
11:40 to 1:30—Noon Recess. 
1:30 to 2:00--Burke, Reading. 
2:00 to 2:30—-Barrett, Geometry ; Graybill, Tennessee History. 
2:30 to 2:45—Afternoon Recess, 
2:45 to 3:15—Barrett, Geography; Burke, Rhetoric. 
8:15 to 3:45—Graybill, Bookkeeping and Agriculture; Gilbreath, 
Theory and Practice. 
3:45 to 4:00—Question Box. Announcements. 
Enrollment and Attendance—The total enrollment of teachers 
in regular attendance and visiting teachers and friends of public 
education was 413. Of this number, 175 were members of the 
Institute—bona fide teachers. The average daily attendance of 
teachers was 119; of all, about 250. The total number of days 
present was 2380, or an average of nearly 14 days for each 
teacher enrolled. In the list of those receiving certificates, eight 
counties and two states are represented, and a number of other 
counties were represented, not shown on the certificate list. 
Nearly every county from Bristol to Chattanooga on the line of 
the Southern Railway was represented by one or more teachers. 
The attendance from Cleveland and Bradley County was not as 
large as in 1900, but this loss was more than met by gains else- 
where. In addition to the very efficient work of Supt. Burke, of 
McMinn County, one of the regular instructors, the teachers 
were encouraged and helped by the presence and counsel of 
Supts. Layne of James County, Gallaher of Meigs County, Clem- 
133
-P-A-G-E-149
mer of Polk County, Lawson of Bradley County, and ‘Todd af 
Rutherford County. : 
’-Results—Forty-two certificates were granted i in the Primary 
Course.and: twelve in the Secondary Course. Of.a total of 79, . 
applicants, 25 failed—-nearly 32 per cent. All the examination 
questions- were ‘approved. by the faculty, and were reasonable 
rather than rigid. The grading was strict. Many of the failures 
were due to the poor showing made by thé applicants in reading, 
writing, spelling, and cornposition. The Institute was a working 
body; in this respect, as in others, superior to the Institute of the © 
year before. The attendance was fairly regular, and great in- 
terest was shown in all the work’ done. : 
I cannot speak too highly of the work. of my associates, of the 
high place they won for themselves in the hearts and minds of 
the teachers and of all with whom they came in contact. Strong 
resolutions asking for their reappointment next year were unani- 
mously adopted by the. Institute, and that the Institute 
be again located in Cleveland. While the work done by each of 
my associates was of a very high order, I cannot refrain from re- 
ferring to Supt. Barrett as one of the great teachers of the State 
and one of the ablest educators in the South. 
In conclusion, permit me to observe that one of the great needs 
in Institute work heretofore not fully recognized is the better 
organization of the primary department. The great majority of 
the public school teachers are engaged in primary work, and the 
public schools are primary schools. I do not believe that any 
institute faculty should be deemed complete or sent out that 
does not have in it one or two primary teachers of practical ex- 
perience. Your recognition of this need and your earnest efforts 
to meet it commend you to the progressive teachers of the State. 
My experience in institute work leads me to favor specific in: 
stitute legislation which will more clearly define the duties of 
county superintendents toward such summer schools. While the 
people of the county in which the institute is located may by 
their support contribute largely to its success, and while county 
courts and city councils may vote appropriations, still the chief 
local factor in the success of the meeting is the county super- 
134
-P-A-G-E-150
intendent of schools. If he fail to give the fullest and. heartiest 
support, the institute responds to his lack of co-operation. He 
can lessen local attendance or secure it. By the indiscriminate 
granting of certificates to those who fail in the State examination 
he reflects on the work of the State instructors and offers a county 
reward for State failure. The institutes in many instances have 
been crippled by the narrow views ‘and selfish interests of local 
officials, and legislation is needed that will free them from such 
disturbing influences. 
I cannot close this report without assuring you of the esteem 
in which you are held by the faculty and teachers of the Cleve- 
land Institute. Your visit to us was highly appreciated, and all 
united in testifying to the wisdom and worth of your most help- 
ful and practical address to the Institute. Very truly yours,

STATE PEABODY INSTITUTE, 
JONESBORO, TENNESSEE. 
July 1, Four Weeks. 
Sir—The following is most respectfully submitted as my re- 
port of the State Peabody Institute held at Jonesboro, begining 
July 1 and elosing July 26. 
This «vas the first State institute held at this place, and cer- 
tainly was a splendid success. Both the Primary and Secondary 
courses were represented, aggregating 260. Three actual teachers 
were enrolled. We kept no register of our visitors, but during the 
last two weeks of the Institute our large hall was for the greater 
part of the time comfortably filled. In the very begging a cor- 
dial reception was given us through a chosen representative of 
the citizens—Judge Hacker—as also by Revs. Mitchell, Aiken 
and Sharp, all of whom extended a hearty welcome and thorough 
co-operation; and this, with a splendid orchestra and a fine quar- 
tette, made our opening one of joy and pleasure. 
There were two sessions each day, opening at 8:30 and 2 
o’clock and closing at 12 and 4. While our exercises were varied 
as much as possible, yet we adhered closely to methods adopting 
the best plans of procedure in the class room. The curriculum 
was carefully observed and time allotted as the importance of 
each subject suggested. 
My assistants—Supts. Matney of Greeneville, Mason of Mor- 
ristown, and Brown of Jonesboro, all gentlemen of culture and 
refinement and of especial adaptation to institute work—respond- 
ed promptly to every demand, were well up in their respective 
subjects, and did their whole duty from the very beginning until 
the close. 
A day was set apart for the Directors, and right well did they 
137
-P-A-G-E-153
respond, more than half of them being present. I have never 
known directors to manifest more interest in school questions, 
taking as they did an active part in all discussions and giving us 
a thorough insight into the condition of their schools. This was 
certainly atenjoyable,and profitable, day-to us.all.” 
The visit of the State Superintendent was another feature of 
the Institute that gave pleasure and interest to the work. We 
were all glad to see him, and: feel that his clear and practical dis- 
cussion of some of the. most prominent features of the schools 
and their environments did much good. 
With great pleasure we mention the editorial committee who 
did such good and faithful work and who certainly deserve much 
credit for their efficiency and promptness in the discharge of 
duty. 
The ministers of the city, especially Revs. Mitchell, Aiken and 
Sharp, were very kind, being present often with us in our devo- 
tional exercises. 
On the part of the Institute, T would especially return thanks 
to the Jonesboro Orchestra, the Mandolin and Guitar Club and 
the quartette, for the great pleasure and joy they afforded the 
Institute during its session. We were certainly blessed with the 
very best of music, which plays no small part in the success of an 
institute. 
During our session we enjoyed the visits of Profs. Arnel) of 
Columbia, Bolton of Grant University, Henderson of Jefferson 
City, Jones and Patton of Harriman, and Lemon of Bristol; 
also Cols. Allison of Nashville and McCarron of Athens, Presi- 
dent Cooke of Washington College, Supts, White, Allen and 
Senaker, and Judges Kirkpatrick and Hacker. 
Now, in conelusion, permit me to say that I feel assured that 
our educational interest is moving steadily to the front; that the 
State Peabody Institutes are proving to be important factors in 
the great work, and that the State aid that you have so judiciously 
given to such a great number of the counties during the past two 
years will redound with telling effect upon the cause. Certainly 
we have great reason for rejoicing, and with the continued wise 
138
-P-A-G-E-154
generosity of our legislators, I feel that an intellectual dawn will 
be ours; that the “hedges and byways” will be visited, the clouds 
of ignorance will be dispersed, and from every quarter of our 
grand old State will come the glad tidings, “AII’s well.” 
Respectfully, C. 8. DOUGLASS, Conduetor.

Resolutions. 
We, your committee on resolutions, beg leave to report as 
follows: 
Resolved, first, that we tender our thanks to the State Super- 
intendent, Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, for his kindness in desig-

excellent faeulty, and for the deep interest he has manifested in 
the work by visiting, and for his instruction and practical address. 
Second—That we thank our Conductor, Capt. C. 8. Douglass, 
for his very able management of the Institute; for his patriotic 
and enthusiastic lectures on Tennessee History; for his practical 
talks on School Management; for his wit, humor, and kindness 
and especial courtesy toward the teachers at all times. We would 
suggest that every teacher endeavor to organize and conduct 
schools along the lines suggested by him.

ney, Mason and Brown—for their especial preparation on each 
branch taught, and for the deep interest manifested by them. 
Fourth—That Supt. 8. W. Murray is entitled to our thanks for 
his energy and kindness in the discharge of his many duties. 
Fifth—That we extend our sympathy to our secretary, Miss 
Daisy Boring, on account of her enforced absence, caused by the 
serious illness of her sister; and that we are also indebted to Mr. 
Glenmore Garrett, assistant secretary, for his efficiency and un- 
tiring energy in the performance of his duties during the entire 
absence of Miss Boring. 
Sixth—-That we extend our thanks to the Southern Railway 
Company for reduced rates; to the ministers of Jonesboro for 
the interest manifested by their visits and helpful talks; to the 
citizens for their hospitality; to the quartette, orchestra, and 
Mandolin and Guitar Club for their most excellent music; and 
we especially thank Misses Yoakley and Butler, as also Prof. 
Pope, for their work in conducting the music of the Institute. 
Seventh—That we are not unmindful of the splendid speeches 
made by Hon. John Allison and Prof. Arnell on Tennessee His- 
tory, and here tender the thanks of the Institute. 
Eighth—That this Institute feels grateful to the Herald and

REPORTS FROM COUNTY 
SUPERINTENDENTS. 
ANDERSON COUNTY. 
The Anderson County Teachers’ Institute met in Clinton 
July 8, and was in session two weeks. 
Capt. W. R. Garrett, of Nashville, and Prof. W. L. Stooks- 
bury, of Forkvale, Tenn., were our instructors. These men were 
equal to the oecasion, and showed to all that their estimation of 
teaching is very high. It is a rare treat to have such learned 
men with us, and our teachers showed their appreciation of it 
by regular attendance and careful attention. 
The teachers and patrons of the Anderson County schools are 
becoming interested in the education of the youth, and are mak- 
ing efforts to get to the front in this work. There never has been 
a time in our county when teachers showed more earnestness 
than they are showing now; so our prospects are bright for the 
coming year. 
We have a circulating library of the choicest books, and our 
teachers are becoming interested in reading. So, with plenty of 
good books at hand, there is no need for a dull teacher, and I am 
glad to say we have but few such in our county. 
Respectfully, W. B. DISNEY.

BEDFORD COUNTY. 
The seventeenth annual session of the Bedford County 
Teachers’ Institute was held in Shelbyville, beginning June 17 
and continuing two weeks. The officers of the Institute were: 
Garland. 8.. Moore, president; Miss Lena Chick, secretary. A 
splendid programme had been prepared, which was carefully 
carried out. The enrollment was 100, and the average daily 
attendance was 92 per cent. Much interest was manifested dur- 
ing the entire Institute: co 
BENTON COUNTY. 
The teachers of Benton County met at Camden, Monday, 
June 24, 1901, for the purpose of organizing and conducting an 
institute. 
166
-P-A-G-E-184
The house was called to order at 9 o’clock by Supt. McD. 
Neal. The programme was then rendered, as follows: 
Invocation—Rev. J. M. Pickens. 
Address—Supt. McD. Neal. 
Election of officers—Supt. McD. Neal was elected president; 
J. M. Lockhart, vice-president; Allie Alsup, secretary; Joseph 
Fitzsimmons, assistant secretary; critics, Lom Cooper, Miss 
Mattie Clements; committee on arrangement of programme— 
Prof. A. A. Lindsey, Charles Bain, Miss Florence Nance, Miss 
Emma Zimmerman, and Prof. C. C. Vick. 
Address—Prof. J. B. Cummings. 
In the afternoon the programme was taken up with much en- 
thusiasm, which continued throughout the week. 
The instructors were Supt. McD. Neal, Supt. J. B. Cummings, 
of Gibson County, and Prof. W. D. Cooper. 
Our enrollment reached 75, and the interest increased from 
start to finish, many teachers expressing themselves as greatly 
delighted and much benefited. . 
The Institute was the most interesting and the most profitable 
of the many institutes that have been held in the county. Our 
teachers are wp to date, and take great interest in institutes and 
teachers’ monthly meetings. 
We are very thankful to Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick for send- 
ing us such a proficient instructor—Prof. J. B, Cummings—and 
for visiting us and delivering a most excellent address. 
At the close of my Institute, I examined eighty teachers, two 
of them colored. : 
The following resolutions were adopted: 
“Inasmuch as we, the Benton County Teachers’ Institute, 
have been shown many valued favors, we feel it our duty to show 
our appreciation by some act while in session assembled; there- 
fore, be it 
“Resolved (1), That we tender our sincere thanks to our 
worthy State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Hon. Mor- 
gan C. Fitzpatrick, for his visit and for the happy, interesting 
address delivered for us; also for sending us an instructor in the 
167
-P-A-G-E-185
Institute, the worthy Prof. J. B. Cummings, a most excellent 
gentleman and one of the best teachers in West Tennessee. 
“(2) That each and every teacher gives Prof. Cummings his 
most ardent thanks for his valuable service rendered in instruct- 
ing and inspiring the teachers in their work. 
“(8) That we ardently thank Prof. Cooper, of the Benton 
Seminary, for his aid and instruction given us, both as an in- 
structor and as a member of the Institute; and further, that we 
thank our worthy County Superintendent for the arrangement 
of the Institute so as to meet the demands of so great a number 
of teachers, and that we especially thank Supt. Neal and Prof. 
- Cooper for the most excellent syllabus programme prepared for 
us to use in our Institute work. It certainly is a long stride for- 
ward in the march of education.”

BLOUNT COUNTY. 
The annual Teachers’ Institute for Blount County was held in 
Maryville College, beginning July 1 and ending July 6, 1901. 
Prof. F. M. Gill and Mrs. Emma Rice were the instructors. 
Prof. Gill and Mrs. Rice are both proficient and thorough in 
their work. Their lectures were very interesting and also very 
practical and beneficial to the teachers. 
Our Institute was well attended; in fact, there were only four 
or five white teachers in the county who failed to attend the In- 
stitute. 
The interest manifested by the teachers was greater than usual, 
and nearly everyone said it was the best institute ever held in the 
county. 
We held an institute for colored teachers also. There was 
much interest in this Institute, though the attendance was small. 
The people of this county are taking more interest in the cause 
of education from year to year, and I think our schools are im- 
proving. J. F. IDDINS, Superintendent.

CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
The Campbell County Teachers’ Institute was held at Jacks- 
boro, beginning July 8 and ending July 12, 1901. 
Our Institute was one of great success. The attendance was 
very good. Our instructor, W. F. Albright, proved a factor of 
great good. THis lectures were helpful and inspiring to our 
teachers. : 
We had with us a number of other helpful educators, among 
whom were Profs. E. M. Ellison, John Jennings, Jr., M. M. 
Dossett, R. D. Case and others, all doing good work and manifest- 
ing great interest in education. 
One of the greatest hindrances to the success of our public 
schools is the salary paid our primary teachers. Many of our 
teachers quit the work about the time they become well prepared 
for efficient work; then, of course, we must take new and un- 
trained teachers to supply their places. 
I have issued eighty-six Primary Certificates and four Second. 
ary Certificates. ; 
It seems that teachers are beginning to realize something of the 
responsibility and importance of their work. This being the fact, 
we look for better results.

CANNON COUNTY. 
The Cannon County Teachers’ Institute convened at Wood- 
bury on June 25 and closed June 28, 1901. 
The majority of the teachers are exerting their best efforts for 
success in order that they may keep abreast of the leading 
teachers of the State. 
Our Institute was a very successful one, its members many 
‘imes growing very enthusiastic. The instructors were: Miss 
Katie A. Monohan, of Nashville, at present instructor in the 
public schools of Knoxville; Miss Ada Gilbert, of Smithville; 
171
-P-A-G-E-189
Prof. L. E. Summers, principal of Trousdale Academy; Prof. 
J. B. Clark, of Dibrell High School. Thomas M. Harrell, of 
Bradyville; Prof. J. E. Brandon, of Auburn; Prof. W. T: 
Barnes, of Burritt College, and several other prominent edu- 
cators rendered valuable service throughout the week. 
Our exercises were made very entertaining by vocal and instru- 
mental music, the vocal music being conducted by Prof. C. T. 
Cate, and the instrumental music by Prof. Marcus D. Meadow, 
of Trousdale Academy. 
The following resolutions were adopted: 
“Resolved (1), That we express our high appreciation and 
gratitude to Miss Katie A. Monohan for her efficient services 
rendered so cheerfully as State instructor; (2) that we extend to 
State Supt. Fitzpatrick our sincere expression of gratitude for his 
sending to us an able instructor and conductor.” 
There were 110 teachers enrolled. There were 85 teachers in 
the county. 
The Institute was a grand success in every particular.

CARROLL COUNTY. 
On June 24, 1901, the annual Carroll County Teachers’ Iusti- 
tute, after having been extensively advertised in the local papers 
and in a cireular letter, met in the Southern Normal University, 
Huntingdon, Tenn. The Institute proper continued one week— 
until June 29, 1901—and the annual examination of teachers 
took place immediately after the Institute—July 1, 2 and 3; 
altogether nine days. There were two sessions each day—the 
morning session from 8:30, after devotional exercises, until 
11:45, and the evening session from 1:50 to 4:15. 
The Institute was conducted by Nathaniel Traywick, County 
Superintendent, and the instructors were Prof. W. R. Jones, of 
Nashville; J. N. Williams, of McKenzie, and Nathaniel Tray- 
wick, of Huntingdon. : 
All the work was confined to the primary branches, as the 
teachers in that department seemed more deficient. Instructions 
were given in both the subject-matter and in methods and the- 
ories of teaching the adopted text-books in the public-school 
courses. 
The enrollment was greater than ever before, it being 126, 
and greater interest was taken in the whole Institute work than 
has been shown heretofore among the teachers of Carroll County. 
During the week we had some very important lectures—Prof. 
A. J. G. Wells, of the Southern Normal University, two lectures 
on psychology in the country school; Prof. J. E. Kinsland, of 
the same university, miscellaneous; Prof. J. A. Baber, formerly 
president of the Southern Normal University, now of Bowling 
Green, Ky., on the hundred per cent. method of teaching 
percentage; Col. John Allison, of Nashville, former Secre- 
tary of State, on Tennessee history and the patriotism of 
brave Tennesseans. All of these lectures were greatly appre- 
ciated by the entire Institute and received its undivided attention. 
There were 112 out of 121 passed the examination, Those who 
attended the Institute and took an active part in each discussion 
- had no trouble in making grades of perfect satisfaction. The 
failures were those who did not attend and take an interest in the 
Institute work.

We feel that our Institute was a great success, and that there 
was much accomplished in the educational interest. I am proud 
to state that Carroll County is striving to keep abreast of the 
adjoining counties; yes, and even striving to lead in the great 
educational work. NATHANIEL TRAY WICK,

CARTER COUNTY. 
In obedience to your direction, I reported for duty to County 
Supt. M. D. Allen, of Carter County, at Elizabethton, on June 
24, 1901. . : 
The Institute was opened in due form, and work began at once. 
Being assured that the teachers needed class work, we followed 
generally the school routine, having the work exemplified by 
chart and blackboard, together with appropriate lectures. I am 
gratified to report that Supt. M. D. Allen is a live and active man 
and is discharging the duties of his office in good faith. The 
teachers I found affable, bent on progress, and I feel that they 
will do their full duty in their respective schools, As an indica- 
tion of the appreciation for the aid that you gave them, I submit 
the following resolutions, unanimously adopted: 
“Resolved, That we thank Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick for 
giving this Institute and sending Prof. Mason, the able and popu- 
lar educator. 
“Resolved, That the teachers of the Institute extend their 
thanks and make known their appreciation to Prof. Mason for 
the great benefit received from his instruction; also to County 
Supt. M. D. Allen for the instruction given and the interest 
taken in education. 
“Resolved, That we extend an expression of our gratitude to 
William Toncray for the preparation and decoration of the room 
for the Institute, and to the people of Elizabethton for their 
hospitality. Very respectfully,

CHESTER COUNTY. 
The scholastic year closing June 30, 1901, has been one of the 
best in the history of the county. The teachers have become 
awakened to their duty, and ask for the permanent organization 
of a teachers’ association and reading circle, in which they may 
better qualify themselves for their work. They are fast realizing 
that teaching must be studied as a vocation and not an avocation.

When this is fully known, one of the greatest hindrances in our 
public-school system will have been removed. 
The teachers no longer ask for private examinations, as they 
will only be held at such times as the State Superintendent may 
direct, and then certificates are only issued upon the merit and 
qualifications of the applicant. 
On June 24 the annual Institute of white teachers convened at 
Henderson, in the G. R. C. College building. The organization 
was perfected by the election of Miss Hattie Massengill, ex- 
County Superintendent, as secretary. 
Sixty-one teachers were enrolled. The work continued one 
week, and was very satisfactory, closing with the annual examin- 
ation. 
Profs. W. G. Deen, G. G. Butler, I. B. Day, J. W. Stewart, 
N. B. Hardeman, W. J. Carlton and others very ably assisted me 
in carrying out the programme. 
In reporting to the county paper, the secretary, among other 
things, said: . 
“All agreed that it was one of the most interesting and profit- 
able institutes they had ever attended, and praised the conductor 
for his skill in conducting same.” 
Teachers’ meetings were held in various sections of the county 
during the year, in which the teachers, directors and patrons 
took an active part. These meetings have been productive of 
much good, and have aroused interest and enthusiasm among all 
the people. C. B. ITAMS, Superintendent.

CLAY COUNTY. 
Our Institute, held on July 1-5, 1901, is acknowledged by the 
public to have equaled or even surpassed anything of the kind 
ever held in Clay County. 
We are happy to acknowledge the fact that a great deal of this 
interest and enthusiasm shown by the teachers is due to the great 
interest, zeal and energy on the part of our most worthy State 
Superintendent, Morgan M. Fitzpatrick, who has remembered 
us. This year he administered to our needs by sending to aid 
us Prof. L. Pierce Ford, of Elmwood Academy. Prof. Ford is 
an able instructor and a brilliant worker. 
Our teachers seem to be rapidly improving along all lines. 
On the last day of our Institute we were happily surprised 
and found ourselves in the midst of “exceeding great joy” to 
have our State Superintendent with us. We believe we have the 
best and the hardest working State Superintendent found in the 
history of the State. Respectfully submitted,

COCKE COUNTY. 
Cocke County Institute was opened June 24, and continued 
through the week. The enrollment was 84 the first day, and soon 
increased to 95. 
Supt. A. J. McMahan acted as chairman, and did all in his 
power to make the Institute a success. Burrell B. Brooks was 
appointed secretary. : 
The Institute which has just closed has been quite successful 
and satisfactory to the teachers. 
As your instructor, I instructed by lectures, giving methods 
by which the teachers were enabled to grasp the knowledge in a 
practical way. The secondary studies were omitted at the request 
of the Institute, as it preferred the time being spent on the line 
179
-P-A-G-E-197
of work the majority of the teachers would be called upon to per- 
form in their district schools. 
The Cocke County teachers desire, through myself, to extend 
to your their appreciation of the privilege extended, and hope 
you may be enabled to consider them again next year.

COFFEE COUNTY. 
The Institute for Coffee County was held at the public-school 
building in Manchester. We began work June 24 and closed 
June 28, 1901. The programme that had been prepared by the 
executive committee was carried out. 
Only one teacher who was put on for work in the Institute 
failed to respond, and she was prevented from attending by the 
sickness of her father. Her place was supplied by Miss Lizzie 
Clark, of Winchester Normal. : 
180
-P-A-G-E-198
Several important questions pertaining to school work were 
discussed by the teachers and visitors, among others being the 
subject of compulsory education. 
Forty teachers were enrolled, although it was the busiest time 
of the year. 
The young ladies who attended furnished excellent music and 
recitations for the Institute. 
Supt. A. L. Todd, of Rutherford County, was sent by the 
State Superintendent to assist us in the work. He was with us 
all the week, and did excellent work. His class work was fine, 
and his timely talks will be long remembered by Coffee County 
teachers. Supt. Todd is a good worker and a very pleasant 
gentleman. We are very grateful to Supt. Fitzpatrick for the 
aid he gave us. 
We expect to hold monthly meetings of our Institute at Man- 
chester. We will also hold teachers’ meetings at various points 
in the county. We have the hest grade of teachers we have ever 
had, and our schools will be better this year than ever before. 
It was the unanimous opinion, both of teachers and visitors, 
that the Institute just closed was the most successful ever held 
here. Yourstruly, C. N. TOWNSEND, Superintendent.

CROCKETT COUNTY. 
The Institute for white teachers convened at the public-school 
building in Alamo on Monday, June 17, 1901, and continued 
two weeks. The State Superintendent furnished Miss Margie 
Stone, who had charge of the primary work. Miss Stone did her 
work well, and was highly appreciated, both as a teacher and as 
a Christian young lady. 
Our teachers came nobly to the front and did good work in 
both the primary and secondary branches. G. O. Mudge, R. L. 
Conley, Mrs. Lelia Jetton, Perey McDonald, Fred C. James and 
others carried on the work successfully. The Superintendent was 
necessarily absent several days, and Prof. A. C. Patton was 
elected to preside. He did so with eredit to himself and to the 
Institute. The best feeling prevailed during the entire two weeks 
and much good was done. No teacher who wants to be pro- 
gressive can afford to miss such an opportunity for preparation.

CUMBERLAND COUNTY. 
L issued an extended announcement and course of study several 
weeks before the convening of the Institute. I arranged a four- 
183
-P-A-G-E-201
years’ graded course of study for the Normal Institute, and pro- 
vided for the graduation each year of those who complete the 
fourth year on “A” grade of the course. This entitles them to 
immunity from examinations in the county hereafter, provided 
as alumni they attend regularly the normal institutes and par- 
ticipate actively in the work assigned them. Five teachers com- 
pleted the course, delivering graduation orations on the last 
night of the Institute. 
Several noted lecturers were with us on as many nights during 
the Institute. In fact, our evening entertainments were a de- 
cided feature of the work. A splendid choir and several good 
vocal and instrumental soloists assisted us throughout. 
The instruction was of a high order, and the interest mani- 
fested throughout excellent. Our county is noted for its good 
institutes, but never a better one preceded this. 
The lecture of Edward T. Sanford, of Knoxville, on “The 
Convention that Made a Nation,” was superb, and the subject of 
President Samuel T. Wilson, of Maryville College, was ably 
handled. The County. Superintendent’s annual address, “The 
Education of Democracy,” was much commented upon. The 
State Superintendent gave us two splendid addresses during the 
session. The class address was given by 8. C. Brown, dean of the 
American University, of Harriman. 
Our teachers are on a high plane, apt, enthusiastic and pro- 
gressive, and the two weeks of successful Institute drill sends 
them forth better prepared to discharge properly the duties of 
child instructors and equipped with a more thorough knowledge 
of child nature, improved methods of instruction, and the best 
educational thought of the age. Truly yours,

DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
The Davidson County Summer Institute. was held at the Pea- 
body Normal College June 10-21. 
The interest’ and attendance were the most satisfactory we 
have ever had. This may be attributable partly to the fact that 
185
-P-A-G-E-203
teachers are beginning to realize more fully that to be a first- 
class teacher requires much time and energy, and that the few 
weeks spent in institute work is very helpful to them; and again, 
we may attribute this to the very efficient instructors—Dr. J. M. 
King, Prof. Stetson, Miss Maud Brown and Miss Maud Terrell— 
who were employed and paid by the teachers. With but few 
exceptions our teachers appreciate the value of institute work.

DECATUR COUNTY. 
The Institute for white teachers was largely attended by both 
teachers and friends of education, and one of the most instructive 
and beneficent educational meetings in the history of the county, 
it has been said, was held from July 2 to 6. 
186
-P-A-G-E-204
We were ably assisted by Hons. Joe Jennings and W. W. 
Powers, of the Decatursville Bar. 
Interest in the cause of education in the county, we think, has 
been thoroughly aroused, and we believe the various schools in 
this section will show marked improvement during the ensuing 
school year. We feel sure that the teachers will do their work 
faithfully and well.

DEKALB COUNTY. 
‘We have just closed one of the most successful institutes ever 
held in this county. The work was a success from the beginning, 
both teachers and pupils being alive on all subjects that came be- 
fore the Institute. 
Under your administration the standard of education in this 
county has been raised; and it is evident to the teachers who 
have been making school teaching in the fall a side line in their 
business that they must be dropped from the profession or give 
more time and attention to the cause. 
Our examinations were thorough and practical, and the teach- 
ers who were successful in making the grade required by law 
were licensed, and none other. So we have this year a better 
qualified corps of teachers than heretofore. 
The teachers adopted a resolution of thanks to Prof. J. H. 
Sykes, of Nashville, for the able manner in which he instructed 
them, and for the kindness shown them by his ever willing and 
able instruction given when called on. 
I wish to say, in behalf of the teachers, in approval of the man 
you sent us—Prof. Sykes,—that he was the.man for the place, 
and I assure you that the teachers of the county, as well as my- 
self, will ever remember your kindness in favoring us with such 
aman. 
DeKalb County is advancing as she has never done before.

DICKSON COUNTY. 
A Teachers’ Institute was held at Dickson from June 3 to 
June 8. Much interest and enthusiasm was manifested by those 
in attendance, and we feel that great good was accomplished. 
There were about 60 enrolled, and the citizens showed their 
appreciation by visiting the Institute from time to time. 
The majority of the teachers of Dickson County are pro- 
gressive, earnest workers, and wish to be excelled by none. 
Many of them are already asking for a month’s institute next 
year, and we hope to be able to give them the best we have ever 
had in the county. 
The Institute is under lasting obligations to.the State Super- 
intendent for the able and efficient instructor secured to assist 
in the work. Prof. Loggins is an up-to-date man, and it is evident 
that the entire Institute appreciated his earnest, enthusiastic 
efforts to help them. . 
We are glad to note a spirit of awakening, and are earnestly 
189
-P-A-G-E-207
looking forward to better times educationally in Dickson County. 
It shall ever be our aim, by a thorough and fair examination, to 
secure better instructors in the county. We want men and women 
to take charge of our schools who have the work at heart, and 
those who refuse to keep abreast with the best instructors must 
see their places filled by others who will qualify themselves for 
the responsible duties of the profession.

GIBSON COUNTY. 
I herewith submit for your consideration my second annual 
institute report. 
The Institute, having been extensively advertised through the 
newspapers and printed circulars sent out from the County Super- 
intendent’s office, opened July 1, 1901, with the largest attend- 
ance in the history of Gibson County normal institutes. The 
interest manifested was splendid, the instruction given was ex- 
cellent, and the results attained were very satisfactory and grati- 
fying. The Institute was in session ten days, and the interest and 
enthusiasm on the part of both instructors and teachers was un- 
abated from start to finish. 
We patriotically observed Independence Day on July 4, mak- 
ing it a grand rally day for the schools of Gibson County. An 
excellent programme was rendered, consisting of patriotic ad- 
dresses, songs, recitations, and soul-stirring martial music. 
Among the addresses that deserve special mention we name those 
of Prof. E. P. Smith, Judge M. M. Neil, Dr. T. J. Happell, and 
Hon. Sp’l Hill. Our citizens take special interest and pride 
in our annual institutes. At the close of the rally exercises, after 
the report of the committee on awards was read, the County 
Superintendent, having previously offered a first prize to the 
schoo] having the largest number of pupils in attendance and a 
second prize to the school having the next largest number in 
attendance, proceeded in a_ brief speech to award to Hickory 
Grove School the first prize, a library consisting of a selection of 
193 
13——
-P-A-G-E-211
books from the American Book Company and the B. F. Johnson 
Publishing Co. The second prize, consisting of fifteen volumes 
from Ginn & Co., was awarded to Edison Institute. The object 
in offering the above prizes was to arouse interest in school 
libraries among our people. From the teachers we have just 
collected about $65 to replenish, with new and advanced. books 
on the science and practice of teaching, the Gibson County 
Teachers’ Circulating Library. 
At the close of the Institute session, we held a three-days’ 
examination for teachers. Numbers were assigned to the 
teachers by the secretary of the Institute, Miss Mai McRee, and 
these numbers were placed on the examination papers by the 
teachers instead of their names. The papers were then graded by 
numbers, and not by the names of the teachers. The examiner 
did not know the name of any applicant for a certificate till his 
papers were all graded. This obviated all possibility of charges 
of partiality in grading papers. 
We think we but voice the sentiment of the teachers and the 
people generally when we say this was the most successful Insti- 
tute ever held in the County. 
After singing “God Be With You Till We Meet Again,” the 
Institute adjourned, to meet in 1902 at the call of the County 
Superintendent. J. B. CUMMINGS, Superintendent. rr an Seo

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
The Grainger County Teachers’ Normal Institute met at Rut- 
ledge July 15, 1901, and continued one week. This was a week 
of much interest and enthusiasm among the teachers and friends 
of education in Grainger County. 
— People from different parts of the county were present during 
the week and gave teachers and County Superintendent encour- 
agement by promising hearty co-operation in school work during 
the term. The County Court of Grainger at its April term, 
195
-P-A-G-E-213
1901, made an additional tax levy of 10¢ on the $100, which 
will give us an average term of five months. 
Ut now seems that the educational outlook in Grainger County 
is better than ever before. We have a better County Court, a 
better Board of School Directors, and a better spirit of working 
together for the advancement of education, than in the past. 
Our Normal is being praised as the best yet held in Grainger 
County. We were very much pleased with Prof. J. A. Cragwall, 
the man whom our worthy State Superintendent sent to help 
conduct the Normal. We hope to have a two-weeks’ Normal 
next year, and would be pleased to have Prof. Cragwall with us 
again, 
The people of Grainger County believe that we now have the 
best State Superintendent we have ever had. He is spoken of by 
our teachers in very complimentary terms. 
Prof. Cragwall and Supt. Farmer were ably assisted in the 
work of the Institute by Profs, Wickham, Harrison, Camper, 
Seymour and others of the county teachers. 
Several prominent visitors were present during the week. 
Prof. J. T. Henderson, of Carson-Newman College, made the 
teachers one of his excellent talks. Prof. Bolton, of Grant Uni- 
versity, gave an interesting lecture. 
The schools have opened in every district but one. We expect 
a better attendance than usual this year.

GRUNDY COUNTY. 
The Grundy County Teachers’ Institute, conducted by the 
County Superintendent and Prof. A. D. Hassell, who was sent 
here by the State Superintendent to aid us in our work, convened 
in the auditorium of the James K. Shook School at Tracy City 
on July 3, 1901, and continued six days. The Institute was 
opened at 8:30 o’clock Monday morning with appropriate exer- 
cises, after which the Institute work began in earnest. From the 
first the teachers manifested much interest, which grew from 
day to day, and we would not exaggerate if we were to say that 
this was the most interesting and best appreciated Institute ever 
held in Grundy County. This was due to the excellent faculty 
selected for the occasion, viz.: Prof. W. G. Dillon, phonies and 
grammar; Prof. A. D. Hassell, history of Tennessee, school law, 
and pedagogy; G. C. Martin, United States history; Miss Hattie 
Young, geography; Jeff. D. Fults, physiology; Marion Turner, 
rhetoric; Attorney C. H. Garner, civil government; R. H. 
White, arithmetic; Miss Coker Parker, theory and practice, with 
197
-P-A-G-E-215
queries; Miss Emma Ring, primary work. The faculty, although 
not paid, worked faithfully and made the Institute a grand 
success. / 
Thirty-eight teachers were in attendance, only two of whom 
failed to get certificates after the examination. There were also 
some visiting teachers and a number of friends of education 
present each day. 
On Monday night an entertainment was given in honor of the 
visiting teachers. The auditorium was crowded with spectators, 
and all seemed delighted with the programme rendered by local 
talent. 
The teachers as a unit expressed their appreciation of the Tn- 
stitute, and I am sure that I voice the sentiment of every teacher 
and friend of education present when I extend my thanks to the 
State Superintendent for sending Mr. A. D. Hassell here to aid 
us in our work; and we trust that we may have similar courtesies 
shown us in the future.

HAMBLEN COUNTY. 
The Hamblen County Teachers’ Institute convened in the 
Morristown High School building July 1 and continued in ses- 
sion five days. 
The County Superintendent was assisted by Supt. Fd. 8. 
Vaught, of Jefferson County, and J. A. Cragwall, of Nashville. 
This was the most intelligent body of teachers that ever 
assembled in our county, most of whom were ladies. 
The Institute was visited by Prof. J. T. Henderson, president 
of Carson and Newman College, Jefferson City, who gave a very 
interesting talk. Prof. A. R. Hickman, of Dandridge, gave a 
very interesting address on Tennessee history. Miss Leona 
Young, of Oak Grove, Jefferson County, was with us for a short 
time, and highly entertained her audiences with her recitals.

HANCOCK COUNTY. 
The following is a report of the annual Institute of Hancock 
County for 1901: 
The Institute met at Sneedville July 22 and continued till 
Aug. 2, 1901. : 
200
-P-A-G-E-218
Prof. E. M. Wright, of Greeneville, was sent by the State 
Superintendent to help conduct the Institute. Prof. Wright, 
having had the advantage of several years’ experience in teach- 
ing and conducting institutes, did the work thoroughly and satis- 
factorily. 
We held morning and afternoon sessions of two hours and 
thirty minutes each. 
There are only two secondary schools in the county, so the 
work we did was nearly all in the primary course. The work 
was made very practical, and will be of much advantage to the 
teachers in the county schools this fall. 
The attendance upon the Institute was unusually large. A 
great many citizens attended regularly and took part in the 
discussions. There are only 53 schools in the county, yet the 
enrollment for the two weeks aggregated 110. 
All the branches taught in the primary schools were taken up 
and discussed, with special reference to the latest and best 
methods of presenting them in the schoolroom. Though very 
little reviewing was done while the Institute was in session, yet 
the discussions were conducted in such a manner as to induce the 
teachers to review while at their rooms. The programmes were 
announced a day ahead, so that all might have time to make 
preparation on their subjects. Nearly all the teachers entered 
earnestly and systematically into the work, and very few could 
be found idling and jesting on the streets, as is sometimes done 
at normals. 
The examinations given with the closing of the Institute were 
very practical and a thorough test of competency. The students 
of the McKinney High School who made good grades in the free- 
school branch at the final examination which was given last April 
with the approval and under the direction of the County Super- 
intendent, and who attended the Institute, were excused from 
the annual examination. Some teachers who held high-grade 
certificates and who were known to be well qualified were not 
amination and three failed. Fifty-six certificates were issued.

to those who did not attend the Institute, except in cases of sick- 
ness or other Providential hindrances. Thirty-five took the ex-

HARDEMAN COUNTY. 
Our Institute met June 24 and continued in session for one 
week. All pronounced the Institute to be a good one. 
Prof. Abernathy, of Selma, Tenn., was sent by the State 
Superintendent, and his work was highly appreciated by the 
202
-P-A-G-E-220
Institute. He made many friends, and we would be glad to have 
him with us again. 
Profs. Coffin, Roland, Allford, Roberson, Murdough, Bishop, 
McDaniel and Ferguson did some fine Institute work. Mrs. 
Miller, Miss Stewart and Miss Franklin also gave fine work to the 
Institute. 
Our examination was well attended, and the teachers made 
higher grades than ever before. Hardeman County’s teachers 
are becoming better qualified for their work cach year, and soon 
none but those who are well qualified can manage our schools. 
Our colored Institute met July 1 and continued in session six 
days. It was conducted by Prof. J. L. Allford, and he did his 
work in a satisfactory way. Seventy teachers attended and 65 of - 
these took the examination, 60 making a satisfactory grade. 
They gave an entertainment in the Court House at the close of 
the examination, and the programme was enjoyed by all.

HARDIN COUNTY. 
I take pleasure in submitting my first annual report of insti- 
tute work and the condition of education in Hardin County for 
the year 1900-01. 
On. the second Saturday in March last our teachers met and 
organized the Hardin County Teachers’ Association, with 24 
members, which has grown until now we have a membership of 
60. Its purpose is to advance the cause of education in Hardin 
County; to promote unity and mutual co-operation in the ranks 
of the teachers, patrons, and directors; and to discuss questions 
which will yield practical results in school management and 
school instruction. 
In April the teachers decided to hold a two-weeks’ summer 
normal institute, beginning June 24 and closing with the annual 
examination July 5-6. The Institute building in Savannah was 
selected as the place in which to hold the normal, and the follow- 
ing were elected to conduct the work: County Supt. Walter E. 
Gill, conductor; faeulty—A. G. Freed, of Henderson, Tenn., 
204
-P-A-G-E-222
principal; Miss Ellen Brown, Mrs. Mai Dickson, W. F. Bell, 
M. L. Jowers, H. E. Woodside, C. R. Spencer. A full announce- 
ment and complete programme, with topics assigned to each one 
of the faculty, was printed and sent to all teachers and directors 
in the county. 
On June 24 the Normal was called to order by the conductor, 
after musie and prayer. Rey. J. J. Stowe, pastor of the M. E. 
Church at Savannah, gave a word of weleome cheer and good 
will, which was responded to by Prof. Freed in a very appropriate 
manner. 
The interest manifested by the teachers and faculty has never 
been equaled in Hardin County. Due credit was given the 
teachers in their examinations for their deportment and pune- 
tuality. It was the first thorough and systematic work done for 
years, and the teachers say we must not fail to have a normal 
each year hereafter. 
At the close of the Normal, the Teachers’ Associaticn -'-+-4 
the following officers for the ensuing year: Supt. Wait: 
president; Prof. H. E. Woodside, vice-pres; Alonzo 
second vice-president; Miss Martha Dugdale, secretar, , 
Hurst, assistant secretary; M. L. Jowers, treasurer. 
The following resolutions were adopted by the association: 
Asking the County Court to establish a county high school. 
Asking the State Teachers’ Association to recommend to the 
next General Assembly the adoption of a uniform system of 
examination for teachers in the public schools throughout the 
State. 
That applicants for the office of State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction shall undergo a satisfactory examination before the 
State Board of Education, assisted by three members elected by 
the State Teachers’ Association. 
The condition of education in Hardin County is certainly 
improving. The schools and teachers are becoming more en- 
thusiastic, the demand for good teachers is growing, and we hope, 
by constant effort on the part of the teachers and the schools, to 
have nothing but good teachers and good schools.

HAWKINS COUNTY. 
There were three institutes held in Hawkins County this year. 
The white teachers’ Institute convened at Persia from July 8 
to July 13, and at Alum Well from July 15 to July 20, 1901, 
and were conducted by the County Superintendent, who was 
ably assisted by Profs. W. B. Sanders and ©. W. Davis. The 
attendance of teachers was unusually large, and the interest mani- 
fested by both teachers and school patrons was indeed encour- 
aging. 
As many of the teachers of the county are ladies, I felt that 
it was necessary for them to take an active part in our Institute 
work if we wished to have great success, and I asked them to 
prepare papers on various subjects. This call was responded to 
by many of them reading in our Institutes interesting and in- 
structive papers. All were given something to do, that they 
- might “learn to do by doing.” 
The colored teachers’ Institute was in session at Rogersville 
from July 2 to July 6, 1901. It was conducted by Rev. W. H. 
Franklin, principal of Swift Memorial Institute. ‘The attend- 
ance was fairly good, and the teachers made very good grades, 
showing much improvement in their work. 
One hundred and twenty-six white teachers were examined and 
115 received certificates; 15 colored teachers were examined, 
and 12 received certificates; 118 primary and 12 secondary 
certificates were issued. 
We begin the new school year very much encouraged. Our 
County Court at its April term, 1901, levied an extra tax of 10 
per cent. for school purposes, which I think will make our school 
term more than five months this year. 
The one great trouble in this county in regard to teachers is 
that the best material does not find its way to the sehoolroom. 
The salaries paid teachers in our primary and secondary schools 
are such as to drive from the county some of our best teachers. 
T hope to be able to remedy this before long. I am endeavoring 
to license only the best teachers and to have them paid better 
salaries. 
207
-P-A-G-E-225
During our Institute we were favored with addresses by Rev. 
T. P. Walton and others, which I think will be a source of much 
benefit to our teachers. Most of the teachers are reading educa- 
tional journals. My aim next is to get them to attend our 
teachers’ meetings. Taking everything into consideration, I think 
we are doing good work. I believe that Hawkins County is rais- 
ing more money for school purposes this year, has turned her 
face toward the morning, and that she expects the fuller day, 
broadening perpetually, whose sun continually ascends but 
reaches not its zenith until time shall end.

HENDERSON: COUNTY. 
The seventh annual Teachers’ Institute of Henderson County 
convened in.the college at Lexington June 24. . A very suecess- 
ful session of six days. was conducted by the County Superin- 
tendent. . 
The State Superintendent sent Miss Mattie Butler, of Tren- 
ton, as instructor.. She was. assisted by the best teachers of the 
county. Eighty-eight teachers were enrolled, and the average 
daily attendance was 76. Miss Butler is indeed a most excellent 
lady. Asan instructor of primary teaching she is specially fitted. 
The teachers were greatly benefited by her discussions and lec- 
tures. The local teachers who were assigned deserve special 
credit. . . 
. On Tuesday, the 25th, the Institute and the citizens of the 
town assembled in the Court House, and Dr. M. A. Matthews, of 
Jackson, delivered a very interesting and beneficial address on 
the subject of three-fold training. 
On Thursday, the 27th, Dr. Savage, president of the South- 
western Baptist University, favored the Institute with a visit and 
delivered an excellent address. Prof. B. A. Tucker, of Scott’s 
Tiill, gave a very fine discussion on psychology. 
The teaching ability of the county has made a marked improve- 
ment in the past four years, and while the teachers receive only 
medium salaries, it is believed that no other county in the State 
has a better qualified class of teachers, considering the salaries 
paid. The school fund has increased in the past vear, which is 
largely due to the close collection of Mr. T. Edwards, the County 
Trustee. On the whole, the schools of the county have an up- 
ward tendency, and greater interest is being manifested in eduea- 
tional work than ever before. 
The Institute this year was the most interesting and successful 
one ever held in the county.. 
The colored Institute was conducted the same week by J. A. 
Hannan and David V- Bohanon, who did a good work for the 
teachers. T'wenty-four were enrolled, and the average attend- 
ance was about 20. The qualifications of the colored teachers 
were greatly improved by the Institute.:

HENRY COUNTY. 
The Henry County Teachers’ Institute held its annual session 
July 1 to 6, 1901. The programme that had been previously pre- 
pared and put in the hands of the teachers was, with few excep- 
tions, carried out as planned. «a; yey he 
The interest taken by the teachers was ; deep and sincere, 
was an interest of the quality that looks to the future and not 
alone to the present. “The interest and enthusiasm of the teachers, 
211
-P-A-G-E-229
taken with that manifested by the citizens, points unmistakably 
to a better day for the public schools of Henry County. 
The lecture Tuesday evening by Dr. M. A. Matthews, of 
Jackson, was inspiring and helpful in the deepest and truest 
sense. The teachers who heard it will ever after be better 
teachers, and those not teachers will have a truer appreciation of 
the teacher and his work. 
Prof. J. D. Hoskins, of the State University, spent one day 
with the Institute. His first. talk was devoted entirely to the 
university, explaining its relation to the public schools of the 
State, and the requirements for admission. Prof. Hoskins’ see- 
ond talk was on history. It was replete with suggestions for 
teaching this very important subject. 
Special mention is due to every member of the Institute, who 
so promptly responded to every duty assigned them; to Supt. 
J. I. Allman, of Stewart Cotinty, for an excellent talk on psy- 
chology, and to Miss Addie Oliver, secretary. 
Total enrollment, 101. The larger number of those enrolled 
contributed $1 each for the founding of a teachers’ library. 
The Colored Teachers’ Institute was held July 8 to 13, 1901. 
Prof. B. K. Sampson, principal of the city colored school, was 
conductor. The attendance and attention to work were excellent.

The Houston County Teachers’ Institute was in session July 
8-13, closing with examinations. Great interest was manifested 
by the teachers of the county. The attendance was good, only one 
teacher being absent the entire time, and those who attended the 
State Institute attended our County Institute and took active 
part. The interest in education in the county is increasing and 
_ bids fair to equal that of the leading counties of the State. 
We extend our ihanks to Supt. Morgan C, Fitzpatrick for his 
aid. We also express to Mrs. §. A. Green our appreciation of 
her energetic and untiring work while with us.

HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
: The Humphreys County Suramér Institute convened in the 
chapel of Waverly College on Monday, June 10. It was con- 
ducted by the County Superintendent, assisted by Prof. 8. L. 
Smith. 
The Institute was well attended, 59 teachers being present. 
They took great interest in the Institute, and all expressed them- 
selvés as being well pleased with the work. 
At the close of the Institute the teachers organized an associa- 
tion to be known as the Humphreys County Teachers’ Associa- 
tion. We have also made arrangements to organize a teachers’ 
library association, which we ‘hope to do.in:a-very short time. 
The educational interest of our county. is improving. Espe- 
cially is this true of our magistrates, who have assured me that 
they will increase the school tax next January.

LAKE COUNTY. 
I beg leave to present the following report of the Lake County 
Teachers’ Institute: 
The Institute was called to order by Supt. R. C. Donalson at 
9:30 a. m. Monday, July 8, in the Court House at Tiptonville, 
and continued in session one week. 
A large number of the Lake County teachers being present at 
the opening, and each day taking an active part in the work, pro- 
moted the interest and enthusiasm very greatly. In many re- 
spects it was one of the most interesting and satisfactory insti- 
tutes I have ever attended. The citizens of Tiptonville manifest- 
ed their interest in the work by attending the sessions. 
Friday was directors’ day, and Prof. W.T. Moore, principal of 
the Tiptonville High School, made a good practical talk, when 
the Institute adjourned. E. H. SLOSS, Conductor. 
The following resolutions were read and adopted by the teach- 
ers at the close of the Institute: 
“Be it resolved (1), That we, the teachers in attendance upon 
the Lake County Institute, do hereby extend our thanks to the 
State Superintendent, Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, for the great 
zeal he has shown in promoting edueation in this State, and 
especially for giving State aid to our county for the purpose of 
holding this Institute. 
“(2) That we tender our thanks to our worshipful County 
Court for its aid and encouragement. 
“(8) ‘That we endorse the work accomplished in the Institute 
just concluded. 
217
-P-A-G-E-235
“(4) That it is the sénse of this Institute that we should have 
another Institute next summer, to last two weeks, if possible; 
and that the school officials and pablic s sentiment require all 
teachers to attend in the future. 
“(5) That. we appreciate the able assistance rendered by Prof. 
Sloss as conductor of our Institute, and Prof. Moore’s kind 
assistance. oe . 
“(6) That we feel sincere regret at the severe illness of several 
of our number, which has prevented them from being present, 
and that we trust they-shall soon be restored to health.” 
MISS ELEANOR THOMAS, Secretary. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
This is conceded to have been one of the best. teachers’ insti- 
tutes ever conducted: in Lawrence County. It was held two 
‘weeks earlier than usual, hence a few of the teachers who engage 
in farming did not attend. There are a number of innovations on 
our former institute work, one of the most important being that 
the instruction was more largely confined to methods of teaching. 
Several years ago, when J. P. Rippey was County Super- 
intendent, an attempt was made to grade the schools. Much 
good resulted from this effort, but our system of grading is still 
imperfect. With the kind aid of Mrs. 8. A. Greene, a suggestive 
course of grading has been prepared and will be put into the 
hands of the teachers, and it is my earnest determination that our 
schools shall be graded. Uniform examinations will be required 
under my direction, and a record will be kept of the work of the 
different schools of the county. This will occasion a great deal of 
labor, both for myself and the teachers, but it is ‘hoped it will be 
productive of satisfactory results. These examinations will not 
oceur oftener than every two ‘and one-half months. 
The teachers of the county have organized for the purpose of 
holding an annual institute for three years. The enrollment fee 
was fixed at $1, and there is a sentiment among the best, teachers 
218
-P-A-G-E-236
that it ought to be increased. The fund lias been ample for ex- 
penses. Those who teach in our county, whether attending the 
Institute or‘not, have been very kindly helping the Institute fund 
by enrollment. 
: “The constitution of our Annual Institute was so amended at 
this term as to provide for a monthly session. The teachers were 
almost unanimous in voting this change. 
Our constitution now provides for directors’ day in the winter 
or spring at one of our monthly sessions. Special programmes 
will be prepared and ‘will be discussed wpon directors’ day that are 
of common interest to directors and teachers.. Our efforts to 
make directors’ day a success on June 25 failed, though we had 
twelve directors present, more than had ever been at any previous 
meeting of the kind in the county. Our directors being mostly 
farmers, and wheat harvest being in progress, it is, I think, a 
tribute to them that we had so many. 
We have about ninety schools in the county, most of which 
are white. ce : 
My policy has been ‘to encourage ‘the consolidation of schools 
and the building of more commodions houses. I have notice of 
the consolidation of schools in one civil district, reducing the 
number from 11 to 7. There are other localities where this 
might be done, and I shall continue to agitate the question until 
it bring results. 
If called upon to point out our greatest weaknesses, I should 
say, “Low salaries, too many schools,-and uncomfortable houses.” 
As the result of this, we are making our county a kind of train- 
ing school for teachers. Few of the teachers who were here two 
years ago are now teaching in our county. Had the County 
Superintendent the right to fix the salary, it might improve this 
condition. It might be, too, that if the power to establish schools 
were taken out of the hands of the district directors, it would be 
well. There should be a curb on their power somewhere. We 
ought to have a system that would produce and keep with us the 
professional teacher. : 
But our schools are improving in many localities. Public 
school funds are being supplemented by subscriptions in some 
219
-P-A-G-E-237
communities where a few years ago little interest was manifested. 
But before closing I wish to say that the success of my work 
Gf it has succeeded) is not due to me, but to the energy, zeal and 
sacrifice of the instructors. I desire especially to commend 
Mrs. S. A. Greene’s work in the primary methods and in arousing 
the enthusiasm of our teachers to try to make themselves the very 
best. More than forty of our teachers subscribed for school jour- 
nals at this term. Only a few had taken them before.

Tn the Loudon County Teachers’ Annual Institute, which was 
held in Loudon July 1-6, I was aided principally by some of the 
best of the county teachers, 
Prof. D. A. Bolton, of the University of Athens, was with ns 
two days, and added much to the interest in the work by excellent 
talks during the time of his stay. 
There were only a few in the Institute who had not been teach- 
ing in the county for some time before this year. Over half of 
221
-P-A-G-E-239
the teachers will teach the same schools they taught. last year. 
‘We will have less than half a dozen without previous experience., 
Our schools will be in session longer this year than usual, as’ we 
have more than one-fifth more school money than ever before at 
the beginning of the school year. Also, our school levy in the 
county for the present year is the same as that collected last year. 
With longer terms we hope for greater improvement among the 
teachers and better results from their work.

The MeNairy County Teachers’ Institute began June 17, 
1901, and continued one week. 
I was ably assisted in the work by Hon. Will K. Abernathy, 
Prof. Harry Hodges, Prof. W. O. Mangrum, Prof. J. A. Hous- 
ton, and Terry Abernathy. 
About eighty teachers were enrolled. 
Everyone seemed to be interested in the work. Our young 
teachers entered heartily into the Institute and did all in their 
power to make it one of the best ever held in the county. 
Our teachers are becoming better qualified for their work. 
They are learning that they will not be licensed except at the 
times prescribed by the State Superintendent, and then only upon 
the merit and qualifications of the applicant. 
It is our purpose to hold a teachers’ meeting in each of the 
nineteen civil districts of the county and do all in our power to 
arouse greater interest among the people, as well as among the 
teachers. 
The colored Institute opened July 1, 1901, and continued four 
days. The colored teachers entered heartily into the work, and I 
think great good was done. Prof. J. A. Houston assisted me in 
the work.

MARION COUNTY. 
The County Institute for the teachers of Marion County was 
held at Jasper, the county seat, beginning June 24 and ending 
July 5. 
The Institute was conducted by the County Superintendent, 
who was ably assisted by the teachers of the county. 
The attendance was unusually large, and the interest mani- 
fested in the work from day to day greater than heretofore. The 
County Institute is doing much for the teachers of Marion, and 
225

they are taking an active interest in this work, and the schools - 
are benefited accordingly. 
The State Superintendent kindly sent Prof. Jas. E. Scobey, a 
leading and distinguished educator of Maury County, to aid us. 
Prof. Scobey entertained and instructed our teachers and citizens 
in a very satisfactory manner. His lectures were practical, sens- 
ible, scholarly, and well timed. We make especial mention of his 
lecture, delivered during the last days of the Institute, on the sub- 
ject “Man! What Is He?” This subject was handled by Prof. 
Scobey in a masterly manner. 
Taking all together, I regard this as an important year for the 
teachers and school interests of Marion County. Our teachers 
are active, wide awake and enterprising, and I believe that we 
will accomplish much in the future. 
: D. A. TATE, Superintendent. 
MEIGS COUNTY. 
I take great pleasure in submitting this report of our County 
Institute, which was held from July 15 to 19. 
I consider the work of this year as being a grand success, and 
besides, I have heard several of the leading teachers of the 
county say since the Institute that it was one of the most success- 
ful they have ever attended in the county. 
There were 41 teachers in attendance; 36 certificates were 
issued. 
Several visiting teachers were with us and took part in the 
exercises. Among these were Prof. D. B. Roark, of Hamilton 
County; Profs. R. D. Davis, John Zeigler, and 8. W. Tindell, 
of Rhea County. 
Two interesting and instructive exercises were conducted at 
night. 
The Institute was favored this year by the State Superintend- 
ent with Prof. W. E. Stephens, of Dayton, as conductor; and, as 
expressive of our appreciation of this favor, the following reso- 
lutions were unanimously adopted by the Institute: 
226
-P-A-G-E-244
“Resolved (1), That we hereby express our appreciation and 
gratitude to Prof. W. E. Stephens, of Dayton, for his efficient 
work, so cheerfully given us as State instructor.

furnishing us State aid in our County Institute.”

MONROE COUNTY. 
L herewith submit my first annual report of the public schools 
of Monroe County. ; 
Our schools are not what they should be, but are improving. 
The grade of teachers are better, and the interest in general is 
improved. The attendance is not as good as it should be. We 
have been careful in examining and licensing teachers, and will 
raise the standard of our teachers by more thorough examinations. 
The teachers have organized themselves into an Institute and 
Library Association, with Supt. Willis as president. They meet 
monthly and discuss such questions as are of greatest importance, 
with instruction in methods and regular text-books. 
The County Institute was conducted by Prof. W. L. Law- 
rence, assisted by Prof. S. G. Gilbreath, of the Peabody Normal, 
and the County Superintendent, and was one of the best ever 
conducted in the county. Great interest was manifested through- 
out. Eight days were devoted to lectures and two to examina- 
tions. I feel that much was accomplished for the public schools 
in the Institute. The teachers were well pleased with the in- 
structors and voted a resolution of thanks to them and to the 
State Superintendent.

MOORE COUNTY. 
I submit herewith a report of the Institute held under your 
direction at Lynchburg, beginning June 24, 1901. 
You will observe that, in proportion to the number of teachers 
employed in Moore County, the attendance was large. 
The work was so divided as to give some time to each subject 
taught in the public schools, but special attention was given to 
primary work and methods of teaching. 
T have not often seen greater attention on the part of teachers, 
neither have I seen a body of teachers more ready to instruct or 
be instructed. The spirit of the true teacher prevailed throughout 
the term; hence, the work was not only pleasant but of a charac- 
ter to produce the results most desired from institutes. 
Three able, practical lectures were given during the term— 
one each by Profs. Morgan and Alexander, of Fayetteville, and 
Miller, of Petersburg.

MORGAN COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my report of the Institute for Morgan 
County, held at Wartburg for two weeks. 
Our Institute was very ably conducted by Dr. FE. W. Kennedy, 
of the Peabody Normal College. 
On the second Monday of the Institute we were favored with 
a visit from every member of the honorable County Court, the 
County Judge, Clerk, and Sheriff, who called on us in a body 
and remained long enough to listen to one of Dr. Kennedy’s 
very interesting and instructive lectures. Our State Senator, 
Hon. John M. Davis, also favored us with a visit and a lecture 
which was much appreciated by the teachers. 
230
-P-A-G-E-248
Nearly all our schools are in session, and I think good work is 
being done by the teachers. 
We are having better teachers’ meetings this year than ever 
before, as the attendance is better and the teachers take more 
interest in the school work.

All of my teachers except Messrs. Cook, Milam and Willing-

OVERTON COUNTY. 
The Overton County Teachers’ Institute was held in Living- 
ston, beginning July 8 and closing July 20, 1901. 
Prof. Homer L. Higgs, of Greenfield, assisted by A. R. Hogue, 
of this county, were our instructors. Both were proficient in 
their work, and their earnest efforts brought about much that 
was inspiring to the teachers. ° 
The attendance was better than ever before. About one hun- 
dred teachers were in attendance, besides a number of visitors 
who took part. 
The examination was held during the last week of the Insti- 
tute. All teachers who expected to teach in the county were 
present except four who were absent on account of illness. 
Ninety received certificates. 
The county is divided into four sections for institute pur- 
poses, and an institute is held in each section once a month, and 
at the close of the term we have a union institute, to be held near 
the county seat. These weekly meetings are rasonably well at- 
tended by the people, who take great interest in the work. Much 
good is expected to result. 
The directors met Friday, July 19. Prof. Higgs, Dr. M. B. 
Capps, Judge Bohannon, and Judge Puckett, of Cookeville, 
made speeches, after which the directors perfected an organiza- 
233
-P-A-G-E-251
tion known as the Directors’ Association, for the purpose of 
securing uniformity of the public school work of the county. 
There are about eighty-five schools in this county, most of 
which are now in session. The majority of them are doing good 
work. I have visited several of them, and will visit all during 
the present. term. 
A. few schools have closed on account of scarlet fever. 
I am very much indebted to Prof. Higgs, whose tact, energy 
and enthusiasm contributed so much to the success of the Insti- 
tute. Few person possess so many of the qualifications of a good 
institute instructor. 
This county has the largest amount of school money this year 
it has ever had. The length of the term will be five to eight 
weeks greater than last year. Our people have been manifesting 
so much interest that we hope to be able to coritinue increasing 
the length of the term until we have a good school during each 
year. ‘ CHAS. J. CULLOM, Superintendent.

PERRY COUNTY. 
The Perry County Teachers’ Annual Institute was called to 
order in the Linden Academy, at Linden, by County Supt. J. R. 
Godwin, July 1, 1901. 
The instructors were Prof. Robt. L. Sutton, now of the Lexing- 
ton Normal School, employed by the county, and Prof. E. 8. 
Brugh, of the Nashville city schools, employed by the State. 
It goes without controversy that this has been the best Insti- 
tute ever held in Perry County. The instructors showed them- 
selves to be men_qualified for the work to which they had been 
assigned, and prove the wisdom of the State superintendent and 
County Superintendent in their selection of instructors. From 
the beginning the teachers took a deep interest in the work, and 
all were prompt at each exercise. The attendance was larger than 
usual, and the interest was beyond anything ever known in for- 
mer institutes in this county. 
‘We want to express our appreciation to the teachers for the 
interest they took in the Institute and the readiness with which 
they responded to the call for the work. It did not seem that it 
was fear of the examination that prompted them to come, but a 
desire for self-improvement and better preparation for the work 
in which they were soon to be engaged. 
‘We extend our thanks to the State Superintendent and to the 
County Court for dealing so kindly with us. We shall try in the 
future to show them that their actions were not without good — 
results. 
We believe the present will be the most prosperous school 
year we have ever had.

PICKETT COUNTY. 
As instructor of the Pickett County Normal, held at Byrds- 
town from June 24 to June 29, 1901, I will say that Supt. Chil- 
ton deserves a great deal of credit for the interest he has taken 
in the teachers of his county. Mr. Chilton is one of the best 
educators in this part of the State, and many of the teachers of 
Pickett are better by having been pupils of his. 
236
-P-A-G-E-254
The week I was with him we had 29 in attendance, 30 to 32 
being the number in the county. Too much cannot be said for 
his teachers. 
T report no secondary teachers. However, a large percentage 
of them have a pass in most if not all secondary branches. 
The public gave us a good audience each day, and certainly 
appreciates state recognition. 
The people are well pleased with the system of uniform text- 
books, and T think it is a great advantage to have such a law. 
My work for the week, at the suggestion of Mr. Chilton, em- 
-braced the leading subjects of the primary text-books, methods, 
ete. We had many lively discussions on school government and 
psychological questions.

POLK COUNTY. 
The annual Institute, held at Benton July 15-19, was well 
attended, well conducted, and well instructed. It commenced 
with 46 teachers or applicants in attendance; the total enroll- 
ment was 59, and the average daily attendance was 51. Two 
237
-P-A-G-E-255
teachers were absent on account of sickness, and one took the 
examination at the State Institute held at Cleveland. Forty- 
seven certificates were issued, and our schools will require about 
fifty white teachers. In the discussions many facts and methods 
especially beneficial to young teachers were brought out. 
Prof. Wm. L. Lawrence, the chief instructor, did excellent 
work in theory and practice, histories, and English grammar. 
His “You Ought ‘To Knows” will no doubt.cause many of our 
teachers to study and think more. 
A. B. Nicholson, conductor, kept the Institute well in hand, 
and delivered some excellent talks. . 
The County Superintendent placed a specimen language les- 
son, a daily programme for primary schools, a spelling class 
record, and a map of Polk County on the blackboards during the 
week. J. L. Williams and the County Superintendent used the 
map in connection with a cabinet of mineral and geological speci- 
mens from various parts of the county in giving instruction in the 
geology and geography of Polk County. 
Closing the discussion on teachers’ circulating libraries, the 
Superintendent proposed to make his the twenty-first name on a 
list to form a library association, each member to pay 50c, and 
the twenty-first to pay $2.50. Before the week closed 24 names 
were on the list, an organization was effected, and a committee 
was selected to purchase books. 
The teachers were informed of a cash surplus in the school 
fund sufficient to pay them two months’ salary, and of an average 
school term this year of probably more than six months. 
The Institute was marked by regular attendance and the pres- 
entation at all times of correct methods by the instructors and 
leading teachers. 
Entertaining recitations and good music were special features 
Thursday evening and Friday afternoon.

RHEA. COUNTY. 
It is the consensus of opinion among the teachers that the 
Institute this year far exceeded any others that have ever been 
held in the county. The enrollment was large, and no doubt the 
average attendance was the best in the history of the county; 
for every teacher was in attendance every day during the two 
weeks, with very few exceptions. It was a well-organized school, 
in which the work was so well planned that every teacher could 
take that which he needed most. The work in each department 
was of the highest order, giving satisfaction to those in attend- 
ance and reflecting much credit on the instructors. 
The following courses were pursued by the different classes of 
teachers: Those teachers who had made an average of 90 per 
239
-P-A-G-E-257
cent. on their certificates for the last two years entered the Read- 
ing Course, consisting of Psychology and Method of Recitation. 
Psychology was taught by Supt. Rogers, and Method by Prof. 
Gortner. The lecture plan was used principally. Much interest 
was awakened in these subjects, which will lead to better pro- 
fessional training of the older teachers of the county. Twenty 
teachers took the examination on this course, having their cer- 
tifieates of last year duplicated and the grades of these subjects 
entered for this year. By this plan, those teachers who comply 
with the requirements may, after two vears’ work in the school 
courses, take up higher courses of study, and thus from year to 
year prepare themselves for better service in higher positions. 
Those teachers who had passed a satisfactory examination in 
the Primary Course Jast year were admitted to the Secondary. 
Profs. Hixson and Ziegler had charge of the work in this depart- 
ment. Only five teachers took the examination in this course, all 
making the required average for a certificate. 
Thirty-one pursued the Primary Course. It is important that 
every teacher should have a thorough knowledge of the primary 
subjects before taking up a higher course, and all of the instruct- 
ors, having some work in this department, endeavored to lead the 
teachers to a broader view of their respective studies and to a 
more thorough knowledge of those subjects which were pre- 
sented, rather than to prepare them solely for the examination. 
Of the 31 who entered the examination on this course, only 21 
made the average required by law for a certificate. The system 
of numbers was used in this examination, and no examiner knew 
at any time whose papers he was examining. Each examiner 
was held responsible for the work of his own subject. Every 
effort was made by the examiners to secure impartiality and fair- 
ness in the examination. 
It is needless to say that the standard has been raised to comply 
with a resolution passed by the teachers some time ago. Those 
who failed did splendidly, and no doubt would have passed most 
of the examinations given in this county in the past. The present 
demands a better teacher than ever before, and while an examina- 
tion is not a perfect guide, it is the best we have.

The teachers are offered two courses of study for the ensuing 
year—one in English Literature, with Prof. 8. A. Gortner as 
instructor, and one in Psychology, with Supt. Rogers as in- 
structor. These courses were adopted by the teachers, and special 
courtesy will be given those teachers who have the required 
grades and who pursue these courses, in the annual examination 
next year. W. E. ROGERS, Superintendent.

ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
Our institutes—white and colored—-opened on June 3 and 
continued for 11 days, with three days’ examinations. 
That prince of institute conductors, Dr. Gilbreath, and Mrs. 
Ransom, did most of the work, assisted by Prof. Huey W. J. 
Prichard, J. W. Green, W. O. Cranor, J. M. Keller, and L. T. 
Dowell. 
This was the largest, most regularly attended institute ever 
held in this county. Dr. Gilbreath is a strong man and very 
popular with the teachers. Mrs. Ransom was sent to us by Supt. 
Fitzpatrick—the only State aid this county has received in a 
number of years. She is certainly the right woman in the right 
place. She did most excellent work here. 
This was my seventh annual institute, and I can truly say the 
attendance, interest, and work done were much better than ever 
before. 
Of the 98 examined in the primary class, only about 66 per 
cent. were licensed. We are gradually raising the standard of 
qualification. Over fifty per cent. of the applicants in the colored 
Institute were refused certificates. 
‘We have organized a teachers’ library of 50 members, and 
have funds collected to supply books. 
We are doing fairly well; and yet, we should do better.

RUTHERFORD COUNTY. 
The Rutherford County Annual Teachers’ Institute was a 
most successful meeting of teachers. It was attended by almost 
the full membership, and more than the usual amount of interest 
was manifested. The class exercises, lectures, discussions and 
other features were at all times full of animation and force. 
This was the first annual meeting under the management of 
Supt. Todd, and he impressed the fact upon the teachers that he 
understands his work well and has executive ability to plan and 
Supt. Fitzpatrick sent up Prof. W. A. Link, with the charge 
to “use him.” He proved a most capable man, fitting readily into 
242
-P-A-G-E-261
anything given him, and-found a most cordial response in the 
hearts of the teachers. His work, in whatsoever line given, car- 
ried conviction with it. 
Among those who gave valuable work in the regular course of 
instruction may be mentioned especially Dr. G. M. Savage, Presi- 
dent of the Southwestern Baptist University, Jackson; Prof. 
S. M. Bain, University of Tennessee; Prof. R. A. Taylor, of 
DeKalb County, and Miss Ina Smithson, ex-Superintendent of 
Cannon County. Rev. F. J. Stowe, of Murfreesboro, interested 
the Institute by his work in reading, and his recitations, espe- 
cially his recitation of Poe’s “Bells.” Hon. John E. Richardson 
gave some valuable suggestions on school law as it relates to the 
duties of the teacher. Dr. W. C. Bilbro kindled fresh enthusi- 
asm by his timely remarks on practical physiology, as did Prof. 
FE. TH. Childress in his interesting work on English composition. 
Throughout the week many visitors took advantage of the wel- 
come extended by the teachers, and not a few participated in the 
discussions. Among these latter may he mentioned Prof. A. J. 
Brandon, of Tullahoma; Prof. Garland 8. Moore, president of 
the Bedford County Teachers’ Association, and Prof. A. C. 
Speer, late of Texas. Mach of these made appropriate remarks on 
various occasions. 
The good will and fellowship existing among the teachers 
throughout was really inspiring. At times the discussions be- 
came quite spirited, and conflicting opinions were expressed. All 
was done in the best of brotherly feeling, and not a cord of 
friendship was strained. 
Good music, both vocal and instrumental, was given through- 
out the week. 
The Institute was under the chairmanship of Prof. J. S. Batey, 
Prof. E. C. Cox, of the Murfreesboro schools, was always 
ready to lend a hand or give timely advice or suggestions. 
Miss Emma King as secretary of the Association did her work 
well and faithfully. 
There was not a dull hour during the week. The teachers go to 
their work with deeper realizations of responsibility and with an 
ambition to attain.to nobler and grander things in the future. 
244
-P-A-G-E-262
Over one hundred subscriptions to the Southwestern School 
Journal were taken, thus securing a specially low rate from the 
publishers of that paper. 
All the teachers took the examination except those exempt 
under the school law. 
Prof. Todd hopes for better things from the teachers during 
the ensuing year.

SCOTT COUNTY. 
Our annual Institute was held at Huntsville, beginning June 
24, and closing July 5. 
The Institute was visited by prominent educators from differ- 
ent localities, and all seemed to think that the work being done 
was of high grade. ° 
The Institute was conducted by the County Superintendent 
and Professors Ernest H. Boyd and R. M. Shipp, as principal 
instructors. Their work was efficient in every respect, and our 
teachers go to their work more enthusiastic and better prepared 
by having attended the Institute. I required all teachers 
to attend the full term of the Institute. I think every teacher 
ought to be compelled to attend at least one Institute every year. 
Education in this County is rapidly advancing. You would 
only have to contrast the present conditions with the conditions a 
few years ago to have conclusive proof of this statement. Yet 
there remains a great deal to be done if we stay at the front. 
One thing that I would heartily advocate is that our State 
should take some step toward compulsory education. 
When. parents wilfully keep their children out of school I see 
no reason why the State should not demand the rights of the 
child. 
Our teachers’ meeting was organized with an enrollment of 
96. While we have but 73 white teachers in the county, there 
are a number that are not actively engaged in teaching who are 
deeply interested in educational work and are in regular attend- 
ance at Institutes, teachers’ meetings and other educational 
assemblies. 
A number of the teachers sent out this year are young teach- 
ers, but are all teachers of recognized ability, and the very best 
results are expected. 
Our school term will be about four and one-half months this 
year. .

  SEVIER COUNTY. 
Our Normal Institute began on Sune 8, 1901, and continued 
two weeks. The work was conducted by the County Superin- 
tendent, who was ably assisted by Prof. J. W. Trotter, of the 
Knoxville City Schools, Prof. W. M. Rogers, of Harrison Chil- 
howe Seminary, and Prof. Ketron, of Murphy College. 
The instructors did very earnest work and their efforts were 
247
-P-A-G-E-265
highly appreciated. The instructions were principally on Pri- 
mary Methods and School Management, which were of a very 
helpful nature, and so practical that all teachers were greatly 
benefited because all that was presented could be used in any 
school. 
The teachers were all well pleased with the Institute work, 
and I believe they were inspired to do their very best work this 
year. 
There were 130 teachers enrolled; their attendance and the 
interest they manifested was very gratifying, and I think point 
to great efforts on their part for the advancement of education 
in the county.

SMITH COUNTY. 
Our Institute this year and the examination at the close showed 
plainly that the standard of teachers is being raised. Throughout 
the year the attendance has been good at our monthly teachers’ 
meetings, and during the Institute a large majority entered 
heartily into the discussions of the various branches. 
We believe positively in encouraging and protecting the com- 
petent county teachers of Smith; therefore the rule “not to 
duplicate certificates from other counties” was rigidly adhered to. 
The best of order and the most congenial professional and 
social feelings pervaded the entire Institute, and every ruling by 
both State and County Superintendents was concurred in unani- 
mously, 
The instructors chosen for the Institute did their work nobly. 
Living thoughts, modern tactics, and genuine enthusiasm charac- 
terized all the recitations. 
The teachers of this county have no trouble in securing schools, 
and the salary for their work is getting better. The whole out- 
look is growing brighter.

STEWART COUNTY. 
Greater interest is being manifested in educational matters 
in Stewart County than was ever known before. Teachers, di- 
rectors and patrons are all awake and in live discussions of edu- 
cational problems. Every director in the county made his 
report, and most of them on time. They are making greater 
demands of their teachers, and the teachers are responding 
heartily. Their reports show that during the past year there 
has been an increase in scholastic population of nearly 47 per 
cent. ; in enrollment an increase of 10 per cent. ; and in daily at- 
tendance of 20 per cent. There has also been a great interest in 
250
-P-A-G-E-268
the matter of proper houses and seats. So great has been this 
interest that there has been an increase of 40 per cent. in the 
value of school property in the county during the past year. This 
has been largely from public subscription. Comparatively little 
has been taken from the school fund for improvement. There 
has also been a substantial increase in the teacher’s salary. This, 
however, came only with a better equipped teacher, and the in- 
crease in daily attendance lowered the average cost of tuition per 
pupil 20 per cent.; so that while paying the teachers more the 
real cost per pupil was one-fifth less; sufficient evidence for the 
employment of efficient teachers at an increased salary. 
We held no Institute (county) for white teachers this year. 
The State Peabody Institute at Clarksville was so convenient 
that 90 per cent. of our teachers attended and did excellent 
work. More than 50 per cent. of our teachers hold the same 
positions this year that they held last, and a great many at an 
increased salary. 
We have organized a literary association, each member of 
which pays an annual membership fee of one dollar for the sup- 
port of the library. In addition to this we have our teachers’ 
associatiori, which meets monthly. A system of fines for absence 
or non-performance of duty acts as a spur to those who are in- 
clined to be negligent. Out of 56 licensed teachers more than 
50 are members of this association. The reading furnished by 
our library and the work done in our association is greatly add- 
ing to the efficiency of our teachers, and assisting materially in 
the work of grading our schools by giving our teachers a unity 
of purpose. By the lapse of another year we hope to have a 
smooth and practical system of graded schools. In addition to 
their regular course of study most of our teachers are readers 
of good school journals. 
We have a plan on foot to place libraries in every school as 
soon as we have the various school houses in a condition to care 
for same. This, we believe, will add greatly to the efficiency of 
our schools and render material aid to our teachers. 
On July 1-6, 1901, we held the Institute for colored teachers 
at Dover. We were ably assisted in this by Professors G. K. 
251
-P-A-G-E-269
Grant and G. D. Free.’ Great interest was manifested and a 
permanent organization effected, which meets monthly at vari- 
ous places over the county. 
We have carried out the instructions of the State Superin- 
tendent regarding the time and manner of holding examinations 
and issuing certificates. While it has caused some friction be- 
cause of people’s failure to understand it, we like it and indorse 
it, and believe that all will when they come to understand that it 
works to the best interests of the county. 
We want for the coming year a greater enrollment, better 
attendance, more money for schools and better equipped houses. 
We expect to get these things through the co-operation of County 
Court, teachers, directors and patrons. :

[rnsriTuTE. ] 
As your representative I herewith submit the report of the 
Sullivan County Institute: 
Sullivan County Institute commenced at Blountsville Mon- 
day, July 8, at 10 a. m., and closed Friday, July 20, 1901. 
Superintendent J. E. L. Seneker took the chair and appointed 
Miss Rachel Fain secretary. 
The Rev. Mr. Carson, of Blountville, conducted the religious 
exercises. The work of the Institute was then outlined by 
Prof. R. E. Wolfe and myself. 
The attendance on the Institute was divided between Jones- 
boro and Blountville. This caused a decrease in average attend- 
ance. Superintendent J. E. L. Seneker was active in the work 
of the Institute, striving to make it a success. He introduced 
the following gentlemen, who addressed the teachers with words 
of encouragement and advice: Mr. Trigg M. Thomas, Rev. D. 
Elfiott, Rev. J. M. Hendrickson. 
252
-P-A-G-E-270
Prof. R. E. Wolfe gave valuable assistance in mathematics, 
grammar, reading and geology. 
The work of the instructors was practical. The Institute was 
divided into sections, each section had some allotted work dur- 
ing the session. 
At the close of the Institute the following resolutions were 
adopted: 
“(1.) That we feel very grateful to Hon. Morgan C. Fitz- 
patrick, State Superintendent of Publie Instruction, for mani- 
festing such interest in the teachers of Sullivan County as to 
send a state instructor in the person of R. H. Freeland, who 
gave splendid instruction. 
“(9,) That we extend our sincere gratitude to Superintendent 
Seneker for his honest zeal and untiring energy towards uplift- 
ing the cause of education in Sullivan County ; and be it further 
resolved, That we also thank Mr. R. E. Wolfe for the valuable 
instruction he has ziven us. 
“¢3,) That we extend our thanks to Rev. J. M, Wendrickson 
for rendering aid in singing. 
“(4.) We as a body of teachers pledge our support to the 
Bristol News, which has been adopted as the organ of the Sulli- 
van County teachers, and that we thank the managers of the 
News for the space which they have given for the Normal 
reports. 
“(5.) Vhat we extend to the citizens of the town and com- 
munity our thanks for their generous hospitality and kind en- 
tertainment given us during our stay here. 
“(6.) Be it further resolved, That we extend to Miss Rachel 
Fain our appreciation of her services as secretary.

SULLIVAN COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my ninth report. As usual I have had no 
little trouble getting full and correct data. Many teachers and 
district clerks failed to report on time. 
Our educational affairs are in very satisfactory shape. We 
have this year a good body of teachers. Most of our schools are 
now in session, and the outlook for a successful school year is 
bright. 
Our last Normal Institute was very interesting and profitable. 
Prof. R. H. Freeland, whom you kindly sent to assist us, did 
excellent and quite satisfactory service. Prof. R. E. Wolfe, a 
veteran ex-county superintendent from Virginia, ably assisted 
us. Much praise is also due Miss Rachel Fain for much valu- 
able aid. 
The attendance was not so large as in former years on ac- 
count of many attending the State Normal at Jonesboro. 
J. E. L. SENEKER, Superintendent. 
SUMNER COUNTY. 
At the opening of our annual Institute many citizens of Gal- 
latin were out to welcome the teachers. The address of welcome 
was delivered by Mayor Jas. W. Blackmore and the response by 
the County Superintendent. Short talks were made by citizens, 
after which we had an address from Mayor Jas. M. Head, of 
Nashville, which was very much enjoyed. 
I am familiar with the educational work of this county, 
and I am proud to state that it is gradually improving. It gives 
me great pleasure to say that there was a marked improvement in 
the work and enthusiasm this year. There is a growing demand 
for enterprising, progressive teachers, and I know the directors 
are trying to employ just such teachers. I am trying earnestly 
to carry out to the letter the instructions of the State Super- 
intendent. 
255
-P-A-G-E-273
Our annual Institute continued for two weeks, and was con- 
ducted by Capt. C. S. Douglass. Te was assisted by J. A. Crag- 
wall, who had charge of mathematics; Miss Mary Louise Good- 
win, geography, history, grammar; Miss Jeannie Gloster, pri- 
mary work, and J. V. Chapman, arithmetic. We enrolled 121 
teachers. 
Tuesday, June 18, was set apart for the directors, a great many 
of whom were with us and took part in the exercises. 
The State Superintendent, Hon. Morgan ©. Fitzpatrick, was 
present on Directors’? Day and addressed the teachers and di- 
rectors, who are always glad to welcome him. We feel that our 
success is due in great part to him. 
Onur teachers have regular monthly meetings in different parts 
of the county. They are doing more professional work than ever 
before—taking school journals, attending institutes, both annual 
and monthly, and are teaching better schools. 
The teachers have made a strong effort to grade the schools, 
and it has done a great deal of good. 
The colored teachers had a very successful institute, with about 
thirty in attendance, for two weeks. 
The attendance at our Institute showed that the work was in- 
teresting to the citizens as well as the teachers. 
The Institute was not only of educational value, but it inspired 
the teachers with an earnest professional spirit. 
I am proud to say that our school interests are advancing, and 
that this year we will have better schools than ever before.

The Institute was conducted by the County Superintendent, 
assisted by Prof. Griffin, of Howard Female College, Gallatin. 
Instructors—Miss Della Stroud, of Nashville; Prof. Wilson, of 
Hartsville Masonic Institute; besides other Trousdale County 
teachers. 
The Institute is indebted to Misses Carrie Rodgers, Mamie

Della Stroud to help them in their Institute, and also for his 
presence and a most excellent address on school work. The 
teachers not only attended, but showed their appreciation of the 
benefits to be derived from a good institute by cheerfully per- 
forming all duties required of them by the County Superintend- 
ent and taking an active part all through the Institute.

UNICOI COUNTY. 
The Institute held at Erwin from July 31 to Aug. 2, 1901, 
is said to have been the best in the history of Unicoi County. 
The Erwin Magnet said: “The Teachers’ Institute just held 
258
-P-A-G-E-276
was the most interesting affair of the kind ever held in the 
county.” 
‘We had the largest crowds that ever attended an educational 
meeting here, and the interest continued to the end. The Court 
House could not accommodate the crowds at night. 
Prof. J. T. Pope, A. M., and Mrs. J. T. Pope, A. M., of 
Boone’s Creek Seminary, were the principal instructors. Prof. 
Randolph, of Richmond; ex-Supt. R. W. H. Gilbert, Miss Estell 
Connard, A. M.; Miss Mattie Bullock, B. S.; Miss Lee V. Cole- 
man, B.8.; R. M. Barry, B. S., and a number of others rendered 
invaluable aid in the Institute work and discussions. 
A spirit of unanimity seemed to prevail throughout. While 
the discussions would get lively and interest run high, yet all 
seemed harmony and good feeling. In this respect the meeting 
excelled any I have ever attended. , 
I think our county is coming to the front as fast as her popu- 
lation and wealth will permit, and I am glad to say both are in- 
creasing rapidly.

UNION COUNTY. 
In submitting to you my annual report I wish to say the 
ardent desire for better institutes, thorough work and more 
school money was greatly manifested at our last meeting. 
We are very grateful to the State Superintendent for sending 
Prof. N. C. Gregg, of Cumberland county High School, to assist 
us in our work. His work was of the best. 
The Institute feels indebted to Prof. J. A. Anderson for his 
services as secretary and instructor. 
Our Institute was held at Hill’s Academy, beginning on July 
8, continuing one week. 
I must say the per cent, of attendance was greater than ever 
before. 
A great deal of credit belongs to the executive committee, con- 
sisting of J. M. D. Nelson, J. J. Chesney, Horace Hamie, J. L. 
Henegar and Miss Belle Ousley, for their earnest labors. 
The County Superintendent requested that all teachers sub- 
seribe for some good educational journal. They responded 
cheerfully. 
The Institute was visited by several educators of East Ten- 
nessee. Among the most prominent were Prof. Gill, of Mary- 
ville College; Prof. W. L. Gentry, of Andersonville Institute; 
Prof. G. W. Martor, of Pamel’s Valley Seminary, all of whom 
delivered interesting and instructive addresses.

WARREN COUNTY. 
Our County Teachers’ Institute, held at McMinnville in the 
University building the first week in July, was very successful. 
One hundred and fourteen teachers were enrolled. They at- 
tended regularly and took an active part in the work. 
Prof. W. V. Freiley, of Burritt College, was with us and gave 
261
-P-A-G-E-279
diseussions on Geometry. The rest of the work was done by our 
county teachers. 
Ex-Superintendents E. B. Etter and J. B. Clark were with us 
and gave their aid. Prof. Clark was made chairman of the In- 
stitute. The secretary, Miss Myrtle Reynolds, greatly aided us 
by keeping a perfect record of the Institute work. 
I find that our teachers understand such branches as Geom- 
etry, Algebra and Arithmetic very well, and are not so proficient 
in Orthography, Penmanship and Bookkeeping. 
We, like most all other teachers, need to study literature more, 
and I feel sure that our teachers are going to take great interest 
in this part of the work. 
We have some very able teachers. There are 85 white schools 
in this county. ‘Nearly all the teachers for these schools were 
present and took the examination. 
Permit me to speak of the Warren County Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, which meets monthly in the different sections of the county, 
with the superintendent and teacher in charge as conductors. 
The meetings are growing in attendance and influence. 
We would like to have another State Institute, for the oue you 
gave us did a great deal for the cause of education in the county.

WAYNE COUNTY. 
On Monday, June 24, 1901, at Waynesboro, Prof. E. 8. Brugh 
of Nashville commenced his part of the work in the Wayne 
County Teachers’ Institute. He gave satisfaction, and we were 
glad that State Supt. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick sent a first-class man 
to our county. The teachers were well pleased with Prof. Brugh 
on aceount of his successful management of English grammar, 
United States History, and written arithmetic. These were the 
special branches assigned him, and he entered heartily into the 
diseussion of every subject—not for argument’s sake, but for the 
benefit of the teachers, bringing out the truth all along the line. 
We hope to have Prof. Brugh with us next year. His sound 
263
-P-A-G-E-281
normal instructions will help the teachers in their work this sum- 
mer and cause a better interest to be taken in institute work next 
year. 
Profs. W. Z. Stricklin and Joe Sims were instructors in the 
Institute. They are Wayne County boys, and need no praise 
from me, as all were pleased with their work. They gave satis- 
faction to all concerned, and their instruction will be a help to 
the teachers this summer. 
This year I gave a great deal of the time of the Institute to 
reading and considerable time to orthography. 
The work of the Institute was of a practical nature, showing 
the teachers how to teach by teaching, thus having actual school 
work in the Institute, and not so much of that dry lecture method 
that is more calculated to put one to sleep than to instill into the 
mind the principles of teaching. Such has been the course pur- 
sued by our instructors in the Institute—showing others how to 
teach by teaching them. 
The Institute generally commences in June or July, and this 
is a very busy time with those teachers who are engaged in farm- 
ing. Three months, or even four months, are not enough to 
justify the teacher to give all his time, for so little pay. Our 
school terms are too short. Not enough money. This accounts 
for the tardiness of some teachers, though I can see an interest 
taken, especially since I will not give certificates without an 
examination.

WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
Dear Sir—I take great pleasure in submitting for your consid- 
eration my third annual report of institute work and of the con- 
dition of educational affairs of Weakley County in general. 
The State Peabody Institute’which you located was a marked 
success in every particular. This Institute was well attended by 
teachers from Weakley and all adjoining counties. The faculty 
was composed of able, capable and efficient educators, for whom 
our teachers have the highest personal and professional regard— 
Capt. 8. A. Mynders, of Jackson, Conductor; Supt. R. L. By- 
num, of Union City; Prof. Homer L. Higgs, of Greenfield, and 
W. B. Hale, of Dixon Springs; instructors. Great credit is due 
265
-P-A-G-E-283
the good citizens of Martin for suitable and ample provisions 
which they offered the teachers. Hon. G. E. Bowden and Prof. 
N. E. Estes, Superintendent of the Martin public schools, deserve 
the highest commendation for their efforts in making all neces- 
sary local arrangements for the State Peabody Institute at Mar- 
tin. Your visit to our county during the Institute did much good 
in the advancement of the educational cause. 
As this is the first time you have located a State Peabody In- 
stitute in our midst, we are very desirous that you will give it to 
us again next year. 
As regards the general educational welfare of Weakley 
county, I have this to say: More children attended the public 
schools during the past year than ever before; more teachers sent 
in their monthly and term reports; more directors sent their re- 
ports on time, and in better condition; more teachers attended In- 
stitutes, and these teachers were the only ones who made good 
grades in their examinations. Our teachers are organized into 
what is popularly known as the Weakley County Educational 
Association, of which the following are the officers: Prof. Homer 
L. Higgs is president, and Miss Ida Baxter is secretary and treas- 
urer. Our prospects for better schools, better work and better 
teachers are all brighter than ever before. Yours truly, . 
8. 8. FEATHERSTON, Superintendent. 
WHITE COUNTY. 
On July 20, 1901, we closed one of the most successful insti- 
tutes ever held in the county. The attendance was large, and the 
interest was good during the whole meeting. 
At the close of the Institute the teachers by unanimous vote 
adopted resolutions expressive of their thanks to the State Super- 
intendent for sending us Miss Katie A. Monohan, whose work 
was eminently satisfactory and whose charming personality add- 
ed much to the Institute. We hope she will be sent here again. 
266
-P-A-G-E-284
Last year I provided that all teachers who made an average of 
90 per cent. and did not fall below 70 per cent. on any subject 
in the regular examination would be given a course of prescribed 
yeading instead of the regular examination this year. Quite a 
number of teachers made the required percentage, and I have 
found the plan so satisfactory that I have announced another 
reading course on the same conditions for the coming year. 
So many of our teachers hold State Certificates from the 
Cookeville Institute that there were not nearly so many teachers 
in the county examination this year as there have been usually. 
Our teachers are very anxious that one of the State institutes be 
held in White County next year. 
Our Teachers’ Library was destroyed by fire recently, but dur- 
ing the Institute we effected a reorganization by which we expect 
to replace the library and make it much better than it was.

WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
T am glad to report that our school term is gradually lengthen- 
ing, and that the pay to the County Superintendent and to 
teachers is increasing. 
While the grade of instruction is not all it should be, yet it 
is improving and tha enrollment and average attendance are 
better year by year. 
The directors allow the teachers one day each year to visit 
schools, and I find it is very helpful to them. 
The teachers take a lively interest in all kinds of teachers’ 
meetings. Last January a large number attended the Public 
School Officers’ Association in Nashville, and forty-five attended 
the State Peabody Institute at Columbia June 17 to July 12. 
The Williamson County Teachers’ and Library Association 
meets monthly, and is doing excellent work. I am giving the 
subject of distriet libraries considerable time, and I hope to 
make this feature a success. I also meet the colored teachers in 
their monthly meetings. This is well attended by them and is 
accomplishing great good. The teachers of my county, white 
and colored, are studious and manifest a deep interest in every- 
thing pertaining to their work.

The annual Institute for white teachers was conducted by me 
at the public school building in Franklan during the week begin- 
ning July 15, 1901. I was assisted by Superintendent L. S. 
London, Bristol, Tenn., and by the following instructors of my 
county: Professors Thos. E. Clay, W. S. Renick, E. S. Jenkins. 
J. W. Neal, T. I. Pettus, FE. R. Chest, and Misses Mary Reams 
and Margaret McElroy, all of whom did good work. Prof Lon- 
don is a most interesting talker and a practical school man, and 
his lectures were highly appreciated. The teachers were prompt 
and regular in their attendance and much good was accom- 
plished. Five days were given to lectures, and the examinations 
were held from 2 to 5 o’clock on Thursday and Friday and dur- 
ing the full day Saturday.

WILSON COUNTY. 
The Wilson County Teachers’ Institute for white teachers was 
held in the L. C. Y. L. at Lebanon beginning June 24, 1901, and 
continuing ten days. Ninety-three teachers were enrolled, and 
we had good attendance throughout the entire time. 
We employed as our instructors Miss Maud Terrill, of Dech- 
erd; Prof. A. J. Brandon, of Wartrace, and Prof. J. H. Sykes, 
of Nashville. These all did most excellent work, which met the 
approval of all the teachers. 
Miss Jeannie S. Gloster, of the Gallatin public schools, was 
furnished by the State Superintendent, and we can truthfully 
say of her work that it was good, and to show our appreciation 
of her we would say to the State Superintendent, “We would be 
pleased to have you send her to us again next year.” 
The State Superintendent visited us July 1 and delivered a 
most excellent address. 
On July 4 Representative A. A. Adams visited us while in 
session and favored us with a very fine address. 
Our motto in Wilson is “Onward and Upward.”

was about 20. 
The teachers seemed to take a good deal of interest, but there 
is still room for improvement. 
The last two days were spent in examinations. Thirty-seven 
took the examination and 34 made satisfactory grades. I have 
issued 80 primary and four secondary certificates. Those who 
attend the Institutes and take the most interest in the work are 
the most suecessful.

CHESTER COUNTY. 
The Institute for colored teachers was held in Henderson 
July 1-6, closing with written examination. 
Twenty-two teachers were enrolled and the work was very 
profitable and interesting. 
This was the third Institute of the kind ever held in the 
county. The teachers are improving and J attribute much of 
the progress to our Institute work. They have organized a col- 
ored Teachers’ Association, which meets several times during 
the year. I predict for them marked success if they continue 
to improve in the future as they have in the past year. 
I am very highly pleased with the work of the schools, both 
white and colored during the year. Directors are more cogni- 
zant of their duty, parents are co-operating with the teachers 
for the upbuilding of the schools, and the teachers are active in 
their work, and rank among the best in the State.

COCKE COUNTY. 
In connection with our Normal Institute we also conducted 
one for the colored applicants. While the number is compara- 
tively small much interest was manifested. The instructors 
were able and took especial interest in devoting the four days’ 
work to the benefit of the colored schools. The corps of colored 
teachers in Cocke County is the best we have ever had.

CROCKETT COUNTY. 
The Colored Institute for Crockett county convened at the 
colored school house, one mile south of Alamo, on July 1, 1901, 
and continued one week. The teachers were prompt in attend- 
ance and seemed anxious to profit by the week’s work. 
The County Superintendent was present and conducted the 
exercises on the first day. He was called away by telephone and 
did not return until Saturday morning. The Institute work 
was left in charge of J. M. D. Brown, to be assisted by J. H. 
Roberts. These are first-class colored teachers, with experience 
in Institute work. The Institute did well under their manage- 
ment until Friday morning, when the examinations began. 
Perey McDonald took charge of the examination, which con- 
tinued until Saturday evening. The County Superintendent 
returned Saturday morning and assisted in the work until it 
was finished. Several colored teachers from other counties at- 
tended this Institute.

Report of the Annual Institute for colored teachers, located 
at Decaturville, Tenn., in Decatur County. 
The Colored Institute was conducted principally by Profs. 
D. V. Bohannon of Henderson and J. A. Harmon of Lexington. 
The attendance was very good and quite an interest was mani- 
fested by the colored people in general. 
I am satisfied good work was done, and that their idea of 
education has been raised to a higher plane.

DEKALB COUNTY. 
Prof. T. H. Elliott (col.), conducted the Institute, assisted 
by Prof. W. H. Slaughter (col.), both from the Central Ten- 
nessee College. 
The colored teachers of this county are using all the means at 
hand to educate themselves. 
There are only ten colored schools in this county, so there 
were few in attendance, but they did satisfactory work, and on 
examination only one failed to make the grade required by law.

GIBSON COUNTY. 
I herewith submit my report for the Gibson County Colored 
Teachers’ Institute: 
The Institute was well attended and much good was accom- 
plished for the teachers and their schools. The Institute opened 
and closed at the same time as the white. 
The Institute was under the direction of the following teach- 
ers, selected for their ability in conducting an Institute: Prof. 
T. M. Stigall; of Humboldt; Prof. Geo. F. Porter, of Trenton, 
and Prof. A. J. Collins, of Milan. 
This year our work was devoted entirely to the primary 
branches, there being great need of some genuine good work 
along this line, and there being only a few secondary colored 
schools in the county. Our teachers did good work, and in the 
examinations made better grades than last year. 
Prof. J. F. Booker, of Union City, and Dr. Key, of Trenton, 
rendered the Institute very valuable service in the way of in- 
struction, lectures on methods of teaching, and school of hygiene 
and sanitation. 
The County Superintendent made several practical talks on 
school law and the theory and practice of teaching. 
Teachers in both the white and colored institutes were urged 
to have written contracts and to promptly make all monthly and 
term reports to the proper authorities. 
We think our colored teachers are getting on a higher moral 
and intellectual plane.

RHEA COUNTY. 
The Institute for the colored teachers was very successful this 
year. Two of their best qualified teachers were selected as in- 
structors, and outlines of the work which each was to cover in 
his respective subjects were given them before the Institute met, 
that they might be well prepared for the work. 
When the teachers assembled on the first day, an organization 
was effected by the election of the usual officers, and the ap- 
pointment of committees. While I attended each session and in 
a general way directed the work, the actual work of the Institute 
was done by colored teachers. 
The teachers manifested great interest in the work, were 
regular and prompt in their attendance, earnest and active in 
their work. 
Our colored teachers have a reading course, and conduct 
monthly institutes which are very interesting, and profitable to 
them in their school work.

RUTHERFORD COUNTY. 
The Rutherford County Colored Teachers’ Institute, under the 
management of the County Superintendent, convened at Brad- 
ley’s Academy, Murfreesboro, June 10, 1901, and continued 
until June 16, 1901. The sessions began cach day at 8 a. m. and 
closed at 3 p. m. 
This was one of the best (if not the best) institutes ever held in 
Rutherford County for the benefit of colored teachers. Local 
talent was employed for regular routine business (as instructors), 
and daily lectures were given by some of the best white edu- 
cators in the county. 
Rey. C. R. Johnson, pastor of the First Baptist Church, Mur- 
freesboro, visited the Institute on Wednesday and delivered a 
lecture on “The Negro Teacher,” which certainly aroused the 
teachers to a sense of their responsibility. 
Prof. A. L. Todd was elected County Superintendent last Jan- 
uary, and we as teachers are proud of him and feel that education 
in Rutherford County will soon take on a different aspect.

We have three colored schools in the county. They are small 
and do not last more than 75 days, usually not more than 60 days. 
The colored teachers are of fair ability and some experience, 
and the outlook for the year is promising.

The County Institute for colored teachers of Stewart county 
met in the colored school house in Dover, July 1, 1901, and 
continued in session six days; examinations the last two days. 
The Institute was conducted by the county superintendent, 
assisted by Profs. Grant and Free. A live interest and close 
attention to work were marked characteristics of the Institute. 
At the close of the Institute the teachers organized for a monthly 
teachers’ meeting, to meet at various places over the county 
throughout the year.

  TROUSDALE COUNTY. 
The tenth annual Institute for colored teachers of Trousdale 
County convened at Hartsville. It was conducted by R. R. Burn- 
ley, assisted by J. E. Mitchell, the leading teachers of the county. 
There were in attendance 29 teachers, 11 of whom took the ex- 
amination and passed. In every exercise there was enthusiasm 
and interest manifested by the teachers. Our teachers are rap- 
idly going to the front. Our conductor, an educator of 25 years’ 
experience, says the work shows a wonderful improvement. The 
teachers are reading educational journals and studying up-to- 
date methods of teaching. The daily work was lessons in the 
best methods of teaching the new text-books, supplemented by 
school government and theory and practice. Prof. Dalton, 
County Superintendent, visited the Institute, accompanied by 
297
-P-A-G-E-315
Prof. Wilson. These gentlemen made interesting and profitable 
addresses along the line of educational work. The colored man’s 
friend, Col. W. J. Hale, who always takes an interest in the 
colored people’s advancement, visited us and delivered an address 
that will always be remembered by the teachers and patrons who 
heard it. 
WARREN COUNTY.

WAYNE COUNTY. 
The colored people have been accustomed to get certificates 
without an examination. I have put a stop to it, and I think 
more will be at the Institute next year. Just nine regular col- 
ored schools in the county, though the largest public school is a 
eolored one—205 pupils or children enrolled between the ages 
of 6 and 21. 
The instructors were well up and gave good instruction, and 
for the few there was a good Institute.

WEAKLEY COUNTY. 
The Institute for colored teachers convened at Martin June 
24 and continued one week. This Institute was well attended 
and did good work throughout. The conductor, Prof. J. W. 
Johnson, is one among the ablest colored teachers in the State. 
His work was of the highest grade and he has the honor of having 
at one time been engaged to work in the State Peabody Institute 
for colored teachers. Profs. Daniels and Dobbs did excellent 
work. The work done in this Institute will be felt and its im- 
portance more fully realized in the schools in which those who 
attended teach. Our colored teachers are noted for their prompt- 
ness, regular attendance upon Institutes and the high degree of 
enthusiasm which they manifest in their work. 
Profs. Mynders, Higgs and Bynum each delivered lectures to 
the colored teachers. Our colored schools are much improved, 
and the outlook is very promising.

WILLIAMSON COUNTY. 
The annual Institute for colored teachers was conducted by 
me at the same time as the Institute for white teachers, but in a 
separate building. Supt. London lectured to them each day, 
and in addition the following of their own teachers were in- 
structors: Profs. W. F. Reynolds, Major Boyd, J. M. Windrow, 
J. D. Steele; Misses Carrie Otey and Mary Williams. The in- 
struction was eminently satisfactory. The examinations were 
held at the same time as those for the white teachers, and the 
same questions were used. As we have no secondary colored 
schools, the lectures and examinations were confined to the pri- 
mary course:

"REPORTS FROM STATE INSTITUTIONS, 
PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
Sir—I have the honor to submit to you my report as president 
of the Peabody Normal College for the period which has elapsed 
since my last report to the expiration of the session which closed 
May 29, 1901. 
Tomorrow my connection with the college will cease. Having 
been recalled to the Chair of the Science and Art of Teaching in 
the University of Michigan, I have tendered my resignation as 
President of the Peabody Normal College and Chancellor of the 
University of Nashville, which has been accepted, to take effect 
June 1, 1901. 
In thus severing my connection with the Peabody Normal 
College, to which I have devoted so many of the best years of my 
life, I return my heartfelt thanks to the honorable State Board 
of Education of Tennessee, and personally to the honorable State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, for the efficient support 
which they have extended to me in the discharge of my duties. 
The cordial co-operation of the three Boards of Trust has been 
to me a source of gratification and strength through my entire 
administration, and has enabled me to accomplish resulis which 
afford me, in retiring, the most lively satisfaction. 
When I entered upon office in 1887 the total enrollment of 
students amounted to 177, which has increased to 607 in 1901. 
The steady increase in numbers may be traced in the tabular 
statement hereunto annexed as a part of this report and marked 
“Exhibit A.” 
During the same period the curriculum of study has been 
much enlarged, and the number of professors correspondingly in- 
creased. The grounds have been improved, and additional build- 
ings have been added. 
The school year just closed has been a year of prosperity, har- 
mony, and satisfactory results. The total enrollment of students 
306 ‘
-P-A-G-E-324
was'607; of this number, 168 were graduated on commencement 
day; May 29. : 
~The following analysis of the students enrolled shows the sex 
and average age of the students, and the occupation of parents: 
The number of men is 232; the number of women 375. ‘The 
average age is 21 years. 
The percentage of students whose parents are farmers is aq. 55 
merchants, 18; mechanics, 2.3; physicians, 6.8; lawyers, 4.3; 
ministers, 8.9; teachers, 2.7; miscellaneous, 19.5. 
It is a source of the deepest gratification to bear testimony to 
the high character of the entire student body. A more moral, 
earnest, intelligent, and decorous body of students was never 
assembled in any institution of learning. The recollection of the 
exemplary conduct of these students will always be to me a cher- 
ished memory. 
In my last report I called attention to the improvements on 1 the 
grounds and buildings which were made during the summer 
vaedtion by the regular employes of the college, thus saving all 
expense except the cost of materials. The same policy will be 
continued during the coming vacation under the efficient super- 
vision of the secretary, John M. Bass. It is contemplated, among 
other improvements, to fit up an additional lecture room espe- 
cially adapted to the use of the class in chemistry. 
During the year Hon. J. L. M. Curry and Hon. James D. 
Porter, of the Peabody Board of Trust, accompanied by the Gov- 
ernor of Tennessee and other distinguished visitors, honored the 
college with their presence on the occasion of the presentation’ of 
the portraits of Doctor Barnas Sears and Hon.. William M. 
Evarts. On this occasion both representatives of the Peabody 
Board made expressions which justify the hope that that Board 
will adopt measures at its next meeting whichwill largely in- 
crease its generous appropriations to the next college. 
1. The’Peabody Normal College, with the Winthrop Model 
- The Joint Committee of the General Assembly visited the in- 
stitution in March, 1901. An extract from the report of this 
Committee, marked “Exhibit B,” is hereunto appended; includ- 
ing all :that relates to the Peabody Normal College. 
307
-P-A-G-E-325
In addition to the official visit of the investigating committee, 
the college was honored by personal visits of members of the 
General Assembly, the State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion, and the Governor of the State. 
There have been a few changes in the corps of instructors since 
my last report: 
The vacancy in the Department of Greek caused by the resig- 
nation of Prof. E. C. Huntington, was filled by the appointment 
of Dr. Campbell Bonner, of Nashville, during whose absence in 
Europe the place was filled by the temporary appointment of 
Dr. Adolphus Brodbeck. Prof. Bonner is expected to enter upon 
his duties at the beginning of the next session. 
The vacancy in the Department of Art has been filled by the 
appointment of Miss Minnie Gattinger, of Nashville; and the 
vacancy in the office of librarian by the appointment of Miss 
Jennie Lauderdale, of Dyersburg, formerly the efficient librarian 
of the Tennessee State Library. 
Miss Dorcas Merriman, of Massachusetts, has been appointed 
to fill the vacancy in the Department of Physical Culture, and 
Prof. Felix R. R. Smith, of Nashville, has been appointed in- 
structor of the newly-organized class in surveying. 
I cannot close this report without testifying my gratitude to 
my associates in the work of instruction and government. Dur- 
ing my active administration it has been to me a source of pain 
that the resources at my command were inadequate to afford ‘just 
remuneration to instructors of such eminent ability and skill ° 
and who have rendered such patient and faithful service. I sin- 
cerely hope that the means may be found to reward them in the 
future with salaries commensurate with their merits and equal to 
the salaries paid instructors in institutions of similar grade. 
It is a source of gratification to me to know that the control of 
the college will be in the hands of your distinguished fellow- 
citizen, Hon. James D. Porter, of the Peabody Board, who has 
been appointed acting chancellor until permanent arrangements 
shali be made. 
Respectfully submitted, 
WILLIAM H. PAYNE, President.

UNIV ERSITY OF NASHVILLE. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit to you my report as Chan- 
cellor of the University of Nashville for the year ending May 
30th, . 1901. 
As is known to you, this Institution—first as Davidson Acad- 
emy, next as Cumberland College, and finally under its present 
charter—has been an important factor in the educational devel- 
opment not only of Tennessee but of the whole southwest; and, 
until its faculty and students were scattered and its doors closed 
by the war of 1861, it yearly sent its alumni to all parts of the 
South.. For the past twenty-five years the Trustees of the Uni- 
versity have, by giving much of its available income, and 
grounds and buildings, aided the State and the Peabody Board 
in carrying out the purposes of Mr. George Peabody’s great gift 
to the South. 
With this view the Trustees many years ago by resolution 
turned over the grounds and buildings to the Peabody Board to 
be held by it as long as it-maintained there the Peabody College 
or other similar school; and, in addition, obtained legislative au- 
thority in an “enabling act” to make this disposition of the prop- 
erty permanent. While this has been done at the expense of 
other University departments which otherwise might have been 
successfully organizd and maintained, the wisdom of the sacri- 
fice has long been evident in the success of the one department 
to which the Trustees have more particularly dedicated their 
property and directed their efforts. 
The University as now organized consists of the following de- 
partments: 
1. The Peabody Normal College, with the Winthrop Model 
School, which it controls and conducts for observation purposes. 
2, The Medical College. 
8. The Montgomery Bell Academy. 
1. In my report to you as President of the Peabody Normal 
College I have sought to furnish full information relating to that 
school; especially as it is the only department of the University 
which is in receipt of appropriations from the State; and you are 
respectfully referred to that report. 
310
-P-A-G-E-328
2. The Medical College was founded in 1850 with a faculty 
of seven professors, and—excepting during four years—has 
from the beginning enjoyed a career of uninterrupted prosper- 
ity; and there are only two older medical colleges in the South. 
During this time forty-three hundred and sixty-nine physicians 
have received their diplomas here, many of whom have become 
distinguished practitioners and teachers of medicine. Since 
1895 the department has occupied a building erected for it by 
the Trustees of the University on Market Street two blocks from 
the City Hospital, containing lecture halls, laboratories and 
every modern requisite for successful instruction. The present 
laws of the State giving to medical colleges in certain eases un- 
claimed cadavers give good facilities for thorough instruction in 
anatomy, and the policy of the authorities of the City of Nash- 
ville in admitting medical students to the City Hospital affords 
ample opportunity for clinical observation. Much attention is 
given to work in the laboratories, since the practice of medicine 
in all its branches should be based upon a thorough preliminary 
training in the medical sciences. 
The faculty consists of three officers, fourteen professors, five 
laboratory directors and eight assistants 
The methods of instruction include: (1), Didactic lectures ; 
(2), Demonstrations; (3), Recitations; (4), Laboratory exer- 
cises; (5), Hospital and Dispensary Clinics. 
The curriculum includes Physics, Chemistry, Histology, 
Anatomy, Physiology; Materia Medica, Pharmacologyy, Thera- 
peutics, Pharmacy, Bacteriology, Pathology, Practice of Medi- 
cine, Surgery, Diseases of the Eye, Ear, Throat and Nose, 
Genito-Urinary Diseases, Obstetrics, Diseases of Children, Gyn- 
ecology, Nervous Diseases, Hygiene, Medical Jurisprudence. 
The Laboratory courses are: (1) Chemistry, (2), Histology, 
(8) Anatomy, (4) Physiology, (5) Bacteriology, (6) Path- 
ology, (7) Operative Surgery. 
The clinical facilities consist of twelve hours per week of 
practical observation in the Nashville City Hospital and the 
College Free Dispensary. 
The session commences the first week in October, continues 
311
-P-A-G-E-329
twenty-six weeks and ends the first week in April. During the 
session of 1900-01 there were sixty-six graduates and one hun- 
dred and ninety-two matriculates. 
The course is graded and covers four years. Women are 
admitted. 
_ 8. The Montgomery Bell School is the Academie Depart- 
ment of the University and was founded by a bequest of Mont- 
gomery Bell for the gratuitous education of boys who are unable 
to educate themselves. 
The Academy has a Grammar department with three years 
of study; and a High School department with a four years’ 
course. The latter has three distinct courses: Classical, Latin- 
Scientific, and a Business Course. 
The Academy is well equipped for elementary instruction in 
the sciences, has sufficient apparatus to illustrate all the subjects 
embraced in the text-books used; a chemical laboratory ; a large 
collection of minerals and geological specimens, and a well- 
selected library. Particular attention is paid to elocution, and 
public contests are held in this course every winter. More than 
eighteen hundred pupils have attended the Academy since its 
organization in 1867, and as only the interest derived from 
Mr. Bell’s bequest is used in the maintenance of the school, it 
may safely be classed among the permanent institutions of learn- 
ing in the State and one which promises to be productive of 
great good. 
Very respectfully submitted, 
WILLIAM H. PAYNE, Chancellor. 
UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE. 
The University comprises the following institutions: 
I. The College of Agriculture and Mechanic “ts with 
the following departments :

State Scholarships. 
For several years past the Board of Trustees has generously 
extended. free tuition to all Tennessee students who have proved 
qualified; but it has become necessary to restrict the state 
scholarships, and the Board instructed the president with the 
beginning of the present session to limit them to the number 
The law also provides that each Sena- 
314
-P-A-G-E-332
tor shall be entitled to make two, and each representative to make 
three, appointments, and that after the 10th of August, the 
president shall fill all vacancies then existing. There are now 
33 senators and 99 representatives, and if each legislator issues 
the full number of appointments to which he is entitled, the 
total number of appointments made would be 363 instead of 
275, the limit fixed by law. This discrepancy in the law, and 
the fact that a large number of students who entered when free 
tuition was granted to all qualified Tennessee students had to 
be provided for, have made it impossible to keep the number of 
scholarships for the present session within the limit fixed by 
law. The appointments made thus far for the current session 
are as follows: 
Senators... 0... ccc cee eee cee tees 48 
Representatives... 0... ce eee 175 
President ... 0... ccc eee ee nee eee 118

Of this number 291 have been issued to white students and 
50 to colored. ‘Two hundred and seventy-eight, 230 white and 
48 colored, state appointees have already entered the University, 
and a considerable number of others will enter at the opening 
of the second term. Respectfully submitted, 
CHAS. W. DABNEY, President. 
TENNESSEE DEAF AND DUMB SCHOOL. 
Sir:—In former reports for the Tennessee Deaf. and Dumb 
School which I have had the honor of presenting to your depart- 
ment, I have given in some detail the history of the school, to- 
gether with the aim and scope of its work. I have also taken 
advantage of the opportunity thus offered to call the attention 
of the public school teachers of Tennessee to the pitiable condi- 
tion of the uneducated, untrained deaf mutes of our common- 
315
-P-A-G-E-333
wealth, at the same time bringing to their notice the: general 
provision by the State for the education of this class of her 
helpless children, and their consequent elevation in the scale of 
humanity and good citizenship ; and I am pleased to believe that 
the information thus disseminated and the appeals thus made: 
have not been fruitless, but have awakened interest in the school : 
and brought its work to the attention of friends of the deaf who 
would otherwise have had no knowledge of its existence. 
I would again ask every teacher in the state who has knowl 
edge of an uneducated deaf child to report the fact to the school 
and thus aid in the extension of its benefactions and in the at- 
tainment of the high purpose of its establishment and mainte- 
nance—the éducation and training of every deaf child in Ten- 
nessee, so far as possible. 
The following explanation and statement of conditions of 
admission of pupils may apprpriately be inserted here: 
1. The methods of instruction are adapted to children who, 
because of deafness, cannot be educated in ordinary schools for 
hearing children. 
Proper subjects for the school may be either children who 
were born deaf or those who lost their hearing in infancy and, 
hence, are dumb as well as deaf; or they may be children whose 
hearing was lost or impaired after learning to speak, having 
retained the speech of earlier childhood, but having become too 
deaf to be educated in the public schools. Children who hear 
perfectly, but cannot talk, are not proper subjects for admission. 
2. Applicants must be of sound mind and body, so as to be 
capable of being educated. 
3. The age of admission is eight years. The character and 
habits of applicants over twelve years of age will be inquired 
into, and those of confirmed vicious habits and those who cannot 
reasonably be expected to conform to the rules of the school, 
will not be admitted. 
4. Pupils are admitted for the entire session of forty weeks, 
from September to June, and they are expected to spend the 
summer vacation at home. 
5. Parents or friends are expected to pay railroad fare and 
316
-P-A-G-E-334
to clothe pupils. In case of inability to do this they will be as- 
sisted to the extent necessary, on proper presentation of the facts. 
6. Tuition, board, washing, books and necessary medical 
attendance and medicines are provided free by the school for 
all eligible pupils, as above, who are residents of the state. 
Application for admission and for further information should 
be made to the principal. In writing, give age, name, color and 
residence of child, also address of parent or guardian. 
For the scholastic year just closed I have to report a year 
of remarkably good health among the pupils, and the attain- 
ment of good results in school work. 
The attendance for the year 1900-01 was 236—204 in the 
white department and 32 in the colored department—every sec- 
tion of the state and almost every county being represented. 
The two departments of the school are situated in different 
sections of the city, but are under the supervision of the same 
general officers and one Board of Trustees. 
The majority of the pupils were taught by what is known as 
the manual method—the manual alphabet, signs and writing 
being used in the class-rooms of these pupils. 
The oral method was used with those pupils who seemed most 
capable of being benefited by this method and of attaining pro- 
ficiency therein—the means employed being speech by pupils 
and teachers, lip-reading and writing. 
Physical culture was systematically taught throughout the 
yedr, in a well-equipped gymnasium, with very satisfactory re- 
sults upon the health, bearing and morale of the pupils. 
A commodious and well-appointed hospital building was com- 
pleted during the year. Fortunately there was but little use 
tor it. 
The boys had daily instruction and practice in printing, shoe- 
making, carpentry, dairy-work, ete., and the girls had training 
in nearly every department of woman’s work. 
There was marked progress along all lines and a general man- 
ifestation on the part of pupils of the spirit of: industry, faith- 
fulness and intelligence, which argues well for their future pros- 
pects as worthy and self-supporting citizens.

The totalexpenditures for all purposes for the-year ending 
June 30, 1901, were $40,024.07 (forty thousand and twenty- 
four dollars and seven cénts). Very respectfully, 
THOMAS L. MOSES, Principal. 
TENNESSEE SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit to you the annual report of 
the ‘Tennessee School for the Blind for the year ending June 
6, 1901. 
Another year, the brightest and best of all her sisters, has been 
added to the life of the school. It is like a golden bead dropped 
trom ‘the rosary of time into the abyss of eternity. The day 
or the year which has been well spent leaves behind it the fulfill- 
ment of a prayer, the-halo of a benediction. The session 
opened with fairer prospects than ever before. We confidently 
expected a successful year, and we were not disappointed. Our 
enrollment reached 242—white, 199 ; colored 43—against a total 
of 180 last year. School opened on September 1st with a large 
attendance. Teachers and pupils fell easily into their places. 
Classes were soon organized and the usual routine work pro- 
ceeded with little interruption to the end of the session. Quar- 
terly examinations were held with excellent results, and the 
final examination crowned the labor of the year with credit to 
pupils and with honor to their instructors, whose zeal and 
earnestness I have seldom seen’ equalled and never surpassed. 
‘In the report of the Trustees and Superintendent to his ex- 
cellency, Governor McMillin, and the General Assembly, it was 
stated that, owing to the crowded condition of the school, addi- 
tional room was absolutely nevessary, and to make this’ addi- 
tional room and to pay for the Colored Blind School, $49,780 
was required. “Every member of the Committee on Charities 
without exception realized our need and warmly recommended 
the appropriation of the amount asked for. But, owing to the 
fact that all state institutions’ required larger appropriations, 
818
-P-A-G-E-336
it was feared that there would not be enough money to go round. 
We, however, received seventeen thousand ($17,000) dollars 
for improvements and buildings. Thompson, Gibel & Asmus, 
architects, drew up specifications and advertised for proposals. 
The corner stone of the new building was laid June 4, by the 
Ancient Order of Free Masons, with their beautiful and im- 
pressive ceremony. The exercises were opened with an ad- 
dress by Judge East, followed by prayer by the Grand Chaplain, 
Dr. Lansing Burrows. Hon. W. 8. Anderson, representative 
to the Fifty-first General Assembly from Hickman county, made 
a very interesting speech. Then Mayor Head was introduced 
as the orator of the cecasion and spoke with his usual force and 
eloquence. The children were arranged on the grassy slope be- 
fore the stand and sang hymns and anthems suited to the cere- 
mony. The band, at the beginning and close of the exercises. 
played several stirring selections. 
On the 15th of January I was notified that a report of the 
condition of the school was expected by the State Teachers’ 
Association. I called upon the Secretary of the Association 
and arranged for an exhibition by some of our pupils of the work 
done at the school. At the time appointed, six children and 
two teachers appeared before the Association at the Assembly 
Hall, Tulane Hotel. The room was filled to its utmost capacity ; 
the greatest interest was shown in the performance, for it was a 
revelation to most of those present. After the children read 
some extracts, they were examined on maps of Tennessee and 
of the world, also on the globe. The outlines of states were 
drawn upon cushions, problems in arithmetic and algebra were 
worked on boards with movable characters. “Many of the mem- 
bers participated in the examinations and all were astonished 
at what they beheld. I addressed the body, explained the mode 
of teaching, gave a sketch of the history and progress of the 
school'and a statement: of its present condition, and requested 
every member to report the name of any blind child that they . 
might find in the neighborhood of their schools. >One hundred - 
whisk brooms were distributed among the members 4s specimens 
_wf the work. done. and also to serve as a reminder of the blind 
— 819
-P-A-G-E-337
whenever they were used. Through Hon. Morgan Fitzpatrick, 
Prof. Bayer of Cumberland City requested that an exhibition 
by two.or three pupils of the work of the school be given before 
his students. I complied with his request and sent Miss Bailey 
with four children. They were treated royally and a number 
of citizens as well as the students were highly interested and 
deeply impressed by the training and proficiency of our pupils. 
The:following are extracts from letters from Prof. Bayer: 
“Cumberland City, Tenn., March 16, 1901. 
“Supt. Morgan C. Fitzpatrick, Nashville, Tenn.: 
‘Dear Sir: While attending the State School Officers’ Asso- 
ication at Nashville last January, we were so deeply impressed 
with the work done by the blind children that we have thought — 
ever since that it would be worth much to our school to have one 
or two of these to appear before our students if we could make the 
arrangements. I would be glad to pay the expenses of one or 
two of these and promise them the very best of attention if we 
can get the consent of Prof. Armstrong to let them come.. I 
write to you because I am not personally acquainted with Mr. - 
Armstrong nor does he know anything of me. If such an 
arrangement could be made, I would be glad if you would speak 
to Prof. Armstrong in our behalf and assist us in securing one 
or two to come to our school in order that we may see how well 
they are trained and what they can do. Please advise us in 
regard to this and greatly oblige.” 
“April 24, 1901. 
“Please accept thanks for the kindness shown our institution 
by the recent. visit of a portion of your school. The results were 
all that we could wish for and will be long felt and result in good 
to both you and us. The pupils were as ladylike as they could 
possibly be, and Miss. Bailey acquitted herself in a way that 
reflected much credit upon your institution. We were very 
sorry indeed that on account of the bad weather they had so — 
much to contend with. Our school hasbeen so deeply interested 
in the work of your school that they requested me to send you 
320
-P-A-G-E-338
the enclosed check for the purpose of buying presents for the 
four children and Miss Bailey. You may use your own good 
judgment in the selection of such gifts as you think these parties 
will best enjoy and which the meager amount enclosed will buy.” 
All well-informed persons readily acknowledge that the school 
is the great motive power in our modern civilization. The arts 
and sciences are not now in the hands of the few. The masses 
are beginning to understand and appreciate the power that 
moves the world. The farmer’s boy and the blacksmith’s ap- 
prentice become inventors, discoverers, leaders in thought and 
masters in trade and finance. Never before were there such 
great opportunities, and never before were there so many wide- 
awake and capable men to seize these opportunities and to build 
up fame and colossal fortunes. The great achievements in en- 
gineering, in niechanics, ete., bewilder and astound us with their 
variety and their magnitude. ‘No one could master a tithe of 
the inventions, the discoveries and the practical application to 
science of the every-day business of life in the short time al- 
lotted to most of us. Every hour adds a new avenue to human 
enterprise, another industry to our already innumerable occu- 
pations and professions; to our ever-growing, ever-advancing 
civilization. Consider the marvel of the X-Ray which pene- 
trates opaque substances, showing to the observer what lies be- 
hind them; the wireless telegraph, which operates through 
space without the aid of the usual wire; the meteorological sys- 
tem, now an important department of every government, whose 
office is to warn ports along the coast of the approach of storms 
so that shipping, etc., may seek shelter and safety. Economists 
allow nothing to be wasted. They find use for everything. 
They separate from the crude matter, that which is most useful 
and that which remains is made use of in some remunerative 
way. Old and familiar substances are made to take a thousand 
new forms. A number of perfumes and many kinds of medi- 
cines are extracted from coal tar; broken glass and bottles are 
transformed into mantel ornaments; the husks of grain, stalks 
of corn, straw, shavings, even the sweepings of houses and streets, 
21— . 
321
-P-A-G-E-339
are made to fill some place in the economy of this thrifty, busy 
age. From the very dirt under our feet a beautiful metal is 
extracted. It is as bright as silver, never tarnishes or corrodes, 
is stronger and tougher, much lighter and far more malleable 
than iron. Every clay bank is a mine of this useful and val- 
uable metal. The exquisite dyes and tints used in factories 
where all kinds of beautiful fabrics, wall papers and decorations 
of every kind are made are extracted from matter heretofore 
thought of no value whatever. It was a serious problem how to 
dispose of the great heap of slag accumulated at furnaces and 
factories until mineral wool was made from it and used for 
deafening. An All-Wise Providence has bountifully distrib- 
uted over the whole surface of the earth the materials most 
useful to man. Coal and iron, which have made our advanced 
state possible, are found almost everywhere. 
The chemist, the scientist and the inventor are all at work to 
unveil the hidden secrets of nature, whereby all the require 
ments of man can ke supplied with least labor and with least 
expense. ‘The immense energy of the wind, the waterfall, the 
flowing river, the waves of the ocean, of gravitation of elec- 
tricity, and indeed, of all the forces which regulate and control 
our cosmic world, are harnessed to the car of progress and 
made to do man’s will. Think of the millions of newspapers 
that are published every day, containing information from all 
parts of the world, embracing everything of interest; the 
speeches made yesterday in Parliament, in the Reichstag and in 
the Chamber of Deputies; the latest fashions; the state of the 
markets, and an accurate description of Lady Brook’s new 
bonnet; a full account of the battles in Africa, China, India, and 
the occupation of some small island of the Philippines by the 
American troops ; the Lord Mayor’s toast delivered last night at 
the Guild Hall banquet, and the latest morsel of scandal. All 
this is the result of the intelligence, push and enterprise that 
education alone can give. 
The education of the blind is only at the threshold of the 
great storehouse of knowledge. We are still in ‘the experi- 
mental state. New appliances and new apparatus will be in- 
322
-P-A-G-E-340
vented, and new employmerits will be discovered. Greater at- 
tention will be given to the training of the young. Instead of 
the five systems of letters now used, liberal, broad-minded blind 
men will, I trust, see to it that only one system of print will 
be tolerated, and that that system shall be international. It is 
a grievous sin and an unpardonable folly to spend so much 
money on so many different kinds of print just because some 
one’s egotism and selfishness stands in the way; whereas, if all 
would unite upon one general plan the result for good to the 
blind would be incalculable. The energy now wasted in con- 
tention and acrimony wouid be directed to improve and cheapen 
books and whatever else is used in the instruction of the blind. 
The declamatory contest took place May 10. Col. Allison, 
Dr. McGill and Prof. Allen G. Hall presided as judges. So 
well were the speeches delivered that the judges occupied more 
than half an hour in arriving ata decision. Robert Newman of 
the Seniors and William Spellings of the Juniors won the 
medals. 
On the evening of June 5, a very large and representative 
audience assembled in the chapel to witness the closing exercises 
of the session. The fact that we are unable to accommodate 
more than half who wish to be present is sufficient evidence of 
the enjoyable character of our entertainments. Judge East con- 
ferred high school diplomas and medals for proficiency in music 
on Miss Alma Bruce and Roy Hampton. Negley Fuson re- 
ceived a grammar school certificate. . 
The commencement exercises at the colored school took place 
on June 4. They were quite interesting, showed much im- 
provement and good training. Mr. Campbell conferred a di- 
ploma on Emma Guinn, the first graduate of the colored de- 
partment. 
On Thursday, June 6, teachers and pupils left for their 
homes, where I hope they will spend a most enjoyable vacation. 
Respectfully submitted, 
J. V. ARMSTRONG, Superintendent.

TENNESSEE INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL. 
I have the honor to present to you this, the seventh, biennial 
report of the Tennessee Industrial School. 
During the past two years the health of the children has been 
exceedingly good and their advancement in school and in the 
several branches of business here represented have kept pace 
with the growth and development of this institution. 
We have received since opening 2,553 pupils. Of this num- 
ber 1,950 were white boys, 436 girls and 167 colored boys. We 
have discharged 1,783; of this number 1,456 were white boys, 
214 girls, 113 colored boys. There were remaining in the 
school, December 19, 1900, 767 pupils; of this number 493 were 
white boys, 220 girls and 54 colored boys. This number in- 
cludes 175 pay pupils. One hundred of these are paid for by 
Davidson County and 75 by, parents or guardians. Deducting 
the pay pupils from the state pupils, it leaves us with 592 chil- 
dren to be paid for by the state. 
We turn away from the doors of this institution not less than 
twenty-five children each month. This is sometimes done be- 
cause the quota of the counties making application is already 
filled, but oftener from persons desiring to send us pay pupils. 
During the past two years we have expended on subsistence 
account $149,426.66; on furnishing account $8,366.87, and on 
improvements and repairs $17,030.45. _ We have received on. 
account of pay pupils $34,560.24. The above figures include 
amounts of special appropriations for gas and electric light ex- 
tension, steam cooking appliances and two wings for girls’ build- 
ing made by the legislative bodies of 1899, amounting to $10,- 
760.65. During the same period we have expended for neces- 
sary improvements and repairs for which no special appropria- 
tions were made, $12,030.45. These improvements for which 
this sum has been paid are as follows: New ranges have been 
put in the kitchens at.all the departments of the institution. 
They are of the best make and are all of one pattern, and we have 
arranged with the firms from whom we purchased them to get 
‘all our castings for repairs by weight at nominal cost. We 
were unfortunate in having a portion of the back wall of the 
324
-P-A-G-E-342
main building fall out. This we have built up in a most 
substantial manner with a cement wall. We found it necessary 
to repair the roof of the main building at a considerable cost; 
we also found it necessary to place new metal roof on small girls’ 
building and also added two rooms and a porch for their 
accommodation. The green house department has been rebuilt 
and three good, substantial houses have been filled with a 
choice selection of plants and cuttings. It was also necessary 
to build three vaults, one at the small boys’ department, one at 
the small girls’ department and one at the large girls’ depart- 
ment. This work has also been done in the most approved and 
substantial manner. One of the buildings formerly used as a 
wood shed we have fitted up and arranged for a broom shop. 
We have also refitted and supplied the barber shop with four 
new chairs and proper appliances for conducting the tonsorial 
art. We found it necessary to purchase a complete set of 
‘dentist tools and appliances in order that we might attend to 
the children’s teeth and if possible keep them in good repair. 
It was found necessary to build a tank and put in boiler and 
appliances for heating water in lavatory and bath rooms at the 
‘large girls’ department. The buildings have all been painted, 
the roofs of the buildings have been painted, much needed car- 
penter work about the place has been done, new water and 
gas pipes have been put in from time to time where necessary, 
as well as other numerous little improvements and repairs which 
are constantly to be made in and about an institution, and all 
this has been done without one cent specially appropriated for 
the above mentioned improvements and repairs. We have also 
paid out of our per capita allowance $1,300 for rent of colored 
department and $480 for rent of small girls’ department, besides 
we have rented considerable land for farming purposes, pasture, 
etc., for which we have paid $1,215 for the last two years, and 
a new steam boiler was also placed in the boys’ cooking depart- 
ment, costing $125, for which we had no appropriation. The 
addition to the girls’ department cost $1,200 more than we 
received for the improvement. This was also paid out of our 
per capita allowance. The buildings and appliances of this 
325
-P-A-G-E-343
whole institution have not cost the state over $70,000, and if 
it were not for the fact that we had assisted out of funds appro- 
priated as our per capita allowance with what little we have 
made we could not today have taken the place as leader among 
similar institutions throughout the country, and when we con- 
sider that out of 1,783 pupils discharged from this institution 
only twelve or fourteen have done badly, we feel sure that: the 
State of Tennesses has not thrown away one dollar of her 
property, but has been well repaid in the establishment of good’ 
and useful citizenship. 
Owing to the very unfavorable season and excessive drought 
practically nothing was realized from our farm during the year 
1899. This necessitated the purchase of many vegetables and 
fruits which under favorable conditions we would have raised 
more of than. we could consume. Our potatoes, and in fact, 
everything in the vegetable line, were almost an entire failure, 
but during the past year the season has been more favorable to’ 
farming, and we have raised twenty acres of Irish potatoes, 
thirty acres of sweet potatoes and fifty acres in garden products. 
We have fourteen mules, twenty-seven cows and twelve horses. 
We find that we can rent the land and supply our milk and. 
butter cheaper and better than to buy it elsewhere. We have 
lost three cows, but have purchased others as soon as dead. Our 
shops and all that pertains to the education of the children along 
the line of manual training has been to us entirely satisfactory. 
The children have been interested in all the various duties they 
have been called upon to perform. They have been engaged in 
the following oceupations: Bookkeeping, shorthand, typewrit- 
ing, telegraphy, printing, cabinet making, carpentry, wood carv- 
ing, furniture finishing, manual training, mattress making, up- 
holstering, painting, barber shop work, broom making, tailor- 
ing, blacksmithing, wagon making, bread baking, harness mak- 
ing, shoemaking, storekeeping, steam laundering, work in ma- 
chine shops, boilers, plumbing, farming, vegetable gardening, 
fruit gardening, work in green houses, hot beds, barn and care of 
stock. Their advancement along these lines has beem marked. 
We raise all our vegetables, manufacture all our furniture, make 
326
-P-A-G-E-344
all of our shoes, mattresses clothing and some wagons, do our 
carpentering and a greater part of the plumbing and repairing 
necessary at the institution. They are capable of making any- 
thing that is to be made in these branches. This proves a mat- 
ter of great economy and saving to the state as well as a source 
of great benefit to the children in the way of instruction. We 
have employed at the present time a corps of sixty teachers and 
employes, many of whom at one time were pupils of this school, 
and who, by diligence and perseverance, have fitted themselves 
for the positions which they now fill. We find that more satis- 
factory results can be obtained by employing our former pupils 
than by securing outside assistance. They are gentler and 
understand more thoroughly our established methods of dealing 
with the children, to say nothing of their desire for that perfect 
system and order which has become so thoroughly instilled into 
their natures and dispositions during their attendance as pupils 
here. 
In the pursuance of their literary branches the children have 
also given very satisfactory results, their deportment there, as 
elsewhere, having been exemplary. We have two sessions of 
school daily. (See report of schools.) One-half of the children | 
attend school during the forenoon and are employed in the va- 
rious shops during the afternoon. Those who attend school in 
the afternoon are engaged at work at the time of the morning 
school session. In this way each child is placed under the direct 
management, influence and control of lady teachers for about 
five hours each day, as only lady teachers are employed in the 
literary departments. 
Our musical department compares favorably with that of 
any institution of this character in the country. We have a 
brass band of about thirty-two members, which is acknowledged 
to be the best in the state, and whose musical renditions are 
remarkably good for boys of their age. They play with credit 
music of the very best class, which they read and execute at 
sight. They devote one hour each day to this study under the 
direct supervision of a competent teacher, who is employed for 
that purpose and who also has charge of the barber shop. We 
327
-P-A-G-E-345
also have classes in vocal music at each of our several depart- 
ments, arranged for and directed by the matron and competent 
assistants. 
We would respectfully ask the legislative bodies of the State 
of Tennessee to increase our per capiia allowance from $100 
to $120 per annum for each pupil, and would also respectfully 
ask for the following special appropriations for much needed 
improvements: $5,000 for a small tract of land upon which is 
located a building used for the small girls’ department, $3,500 
for a crematory, $3,000 for insurance, $8,500 for the erection of 
an additional building for the boys’ department and $4,355 for 
an indebtedness incurred for supplies. 
Very respectfully submitted, 
W. C. KILVINGTON, Superintendent.

SCHOOLS FOR THE COLORED. 
LE MOYNE INSTITUTE. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the 
work of this institution for the school year ending on June 
30, 1901: 
The enrollment for the year in all grades and departments of 
the school has aggregated 673 pupils. Of these, 252 were en- 
rolled in the three grades of the Primary Department, 128 in 
the two grades of the Intermediate Department, 121 in the two 
grades of the Grammar Department, and 169 in the Normal De- 
partment. The last-named department comprises five years’ 
work, making a course of school training, in all, twelve years in 
duration, from the first Primary to the senior year of the Nor- 
mal Department. 
The attendance for the year has been quite regular and steady 
at between 500 and 600 in daily attendance. In all the work of 
the school the aim has been to teach thoroughly the regular 
English branches of a graded and high school course of study, 
with additional special work in the Normal Department for 
the training of teachers for the public schools of Tennessee 
and adjoining States. 
The graduating class of the present year numbered eighteen— 
ten young women and eight young’ men—averaging twenty 
‘and one-half years of age. The average time of attendance of 
these students at Le Moyne Institute is a fraction over six years, 
and at other schools a little over five years. Fourteen of them 
intend to teach, and five have already taught from one to five 
terms in the schools of Tennessee. 
Aside from the scholastic and Normal training, the pupils of 
the first four grades have one lesson and period of practice each 
380
-P-A-G-E-348
week in sewing; while the girls of the fifth, sixth and seventh 
grades have four lessons and periods of practice every week in 
the art of sewing and cutting and making of garments. A spe- 
cial teacher is employed for this work. Cooking, household 
work and nursing are also regularly taught to the young women 
of the ninth, tenth and eleventh years in the Normal Depart- 
ment; while the young men of the corresponding grades have 
lessons and daily practice in the use of wood-working tools, 
printing, ete. 
The following outline comprises the course of training of the 
Normal Department, thorough training in Vocal Musie being 
given in each grade: 
MANUAL TRAINING. 
The value of hand training in education has been largely 
overlooked until quite recently. After an experience of some 
years in which we have sought fairly and faithfully to combine 
the training of the hand and eye with the more purely intel- 
lectual training, we are convinced that the two should not be 
separated in graded or high school courses of study. 
The attention and intellectual effort required in guiding the 
eye and hand to the deft and accurate performance of any task 
calling for skill, must secure some of the highest results sought 
for in education. 
The best fruits of education are obtained by “the cultivation 
of a legitimate familiarity betwixt the mind and thing.” Aside 
from the value of manual training as a factor in education, all 
recognize its practical bearing and importance with reference to 
the future life and success of the pupil. To secure these results, 
manual training takes its place in the course of study on the 
same footing and is treated in every respect as of the same im- 
portance as any other branch of study. 
GIRLS’ MANUAL TRAINING. 
If the home is to be the nursery of all virtues, the homekeeper 
must understand how to order the affairs of her household with 
intelligence and economy. The practical training provided for 
the girls of the school has this end in view. 
331
-P-A-G-E-349
The work comprises recitations and practice through ten years 
of the course of study. 
NEEDLE-WORK. 
The first three years, primary grades, follow the excellent 
practice of stitch-work outlined by Miss Kirkwood of New York. 
The fourth year pupils review the stitch-work of the lower 
grades and spend more time on patch work. 
The fifth year pupils have hemming, darning, making of 
plain aprons and similar work. 
The sixth grade take mending, darning, cutting and making 
of plain garments, ete. 
The seventh and last year in needle-work have cutting, basting 
and making of plain garments, with some faney work. 
HOUSEHOLD WORK. 
The girls of the eighth year have daily recitations in the 
theory of household economy and work, including study of foods 
and cooking. ‘The girls of the ninth year do practical work in 
the experimental kitchen. While those of the tenth year take 
up the subjects of Nursing and Hygiene, for six months of the 
year. 
In care of the sick and hygiene the Hand-book of Nursing pre- 
pared for use in the New Haven School of Nursing is used as a 
text-book and guide. In household economy and cooking, we 
follow out the lines of work as marked out in “Household 
Economy,” a manual for schools, published under the direction 
of the Kitchen-Garden Association of New York, and “First 
Principles of Household Management and Cookery,” by Miss 
Parloa of New York. In addition to daily lessons of forty min- 
utes, the class has actual practice in cooking certain days of the 
week, when the class time is extended to two hours. On each 
practice day four dishes are usually prepared by the girls, under 
the supervision of the regular instructor. These exercises in- 
elude lessons in bread, meats, vegetables and pastries, varied so 
as to give practice in preparing most of the wholesome dishes 
found on the average table. Special attention is given to eco- 
nomie cookery throughout. 
332
-P-A-G-E-350
BOYS’ MANUAL TRAINING. 
Thus far provision has been made to give the boys of the 
school some practice in the use of wood-working tools and 
in typesetting and printing. The former for boys of the 
seventh, eighth and ninth years of the course and the latter for 
boys, also girls, of the Junior year. 
WOOD-WORKING. 
For the wood-working classes fourteen benches and as many 
sets of carpenter’s tools are provided. Each set consists of 
1 steel square, 1 try square, 1 rule,.1 draw shave, 1 spoke shave, 
3 saws, 3 chisels, 2 guages, 2 planes, 1, screwdriver, 1 hammer, 
1 mallet, 1 nail-set, 1 oil-stone, 1 oil can, ete. In addition to 
this outfit the instructor has a bench furnished with’a very com- 
plete set of tools. 
So far as possible elements of construction are kept in view, 
but the main object of this work is to train the eye and hand of 
the pupils and to give a thorough understanding of the typical 
tools in use by them. The shop is also provided with a number 
of lathes and other foot-power machinery. 
TYPE-SETTING AND PRINTING. 
A thoroughly equipped newspaper and job office furnishes 
opportunity for instruction in the theory and art of printing. 
This work has been very successful both in practical results and 
as a valuable auxiliary in the intellectual training of the school. 
The entire time of a special instructor is required in this de 
partment, as is also the case in the Wood-working Department 
and in the Girls’ Department of industrial instruction. 
WALDEN UNIVERSITY.

ROGER WILLIAMS UNIVERSITY. 
Sir: I have the honor to report that the past scholastic year 
of this institution closed very satisfactorily on May 15. The 
enrollment was slightly below the total of last year, but in the 
interest shown, the general earnestness manifested and the char- 
acter of work done, the year was eminently satisfactory. 
We graduated from the Theological Department four men, 
three of them men of standing in their denomination and of con- 
siderable experience in general affairs. We have a right to feel 
that these men are better fitted for their important work in life 
and for the wise guidance of their people than before. 
The College Department graduated six men, all of them 
earnest, efficient young men, who will fill important positions in 
life in the near future. 
The graduating class in the College Preparatory Department 
numbered sixteen, twelve male, four female; in the Normal De- 
partment, thirteen, one male, twelve female. The total output 
was, therefore, thirty-nine, almost equally divided as to sex. 
The ultimate value of these trained young men and women upon 
the life and ideals of their several communities in the years to 
come is certain to be very great. 
Recent changes in the curriculum have placed greater empha- 
sis upon the study and use of the English language and the allied 
subjects of Literature and History. In this emphasis we feel 
that we are in line with the best thought and practice of the 
present day. Nothing but contempt can be felt for a man, 
whatever his color and race, who can parade words and phrases 
of a foreign tongue, but cannot use his mother tongue either with 
grace or with accuracy. No year of our course, as now arranged, 
from the earliest year in the common branches to the senior year 
in College, is without definite work in English, either directly or 
in the form of literature. In connection with this increased at- 
tention to English, better opportunities are offered in History. 
The graduate of our Normal course, the candidate for position 
as teacher in the publis schools of the State, will hereafter have 
had—in addition to extended practice in English, and a general 
knowledge of English and American Literature—some knowl- 
335
-P-A-G-E-353
edge of the history of the whole world, and of England and 
America especially. This cannot fail to result in greater in- 
telligence, refinement and breadth of view. 
Another cardinal principle of this institution is its insistence 
upon self-help. About twenty-five per cent. of the young men in 
all departments support themselves almost entirely by their own 
labor. A large number of students fail of admission each year 
because the school cannot assure them financial assistance. 
While this no doubt works real hardship in some cases of genuine 
merit, it may be doubted whether gratuities result, after all, in 
the development of men best fitted for practical life; and the de- 
velopment of such men and women, not merely better teachers 
for the schools of the State, but better, wiser, more intelligent, 
more useful men and women for every department of life, is the 
supreme aim of this and kindred institutions. 
Very respectfully submitted, 
P. B. GUERNSEY, President. 
KNOXVILCE COLLEGE. 
Sir: The year which closed in June, 1901, was in all respects 
a suecessful one. The attendance exceeded 300, students com- 
ing from eighteen States, Central America and Canada. In the 
Collegiate Department six students were graduated and six in 
the Normal Department. 
Knoxville College is under the control of the Freedmen’s 
Board of Missions ‘to the Freedmen, of the United Presbyterian 
Church. Jt is chartered under the laws of Tennessee. It was 
founded in 1875. : 
.By arrangement with the University of Tennessee the college 
has received the colored State University students, and in con- 
sideration of that the University has added largely to the equip- 
ment of. the Agricultural and Mechanical Departments, and 
appropriates $4,000 a year to the maintenance of these depart- 
336
-P-A-G-E-354
ments. The same conditions prevail in the College regarding 
free tuition for State students as prevail in the University for 
white students. Students are assigned work in one of the indus- 
trial departments if they desire it, and receive compensation in 
proportion to the work accomplished. Thus students both learn 
a trade and at the same time earn a part of their expenses. 
Aside from the funds received from the University as indicated 
above the college is suppor ted by the voluntary contributions of 
the church. 
Knoxville College stands for the most thorough intellectual 
training and at the same time provides for thorough industrial 
training. It is in hearty sympathy with all efforts to teach the - 
trades to the colored people and maintains its industrial depart- 
ment for that purpose, but at the same time its literary standard 
is carefully maintained. The courses of study offered are 
Classical, Scientific, Theological, Normal and Common School. 
The Industrial Department offers training in Agriculture, Car- 
pentering, Printing, Electrie Work, Sewing, Cooking and 
Household Work. The College owns over 100 acres of land, 
and in addition to this rents an adjoining tract, and employ- 
ment is given on the farm to a large number of students. An 
electric light plant, run entirely by the students, lights all the 
buildings of the college plant. A steam heating plant, also run 
_ by the students, furnishes heat for the various buildings. The 
Printing Department is under the direction of a practical and 
thorough printer, and besides doing all the printing for the 
College, a large amount of job work is done for outside parties. 
A large cylinder press, run by steam, does the heavier work, 
while a job press does the lighter work. Thus the students are 
trained in all that prepares one for taking charge of a job print- 
ing office. 
The College occupies a commanding site on one ‘of the hills 
made historie by the siege of Knoxville during the Civil War. 
There are nine building, comprising four dormitories, recitation 
hall, mechanical building, heating plant, two residene2s and barn. 
The College property is valued at $110,000. During the past 
year thirty acres of valuable land were added to it. 
22— 337
-P-A-G-E-355
. There have been thirteen State ‘Normal students in attend- 
ance during the past year, under appointment of State Senators | 
and thus entitled to the State Normal scholarship of $50. 
. The work that the College is doing is best seen in the lives of 
those who have gone out from it. The profession of teaching 
claims the larger number; many enter the ministry, while a 
large number are devoting themselves to farming or the trades. 
While in college students are taught that labor is honorable, and 
they are encouraged to go back to their homes to devote their 
lives to the uplifting of their people in their own communities. 
‘The expenses of the student in the college are merely nominal. 
Tuition is only 50 cents a month. Boarding, heat, light, fur- 
nished room and tuition are charged for at the rate of $6.35 per 
month. Very little charity help is given, but by furnishing 
work to worthy students and keeping the expenses at the very 
lowest, self-help is encouraged and the foundation of useful 
citizenship is laid. 
R. W. WGRANAHAN, President. 
FISK UNIVERSITY. 
Sir: In presenting to your honor the report for Fisk Uni- 
versity for the school year of 1900-01, mention at the outset 
should be made of the death of President E. M. Cravath, D. D. 
Dr. Cravath, as the founder of Fisk and its chief executive 
officer for a quarter of a century, had the honor and privilege of 
witnessing the growth of an infant school into a well-equipped 
institution with its eight different departments, while the sightly 
and capacious campus which he selected has been graced by eight 
substantial brick or stone buildings. 
Backed as President Cravath was by a broad-minded organ- 
ization, the American Missionary Association, he was enabled to 
build up an institution, Christian and not sectarian, national as 
well as local. That Dr. Cravath was a singularly catholic and 
338
-P-A-G-E-356
truly American educator is abundantly borne witness to by the 
unchallenged testimony given at his funeral by Rev. Vance, late 
pastor of the First Southern Presbyterian Church of Nashville, 
who said: 
“T think the supreme triumph of his victory is that here under 
all difficult surroundings he did a work which has alike com- 
mended itself to white man, black man, to Northman and to 
Southman. Fisk University has never been a menace to aught 
that was dear to the Southern heart—indeed, it has been a blessed 
safeguard; and if the spirit which breathed in President 
Cravath lived in his work and is represented by you, who consti- 
tute Fisk University, obtained throughout the South and North, 
there would be no race question.” 
In spite of, perhaps owing to, the fact that Dr. Cravath died 
just before the scholastic year opened, the year has been one of 
yare value. The student body has been unusually earnest- 
minded and discipline easy. 
Twenty-seven different states and territories have been repre- 
sented upon the roll of 503 pupils. The number of college stu- 
dents has been unusually large, a matter, it seems to us, for sin- 
cere congratulation in view of the great need there is of well- 
equipped men and women among the vast number of people of 
whom Fisk is an educational center. The self-restrain and self- 
poise attendant upon training afforded in a high-grade Christian 
school will give the Southland doctors rather than quacks, bar- 
risters rather than shysters, instructive preachers, successful 
teachers and business men. . 
The graduates of Fisk, all of whom are closely kept track of 
by the institution, encourages us, by the use they have, almost 
without exception, made of their training, to go forward. 
The young people who have been in attendance at Fisk during 
the last year, aided by State scholarships, have in the main 
shown an appreciation of what has been done for them by the 
commonwoalth and made evident the wisdom of the Senators 
who designated them. 
It is the aim of Fisk to be of service to the State which has 
339
-P-A-G-E-357
chartered it and to fulfill the highest hopes of the many citizens 
of Tennessee who have an interest in its welfare. , 
Respectfully submitted, 
J. G. MERRILL, President. 
LANE COLLEGE. 
Sir: I have the honor to submit my annual report as presi- 
dent of Lane College for the year ending May 30, 1901. 
When the Civil War began in 1861 the Methodist Episcopal 
Church, South, had in its membership about 207,000 colored 
members. The war having closed and the relations of the 
colored people being changed, it was deemed wise to set off the 
colored membership in an organization of their own. Accord- 
ingly Bishop Robert Paine, Bishop H. N. MeTyeire and other 
representatives met the colored representatives in the city of 
Jackson, Tenn., December, 1870. The conference resulted in 
the organization of the colored Methodist Episcopal Church in 
America. The leaders of this new church soon saw the necessity 
of schools of their own. In the fall of 1878, in the City of 
Nashville, at a session of the Tennessee Conference of said col- 
ored church the project of. establishing a school was begun. 
Property was purchased in Jackson, Tenn., and a house was 
erected. In 1882 ihe first session was opened and the school 
was called the High School of the Colored Methodist Episcopal 
“Church. Two years later it was chartered under the laws of 
Tennessee as-Lane Institute, in honor of Bishop Lane, who was 
leading in the new movement. 
In the fall of 1888 Bishop Lane went to the Memphis Con- 
ference of the M. E. Church, South, secking a president for 
the school. The writer was appointed to that position by 
Bishop John C. Keener. 
The institution prospered and its necessities multiplied. 
Bishop Isaac Lane began to travel abroad with the view of 
raising means for the erection of a more commodious school 
340
-P-A-G-E-358
building and boarding departments for its increasing patronage. 
In 1895 the new building was dedicated by Bishop R. 8. 
Williams and its name changed to Lane College. It is a hand- 
some three-story brick, situated on a campus well shaded and 
set in grass. It has a large auditorium, ten recitation rooms, 
library rooms and office. Separate boarding departments for 
girls and boys have been built and furnished. 
It is supported in its finances by the Colored Methodist Epis- 
copal Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. 
Since its organization it has sent out from the Normal De- 
partment one hundred and sixteen graduates, and many of 
these are filling responsible positions and giving great satis- 
faction. , 
There were no graduates at the close of this session, as an- 
other course was added to the present two years’ normal course, 
and the college has not been organized long enough to send out 
graduates from it. 
A Law Department has been organized and is doing well. 
Lane College is in a prosperous condition, and its prospects are 
bright. 
The students appointed by Senators for the State Normal 
scholarships did well and are worthy of the help extended them 
by the State.

  SCHOLARSHIPS. 
Conditions Upon Which Colored Students Are Appointed to 
{Scholarships by Senators. 
Senators in the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee 
are authorized by law to appoint from their respective Senatoriai 
Districts biennially two students of African descent, and to fill 
vacancies when such occur from any cause. An entrance exam- 
ination is required of the scholarship student on the following 
subjects: Spelling, Reading, Writing, English Grammar, Ge- 
ography, Arithmetic, and United States History. In ease a 
scholarship student fails to pass a satisfactory examination, such 
342
-P-A-G-E-360
failure shall be reported by the President of the Institution to 
the Senator, who, in such case, is authorized to fill the vacancy 
by appointing another. Where the student fails to attend, dies, 
or otherwise makes vacant the scholarship, the Senator will fill 
by appointment and notify the State Superintendent as in other 
cases. Two appointments only are provided, and not more than 
two students from any Senatorial District can receive benefits 
from such appointments at the same time by such Senator, it 
being the purpose of the law to give the power of appomtment 
‘to a senator and allow him to keep appointing from time to 
time, filling vacancies, ete., until the appropriation for that 
purpose has been exhausted. The original appointments by the 
Senator are good for a full term of two years, beginning with the 
fall term of school after said appointment is made. This form 
of certificate is furnished the Senator in duplicate for each ap- 
pointment. When properly filled out one copy should be given 
the appointee and the other mailed to the State Superintendent 
at Nashville. The Legislature appropriated for these scholar- 
ships fifty dollars per annum, which will be paid at the close of 
each school year when proper vouchers are presented by the 
president of the institution. The appointee should present his 
certificate to the president of the designated school of his choice, 
who will immediately notify the State Superintendent of such 
entrance. -The designated schools are: Knoxville Corea’ | 
Knoxville; Freedman’s Normal Institute, Maryville; Fisk 
University, Nashville; Roger Williams University, Nashville; 
Central Tennessee College, Nashville; LeMoyne Institute, 
Memphis; Morristown Normal Institute, Morristown; Lane | 
Institute, Jackson, and Athens Academy, Athens. 
The State Board of Education has desginated the above col- 
Jeges and provided that the scholarship student may, upon 
presentation of this certificate, attend that institution preferred, 
and will be allowed credit only for time of actual attendance at 
the rate of six dollars and twenty-five cents per month, this hav- 
ing been. agreed upon by those having in charge the institutions 
named. ‘The applicant for a scholarship under the State appro- 
priation must be at Jeast sixteen years of age, of good health, 
343
-P-A-G-E-361
excellent habits, and moral character. Before entering the eol- 
lege the student is required to declare his intention to makc 
teaching a profession and agree to teach at least two years in the 
public schools of Tennessee after attending any of the above 
schools. No person who has heretofore received full benefits of 
a scholarship appointment is eligible to re-appointment by a 
Senator for either a full or unexpired term.

INSTRUCTIONS GOVERNING THE EX AMINATION OF 
CANDIDATES FOR COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. 
September 19-20-21. 
.«'The examination of those who expect to be candidates for 
- County Superintendent will be held September 19-20-21 at the 
county seat and: on no other date. Questions have been prepared 
upon every subject provided by law to be taught in the public 
schools. These questions are mailed direct to the Examining 
Board in three envelopes, upon the outside of which are indi- 
cated the subjects contained in them, and the date when such 
subjects shall be given to applicants. 
The Board of Examiners shall meet daily at 8:30 each morn- 
ing, and, in the presence of the applicants break the seal and 
open the envelope containing questions for that day only. The 
questions should be placed upon a blackboard, subject by subject, 
and each subject should be completed before another is placed 
upon the board. No communication shall be permitted among 
applicants, and it would be best if they could occupy separate 
seats. After questions are placed upon the board no applicant 
should be permitted to leave the room until the examination 
upon that subject is completed. If the applicant does leave the 
room, then such person should not be permitted to answer ques- 
tious then on the board upon his return. 
I recommend that the Board, after the first n morning, fix the 
hour for opening, closing and dinner. So arrange the examina-° 
tion that the subject upon the board will be entirely completed 
before adjournment for dinner, and that in the afternoon the sub- 
ject then upon the board shall be completed before adjournment 
for the day. 
The especial duty of the three men appointed by the Chair- 
man of the County Court is to see that this examination is con- 
ducted fairly and impartially. Simply place the questions upon 
the board, let each applicant for himself answer the questions. 
Do not permit conversation among applicants or friends; iet the 
examination be so conducted that there can be no question about 
its fairness. I desire that the applicants receive grades upon 
864
-P-A-G-E-382
their answers fairly and freely made, without aid or assistance _ 
from any source. 
Let each applicant write his name and address and county 
upon every sheet of paper used in answering the questions, so 
that the papers may not be confused when transmitted to me. 
When the examination is completed all papers should’ be 
packed in one bundle and either mailed or expressed to me at 
Nashville, and with them this certificate: 
“The examination of applicants for County Superintendent 
was conducted by the Committee appointed by the Chairman, 
and in accordance with the regulations of the State Superintend- 
ent in every respeet. No communication was permitted among 
applicants and no aid was allowed any person, and in all other 
respects the specific instructions of the State Superintendent 
were followed, and this examination was honestly, fairly and 
impartially conducted.” 
" The questions should be returned to this office at once, so that 
papers can be graded and applicants notified of the result.

the law, to promptly turn over to your successor all books, 
records and school supplies sent you from this office. As I have 
stated to yon heretofore, our appropriations for this office, and 
especially for printing, are not large, and it requires economy on 
the part of each official, in order to supply the actual necessities 
in the various districts. These supplies in your hands are worth- 
less to you, and I hope that you will not fail or forget to collect 
all of them and deliver them to your successor on the day of his

STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Deparrment or Pusric Instruction, 
Nashville, May 3, 1901. 
To the County Superintendent: 
I enclose blanks which I desire you to fill and return to me at 
your earliest convenience in enclosed return stamped envelope. 
During the next few days I will have circulars about Institutes 
and other matters for distribution, and it is important that T 
have the name and addresses of all your teachers so that 1 may 
mail matters of interest direct to the teacher. When I receive 
your list I place it with those of other counties in a book which 
T have for that purpose, and during the remainder of the year I 
will be able from time to time to send your teachers printed mat- 
ter of interest and importance to them. Your immediate atten- 
tion to this matter will greatly oblige me. 
Yours very truly, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
State Superintendent. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Department or Pustic Instruction. 
Nashville, Tenn., June 1, 1901. 
To the Superintendents, Directors and Teachers: : 
The Act of 1873 and subsequent legislation makes it the duty 
of the State Superintendent “To prescribe the mode of exam- 
ining and licensing school teachers, and their necessary qualifica- 
tions.” (Sec. 7, Sub-see. 9.) 
- It shall be the duty of the County Superintendent “To per- 
form such duties in relation to the examination of teachers, and 
issuing to them certificates of qualification, as may be required 
of him by the State Superintendent.” (See. 9, Sub-see 4.) 
“To observe such directions and regulations as the State Su- 
_ perintendent of Schools may from time to time prescribe.” (See. 
9, Sub-see. 6.) 
393
-P-A-G-E-411
“No teacher of Public Schools shall be employed, or receive 
any pay from the public funds, unless he or she have a certificate 
of qualification, given to him or her by the County Superintend- 
ent, for the County within which he or she is employed.” 
(Sec. 26.) 
“Diplomas shall be granted to those who honorably complete 
the Course of Study prescribed in Normal Schools established 
by the State Board of Education, and possession of such 
Diploma shall exempt the holder thereof from the examination 
prescribed as a condition precedent to employment in the Public 
Schools of the State, any such graduate being eligible as a 
teacher in any county in the State.” (Sec. 54, Sub-sec. 8.) 
Regulations of the State Board of Education. 
Under authority of the State Board of Education, the Peabody 
Normal College at Nashville issues Certificates and Diplomas to 
graduates, which exempt the holders from examination before 
the County Superintendents. 
“Parties holding Roll of Honor Certificates issued by the 
State Peabody Institutes shall be exempt from examination for 
Teachers’ Certificates in any of the Counties of the State, pro- 
vided that no certificate hereafter issued by any such Institute or 
Conductor thereof, shall be good for a period exceeding four 
years from date of issuance.” (Minute Book, 1899.) 
Heretofore Life Certificates have been issued exempting 
teachers from further examination, but the above action of the 
State Board means that Life Certificates are forbidden and that 
all who stand examinations this, or any succeeding year, shall 
be granted certificates which will expire four years from date, 
instead of for life. This ruling does not interfere with parties 
now holding Life Certificates. ° 
“All persons who are exempt from examination for Teachers’ 
Certificates by authority of the State Board of Education, shall 
conform to the requirements of the State Superintendent as to 
the time when said persons shall make application to the County 
Superintendent for Teachers’ Certificates.” (Minute Book, 
1895, p. 29.) .

Times of Examinations. 
County Superintendents are directed to hold public examina- 
tions at the following times, and to give no private examinations: 
Annual Examination—First Friday and Saturday in July. 
395
-P-A-G-E-413
Second Examination—First Friday and Saturday in August. 
Quarterly Examination—~First Friday and Saturday iv Oc- 
tober. 
Quarterly Examination—Tirst Friday and Saturday im Jan- 
uary. 
Quarterly Examination—Virst Friday and Saturday in 
March. 
Make arrangements so that the Annual: Examination will 
occur during the County Institute or at its termination. 
All Certificates expire at the close of the scholastic year, 
June 30. : 
Instructions are hereby given to Superintendents not to issue 
a certificate to any applicant, graduate of the Peabody Normal 
College, or to a person holding a State Institute Certificate at 
any other time than the dates herein specified. If the two days 
named are not sufficient to conclude the examination of appli- 
cants the Superintendent should continue from day to day until 
the work is finished, but it is desirable to have the examination 
completed during these two days. Superintendents should have 
their examination at the times suggested without exception; 
have uniform dates for examination and uniformity in the 
method of testing the teachers’ ability and scholarship. Do not 
hold private or individual examinations under any circumstances. 
No condition of facts will justify the Superintendent to grant 
such unwise favors. Treat all teachers with absolute justice and 
impartiality. This can more easily be done by following these 
instructions. : 
Fix the time and place for the examination, announce before- 
hand the number of hours to be consumed daily, and then fol- 
low your announcement. Make no exception for or against any 
person. Do not permit personal consideration, importunities of 
either teachers or influential friends to influence you one way or 
the other. Discharge your duty faithfully to the public and deal 
impartially with every teacher. 
I recommend a thorough, practical and uniform examination 
on the subjects as required by law. Examinations in themselves 
are not an infallible test of qualification, but the law has made 
396
-P-A-G-E-414
it your duty to examine teachers, and, in many instances, strict 
examinations prevent incompetent teachers from imposing upon 
the public. While examinations are one test, ability to teach, 
moral character, good citizenship, and general deportment of the 
teacher should be in every case prerequisites to the issuance of a 
certificate. Those who have failed as teachers and those of 
doubtful character should not be licensed. ‘The teacher is an ex- 
emplar in the community and there should be no doubt of his 
good standing and moral character. You have no legal or other 
right to license any person to teach school in this State who is 
not in every way worthy, capable and thoroughly qualified. 
Teachers in our public schools must be of the highest moral 
character and personal worth. License no others, it matters not 
how high their grades, nor how powerful the influences are be- 
hind them. 
The Superintendent has the right to investigate questions of 
this character and to use his good judgment and sound discretion 
in either issuing a Certificate or refusing to do so. A Teachers’ 
Institute should be held annually in each County, and it is the 
duty of teachers to attend the institute and all educational bodies 
in their County and State. The most capable teachers, without 
exception, attend these meetings, and the Superintendent, in ex- 
amining and licensing teachers should give every encouragement 
to such persons. Heretofore I have endeavored, in every possible 
way, to raise the standard of teachers in the public schools, and 
have, accordingly, directed Superintendents in all the Counties, 
without exception, to examine their teachers annually. I think 
this the surest method of obtaining capable persons to teach our 
schools. This year, however, I want the Superintendent to use 
limited discretion in this matter. If you have in your County a 
teacher of experience, ability, and unquestioned character-——a 
person who has been for a reasonable time actively engaged in 
teaching, in attendance upon teachers’ institutes and other edu- 
cational associations, and whose examination last year was of 
high grade, then I do not think it would be improper for the 
Superintendent to issue certificates without examination. Where 
the Superintendent exercises this discretion it, should be with the 
397
-P-A-G-E-415
greatest care. The }irector in most cases employs a teacher 
primarily upon the certificate of the County Superintendent. 
You are charged with the grave responsibility of passing upon 
the teachers’ qualifications. The law empowers me to prescribe 
the manner of examination and it is your duty to comply with 
the requirements of the State Superintendent. 
If our teachers are excellent and capable it is because the 
Superintendent has done his duty without fear or favor; if our 
schools are properly taught it will be because the Superintendent 
and Directors have faithfully followed the law and these instrue- 
tions. I believe that superintendents, directors and teachers 
desire a higher standard in teaching, improvement in methods 
and prosperity in our public schools and that the State Superin- 
tendent will have their co-operation in carrying into effect the 
letter and spirit of the law prescribing the method of examining 
and licensing teachers. It is unlawful for a director to employ 
a teacher until such teacher has a certificate from the County 
Superintendent covering the period of time during which such 
teacher proposes to engage in teaching. All certificates expire 
June 30th, annually, and contracts are necessarily limited ac- 
cording to the life of the teacher’s certificate. 
Teachers Exempt from Examination. 
1. Graduates of the Peabody Normal College. 
2..Graduates of State Peabody Institutes, upon presentation 
of either diplomas or certificates signed by the State Superin- 
tendent, conductor and secretary of the Institute. 
The fact that the teacher is a graduate of some school or col- 
lege does not free him from examination. A public school cer- 
tificate or diploma is not a certificate to teach. The certificates 
issued .to applicants for County Superintendent by the State 
Board of Education do not entitle their holder to a certificate 
without examination. One county superintendent has no au- 
thority to renew or duplicate a certificate issued by another 
Superintendent. When such courtesies are practiced they are 
clear violations of the law and are in total disregard to these 
instructions. The safe method to pursue is, examine annually 
398
-P-A-G-E-416
all public school teachers in each county and grant no favor 
which might impair the public service I issue this official com- 
munication setting forth in detail regulations for examining and 
licensing teachers. This should govern superintendents, direct- 
ors and teachers in matters of this character until the next gen- 
eral instructions are issued from this department.

A State Normal Institute has been located at Cookevilie, 
Tennessee, to begin Monday, June 10, 1901, and continue four _ 
weeks. This Institute is free to all white teachers who will 
attend it, and the public and private school teachers of the 
Upper Cumberland Counties are: especially urged to take ad- 
vantage of this practical and valuable Institute work. Dr. E. 
W. Kennedy, of the Peabody Normal College, has been selected 
as Conductor and will be assisted by President W. N. Billingsley, 
of Burritt College, and Professors Allen G. Hall and J. J. Keys, 
of the Nashville Public High School—all men of ability and 
experience as school teachers and Institute instructors. 
Instructors have been selected because of their ability, expe- 
rience, success and recognized efficiency in school work in all its 
departments. This is a summer school of methods for teachers, 
and the work will embrace all subjects required by law to be 
taught in the Primary and Secondary Public Schools of Tennes- 
see. The work will be thorough, practical, systematic and in 
accordance with the most improved methods of teaching, school 
management and supervision. The Institute is a business insti- 
tution for teachers, and is conducted by authority of the State, 
and under the supervision of the State Superintendent. 
The Conductor, as the presiding officer, after conference with 
the members of the faculty, will assign instructors and teachers 
their work from day to day, determine the order of business, the 
time of meeting, the number of hours consumed daily, and upor 
advice of the members will make other necessary regulations for 
the convenience of the teachers and the success of. the Institute. 
Supplementary work, lectures upon school law, school man- 
agement, the best method of conducting Institutes, etc., will be 
an important feature. All local arrangements will be made by 
the Citizens’ Committee. 
' Roll of Honor Certificates. 
The State’ Institutes were established and are now maintained 
as summer schools for teachers. Under the law, all teachers 
must be examined annually, except those holding diplomas from 
the Peabody Normal College, or those receiving certificates from 
a State Institute. The course requires two years for completion. 
403
-P-A-G-E-421
The primary course should be taken the first year, and the sec- 
ondary the next year. ‘Teachers, however, may take the work 
in either the primary or the secondary course at will, Any 
teacher may take the primary examination, but the secondary 
examination will not be allowed any teacher, except such persons 
as may present a primary certificate from a State Institute. Al] 
teachers taking the primary course who stand a satisfactory ex- 
amination will be given a certificate freeing them from County 
examination for one year; all teachers who successfully pass an 
examination wpon the secondary branches will be given a Roll 
of Honor certificate, which exempts them from examination for 
a period of four years. No teacher will be permitted to stand 
either examination, or receive either certificate, unless such 
teacher has attended this or another State Institute at least fifteen 
days. 
There will be a Secretary of the Faculty, whose duty will be 
to keep a correct record of the daily attendance. Certificates 
will be signed by the State Superintendent, the Conductor and 
Secretary of the Institute. 
Cookeville, Tenn, 
Cookeville, Tennessee, possesses one of the most delightful 
locations in the State; it is twelve hundred feet above the sea 
level, which gives it a pleasant temperature even in the warmest 
months. The cold free stone water and healthful surroundings 
make Cookeville a most pleasant resort. The people of Cooke- 
ville aré very hospitable, social and enterprising, always taking a 
lively interest in the welfare of things progressive, and have 
much at heart the suecess of this, the second State Institute held 
at that point. Cookeville has a magnificent college building 
with all modern equipments. The Nashville and Knoxville and 
Tennessee Central Railroads furnish splendid transportation 
facilities to Putnam County. First-class board is exceedingly 
cheap. Those contemplating attending this Institute will be 
given all the desired information by addressing Superintendent 
A. J. Chisholm, Cookeville, Tennessee. /

To County and. City Superintendents: 
T call your attention to the law contained in the Code, Section 
326 to 331 inclusive (copy enclosed) with regard to examination 
for Free State Scholarships in the University of Tennessee. This 
law, as you will see, requires you to give notice thereof and to 
hold this examination. I suggest that you hold it on Friday and 
Saturday, June 28 and 29, at the Court House, in the County 
seat. I enclose a sample of notice which you may insert in your 
County newspaper, provided the editor will print same free of 
charge, as I have no funds with which to pay for this character 
of advertising. The questions for this examination will be mailed 
to you direct from the University of Tennessee, at Knoxville. 
When the examination is completed you will please mail ques- 
tions and answers direct to the Registrar, University of Ten- 
nessee, Knoxville, Tennessee. In case you have already fixed 
date and place for examination, then you should hold it aceord- 
ing to the date announced; otherwise, have the examination on 
the 28th and 29th, as above suggested.

To the County Superintendent: 
The Act of 1873, Section 21, Sub-section 1, in defining the 
duties of the District Director, provides that: 
“Within thirty days after his appointment, and annually 
thereafter, in the mqnth of July, to take a census of all persons 
residing in the school district between the ages of six and twenty- 
one years, and to gather the statistics relating to education, ac- 
405 .
-P-A-G-E-423
cording to forms furnished by the Superintendent of Public 
Instruction.” 
Sub-section 5, of the same Section also provides that: 
“The Clerk of the District Directors shall not receive more 
than two per cent. per capita for his services in taking the census 
of the children in his district between the ages of six and twenty- 
one years, and for making his report thereof, ‘and other reports’ 
to the County Superintendent and County Trustee, which sum 
shall be paid by the County Trustee out of the funds due said 
district; Provided, that: 
“The County Superintendent shall not. draw any order in 
favor of any District Clerk who fails to make his report of the 
scholastic population of his district within the time prescribed by 
law; and said two cents per capita shall be in full compensation 
for all his services as such clerk for one year.” 
From this you will see that it is the duty of the Clerk of the 
Board of Directors in each school district to take a census of all 
the children of both races in his district. between the ages of six 
and twentyone. This must be done in the month of July and 
cannot be legally taken during any other month. The Clerk 
should report the census of his district to you upon blanks already 
sent you from this department, and you should immediately 
report the census or scholastic population of your County to this 
office. The law makes it your duty to have this census properly 
taken and you are prohibited from issuing a warrant to the Clerk 
for his services until his reports are made to you in accordance 
with the law. All public school funds derived from every source 
are prorated according to the census as reported by the County © 
Superintendent to this department, and it is, therefore, very im- 
portant that you have a full and exact census taken so that your 
County may receive all the public school funds to which it is 
entitled under each apportionment. A sufficient number of 
blanks have been expressed to you for taking the census in all 
your districts and I urge you to give this important duty your im- 
mediate attention.

To the County Superintendents and Teachers: 
The Tennessee State Teachers’ Association will convene at 
Monteagle July 23, and continue three days. Reasonable rates 
have been secured at the hotels, the railroads have granted re- 
duced fare, and all necessary arrangements for the accommoda- 
tion of the teachers of the State have been made. Reduction in 
these rates are so reasonable that the cost of attending this meet- 
ing will be comparatively but little. 
Monteagle is a most delightful summer resort, situated upon 
the summit of Cumberland Mountain, insuring a pleasant tem- 
perature at all times. Its hotel accommodations are excellent, 
and a desirable auditorium for our meeting has been secured. 
This is a very important business meeting of educators of 
Tennessee. Matters affecting publi¢ and private schools, high 
schools and colleges will be discussed, and a program has been 
arranged especially for this occasion, so that every interest of 
popular education in the State will be represented. These meet- 
ings are invaluable to our school system, and the importance of 
attending should not be underestimated by any teacher in the 
State. The State Teachers’ Association does much toward 
shaping legislation and advancing the various interests of edu- 
cation. 
It is very essential that school men assemble annually, and, as 
representatives of their schools, discuss educational matters, 
methods of teaching, needed legislation, and co-operate in all 
matters of concern to the schools throughout the State. I desire 
to impress upon you the importance of attending this meeting of 
the Association and to induce others of your County and locality 
to go with you. If the superintendents and teachers in Tennessee 
will take that interest in our State Association that they should, 
* we will demonstrate to other States that our sytem is equal to 
theirs, and our teachers are more active, more capable and more 
efficient, and at the same time render material and permanent 
aid to the cause in which we are all so much interested.

To County Superintendents and Public School Teachers: 
The Public School Law (see Section 56) makes it the duty of 
the County Superintendent of Public Instruction to see that 
one day in the month of November each year be observed by 
the schools of his County as “Arbor Day.” In order to secure 
uniformity and increase interest in its observance, I have recom- 
mended Friday, November 15, 1901, to be “Arbor Day” for the 
public schools of the State of Tennessee. J suggest this date and 
hope to have the hearty co-operation of superintendents, teachers 
and pupils in its practical observance. We have almost 800,000 
children in the State of public school age. If each child can be 
induced to plant a tree about the school house in his district, 
we will have almost a forest of trees on our school grounds. The 
planting of trees will render the school houses and grounds more 
beautiful, attractive and healthful; and will add greatly to the 
comfort and pleasure of students. The teacher in each com- 
munity should make this a holiday occasion and arrange in ad- 
vance an appropriate programme of music, recitations and ad- 
dresses. Have a programme which will be interesting, not only 
to the students, but to the patrons and citizens also. Urge the 
observance of this day and its importance upon each child and 
you will have no difficulty in securing the planting of an abund- 
ance and variety of trees in our school yards. In this manner 
you can, by diligence, render a valuable service to the children 
of Tennessee—present and future. 
Yours very truly,

To County Superintendents and School Teachers: 
The Southern Educational Association will convene at Colum- 
bia, South Carolina, December 26 to 29, 1901. This Associa- , 
tion is composed of prominent educators from all of the South- 
ern States. You will find the program interesting to you. The 
subjects have been carefully and thoughtfully selected, and the 
persons chosen to discuss them are men of recognized ability, 
and they will, no doubt, interest and instruct teachers. This 
Association has done much for education in the South, and 
gives promise of accomplishing greater things in the future. 
This will, in all probability, be the largest and most repre- 
sentative meeting in the history of the Association, and I urge 
. our teachers and superintendents to be present and participate 
in its deliberations. Tennessee stands first in the Southern 
States in her public and private schools, high schools and col- 
leges. We should, therefore, labor earnestly to have our system 
of public schools, as well as the work of our high schools and 
colleges, fairly represented in meetings of this character. I 
believe that a substantial attendance on the part of our teachers 
will be a source of much benefit to education in Tennessee. 
Suitable accommodations have been promised and reduced rates 
secured. I hope you will bring the Association’s meeting to 
the attention of school men in your locality and co-operate with 
me in securing a large and representative attendance of Ten- 
nessee teachers at the Columbia gathering

To County Superintendents and Members of the Several 
County Courts: 
The Fifty-first General Assembly passed an act designated as 
the “County High School Law.” This statute provides for the 
creation, by the County Court, of a County Board of Education, 
_consisting of seven members, one of whom shall be the County 
Superintendent. This Board shall have power to establish one 
or more County High Schools in the county and to maintain 
such school or schools out of any funds designated for that pur- 
pose. Section 2 of the act provides that “the County Court, 
for the purpose aforesaid, shall have power to levy special taxes, 
in addition to other taxes, for school purposes, not to exceed 
fifteen cents on the one hundred dollars on all taxable property, 
to be levied and collected as other county taxes; and the said 
Court shall also have power, for the purpose aforesaid, to make 
appropriations out of any county funds not otherwise appro- _ 
priated, except out of the public school funds, and the funds 
arising from the taxes levied for the purpose and the appropria- 
tion made for the purpose shall constitute a special fund to be 
known as the County High School Fund, which shall be kept 
by the County Trustee separate and apart from all other funds, 
and applied exclusively to the purpose aforesaid.” 
When the County Board of Education is created by the 
County Court and taxes levied for high school purposes, the 
County Board can then establish one or more County High 
Schools and apply the High School Fund to the support and 
maintenance of such institution. The law authorizes the erec- 
tion, by the Board, of a new high school building and empowers 
the Board, where conditions warrant them in so doing, to con- 
solidate the County High School with some public school, county 
or city, or even a private school already established. Not less . 
than three teachers shall be employed in any County High 
School, and the school “shall be open to all children of the 
county of lawful age who shall be otherwise qualified, and who 
410
-P-A-G-E-428
~ have completed the primary school course, or its equivalent, 
as tested by examination or such regulations as may be provided 
by the Board for the admission of pupils. Provided, that 
schools shall be separate for white and colored children. No 
tuition can be charged children of the county desiring to attend 
this school. 
(A course of study must be arranged by the Board, which 
41 include every subject required to be taught in our public 
schools, except those in the first five grades, and in addition the 
Board may provide such high school branches as are necessary 
and expedient. The purpose of the act being to establish, in 
fact, a County High School, with a course of study equal to 
that of standard high schools throughout the country. The 
County High School actswill be found in the recent edition of - 
‘the Public ¢ School } Laws, issued by this department, page 87, 
and on page age 671, ‘Kets of 1899. This law, providing for the 
“@reation of county high schools, makes this institution a creature 
of the County Court, and it is controlled by that honorable body, - i 
through a Board of its own selection, and not through the ; 
regular State and district authorties. It is the peculiar priv- .. 
ilege of the County Court to create the County Board, and 
through it to establish a County High School, and thus to 
provide in each county for the completion of its entire system 
of school education an institution so wisely recommended by 
Thomas Jefferson in the same year in which our independ- 
ence as a nation was declared. Jefferson stated at that early 
date that’ it was the duty of the people in each ‘county to 
establish a County High School, or County College, where all 
the children of the county might be given a fair education and 
receive training in the duties of citizenship within the borders 
of their own county. 
We now have the primary school in all the districts of the | 
State; and in every district where conditions demand and 
public funds justify, secondary schools have been established. 
In order to complete our system, as was certainly the intention 
of its founders, wé must establish in each county the County 
High School, open to all the children of the county alike. 
411
-P-A-G-E-429
More than two thousand children of the State complete an- 
nually the course of study provided in the school of their lo 
cality, and it is the purpose of this law to give this class of 
students a home school free, which will either prepare them 
for the duties of life, or for entrance to a college or university. 
If this high school is established in your county this class of 
young men and young women will receive further school train- 
ing and derive substantial benefits, for which they will, in the 
remaining days of their lives bless the wisdom and patriotism of 
your honorable County Court. 
This law has my unqualified approval, and I urge you, as an 
official and a citizen, to bring the matter before the County 
Court at its January term, and to co-operate heartily with the 
friends of education. in Tennessee in thlis important work. 
Prompt, vigorous and intelligent effort will accomplish much 
for our common cause, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK,

STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Department or Posurc Instruction, 
Nashville, February 26, 1900. 
To County Superintendents: 
The last legislature amended the law relative to the election 
of School Directors in certain districts by providing in Chapter 
218, page 471, Acts of 1899, that: 
“Tt shall be the duty of the Commissioners or other officers of 
elections in the various counties of this State to open and hold 
elections in the various school districts of this State on the 
fourth Saturday in May, 1900, and biennially thereafter, for the 
purpose of electing three School Directors for each school dis- 
trict; provided, that this Act shall also include districts com- 
posed of portions of different counties. Said election shall be 
held and governed by and under the laws now governing gen- 
eral elections, except that these elections shall be held at the 
schoolhouses in the various school districts, or such other places 
A4l2
-P-A-G-E-430
as said election officer may direct, and that the polls shall be 
opened at 1 o’clock P. M., and shall be closed at 5 o’clock P. M.; 
and he officers holding said elections shall not receive any com- 
pensation therefor.” 
Different constructions having been placed upon the intent 
and effect. of this Act, I addressed a letter to the Attorney- 
general for the State asking his construction of the clauses 
quoted herein, and his opinion is contained in. the following 
letter: 
“Knoxvilie, February 2, 1900.—Hon. Morgan C. Fitzpat- 
rick, Nashville, Tenn.—Dear Sir: Replying to your letter of 
recent date, requesting my opinion upon certain matters relat- 
ing to the election of District School Directors. Prior to Chap- 
ter 218, Acts of 1899, it seems that all elections of District 
School Directors were had at the regular August election and at 
the regular voting places in the several districts. This system 
operated satisfactorily im all cases where the school district. 
was co-extensive with the civil district, but was obviously very 
unsatisfactory where the school districts and the civil districts 
were not co-extensive. In the latter case it usually happened 
at a regular election that the voters of a school district. could not 
all attend and vote at the same regular voting place. The 
civil district being composed of portions of two or more school 
districts, the voters were scattered and much confusion raised 
as to the election of School Directors. To obviate this difficulty 
seems to have been the object of the Act of 1899. That Act 
leaves the former law requiring the election of School Directors. 
at a regular voting place and at the regular election in August 
in all cases where the school districts and civil districts are 
coextensive and in all incorporated towns having a school sys- 
tem of their own. Jn this regard the law has not been changed 
by the Act of 1899, but under the Act of 1899, where its school 
district or school districts in any county are not co-extensive 
with the civil districts, or where a school district includes parts 
of civil districts situated in different counties, the election for 
the District School Directors is required to be held on the 
fourth Saturday in May, 1900, and biennially thereafter. The   
413
-P-A-G-E-431
Act fixes the place of holding the election in such places—not 
at the required polling places, but at the schoolhouses in the 
various districts, or at such other places at the Election Com- 
missioners may select. 
“T am of the opinion that the Act applies to any school dis- 
trict in any county which is not co-extensive with the civil dis- 
trict, although there may be other school districts in that coun- 
ty which do correspond with the civil districts. School Di- 
rectors elected under the Act of 1899 are required to enter upon 
their duties within thirty days of their election, just as those 
elected under former Acts are required to do. 
“Yours very truly, 
“G. W. PICKLE, Attorney-General.” 
From the opinion of the Attorney-general, in which I fully 
concur, it will be seen that this Act leaves the former law in 
full force and effect. in all cases where the school districts and 
civil districts are co-extensive, and in such districts the election 
for School Directors should be held at the regular August elec- 
tion, as heretofore. In all other districts the election should be 
held on the fourth Saturday in May, 1900—that is, if in any 
county there is a civil district and school district co-extensive, 
an election should be held in August; but where a school dis- 
trict is composed of only a part of a civil district, or a part of 
two civil districts in a county, or a part of two civil districts in 
adjoining counties, then in all such cases the election should 
be held on the fourth Saturday in May, 1900. In all cases 
where schoo] districts and civil districts are co-extensive an elec- 
tion for Directors should be held in August; in all other cases 
the election should be held on the fourth Saturday in May. 
This construction should not be misunderstood. 
It is the duty of the County Superintendent to ascertain the 
exact status of the school and civil districts in his county and 
to confer with the commissioners of election for his county and 
see that publication is made and that the election is conducted 
in May, in accordance with the provisions of this Act. If in 
any district a voting place has not been established, it is the 
414
-P-A-G-E-432
duty of the Commissioners of Election for the county in which 
such district is located to designate some place—a schoolhouse 
or other place convenient to the voters—for holding the elec- 
tion, appoint officers, and in all other respects supervise this 
election in accordance with the law, just as other elections at 
other times are held. All Directors should qualify within 
thirty days after their election. “Directors now in office should 
leave the selection of teachers for the fall term of schools to 
their successors to be elected in May. 
Yours very truly, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
‘ State Superintendent. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
DerarrMent or Pusuic Insrruction. 
Nashville, September 11, 1901. 
Hon. J. L. M. Curry, General Agent Peabody Education Fund, 
Washington, D. C.: 
Washington, D. C.: 
Sir—I have the honor to submit herewith the annual report 
of Institute work in the State of Tennessee for the school year 
just closed. This report embraces the entire work of County and 
State Institutes; the former supported entirely by State and 
County aid, while the State Peabody Institutes are supported by 
State appropriations and by funds given by the Peabody Board 
of Trust. . 
It may be interesting to you and your Board to know that 
since my incumbency of this office I have succeeded, with the 
assistance of leading school men, in securing an increase in State 
appropriations for Institute purposes. Prior to my induction 
into office the Legislature appropriated biennially $3,000 for 
Institute purposes, which gave the Superintendent only $1,500 
per annum for State and County Institute work. With the assist- 
ance of leading school men, I succeeded in obtaining from the 
last Legislature an appropriation of $10,000 ,which gives me 
415
-P-A-G-E-433
annually $5,000 for the work—an increase in appropriation by 
the State of $7,000 and an increase in the amount to be expended 
by me annually of $3,500. I attribute this increased appropria- 
tion by the Legislature to increased interest in school matters by 
our people everywhere, and believe it to be a legislative indorse- 
ment of the very capable and satisfactory work heretofore aecom- 
plished in these Institutes. Our people also appreciate the sub- 
stantial assistance rendered by the Peabody Board of Trust, and 
the Legislature feels justified in making increased appropriations 
from time to time for work in this State—especially so when ap- 
propriations by our Legislature guarantee further assistance by 
your Board. So thoroughly satifactory has been the work of our 
Institutes recently that it is now the desire and purpose of all 
teachers who are able to do so, to participate in these associations. 
Every County in the State now has its teachers’ association and 
Institute work. From these Counties leading teachers come to 
State Institutes, State Associations and public school officers’ 
meetings. I find that the County Institute is doing a very im- 
portant work in many neglected places and that teachers are 
reached and bettered by these meetings, who are otherwise 80 
situated that they cannot attend more distant educational gather- 
ings. Much of the success of Institute work in this State and 
much of the credit for renewed activity along educational lines 
is due the ninety-six County Superintendents in the State, who, 
with few exceptions, have labored earnestly, faithfully and intel- 
ligently in all these matters. I have also had the hearty co-opera- 
tion and valuable assistance of the Superintendents of our town 
and city schools. Those engaged in private school work, high 
schools, colleges and universities are taking more interest. and are 
lending more assistance to the work of this department than here~ 
tofore. I know that the standard of Superintendents is much 
higher than at any time prior to this. This is attributable to a 
statute passed by our last legislature requiring an examination 
by the State Board of Education of all persons prior to their elec- 
tion to this important office. A better class of superintendents, 
together with the work of County and State Institutes, is doing 
much to improve the rank and file of public school teachers in 
416
-P-A-G-E-434
Tennessee. I do not mean to be understood in this statement as 
saying that every teacher in the State is taking interest. as he 
should in our work or that all of them are accomplishing just 
what we desire, but I am sure that a great majority of the teach- 
ers in our public schools are more determined and more energetic 
in their purposes to improve educational conditions than hereto- 
fore. This is evidenced by the work being accomplished in 
school rooms, by the attendance of pupils, by the increase in the 
number of days taught and by the inerease in salaries paid to 
teachers. I suggest further that as an evidence of hopeful condi- 
tions here, our attendance at the State Teachers’ Association at 
Monteagle was larger and more representative this year.and the 
attendance and work of the Public School Officers’ Association, 
which convened in this city in January, was very gratifying. 
INSTITUTES. 
During my first term as Superintendent I was not able to 
give substantial assistance in Institute work to as many Counties 
of the State as I desired, but with the increased appropriations 
now at my disposal, I will he able to give substantial aid in some 
way to every County in the State. I expended the entire sum 
donated by the Peabody Board of Trust to State Peabody Insti- 
tute work and a large portion of the State appropriation to the 
same work. I have received contributions to the State Institute 
fund from towns where the State Institutes were located. I 
have taken from time to time some portion of the State fund 
with which I have employed competent instructors who went 
into Counties not. within reach of the State Institutes and assisted 
the Superintendent in conducting his County Institute for 
teachers. I find that this not only aids the teacher in the County 
and assists the Superintendent in stirring up the people in his 
locality in educational matters, but work of this character stim- 
ulates teachers and is the means of inducing many to attend the 
State Institutes. The geography of this State is such that I deem 
it necessary to hold annually more than one State Institute for 
white teachers in each grand division, so that teachers in a large 
majority of the counties may have access to them. I have en- 
a7—- AIT
-P-A-G-E-435
deavored to locate the Institutes at desirable places and at such 
points as will be accessible to the greater number of teachers. I 
located an Institute for white teachers at Jonesboro, in upper 
East Tennessee, and another at Cleveland, in lower East Ten- 
nessee; while the State Peabody Institutes for the colored teach- 
ers of East Tennessee was placed at Knoxville, and the Institutes 
for the colored of Middle and West Tennessee were located at 
Nashville and Memphis, respectively. Institutes for white 
teachers in Middle Tennessee were located this yéar at Cooke- 
ville, Clarksville and Columbia—three substantial towns, well 
located, while the Institutes for the white teachers of West Ten- 
nessee were held at Martin and Jackson. I used great care in 
the employment of instructors for all these Institutes and am 
confident that, under the circumstances, I made the very best 
possible selection from among those who desired to do Institute 
work. During the sessions of the State Peabody Institutes I 
visited them and personally inspected the work being done and 
from that inspection, as well as the reports received from the 
faculty in charge, J] am satisfied that much good, substantial 
work was done by each meeting. The attendance in State In- 
stitutes was more than two thousand actual, bona fide teachers, 
representing school interests in almost every locality in the State. 
T regard this as an excellent showing, in view of the fact that the 
teacher is poorly paid in this State for a short term only, and 
that he bears his own expenses while attending State Peabody 
Institutes. This work has so impressed itself upon the public, 
and especially upon directors and trustees in this State, that 
those teachers who hold State Peabody certificates are preferred 
by those employing teachers for the coming terms of school. The 
$1,200 given by the Peabody Board, through you, was expended 
by me for State Peabody Institute work as follows:

1 cannot too strongly emphasize my opinion of the importance 
of this work to the teachers and citizens of this State We 
appreciate the long continued support of yourself and the Pea- 
body Board. I call your attention also to the fact that while 
your Board gives Tennessee $1,200 when our Legislature first 
made an. appropriation of $1,500 per annum, you have not in- 
creased that donation since our Legislature has taken renewed 
interest in it. I referred above to the fact that the recent Legis- 
lature appropriated $10,000 for Institute work in this State as 
an indication of public sentiment here and of a determination on 
the part of our people, through its Legislature, to make perma- 
nent and far-reaching this character of educational work. Many 
teachers of the State have not had college or university training. 
and are so situated in life that the work of County and State 
Institutes is now all they can hope for, and means much to them. 
If all our teachers were graduates of the Peabody Normal Col- 
lege, and if all our young men and young women were able to at- 
tend that Institution, it would lessen the importance of the State 
Institutes. All funds given by the State, the Peabody Board, and 
from all other sources have been economically expended,. and I 
am confident in the belief that nothing has done more to improve 
educational conditions in this State than this branch of our public 
school work. 
EDUCATION IN THE STATE. | 
The general condition of education in Tennessee is far better 
than in many Southern States and much more satisfactory than 
at any period in our history. Our school terms are not as long as 
they should be, and teachers are not yet paid salaries commen- 
surate with services rendered. Neither County Courts nor Leg- 
_islatures have made as large tax levies for public education as the 
419
-P-A-G-E-437
interests of the publie and the State demand. There is a disposi 
tion on the part of these bodies, however, to vote a larger rate of 
taxation than heretofore. Reports just received in this office 
indicate that we have a scholastic population of a little less than 
800,000, and that more than 509-000 of that number have been 
enrolled in our public scbools during the present year. Of 
course, with a scholastic population of 800,000 more than 500,- 
000 should be annually enrolled and more than 400,000 should 
be in actual daily attendance. Our school age, however, is from 
six to twenty-one years, and embraces more than 100,000 chil- 
dren who are not properly public school students. A large num- 
ber do not enter school immediately upon arriving at the age 
of six, while a very large percentage of those of school age 
either complete the public school course before reaching the age 
of twenty-one or quit that course to enter an academy, high 
school or college. You will observe, therefore, that the enroll- 
ment and attendance of those actually recorded by us as of 
school age is very large. In fact, the percentage of attendance 
in this State is greater than in a number of the States of the 
American Union. The city of Nashville has a larger number 
of high schools, colleges and universities than any city in the 
South, and is not surpassed by but few in number in the country. 
The cities of Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Clarksville, 
Lebanon and Jackson have many institutions of interstate reputa- 
tion, and in almost every county town throughout the State we 
have a private institution of standing and high rank. Our Uni- 
versity at Knoxville is in a most prosperous condition and its 
promised attendance for the term soon to begin is large. Van- 
derbilt University, in this city, is recognized as one of the leading 
institutions of the land, and Cumberland University, at Lebanon, 
has its graduates filling positions of honor and responsibility in 
every State South and West. More than twenty institutions are 
now maintained in this State for the exclusive education of young 
women, while all our Universities have opened their doors to 
them. The largest and best equipped Universities for the educa- 
tion of the colored students of the country are situated in this 
State—ihree in Nashville, others in Memphis, Jackson, Athens, 
420
-P-A-G-E-438
Knoxville and Morristown. The State Legislature makes an 
appropriation for colored students and provides a scholarship 
fund for two of either sex from each senatorial district to be 
appointed by the State Senator. These scholarship students may 
attend either of the nine designated institutions for the colored 
in this State. 
The unforunate of this State of both races are amply provided 
for. We have asylums for the care of the afflicted; industrial 
training schools for the wayward, and most excellent institutions 
for the training and higher education of the blind. 
The Industrial School, situated near Nashville, is supported 
entirely by the State, and numbers more than six hundred in 
enrollment. It has two departments—one for the white and 
another entirely separate for the colored. Both sexes are taught 
here as in other institutions in this State. The Industrial School 
has a superior faculty and a practical education is guaranteed 
those who take a full course. Aside from the work of the school 
room, those of both sexes and color are given practical training 
in the field, the garden and the work shop. This Industrial 
~ School, while formerly established for the especial training and 
correction of wayward boys, has done such important work and 
has become so popular among the people of the State that many 
citizens are anxious to place their sons as students in it. This 
Tnstitution has trained many hundreds of boys and girls, and 
with the exception of less than ten of that number, they are 
now filling positions of honor and responsibility throughout the 
country. 
No State in the Union can boast of better care or greater 
advantages shown the blind and deaf and dumb than Tennessee. 
Our State appropriates funds sufficient to give free education to 
these unfortunate persons in our school for the blind at Nash- 
ville and that for the deaf and dumb at Knoxville. So thorough 
and practical is the teaching in these institutions that those who 
receive training in them are enabled to earn an honorable living 
in various avocations.

PEABODY NORMAL COLLEGE. 
The Peabody Normal College, located in the city of Nashville, 
is a favorite institution with the people of Tennessee and the 
South. The University buildings and grounds are the property 
of the Board of Trustees of the University of Nashville and 
that Board gladly gives them, or their use, to this institution. A 
small fund for the support of the institution is derived from the 
University Board. The Legislature appropriates $20,000 per 
annum and the remainder of funds necessary to meet the ex- 
penses of this large and growing institution are donated by the 
Peabody Board of Trust. Formerly the Legislature appropri- 
ated $10,000 per annum: A little later the appropriation was 
increased to $15,000 per annum, and for a number of years that 
body has made an appropriation of $20,000 per annum The 
institution is, therefore, supported by the Peabody Board of 
Trust, the State of Tennessee, through the State Board of Edu- 
cation, and the Board of Trustees of the University of Nash- 
- ville. The institution includes the Peabody Normal College 
proper, the Medical College, the Nashville College of Music, 
Montgomery Bell Academy, and the Winthrop Model School, 
which is really a preparatory school for the College. While the 
‘Winthrope Model is in fact a preparatory school, it is properly 
termed the model school, because, as was intended in its estab- 
lishment, it is a model of up-to-date, thorough, practical teach" 
ing. In this department children are not only taught, but their 
teaching and school work are for the inspection and observation 
of the students of the College. Tere these hundreds of young 
men and young women who are preparing themselves for th pro- 
fession of teaching are able to observe daily the manner and 
method of properly teaching young children. There have been 
enrolled in the Peabody Normal College proper during the 
present year more than six hundred students, which, with those 
attending the Winthrope Model School, number more than nine 
hundred. Those attending the Peabody Normal College in all 
its departments number more than fifteen hundred. These stu- 
dents, by their attendance, show their interest in the Institution 
and the estimation in which it is held by the people of the State. 
422.
-P-A-G-E-440
While I consider six hundred students a very large body for this 
Institution, I may suggest that the number would be larger if 
our facilities there were greater. Scholarships in the senatorial 
districts are eagerly sought by many young men and young 
women annually, and not a vacant scholarship exists in the Insti- 
tution today from Tennessee, and there has never been a vacancy 
in that institution for a period of thirty days since my incum- 
beney of this office. So great has been the increase in attend-. 
ance upon this institution that the chapel in which public exer- 
cises are conducted has not seating capacity sufficient to accom- 
modate the student body. I report this fact because we are 
gratified on account of this large attendance and for the further 
reason that attention may be directed to the importance of the 
erection at an- early date by the proper authorities of additional 
buildings for these students and those who come after them. No 
institution in the country has a more capable, earnest and ener- 
getic faculty or one as poorly paid as that of the Peabody Normal 
College. In every department wen are rendering faithful ser- 
_vices on salaries far less than are paid in other institutions. It 
is remarkable that we are able to retain so many of our capable 
instructors at the salaries paid. It is also to be regretted that 
from time to time professors are leaving this Institution and 
going elsewhere because greater inducements in the way of salary 
is offered. JI believe that an honest and efficient professor will 
render the best service possible while he remains with us, but 
when we can do so salaries ought to be made commensurate with 
services rendered and with the responsibility of the position. 
The State Legislature appropriates, as indicated above, $20,000 
annually toward the support of this Institution, and I believe the 
State of Tennessee, through its Legislature and through its State 
‘Board of Education, will meet the other two boards in control of 
the Institution and do whatever is necessary to make it the great- 
est educational institution of the Sonth, if not the country. 
From year to year we have labored and hoped that this might be 
done. Students here are from every State in the South and there 
are thousands of others yet to be educatd who desire the same 
advantages and opportunities which we are now extending to a 
423
-P-A-G-E-441
limited number only: In my visits through the State and in my 
observation of school work in all the Counties of Tennessee, I 
am of opinion that the graduates of this Institution are doing 
more satisfactory work in our public schools than those of any 
other institution in our country: The students in the College 
are earnest, hardworking, energetic and hopeful: They are not 
from the two extreme classes; they are neither rich nor poor. In 
the most part, they are young men and young women who have 
taught and expect to teach and who desire the special professional 
training which this institution offers. Many of them—most of 
them—have already as teachers, earned the money with which 
they are meeting the necessary expenses here incurred. This 
Institution, therefore, is doing a work: reaching a class and edu- 
eating it, which otherwise would be much neglected by us. The 
students at the Peabody Normal College are, as a class, the most 
earnest, energetic and hopeful that I have seen anywhere, and I 
am confident in the belief that no work of this character in any 
institution is superior to that being done in the Peabody Normal 
College. 
Since the last meeting of the Peabody Board of Trust we have" 
been informed of the tendered resignation of Dr. William H. 
Payne, the distinguished President of the Institution. Dr. 
Payne came to Nashville and to this college when its surround- 
ings were most discouraging, when its attendance was very small. 
From year to year he has labored earnestly for its betterment 
and has been rewarded by seeing its attendance largely increased 
with the years. He has done much for this Institution and much 
for education in this State. His determination to quit the Pea- 
body Normal College was a source of sincere regret to many in 
Nashville and Tennessee. Our people have confidence in those 
who have the destinies of this Institution in charge. They be- 
lieve that a successor to. Dr. Payne, who is in every way worthy 
and well qualified will be selected. They believe that a man 
thoroughly capable to manage a great institution as this is, and 
greater still as it will be, will succeed him. . The Institution is 
now harmonious in all its departments and when the new presi- 
dent is selected and assumes his duties he will have the cordial 
424
-P-A-G-E-442
_ co-operation of all our people and of all departments of the 
College. 
I do not think it improper in the conclusion of this brief sum- 
mary to again express my gratitude and assume to express that 
of the people of the State for the able, patriotic and unselfish 
services rendered this Institution and education in this State and 
in the South by the Peabody Board’s distinguished general agent, 
Hon. J. L. M. Curry. We are not unmindful of his services and 
of the continued support and generosity of the Peabody Board of 
Trust, which he represents. © 
Very respectfully, 
MORGAN C. FITZPATRICK, 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction.

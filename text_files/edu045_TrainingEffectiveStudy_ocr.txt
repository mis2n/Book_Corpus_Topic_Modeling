  EDITOR'S INTRODUCTION 
Tus volume gives emphasis, in a very practical 
form, to a relatively new and a very important aspect 
of the problem of teacher training. Up to at least very 
recently, and in altogether too many cases still, our 
normal schools and teacher-training institutions have 
placed the main emphasis on special methods and 
practice in teaching. The so-called special-methods 
courses in the various elementary-school subjects have 
been given an emphasis clearly beyond their impor- 
tance in the training of a teacher, and practice in class- 
room instruction, often without much careful guidance 
as to means and ends, has been depended on, along 
with a little psychology, to transform the beginner 
into a trained and accomplished teacher. 
The author of the present volume in the Riverside 
Textbooks in Education has taken an entirely different 
view of the process of teacher training, and has placed 
the emphasis on training pupils to organize their study 
procedure in an effective manner and to learn to 
think. Instead of training teachers to assign lessons, 
control discipline, and hear recitations from textbooks 
which the pupils have been directed to memorize, he 
would have teachers trained to direct pupils in study 
habits, and thus emancipate them from a dependence 
on both textbooks and teachers. He would make the

children do the thinking and most of the talking in the 
recitation, the teacher merely directing the process 
and stimulating the pupils to further activity. To do 
this, though, involves that the teacher be trained to 
look after the preparation of the conditions for study, 
think out in advance and direct the pupils as to what 
they are to do, properly motivate the work to be done, 
cause the pupils to erect standards for their work, 
develop in them effective methods for attacking prob- 
lems, and out of such work train the pupils to think 
for themselves and direct their conduct in a demo- 
cratic society such as our own. 
Such work he rightly holds to be a far more funda- 
mental function of the teacher than the assignment of 
lessons, the hearing of recitations, and the testing for 
the memorization of facts. In other words, he shifts 
the main emphasis from the recitation itself to the 
preparation for the recitation, from the accumulation 
of knowledge to learning how to find and use knowl- 
edge, from the gathering of information to learning 
how to use it and hence stand on one’s own feet, from 
drill to appreciation and expression, from learning facts 
to fitting for responsibilities, and from discipline by 
tules to training for rational self-control. The function 
of the teacher then changes from that of hearing reci- 
tations to that of guiding and directing pupils, from 
that of teaching them the accumulated knowledge of 
the past to widening their horizons, and to that of 
training pupils, through the medium of the directed

work of the school, for a life of intelligent self-direction 
amid the real problems of our political and industrial 
society. 
The careful study of such a volume by the students 
in training in our normal schools and teacher-training 
classes, based as it is on the psychology of the instincts 
and of thinking, could displace, with advantage, much 
of the special-methods work now given to intending 
teachers. It deals with the fundamental underlying 
methods for training pupils to think and to acquire 
and use needed information, whereas much of the 
special-methods work still taught in our teacher- 
training institutions deals only with the presentation, 
by the teacher to the child, of traditional courses of 
study material. 
This volume ought also to find an extensive use in 
Teachers’ Reading Circles, as, by reason of its simple 
style, its logical organization, and its many practical 
applications to classroom situations, it is especially 
well calculated to stimulate teachers in service to new 
thinking along the lines here presented, and tend in 
consequence to develop a more intelligent classroom 
procedure.

  PREFACE 
Tus book has been written from a conviction that 
the study period is as important a factor in the child’s 
education as the recitation period, and that it is there- 
fore quite as much the business of the recitation to 
prepare for the subsequent study as it is for the study 
period to prepare for the subsequent recitation. 
There is nothing unique in the writer’s insistence 
upon the importance of having pupils learn how to 
study. As numerous quotations appearing in the book 
show, the best-known modern educators have often 
emphasized its value and deplored the lack of general 
improvement. Some books already published deal 
with phases of the problem in a very helpful way, 
especially in defining what real study should mean, 
and in presenting plans for supervising study periods. 
The thing which still seems to be needed is a recogni- 
tion that but little general improvement in study is 
possible so long as it is considered merely as a problem 
apart from the recitation. The traditional assumption 
that the chief and almost exclusive concern of the 
recitation is with material previously assigned for 
study has been responsible for establishing practices 
in conducting the recitation that still persist very 
generally, and that handicap improvement in study. 
For example, a complaint often heard regarding most 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
xii PREFACE 
pupils is that their conception of study is limited 
chiefly to memorizing. But that style of study was the 
kind demanded by the schools of a generation or two 
ago. In the meantime our conceptions have changed 
both regarding teaching and the meaning of study 
without sufficient general revision of procedure to 
establish correspondingly new methods of study. The 
modern belief that growth in independent self-direc- 
tion and skill in study should be emphasized as among 
the most important aims of the school calls for a criti- 
cal consideration of all practices that influence such 
attainment. 
In attempting such a consideration the writer has 
included in the first chapter an enumeration of factors 
that influence study, with detailed discussion of the 
more general conditions that have vital bearing on its 
improvement. The second, third, and fourth chapters 
deal with those essentials to good study for which 
the recitation period is primarily responsible. In the 
remaining chapters are taken up the special phases 
belonging largely or wholly to the study period itself. 
In the upper grades and high school these are fre- 
quently directed by some teacher other than the one 
conducting the recitation. 
It is recognized that the value of a book in which is 
undertaken such a task as this will depend upon how 
well it connects with conditions as they actually exist. 
With this in mind, the writer has made liberal use of 
illustrative material drawn from the actual classroom

use, under ordinary conditions, of various features 
of organization and practice which have been found 
effective in bringing about better methods and results 
in study. Not only may some of the most common 
present difficulties be relieved by helping pupils toward 
an intelligent, self-reliant use of textbooks, instead of an 
inane servility to them, but at the same time the way 
is also being best prepared for progress in all phases 
of educational practice. Experience shows that a safe 
and successful transition to the project method of 
school instruction is dependent upon the facility devel- 
oped in pupils for handling effectively their independ- 
ent undertakings and investigations. This book is put 
forth in the earnest hope that it may prove helpful in 
making such a transition to the wider use of all prac- 
tices that call forth greater initiative and responsibil- 
ity on the part of pupils.

  TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE 
STUDY 
CHAPTER I 
THE MEANING, IMPORTANCE, AND CONDITIONS 
OF STUDY 
Tue importance of having children acquire the 
power of effective study has often been emphasized. 
Proficiency in this respect not only ensures their suc- 
cessful progress in school, but increases in value after 
school days are past. There is nothing more essential 
to the best citizenship than the ability to investigate 
intelligently and reach an independent conclusion on 
public questions. Especially now in the reconstruc- 
tion period following the war, when former facts and 
principles are being revised or discarded, the thing of 
greatest permanent value is the power to master new 
principles as they arise and grasp the new facts neces- 
sary to the readjustments demanded. As Bagley has, 
said, “ To teach a child to study effectively is to do there 
most valuable thing that cbuld be done to help him 
adjust himself to any environment of modern civilized 
life into which he may be thrown.” 
No general improvement. In spite of frequent com- 
plaints regarding the failure of pupils to learn how to
-P-A-G-E-20
  2 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
study, and the occasional examples of good work in the 
right direction to be found in the best schools, there 
has been very little general improvement. In 1885 
G. Stanley Hall declared: “At least three fourths of all 
the time spent by a boy of twelve in trying to learna 
hard lesson out of a book is time thrown away. Perhaps 
one fourth of the time is devoted to more or less desper- 
ate and conscientious effort, but the large remaining 
portion is dwindled away in thinking of the last game of 
ball or longing for the next game of tag.” In 1905 
Bagley said: “This phase of schoolroom activity or 
inactivity is beyond doubt responsible for much more 
than one half of the serious waste of time that our 
American system involves. The time spent by the 
average child in ‘preparing lessons’ is very largely 
time thrown away.” In 1909 F. M. McMurry, in 
commenting upon the pupils’ lack of ability to study 
as revealed in an investigation conducted by Earhart, 
asserted: “It is, perhaps, unnecessary to collect proofs 
that pupils do not learn how to study, because teachers 
admit the fact very generally. Parents who supervise 
their children’s studies, or who otherwise know about 
their habits of work, observe the same fact with sor- 
row.” In 1917 Strayer and Norsworthy declared: 
“Many teachers have taught subjects, but not how to 
study subjects. The latter is more important.” These 
comments, extending over a period of thirty-two years, 
and expressing the judgment of such well-known edu- 
cators, indicate that there is still a general need for
-P-A-G-E-21
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 3 
revision of our aims and practices in the schoolroom 
before satisfactory progress can be made in curing 
this long-standing weakness. 
Waste must stop. The increasingly insistent de- 
mand that waste be eliminated and that school prac- 
tices conform to efficiency standards means that this 
much-criticized condition will not continue to be toler- 
ated. Even worse than the mere loss of valuable time 
is the fact that one of the most important aims which 
education in a free nation can have has largely failed of 
attainment. In the present reappraisal of educational 
values, careful studies are being made to determine 
just what training and equipment our boys and girls 
most need in order to meet successfully the responsi- 
bilities of a new era, and there is a corresponding deter- 
mination to reshape the work of the schools toward 
these objectives regardless of traditional practices. In 
this movement a need so universally recognized as that 
for better training in the art of study must receive in- 
creasing attention. 
What skill in study includes. Before discussing how 
the teacher is to assist pupils in acquiring this art, it is 
necessary to define in a general way what is meant by 
skill in studying. First of all it signifies the ability to 
direct one’s mental energies effectively in carrying 
through to successful completion some reasonable 
undertaking or assignment. The task may involve 
memorizing, drill, and the mastery of mechanical 
processes; it may involve searching out needed infor-
-P-A-G-E-22
  4 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
mation and putting it into usable form; or it may con- 
sist in concentrating thought upon the solution of 
problems — either the direct practical problems inci- 
dental to some project, or the more academic ones 
arising from history, geography, mathematics, or 
science. In any case the mental attitude must be alert, 
aggressive, and active, bent upon attaining definite 
Jesults. Real skill in study means the power of effec- 
~ tive, independent self-direction.\ 
The difference between skill in study and its op- 
posite is plainly apparent in the pupil’s use of a text- 
book. Indiscriminate memorizing, mechanical and 
inattentive reading of lessons over and over, inability 
to distinguish between important and unimportant 
material, passive acceptance of what the book seems to 
say, however ridiculous the interpretation may be — 
in short, an attitude toward the textbook of indiffer- 
ence, helplessness, or servile, indiscriminating acquies- 
cence — these are the opposite of good studying. Ef- 
fective study, on the other hand, regards the textbook 
merely as a means to an end, as containing some mate- 
rial of major importance and other of minor impor- 
tance. It assumes that the author had an intelligent 
purpose back of his sentences, and will not rest content 
until a meaning has been wrested from them consistent 
with that purpose. It proceeds to “husk out” the 
significant material, and to ignore what does not con- 
tribute to the purpose in hand. Above all it keeps 
a critical attitude throughout, testing and checking
-P-A-G-E-23
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 5 
every principle by the individual’s experience and 
reason, as master and not slave to the text. 
Not an impossible standard. Although there is a 
wide divergence between this standard and the pro- 
ficiency, or lack of it, shown during the study period 
in most schoolrooms, it is not an impossible one to 
attain. Indeed, there are schools in which skill in 
study is made the chief aim and in which the pupils 
approximate the proficiency suggested in the preceding 
paragraph. In fact there are to be found in every 
school pupils who exhibit this independence, skill, and 
persistence in searching out information and mastering 
the difficulties connected with some special field of 
investigation in which they have an absorbing interest. 
The subjects of study are likely to be aeroplanes, sub- 
marines, radio-telegraphy, or something else not im- 
mediately a part of their schcol-work, and still less 
closely connected with using ordinary textbooks. But 
it suggests the possibilities dependent on making con- 
ditions favorable to independent study, rather than 
opposed as they now regularly are. 
Conditions necessary for good study. Apart from 
the general conditions which influence study, there are 
four essentials which must be observed in order to 
ensure any general success in guiding pupils toward 
the acquisition of skill in this line. Successful study is 
directly dependent upon the following conditions: 
1. The pupil must have a clear idea of what is to be 
accomplished in his work. There can be no real or active
-P-A-G-E-24
    6 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
study, either in school or out, unless one has in mind a 
definite question or problem to which an answer is 
sought or a definite attainment which is to be ac- 
quired. Mere “ going over” an assigned number of 
pages tends to defeat rather than promote this re- 
quirement. F 
2. There must be a sufficient motive or reason for the 
study. Self-activity springs only from interest. With- 
out it work becomes drudgery, unproductive of any 
good results in school, and conducive to permanent 
distaste for all the school represents. 
8. The methods of study must be effective if the best 
results are to be accomplished. Clumsy methods are 
discouraging, cause unnecessary work, and often fail 
completely of results. Methods vary with the type of 
work to be done, and a pupil should distinguish be- 
tween the way to attack a problem-solving task, and 
the way to memorize a drill exercise. 
4, There must be sustained effort until results are 
secured. Pupils may begin well, but soon their “ wits go 
wool-gathering,” and they sit facing their book, but 
with thoughts far away. By making conditions favor- 
able to concentration and continuous effort much 
improvement is possible. 
In most cases the thing that will cause improvement 
in any one of these conditions will help also in another 
or possibly all. For example, good methods of study 
are favorable to persistence in study, as is also a vigor- 
ous motive. But the weakness of any pupil or class
-P-A-G-E-25
CONDITIONS OF STUDY % 
will be due chiefly to shortcomings in some one of 
these essentials, and for that reason a separate chapter 
is given to each. Such a plan seems the best one for 
helping the teacher diagnose the pupil’s difficulties, 
locate the particular phase of study essentials which 
needs strengthening, and apply the remedy which 
most directly touches the source of trouble. 
The textbook system of instruction. One great 
fact in our school system that furnishes both the neces- 
sity for proficiency in studying and the opportunity 
for acquiring it is the American plan of textbook in- 
struction. This system itself, rather than our method 
of teaching, has favored the development of such 
ability in independent study as is to be found among 
those who have attended our public schools. For the 
pupil’s essential problem is to find what he wants from 
the printed pages, just as he will often need to do in 
later life. Moreover, with the prevalence of supple- 
mentary texts, he frequently finds conflicting authori- 
ties and has the opportunity to make independent 
judgments as to their comparative reliability. We 
used frequently to hear the oral-instruction system of 
Germany praised in contrast with our own. But the 
results of having pupils receive unquestioningly the 
dictated opinions of a teacher, with no opportunity of 
taking an independent or critical attitude on their own 
part, appeared during the World War in the tragedy of 
a great nation accepting without question any word, 
however wild or distorted, that fell from the lips of  
-P-A-G-E-26
  8 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
“authority.” By contrast, the critical yet reasonable 
attitude of the American public not only gave evidence 
of the fundamental soundness of our system, but 
pointed the direction in which further progress should 
lie. 
Textbook study and outside study. Modern educa- 
tional practice is tending more and more toward the 
project type of work, with its incidental problems as a 
basis for study. Consequently somewhat less use is 
made of the textbook and the use made is more intelli- 
gent. This tendency promises much of value in the 
way of making school-work vital and significant to the 
pupils. The study involved in carrying through an 
independent project usually has sufficient motive sup- 
plied by the project itself. The other three condi- 
tions to successful study are also apt to be more easily 
fulfilled when a problem-project is whole-heartedly 
undertaken by a pupil or group of pupils. In regard to 
material for study, the effect of this is not to supersede 
the textbook, but to require better methods of study- 
ing and using it. Even the most thoroughgoing “proj- 
ect curriculum” involves more or less extended use of 
textbooks or reference books as sources of basic, sup- 
plementary, or corroborative material. 
Upon the skill shown in selecting and acquiring the 
needed facts from these sources depends largely the 
success of each undertaking. Wherever the project 
plan has proved disappointing, it has almost invariably 
been due to the children’s inability to do intelligently
-P-A-G-E-27
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 9 
the incidental reading and study involved. So, both 
as a remedy for present needs and as the basis for 
extending successfully the use of the project method 
of vitalizing school-work, our first task is to develop 
greater power and facility in the use of textbooks. 
Consequently the aim in this book has been first of all 
to discuss means of helping pupils attain an intelligent 
mastery over the textbook, and incidentally to suggest 
ways of. applying and extending this power in the 
investigation of any problems growing out of their 
interests. 
Practices unfavorable to improved study habits. Al- 
though the special conditions controlling effective 
study are reserved for separate treatment in later 
chapters, there are certain general conditions unfavor- 
able to study that are occasioned by common prac- 
tices in the schoolroom., A just emphasis upon the 
importance of study, such as is unanimously voiced by 
our leading educators, demands that these practices be 
subjected to a critical scrutiny, with a view to deter- 
mining whether they cannot be modified or even 
abolished without undue loss to the work of the school. 
Certainly nothing should be allowed to interfere with 
accomplishing that aim. At least three of these de- 
serve treatment here, not only because they all have 
vital influence in discouraging proper study, but also 
because there is ample trustworthy data for condemn- 
ing them, and their correction is largely or entirely 
within the power of the individual teacher.
-P-A-G-E-28
  10 ‘TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
1. Misplaced emphasis in recitation 
Teacher “too active” in recitation. One practice 
that is unfavorable to developing independence in 
study is the tendency on the part of most teachers 
either to do too much of the talking, or to dominate 
too completely the character of the recitation. Kings- 
ley humorously said, “Children once used to learn a 
lesson and say it to the teacher, whereas nowadays the 
teacher learns the lesson and says it to the children.” 
In our worthy endeavor to get away from the vicious 
custom once followed of requiring pupils to repeat 
verbatim the words studied, we have gone to the op- 
posite extreme of apparently expecting that nothing 
will be definitely mastered during the study period. 
Consequently almost the entire recitation period is 
spent in “going over” what had been assigned for 
study. The teacher, from her clear knowledge of the 
material under discussion, has decided what should be 
said about it. Accordingly the pupil’s halting state- 
ments as to what he learned during the study period 
merely furnish a starting-place for a more or less 
extended cross-examination until that pupil or some 
other pupil is cornered into saying what the teacher 
wishes said about the topic. 
The process frequently consumes much time, but 
her success i getting certain words said affords the 
teacher a pleasurable feeling of triumph. If, however, 
she does not succeed, and is compelled to say herself

the words she wishes said, she is correspondingly 
humiliated, and in her annoyance may say other things 
not originally planned. Pupils soon discover that a 
smattering familiarity with the assigned work and skill 
in divining the teacher’s wishes stand them in better 
stead than attempts to make definite, independent 
judgments regarding the material studied. The natu- 
ral result is the “Is that what you want?” type of reci- 
tation, instead of initiative and independence. Other 
teachers, in their effort to “enrich” the recitation, 
offer a profusion of additional information, comments, 
and illustrations. The pupils usually find this enter- 
taining, and much of it may have real value, but there 
is always danger that the time consumed could be 
better used in other activity. The standard by which 
the value of recitation procedure must be judged does 
not consist in the number of facts presented, but in the 
increased power developed in the pupils. 
A recitation period of generous length, along with 
its splendid possibilities for good, is especially liable 
to this danger of “talking to death” the possibilities 
for improved study. Hall-Quest, in his helpful book 
for high-school teachers on Supervised Study, gives 
many instances of the benefits resulting from shorten- 
ing the actual time given to reciting, and using the 
remainder of the period for improving the methods of 
study. In the elementary school it is very doubtful if 
more than twenty minutes should regularly be allowed 
for strictly recitation work. How any remaining time  
-P-A-G-E-30
  
12 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
available should be used for the sake of better study 
will be discussed later. As McMurry puts it, “The art 
of teaching will then consist not only in ability to pre- 
sent ideas, but also in ability to keep still. . . not the 
least of [the teacher’s] rewards is the fact that she is 
allowed to rest her voice.” The ill effects of “‘over- 
reciting” the pupils may be estimated from the con- 
trasting gain under even the bad opposite condition 
where the recitation time is inadequate for the best 
teaching. This is to be found in rural schools, and 
overcrowded city schoolrooms. 
Children in rural schools. It is a matter of common 
experience and comment that pupils who have com- 
pleted the grades in rural schools show marked superi- 
ority in high school over their classmates from town or 
city schools in the matter of independent study. Ow- 
ing to the number of grades taught by a rural teacher, 
each class spends a very small part of the day in recita- 
tion, and a proportionately long time at “study.” In 
the primary grades the pupils are unable, of course, to 
use this time for study, and the hours they sit daily, 
staring about and waiting for the brief visits of the 
teacher, constitute one of the most lamentable facts in 
the rural-school problem. Even in the upper grades 
there is a great deal of unused and misused time during 
the periods allotted to study, but most of the pupils, in 
sheer self-defense against the ennui of prolonged idle- 
ness, work out some method of study. 
These haphazard methods are usually memoriter in
-P-A-G-E-31
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 13 
character, often cumbrous and unnecessarily laborious 
in use, and almost never as direct or effective as those 
that could and should be taught. But, by way of com- 
pensation, persistence and independence are acquired, 
since the teacher is busy elsewhere and cannot be ap- 
pealed to for help at every difficulty encountered, and 
it is these virtues, rather than especial skill in study, 
which enable the rural pupil, in spite of poor teaching 
and other handicaps, to make a better showing than 
the average city pupil when they face together the task 
of mastering a new and difficult high-school subject. 
Large classes in cities. The fact that pupils lose 
mental strength and independence from being “re- 
cited ” too much, and that this principle holds equally 
with city or country pupils, is indicated by the follow- 
ing statement and statistics furnished by A. W. Plum- 
mer, Chairman of the Arithmetic Committee of the 
Los Angeles Schools, and published in the Sierra Edu- 
cational News for September, 1919: 
From an arithmetic test given by Mr. Lane, Director of 
Research of the Los Angeles city schools, I found that 16 
rooms of 40 or more pupils averaged 62 above city grade; 
98 rooms of less than 40 pupils averaged 14 below city grade; 
also, that 62 rooms of double classes (B and A) averaged 
.06 3-7 above city grade, and 48 rooms of single classes 
(either B or A) averaged only .00 1-6 above city grade. This 
latter statement indicates that pupils have a better chance 
in rooms of two classes. _ 
From a letter recently received from Mr. S. A. Courtis, 
formerly Superintendent of Educational Research, Detroit, 
I quote the following: “I have made several tabulations of 
effect of size of class upon scores of standard tests, both in
-P-A-G-E-32
  14 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
arithmetic and in other subjects, and in both Boston and 
Detroit ... the advantage, if any; being on the side of larger 
classes; that is, classes of 55 on the average made rather 
better scores than classes of 45, and these better than 35 and 
so on.” 
Jessup and Coffman state, in their volume on The Super- 
vision of Arithmetic, that Dr. J. M. Rice gave a test to 
6000 grammar-grade children, distributed through eighteen 
school buildings in seven cities. 
Dr. Rice said: “The number of pupils per class was larger 
in the highest six schools than it was in the schools of City 
VI, and the classes were exceptionally small in the school 
that stands at the lower end.” 
Mr. Plummer’s comment on these facts was as fol- 
lows: 
From years of experience in the classroom and as super- 
vising principal, I have been convinced, for a long time, that 
large classes, 40 to 48 or 50, give the pupils a better chance 
to gather intellectual strength than do classes of from 30 to 
40 pupils. 
Children are intellectual beings and after being directed 
should be given a chance to grow, which must be by their 
undisturbed efforts. The teacher should keep out of the 
child’s mental road, a part of the time, at least. 
From the foregoing it is evident that part of the 
recitation activity usually engaged in may defeat some 
of the most important purposes of education. No one 
questions the fact that pupils in rural schools or over- 
crowded city rooms lose much that the school should 
give, and it is equally unquestionable that other pupils 
would gain much in self-reliance and power, without 
corresponding loss of their present advantages, if only 
their teachers would resist the temptation in recitation 
time either to push discussions to unnecessary length
-P-A-G-E-33
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 15 
or to dominate too completely the details of the recita- 
tion. The teacher who is willing to assume less promi- 
nence and to endeavor instead to stimulate, by sym- 
pathetic encouragement, greater initiative and respon- 
sibility on the part of the class for its own discussion, 
is rewarded in more ways than one. In the first place 
there are easier nerves through the diminution of fruit- 
less questions. But best of all is the satisfaction of 
seeing develop in the pupils through this deliberate 
plan a resourcefulness and power greater than that 
unintentionally developed in those schools where the 
stress of multiplied duties makes it impossible for the 
teacher to do too much either of right or wrong things 
during recitation periods. 
2. Wrong type of examinations 
The function of tests and examinations. A second 
factor which discourages improvement in the power 
to study, and which is also easily subject to correction, 
is the character of the usual examination. Intelligent 
teaching demands that there be adequate testing of 
results, and this testing must often take the form of 
some kind of examination. The kind of test which 
they expect to meet at the end of any unit of work has 
a very strong influence upon the pupils in determining 
the character of work they will do in conscious or un- 
conscious preparation for it. It is equally true, though 
not so generally recognized, that the teacher is also 
strongly influenced in directing the efforts of her pu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  
16 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
pils, and especially in the relative emphasis given to 
any type of work, by the kind of test she expects to 
give or to have given to them. 
For example, the chief value accruing from the in- 
creased use of standardized tests and measurements 
has been the effect in causing teachers to make a more 
intelligent distribution of the emphasis due the vari- 
ous phases of their work, and thus to correct hitherto 
unsuspected weaknesses in their teaching. For that 
reason standardized tests should be used in all lines of 
work in which they have been scientifically worked 
out and their reliability proved. Unfortunately, how- 
ever, their field is limited as yet mainly to the mechan- 
ical phases of school-work, and there seems no immedi- 
ate prospect of their successful application to such 
subjects as geography, history, literature, and most of 
the high-school subjects. The necessity of using some 
other kind of test in these subjects, and the potent 
influence which this test has in determining the char- 
acter both of the teaching and learning, combine to 
make it highly essential that this be the right sort of 
test. Consequently, if an examination is given, it 
should be one which really tests progress in the quali- 
ties and results which the school should most encour- 
age, and one which influences the activities of all con- 
cerned toward the better development of power, skill, 
and resourcefulness on the part of the pupils. 
Most examinations are merely memory tests. The 
examinations usually given, and the manner of giving
-P-A-G-E-35
ee CONDITIONS OF STUDY 17 
them, fail to meet these requirements. For the most 
part they are confessedly tests of memory, preceded 
by strict injunctions that all books, notes, and other 
material that might assist in reproducing the finished 
products of the past are to be put securely away. The 
effect, both at the time of the examination and before, 
is to exalt mere memorizing at the expense of power 
and independent thought. A certain amount of mem- 
orizing is, of course, a necessary element of good 
study, but it should be strictly subordinate to rational 
organization and clear comprehension. The influence 
of the memory type of examination is most harmful to 
immature pupils who have not yet developed good 
standards or methods of study. Various sentences in 
their textbooks may frequently be found marked for 
memorization, but very rarely indeed are these selected 
as a result of independent thought or because they | 
have been found interesting and stimulating. Their 
selection is due instead to hints dropped by the teacher 
that these particular facts are likely to be needed when 
examination day comes around, for most teachers who 
use this kind of test, realizing that the pupils will not 
remember everything touched upon, try to influence 
them toward remembering the things which have been 
vaguely chosen as the material for the examination. 
It is readily apparent how subversive this arrangement 
is of everything resembling independent, self-directed 
study. 
Open-book examinations. The problem then of 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  18 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
measuring results in those fields of school-work not yet 
adequately covered by standardized tests is to select 
such plans of examination as will not emphasize mem- 
orizing to the detriment of more important considera- 
tions. The writer is convinced, after extended experi- 
ment, that this can best be attained in the upper grades 
and high school by giving most examinations, and 
certainly the most important examinations, with text- 
books freely open for such use as the pupils care to 
make of them. This immediately compels the elimina- 
tion of those questions that are merely tests of mem- 
ory, so that they are no longer allowed to usurp undue 
prominence or to exert distorting influence upon the 
aims and methods of teaching and study. Any need 
for testing the pupils’ retention of important facts can 
best be satisfied by a frank and avowed test for that 
purpose, and can usually be given most profitably in 
the earlier part of any unit of work, when there is most 
need for assured mastery of such facts as a basis for 
comprehending larger problems of the subject, instead 
of at the end when their immediate usefulness is nearly 
over. 
By such an arrangement the main examinations can 
be made to test the pupils’ real progress and working 
ability with such tools accessible as he would have in 
solving the problems of later life. We do not rate a 
lawyer’s standing by the number of statutes he can 
rattle off from memory, but rather by his skill in find- 
ing just what he needs and in applying these citations
-P-A-G-E-37
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 19 
to the case in point. Indeed, we should justly feel 
suspicious as to the competence of a physician or an 
engineer who presumed to settle important questions 
from memory, and we reserve our confidence for those 
instead who show ready familiarity with the best 
sources of information and thoughtful precision in the 
selection and use of needed data. At the same time it 
would, of course, be a condemning weakness in either 
a pupil or a professional man to be under the necessity 
of looking up a very large proportion of the informa- 
tion needed, but the mere fact that it is accessible 
removes disturbing factors that tend to prevent clear 
thinking. Just as a lawyer, about to appear in an im- 
portant trial, if warned by some eccentric judge that 
no law books would be allowed in the court-room, in 
his nervous apprehension lest he forget some needed 
scrap of all the possible citations he had tried to mem- 
orize, would surely make a far less creditable showing 
in every way than if his preparation had been under 
circumstances favorable to clear thinking; so the pupil, 
facing the trial of examination day, can hardly be 
expected to use better methods of study and prepara- 
tion, or do clearer thinking in his test, if the condi- 
tions are equally unfavorable. 
Such examinations not easy. When the use of open- 
book examinations is suggested to teachers, their first 
‘thought is that pupils would be able to answer prac- 
tically any question asked. Repeated experiments 
have shown that this is far from true. In our trials of
-P-A-G-E-38
  
  20 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
this plan practically every teacher at first prepared 
questions entirely too difficult. In fact there are 
hardly any circumstances under which the weakness 
of an incompetent pupil is so apparent as when he 
is staring helplessly at pages which refuse to do his 
thinking for him. One of the first results of the plan is 
always the revelation that most pupils who do poor 
work fail because of inability to get from the textbook 
anything except, perhaps, obvious scraps for memo- 
rizing. Consequently both teachers and pupils, in 
preparation for a better showing next time, begin 
consciously to try ways of using books to better advan- 
tage. Pupils will be found practicing on the use of the 
index, and writing condensed summaries. The writer 
has seen these latter worked out voluntarily to a degree 
that constituted almost ideal exercises in textbook 
study, but involving more effort than any teacher 
would think of requesting in addition to regular 
assignments. 
There are other good results from the open-book 
examination, such as removing the temptation to crib 
and cheat, and lessening the nerve-shaking dread, 
most of which is apprehension that some tricky slip of 
memory will wreck a train of thought and defeat pro- 
longed preparation. It meets the objections of those 
who, in their protest against the harmful features of 
the memory type of examination, would go to the 
extreme of giving none at all. But its sufficient justi- 
fication is in its positive value as really testing and 
stimulating right methods of study.
-P-A-G-E-39
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 21 
Tests two important results of study. At least two 
important results of study and of school-work in 
general can be tested by an examination of this char- 
acter which are not usually now being tested in any 
adequate way. These are, first, the pupil’s ability to 
carry out a connected line of thinking on any question 
with only such slight references to books as any 
thoughtful person would be expected to make under 
such circumstances, and, second, the pupil’s skill and 
judgment in selecting quickly from an extended range 
of material only those facts needed for some special 
purpose. For example, when a teacher gave to a 
class in history the following question, “Tell why you 
would, or would not, have voted for Henry Clay for 
President,” some pupils wrote their answers with no 
reference whatever to the textbook; others merely gave 
a hasty glance or two to verify their impression as to 
his attitude on certain policies; while those who spent 
more than two minutes thumbing over the book in 
search of a substitute for independent thought were 
unable to write any satisfactory answer. The test was 
plainly one of thought and not of memory. 
In the same examination, another question was, 
“What issues were settled by each of the compromise 
bills presented by Clay?” The time limit allowed no 
leisure for clumsy turning of pages back and forth; 
there was just convenient time for demonstrating skill 
in locating, selecting, and summarizing facts. Weak- 
ness in any of these activities was apparent in the
-P-A-G-E-40
  22 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
incomplete and unsatisfactory answer. This plan of 
thus determining definitely the precise points in which 
the pupil is weak is of utmost value in its influence 
upon later methods, for the chief justification of any 
method of testing must be in its reaction upon the 
work both of teacher and pupils. 
Miss Mabel E. Simpson, who, in collaboration with 
Mr. Hall-Quest, worked out very successfully a plan 
covering some phases of supervised study as described 
in her helpful book, Supervised Study in History, came 
to recognize that the examination should test improve- 
ment along the lines mentioned above. Accordingly in 
her specimen list of test questions, or “Examination 
Lesson” as she terms it, she includes the following: 
6. Consult one of the books upon the table; find all the 
information you can upon the following topic: “The Print- 
ing Press.” Read this information carefully, list the pages 
read, and then contrast the present system of printing with 
that employed by Franklin. 
7. Using the information gained in reading the references 
found upon “The Printing Press,” apply the old adage, 
“Necessity is the mother of invention,” to the great devel- 
opment made in the methods of printing. 
As the author explains, the purpose of the first 
question quoted is to measure the pupil’s ability to 
make intelligent use of a book in locating and applying 
information; and that of the second to measure his 
ability to reason accurately from given data. Before 
this and other lines of work for improving power to 
study were introduced, the limitations of the pupils in
-P-A-G-E-41
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 23 
her history classes are described in these words: “It 
soon became evident that my pupils had no ability to 
do independent study. Their only idea of study was to 
memorize the facts contained in the text. It never 
seemed to occur to them to question statements or 
investigate points which were not clear.” Most teach- 
ers will recognize this state of affairs as something by 
no means peculiar to that school. It is surely time that 
a general effort be made to influence pupils toward a 
different conception of study by having our exami- 
nations call for correspondingly different and more 
worthy attainments. 
3. “Lock-step” classification and promotion 
Faults in system of class instruction. The third 
general practice that discourages independence in 
study is not so easily remedied. Our system of class 
instruction played a valuable part in the extension of 
free public schools at a time when there was apparently 
no other way of educating large groups of children on 
the very meager financial support that the people were 
willing to contribute in taxes. Its economy has re- 
mained a powerful argument in favor of the system 
even to the present time, and in most of the plans for 
improved administration in school affairs it has been 
assumed that each teacher will always have in her 
room large groups of pupils, all reciting or studying 
the same things at the same time and at the same rate. 
This handling of pupils in mass formations enables 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  
  24 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
boards of education to make a more economical “cost 
per pupil” showing to the taxpayers than any other 
system that has yet been tried on any large scale in 
the public schools. But it has many fundamental 
weaknesses, some of them so closely connected with 
unsatisfactory study that any attempt to improve the 
latter must recognize these faults of the system, and 
attempt to neutralize them by compensating adjust- 
ments in individual assignments if circumstances do 
not permit more radical changes. 
It assumes, for example, that children of a given age 
are so nearly uniform in ability and interests that any 
chance group of them assembled into a schoolroom 
will make the same rate of progress through the same 
work with so nearly uniform success that all or nearly 
all will be ready for promotion on the same day. Many 
writers have pointed out the fallacy of this assumption, 
among them Dr. Burk, who bitterly sets forth what 
he calls “an indictment of the class system of instruc- 
tion by which all pupils in our schools, indiscrimi- 
nately, and without regard to differences of mentality, 
temperament, inborn talents, or tastes, health, ab- 
sences, etc., are marshaled through the grades by 
platoons in tight lock-step.” There is no doubt that 
this uniformity of treatment is responsible for much 
retardation, not only of slow pupils who are not quite 
able to keep up with the class and so must drop back 
a whole grade or half-grade and try to go equally fast 
with the next group, but also of the stronger pupils
-P-A-G-E-43
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 2 
who could go much more rapidly, and yet are hardly 
able to skip a whole grade. The exasperation that 
comes from being held in a crowd that either drags 
one off his feet by compelling him to move too fast or 
frets him with its dull slowness, incites pupils to leave 
school or increases disciplinary difficulties. Still other 
shortcomings might be charged against the system, 
but this discussion must be limited to those phases 
that handicap improvement in study. 
Uniformity not stimulating to study. The practice 
of asking all the pupils in a class to do the same work 
in the same time, fair and impartial as it may seem, 
in reality is very far from being fair, and certainly is 
not conducive to the best study on the part of all the 
pupils. Wherever the silent-reading tests have been 
given to determine the rate at which pupils read to 
gather thought, and their accuracy in interpreting 
what they read, wide discrepancies have regularly been 
found among the pupils of the same room and grade. 
For example, it is not unusual to find that the best 
pupil in a room skims along six times as fast as the 
poorest pupil, and at the same time is more accurate 
in getting the thought. Occasionally the best fourth 
of all the pupils in the same grade will be found to 
read three times as rapidly as the poorest fourth of 
their classmates. 
In the face of these inequalities of power, it is obvi- 
ously neither fair to the slow pupils nor stimulating 
to the quick ones to give all one uniform assignment.
-P-A-G-E-44
  
  26 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
Vigorous, effective study is dependent on interest, and 
interest is deadened equally bya task hopelessly beyond 
one’s ability or one that presents insufficient difficulty 
to challenge one’s resources. Even the pupils of 
average ability, for whose capacities such assignments 
are intended, are hardly stimulated to put forth pains- 
taking effort when they realize that the same point 
will be more glibly recited on by the bright pupils, 
who will have prepared for it without tiresome effort 
and with leisure to spare. The attempt to fit wholesale 
requirements, gauged for so-called average pupils, to 
the widely varying capacities of any class, is Tespon- 
sible for most of the discouragements to improved 
study that inhere in the class system of instruction. 
Experimental attempts at radical change. Various 
educators, realizing these defects, have tried to demon- 
strate the practicability of reorganizing the schools 
upon the basis of individual instruction. Superintend- 
ent Search, while in charge of the Pueblo schools, gave 
wide publicity to the plan which he introduced there. 
Since then accounts of various schools using similar 
systems have occasionally appeared in print. Most of 
these schools have been private schools, and with a 
limited number of pupils. In spite of the claims made 
in its favor as a cure for the admittedly wasteful faults 
of the class system of teaching, the scheme of trans- 
forming the school organization to such a basis has 
never met wide favor. One reason for this has been the 
general conviction that the necessity of assigning
-P-A-G-E-45
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 27 
smaller groups to each teacher would immediately 
require such additions to the teaching force as to entail 
prohibitive expense. A second, and even more vital, 
reason has been a somewhat vague, but persistent, 
feeling among school authorities that pupils receiving 
strictly individual instruction missed certain social 
values that the usual class receives from its group 
recitation. There is no question that a mastery of facts 
and processes can be more quickly attained by sepa- 
rate instruction for each pupil, but such a plan tends 
almost inevitably toward reducing the study of any 
subject to the mere acquisition of its facts and proc- 
esses, at the sacrifice of the opportunities it affords 
for socialized activity. 
Socialized recitation demands group participation. 
With the present emphatic tendency in education 
toward the socialized recitation and the socialized 
curriculum, the belief is becoming more definitely 
expressed that in many school subjects the facts them- 
selves are not of so much importance as the occasion 
and material furnished in the acquisition and use of 
these facts for socialized, codperative group participa- 
tion. We frequently hear that it is the duty of the 
school to give training im, rather than facts about, 
citizenship, and in the social sciences and correlating 
phases of other subjects, individual instruction that 
omitted the interplay of class participation would be 
likely to miss some of the best educative values which 
those subjects are capable of yielding. From the 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  28 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
standpoint of vital stimulation it is somewhat as if an 
individual were attempting to play alone a game of 
tennis or baseball. 
Development of compromise adjustments, What- 
ever may be the merits in the case for or against the 
substitution of individual for class instruction, our 
present discussion is merely concerned with the fact 
that the plan is making no general headway, and that, 
for the present at least, some other means must be 
found for removing the obstacles to improved study 
which arise from the objectionable features of mass 
teaching. For the special cases of pupils whose work 
in certain subjects varies so widely from grade stand- 
ards as to prevent them temporarily from working 
profitably with any regular class, modern school sys- 
tems have “Ungraded Rooms,” or “Adjustment 
Rooms,” in which, by a combination of special group- 
ing and individual teaching, the pupils are prepared 
to return to some regular grade. But for the schools 
in which such adjustment opportunities are not avail- 
able, and for all schools in which troublesome varia- 
tions among pupils’ abilities and attainments inevita- 
bly remain, certain methods of adjusting the work to 
the pupils’ capacities have been found satisfactory, 
and may easily be adapted to her own needs by any 
classroom teacher. These are the regrouping of pupils 
into fast and slow divisions, the elastic assignment, and 
the individual assignment. 
’ Elastic provisions for difference in ability. The plan
-P-A-G-E-47
  CONDITIONS OF STUDY 29 
of separating the pupils within a grade into groups ac- 
cording to capabilities has produced very satisfactory 
results in the way of interest and progress. It usually 
takes the form of triple groups, one each for fast, slow, 
and average pupils. It frequently happens, especially 
in the lower grades, that the fast group can, without 
skipping or omissions, do one and one half year’s work 
in a single year. The medium group does its year’s 
work on schedule time, but without dragging along 
slow pupils or being dazzled and discouraged by pupils 
too bright for the rest of the group. The slow group 
may require a year and a half to complete the grade, 
but they are not merely dazed auditors while stronger 
pupils recite; they feel the interest arising from assign- 
ments within their ability, and are not repeating. 
Teachers who try the plan regularly find that, from 
their own standpoint, the extra number of recitations 
is more than compensated by the improved response 
of pupils, the greater uniformity of preparation, and 
the elimination of loss and friction due to the con- 
straint of trying to hold wide diversities of ability to a 
single average standard. In the upper grades the dif- 
ference in work done by the various groups may con- 
sist not in varying rates of progress, but in the char- 
acter and content of the work itself. In that case it is 
usually better to allow the pupils to do their own 
grouping by means of a minimum, an average, and a 
Maximum assignment. All pupils must do the mini- 
mum, which is adjusted to the ability of the slow pu-
-P-A-G-E-48
  30 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
pils; those who are able may add the interesting mate- 
rial of the average; while the strongest may accept the 
challenge to their powers of the still more attractive 
maximum material. 
Thus every pupil may show his mettle, while the 
weakest must concentrate on something within his 
range and gets the minimum essentials involved in the 
lesson. Under the direction of a competent teacher the 
stimulation of interest by this plan, and the effort put 
forth by every pupil to be able to report himself at the 
beginning of each recitation as having gone beyond the 
minimum, constitute some of the most admirable 
class-work which the writer has ever seen. This leads 
naturally to assigning work individually to various 
pupils, adapted to the particular difficulty or the par- 
ticular strength of each. Both the elastic assignment 
and the individual assignment will be discussed in 
later chapters in relation to their special applications 
in promoting study. 
Chapter summary. Although it is generally con- 
ceded that teaching pupils how to study should be one 
of the foremost purposes of the school, there has been, 
during the past generation, very little general improve- 
ment in the much-criticized deficiencies along that 
line. Modern needs emphasize the demand for im- 
provement and for reshaping school practices toward 
securing it. Progress in study has as its goal independ- 
ent self-direction, and is dependent for success upon 
four special conditions; namely, knowing what to do,
-P-A-G-E-49
  
CONDITIONS OF STUDY 31 
having a motive for the effort, knowing how to work 
effectively and economically, and being able to main- 
tain attention and effort until results are secured.\ 
Apart from these direct factors governing study, 
there are three general conditions which handicap 
study, and which will continue to make the task of im- 
provement doubly hard, unless remedied. These are 
the tendency to overdo “recitation activity” on the 
part of the teacher; the vicious custom of making 
memory questions the chief feature in tests and exam- 
inations; and the wholesale requirements of class in- 
struction. | 
Fortunately the means of neutralizing these handi- 
caps are within the reach of most teachers, and a just 
regard for the progress of pupils in attaining greater 
skill and better ideals of study demand that obvious 
readjustments be made toward that end. 
QUESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. In your own experience as a student can you 
recall a point at which there was a rather marked 
change in your conception of study? To what 
extent was there a corresponding improvement 
in the effectiveness of your study? What in- 
fluences were responsible for this change, and 
how far do you think the same principles might 
be utilized with any pupils? 
2. “One of the surest indices of a teacher’s ability 
is the diligence of the study class. . . . The prime

test of a teacher is not the manner in which he 
conducts a recitation, but the growth that his 
pupils make in ability to work efficiently without 
supervision.” (Bagley, Classroom Management, 
p. 206.) 
Explain and justify the two statements quoted. 
What do you think is implied as to the functions 
and responsibilities of the recitation period? 
Make a list of five questions which you think 
would be suitable for an open-book examination 
in geography. What difficulties did you encoun- 
ter in preparing the questions? In what ways did 
the task suggest new aims and points of emphasis 
in teaching? If these questions were actually 
given to a class, what would be the probable 
effect upon their method of studying the subject 
in preparation for another similar examination? 
Give three reasons why the work of the study 
period may be more valuable for the pupils than 
that of the recitation. 
Suggest ways in which some phases of individual 
instruction might be used in the ordinary class- 
-room as a special stimulant to independent 
study. 
Write out an “‘elastic’’ assignment in civics, pro- 
viding a minimum that would not discourage the 
weaker pupils, and at the same time affording 
sufficient opportunity for vigorous study by the 
strongest ones.
-P-A-G-E-51

7. In the case of the pupils you have most recently 
10. 
11. 
12. observed, what do you consider the chief reasons 
for weaknesses in study? 
. Many teachers hesitate to introduce project work 
extensively because their pupils seem unable to 
carry out the individual investigations necessary 
to a worth-while undertaking. Enumerate vari- 
ous ways in which improvement in standards and 
methods of study would lead toward more gen- 
eral and more successful use of the project type 
of school-work. 
. It is not only true that the successful carrying 
out of a project by a pupil or group of pupils is 
dependent largely upon power of self-directed 
study, but such work, in return, may be made the 
means of still further developing this power. 
Show how a well-chosen project may help to 
supply each of the four conditions named as es- 
sential to effective study. 
Give some illustrations of the type of “home 
work” usually assigned for pupils in the eighth or 
ninth grades. To what extent do such assign- 
ments secure good results? 
Some educators believe that no home study 
should be assigned below the second year of high 
school. Give arguments for and against such a 
plan. 
Which would you rather have, a ready knowl- 
edge of the information contained in some text-

book, or the ability to locate and verify this and 
similar information when needed? Give at least 
three reasons for your preference. 
Investigate the methods of work followed in some 
voluntary “study-club” or by some individual 
pursuing independent research outside of school. 
How does the effectiveness of this study compare 
with that done in the public schools as you know 
them? How could any good points noted be used 
in school? 
A distinction is sometimes made between “study 
for learning” and “study for doing.” What prac- 
tices in regard to study have given rise to this 
distinction? Justify your answer. 
In what ways may the increasing use of standard- 
ized educational tests help toward the improve- 
ment of study? Illustrate with some particular 
kind of test. 
It is generally agreed that the teacher should as- 
sume much less prominence in conducting a 
recitation than has formerly been the case. Try 
to state some rules or principles for the recitation 
so as to avoid over-activity on the part of the 
teacher and yet ensure adequate guidance for the 
pupils. 
What are the good as well as bad features of 
“cramming” as a type of study? To what extent 
and by what means should proficiency in swift, 
intensive study (as “cramming” sometimes
-P-A-G-E-53
  CONDITIONS OF STUDY 35 
implies) be made a definite objective in study 
training? 
18. In using the “group” system of class instruction 
there are always “fast” and “slow” groups in 
the lower grades, but in the upper grades the plan 
is frequently preferred of having the groups vary 
in the breadth and richness of material handled 
rather than in rate. Give arguments for and 
against the latter plan, and designate the ap- 
proximate grade in which the change should 
occur, if at all.

CHAPTER II 
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 
The cause of much poor preparation. The most fre- 
quently heard explanation or excuse for failure to pre- 
pare lessons as expected, is, “I did n’t know we had to 
do that.” After making due allowance for the cases 
where such a plea is merely an excuse, the fact re- 
mains that the statement is far too often justifiable. 
Even the most conscientious teachers, in spite of their 
efforts to be clear and definite in making assignments, 
are sometimes called upon before the next recitation 
to settle disputes between pupils as to the precise 
things they were to do. These misconceptions as to 
what is to be done during the study period may be due 
to failure to understand the words of the assignment 
or text, to misinterpretation of directions, or to lack of | 
sufficient preparatory knowledge to enable the pupils 
to grasp intelligently the problems presented. 
Difficulty with words. We have all been amused at 
the extracts from examination papers, such as are 
printed in the “humor columns,” in which the comic 
element is due to a misconception of the meaning of a 
word. In fact, most teachers can furnish similar ex- 
amples from their own experience. But, in the ma- 
jority of cases, these misunderstood meanings, instead 
of appearing funny, are exasperating to the teacher
-P-A-G-E-55
  KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 37 
who can’t understand how children get such queer 
ideas, and embarrassing as well as discouraging to the 
perplexed pupils. Beecher once said, “Words are 
merely convenient pegs upon which to hang ideas.” 
Since a child’s knowledge of words is gained largely 
from the context and circumstances under which he 
has heard and seen them used, as interpreted and 
colored by his own limited experience, it is not surpris- 
ing that teachers frequently find startling misfits 
among the ideas and the pegs upon which they have 
been hung. So when one considers not only the totally 
unfamiliar words which abound on almost every ad- 
vance page of the average textbook, but the even more 
treacherous half-familiar ones as well, the necessity 
becomes apparent for taking precautions against these 
dangers to safe progress during the study period. 
In most cases it will hardly be advisable to make any 
extended study of these new words, but it is neverthe- 
less real economy of time to pay at least enough atten- 
tion to each of them to save the pupils from a wrong 
impression as to its meaning. When time and the 
material do permit careful word-study, there is no 
better way to provide both motivation for and appli- 
cation of it than in connection with its importance 
for problems immediately confronting the pupil. The 
goal, of course, in dealing with unfamiliar words is the 
establishment of the “dictionary habit” or “word 
conscience’; that is, a standard on the part of the 
pupils that makes them unwilling to pass a strange
-P-A-G-E-56
  38 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
word in their reading without some investigation as to 
its character and business there. 
Misinterpretation of problems or directions. By far 
the greatest waste of time, and frequently of effort, 
arises from failure of the pupil to grasp clearly the 
exact nature of the task involved in the matter to be 
studied. If any teacher doubts this, a simple and 
obvious experiment will be found convincing. After 
making an ordinary assignment, ask various pupils to 
explain immediately just what they understand is to be 
done during the study period. The more definite they 
try to be, that is, the more in detail they attempt to 
state what steps they expect to take, the more will con- 
fusion be apparent. Fortunately, in most cases this 
misapprehension is not serious enough to prevent a 
tolerable preparation of the lesson, but rare indeed are 
the recitations in which there appears no evidence of 
such difficulties. In fact one frequently hears teachers 
declare that they would be astonished if all the pupils 
in a class were to make precisely the preparation they 
were all asked to make. Granting that the remark is 
partly humorous exaggeration, the very point of the 
humor depends upon the universality of the experience 
among teachers. 
The causes of such misapprehension may be various. 
The attention of the pupils may not be alert for the 
assignment; they may fail to visualize vividly the 
necessary lines of activity involved, or the attention 
may linger upon one phase of the assignment at the
-P-A-G-E-57
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 39 
expense of the rest. In any event the remedy is the 
same. The pupils should be given the largest possible 
share in making their own assignment. Quite apart 
from the tremendous gain in interest that comes from 
having the pupils formulate their own problems, the 
advantage in clearness of comprehension is equally 
great. Ability to do this will not come at once, but can 
be developed. A very simple way to begin, and one 
which represents the very least that a teacher should 
do in making an assignment, is to have various pupils 
restate the problems or tasks of the assignment as 
they understand them. The time thus spent will bear 
rich returns considered merely from the standpoint of 
better comprehension of what is to be done, and con- 
sequently more intelligent preparation. It is a mistake 
to slight this because it seems unnecessary repetition 
and a waste of time. As Bagley says, “The natural 
result is that the teacher who does not teach in the 
assignment is forced to teach in the recitation.” But 
effective teaching in the assignment depends upon 
getting the pupil to reveal wherein teaching is needed 
through his reaction to the assignment as given. 
The right study attitude. The share which the 
pupils are to have in making the assignment should 
not end with their restating and discussing such ques- 
tions and problems as the teacher has to propound. 
The goal of all training in study is self-direction. The 
“form which this should take in teaching pupils the 
effective use of textbooks is well stated in the following
-P-A-G-E-58
  
  40 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
sentences from How to Teach, by Strayer and Nors- 
worthy: 
They must learn that books are written in answer to ques- 
tions. In order to thoroughly understand a book, students 
must seek to frame the questions which it answers. 
When pupils once grasp this idea, their whole atti- 
tude toward finding what to do in study-time is trans- 
formed. As a step toward this, some such device as 
the following has frequently been used, and is surpris- 
ingly successful even as low as the third grade. Each 
pupil is asked to use his study-time in selecting and 
preparing questions about the lesson, such as he thinks 
would be fair to ask the rest of the class. As a result, 
the pupils, almost without exception, are able not only 
to answer their own questions, but an unusually large 
number of other questions. But the great value of this 
type of exercise lies deeper even than the improved 
preparation secured or the increased interest, some 
part of which is due to novelty. It causes the pupil to 
assume the correct attitude toward books as a source 
of information. This active attitude of seeking the 
questions for which the book supplies answers is im- 
measurably superior to the passive one which depends 
for guidance on the questions or directions of some one 
else. 
Naturally, the early efforts of pupils in formulating 
their own questions for study will be crude. Their 
sense of relative values is faulty, and they may em- 
phasize trifles at the expense of important material.
-P-A-G-E-59
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 41 
But, while recognizing the need of correcting this, let 
us remember that self-direction can be developed only 
by practice and trial, with diminishing domination 
from the teacher. Moreover, the rate of improvement 
in this respect is surprisingly rapid whenever the 
teacher is genuinely convinced that a pupil’s progress 
in setting problems for himself is more important than 
prolonged study upon ready-made exercises set by 
another. As a matter of fact, in experimental classes 
it has usually been found that pupils of the lower 
grades, in spite of their immaturity, show quite as 
much readiness in devising worth-while problems for 
study as do upper-grade pupils, in whose case the first 
task is to break up the encrusted habits of passivity in 
regard to study. 
Preventing assignments for which pupils are not 
prepared. If any further reason were needed for a pre- 
liminary discussion by the pupils of the work to be 
studied, it would be found in the third cause of mis- 
conceptions as to work assigned; namely, insufficient 
preparation on the part of pupils to enable them to 
grasp intelligently the problems presented. Problems 
and questions formulated by pupils are rarely those 
with which they are unprepared to cope. Even if the 
class has not yet been brought to the point where it can 
contribute much in making its own assignment, a pre- 
liminary discussion of the advance problems will at 
once reveal any unpreparedness to do profitable study. 
If this is due to some difficulty that cannot readily be
-P-A-G-E-60
  42 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
removed, it is possible to alter the assignment before 
an entire study period is wasted, failure and discour- 
agement invited, and a wrong attitude toward study 
begun. On the other hand, the preparation needed by 
the pupils before being able to do efficient study on the 
advance assignment may be such that it can be ac- 
complished in a short time. In that case it is the busi- 
ness of the preliminary view of the work to be studied 
to furnish that preparation. 
In the schools in which the best results are now 
being attained, both as regards mastery of work and 
progress in study, the custom is to divide the recita- 
tion period into two nearly equal parts, the first being 
the “review” or backward look at the work already 
studied, and the latter half the forward look at the 
new assignment. If pupils were really prepared on the 
previous day to study properly, and are held to a 
business-like accounting for results, without painful 
and drawn-out efforts on the part of the teacher to 
have them say things they do not know, half of the 
usual recitation time will suffice for the backward- 
looking part of the period. If any less than the other 
half of the period is given toward ensuring a clear 
understanding of the new assignment, determining 
what is to be solved or summarized or memorized, 
selecting sources of information, forestalling difficul- 
ties by adequate preparation, and doing such other 
things as will leave the pathway to the next lesson 
only just difficult enough, the penalty for neglect will
-P-A-G-E-61
  
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 43 
probably be a lesson so ill-prepared next day that the 
entire recitation period will not suffice for eliciting 
satisfactory responses. 
Teaching pupils to frame questions for study. A 
recognition of the major importance of independent 
study as an aim of school-work involves a further 
revision of emphasis and procedure during the recitax 
tion period. Strayer and Norsworthy, in a chapter 
previously quoted, say: “Many teachers have taught 
subjects, but not how to study subjects. The latter is 
more important.” Other prominent educators state 
the fact even more emphatically. The general agree- 
ment that training in study is a more valuable use of 
time than hearing recitations calls for a new type of 
classroom technique. In high schools, where weakness 
in a pupil’s study-power becomes quickly and often 
disastrously apparent, much attention has been paid 
to means of improving this general shortcoming. For 
the most part these consist of administrative devices 
for ensuring supervised study periods. But the time 
at which special effort should be directed toward pro- 
moting skill in study is in the elementary school. Not 
only does the task involve less difficulties in the way 
of overcoming wrong conceptions of study if persist- 
ently worked toward in the lower grades, but the 
added strength of the pupil who advances into the 
upper grades and high school with increasing efficiency 
in study justifies such emphasis at any reasonable 
cost. 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
44 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
Beginning in the primary grades. The foundation of 
a correct study attitude should be laid in the very first 
grade. As soon as the child can begin to read at all, his 
natural tendency is to “guess ahead” as he eagerly 
works through the sentences of his story. With only 
slight encouragement, he will tell what he hopes to find 
out; that is, frame in a crude way the questions for 
which the remainder of the story is to furnish the an- 
swers. This is the essence of the correct study attitude 
reduced to its simplest terms. As long as this remains 
natural with the pupil in his reading and study, he is 
safe from that lifeless stumbling over a meaningless 
succession of words which is fatal not only to oral 
reading, but to any study worthy of the name. Such a 
performance is not reading in any just sense, and a 
teacher is doing a child a wrong if she allows him to go 
on believing that he has really “read the lesson over.” 
Caution in primary grades. Since study, even in its 
simplest form, requires holding the attention alert and 
expectant, care should be taken not to fatigue small 
children. A short part of the recitation period should 
be used for the training in study, and in the first grade 
should not exceed ten minutes. Whether the things to 
be looked for are proposed by the pupils or by the 
teacher, make sure that they are entirely clear to all, 
and that this assignment immediately precedes the: 
period of study. The time between recitations, for this 
grade, may be spent in occupational work connected 
with their lessons, but real study should not be called 
  q
-P-A-G-E-63
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 45 
for except during the brief periods mentioned, and 
while the teacher is present to control conditions and 
standards as well as guide the habits that are being 
formed. The important points to be remembered are 
that the pupils must know precisely what they are 
expected to do or to find out, and that they should earn 
the satisfaction then and there of accomplishing their 
ends, with the added pleasure of telling or demon- 
strating their success. Complete and successful prep- 
aration should be their standard and habit from the 
first. Quality is much more important than quantity 
in the study requirements of small children. 
Broadening field of study problems. From the 
second and third grades the type of study may begin 
to include something more than the simple form of 
thought-getting which characterizes it in the first 
‘grade. One field to be added is that of the “outside” 
problem, arising in such work as nature-study, home 
geography, or handwork. The solution or verification 
needed in such cases will require reference to printed 
matter. It seems a very simple and easy thing to 
settle the questions connected with a “real” or “out- 
side” problem by referring to the proper chart, book, 
or other authority. Children, however, do not find it 
so, and the complaint is frequently heard regarding 
upper-grade pupils that they are helpless in the matter 
of applying textbook facts to the real situations about 
them, even when the connection seems plain and ob- 
vious. This divorcing of school and life can be pre-
-P-A-G-E-64
  
  46 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
vented, and vitalizing motives gained, by taking care, 
from the early grades on, to have included among the 
study tasks a goodly share of questions growing out of 
the everyday interests and affairs of the pupils, but 
necessitating for their final settlement recourse to the 
proper printed authority. In fact the modern standard 
for estimating the success of a teacher emphasizes 
skill in motivating school-work through real situations, 
and guiding pupils to the study of subject-matter 
through the needs arising from their natural interests. 
Questions requiring more thought. The second 
way in which the questions for study should become 
more comprehensive is in the character of the thinking 
required. In the beginning work, the question must 
be relatively simple, and when the answer is found it 
is merely a matter of the pupil’s recognizing it as such. 
He may even place his finger upon the sought-for 
words and triumphantly call them out. In the days 
when memoriter study was the regular thing, this 
style of question and answer was the one most com- 
monly used. But modern practice uses it only as an 
introductory step, and seeks to follow it immediately 
by a type of study question that demands more 
thought. 
A very comprehensive presentation of the possibili- 
ties of this type of thought question, with illustrative 
treatment for the various grades, may be found in 
Hall’s The Question as a Factor in Teaching. In this 
same connection teachers will find material of double
-P-A-G-E-65
    KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED © 47 
value in the latest revision of the Kansas Silent-Read- 
ing Tests, by Monroe. This latter not only provides a 
carefully worked-out series of exercises in interpreting 
reading matter, ranging progressively from questions 
simple enough for the first grade up to complicated 
thought questions difficult even for advanced high- 
school students, but will also suggest standards of 
attainment that should be expected of pupils in the 
grades corresponding to the divisions of the test 
material. Obviously the best way to develop greater 
ability in this respect is by guiding the selection of 
assignment problems toward greater exercise of 
thoughtful judgment. : 
Adaptations to particular lesson types; drill exer- 
cises. One type of lesson in which very unfortunate 
results may follow, if the pupils’ preparation is not 
guided by a clear understanding of what is to be done, 
is that involving drill exercises. Most of the recitation 
time devoted to drill is spent in trying to correct 
wrong habits, as any teacher who has struggled with 
repeated misspelling, slipshod language, and faulty 
fundamentals in arithmetic will probably agree. Fre- 
quently these wrong habits are the result of the pupils’ 
not knowing precisely the right thing to do in the 
study period, and, more often still, repeating the 
wrong thing during the study period fixes the incorrect 
process and counteracts the painstaking efforts to 
establish the right habits during the recitation period. 
Penmanship, spelling, and punctuation furnish ever-
-P-A-G-E-66
48 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
present examples of this latter form of waste. The 
plan of having pupils write each month sample forms 
or pages which they are willing to have serve for the 
following month as the minimum standard of excel- 
lence in their written work brings much better papers, 
and similar devices for preventing bad habits during 
study time will occur to resourceful teachers. But the 
point to be emphasized now is the need of precautions 
to ensure accuracy on the part of pupils with regard to 
newly inaugurated processes which the study period is 
intended to strengthen. 
Spelling furnishes a good example of the principle 
stated above. Until recent years the time-honored 
custom in that subject was to assign a list of words for 
study, and the pupils would attack the list more or 
less vigorously and vociferously. The recitation time 
was spent in discovering how many they could spell; 
that is, in testing spelling and not in teaching it. Some 
of the earliest scientific studies of comparative results 
were in regard to spelling, and disclosed the startling 
fact that the length of time spent by pupils in so-called 
study of spelling made almost no difference in the 
quality of their habitual spelling. Then, for the first 
time, attempts at really teaching spelling began to be 
made. The efficient teacher of that subject now de- 
votes a good share of the recitation to teaching the 
pupils what to do with their spelling words so that 
their practice time will be profitably spent. Testing 
is subordinate to teaching, and loses its discouraging
-P-A-G-E-67
  KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 49 
phases if the teaching has been well done. The same 
principle applies to all exercises that include drill 
either on facts or forms. The possibilities of misused 
time and negative results are so great that the utmost 
caution in assignment is necessary. Unless the recita- 
tion has inaugurated the processes and established 
the forms so well that pupils know certainly what to do 
in practicing them, it is better not to assign drill at all 
for the study period. 
The solution of problems. The severest test of abil- 
ity to study comes in dealing with problems. These 
occur in various subjects, notably geography, history, 
and mathematics. The arithmetic problem may be 
considered as typical and as being the kind pupils are 
apt first to find difficult. The difficulty is due usually 
to a failure to comprehend clearly what is required. 
Unless the processes needed for the solution are glar- 
ingly obvious, the efforts of most pupils are likely to be 
guesswork, and the results correspondingly ridiculous. 
For example, an eighth-grade class was given a gen- 
eral examination on unfamiliar questions taken from 
“Food Problems,” one of which was: 
Hotel-keepers have found that the most economical way 
to serve butter is in one-fourth ounce portions. How many 
can be cut from a pound? 
Many readers have probably already guessed what 
happened. Over half of the class, seeing the fraction 
one fourth, and knowing that a pound contains sixteen 
ounces, promptly took one fourth of sixteen, and put
-P-A-G-E-68
  50 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
down four as the answer with apparently no thought 
of its absurdity. 
On another occasion the writer observed a class of 
fifth-grade pupils, who had come in their text to their 
first extended series of problems and were wrestling 
with this one: 
A boy raised five bushels of popcorn and sold it to a grocer 
for $1.50 a bushel. The grocer sold it out at 5 cents apound. 
How much more would the boy have made if he had sold it in 
the same way? (Popcorn on the cob weighs 70 pounds to the 
bushel.) 
It was intended to be a practical problem, with an 
appeal to the interest of pupils of that grade. Yet only 
two of the pupils were arriving at anything they had 
the temerity to suggest was the solution. Of these 
two, one said $3.50, while the other said $7.50, and 
neither was disposed to show confidence in defending 
his answer. 
Recitation often fails to meet needs. The perplexity 
of these pupils was typical of that felt by most pupils 
when, in about the fifth grade, they begin to encoun- 
ter problems of some slight complexity. They have 
learned to add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and are 
better prepared to do mechanical work than to think. 
So when they meet a complicated problem, a frequent 
question is, “ What does it want me to do ?” — mean- 
ing, “ What process am I expected to use?”? When 
they feel that something must be done, they are apt, 
unless guided by the assignment toward thoughtful 
study, to begin putting down the most obvious figures
-P-A-G-E-69
  KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 51 
in sight and mechanically combining them until some- 
thing is produced that looks like ananswer. The danger 
is that this substitution of mechanical manipulation 
for real thought will become habitual, and result in 
such absurdities as the pupils were guilty of in dividing 
the pound of butter. 
A common style of recitation that fails to remedy 
this condition, and at the same time fitly illustrates 
the time-wasting procedure criticized in the previous 
chapter, is well described in the following paragraph 
frem Modern Elementary School Practice, by Freeland: 
Formerly a common method was first of all to ask, “How 
many had trouble with the first problem?” — then, “How many ‘got’ it?” A child who solved it correctly was allowed to copy his solution on the board. This procedure was re- peated with each problem. Those who had been unable to do the work received no exercise, but sat at their seats. Those who did not need this particular exercise did the work, which, indeed, was not real work, since they had already 
done it once. After the problems were all on the board, the bright children who did not need the exercise (at least this particular exercise) were asked to “explain” their problems. 
This they did in turn, but what they said was merely the story of the steps they took, rather than an explanation. 
The children who missed problems often ignored the entire procedure. It is certain that they profited little by it. 
It is needless to expect improvement in study meth- 
ods to follow such a recitation. Besides encouraging 
the weaker pupils to imitate methods which they 
do not comprehend, it consumes valuable time that 
should be used in having pupils learn steps necessary 
to thoughtful problem-solving.

Assignments that guide and stimulate thought. 
What is needed is the kind of recitation and assign- 
ment that will lead the pupil to the realization that the 
process of solving a problem consists of a series of 
simple steps, to be taken in their proper order. His 
natural tendency seems to be to regard a problem as an 
indivisible unity, and he tries, so to speak, to swallow 
it at one gulp. The difficulty in getting a pupil to break 
up a problem into parts is greatly lessened if he begins, 
and continues as much as possible, with real and vital 
problems arising from projects or experiences of his 
own. If, for example, in his home garden a pupil under- 
takes to discover how profitable it is to grow tomatoes 
ona plot ten by thirty feet, he will have a complicated 
general problem and several minor ones to solve. The 
questions of labor and expense in preparing the soil, 
determining the number of plants needed, purchasing 
and setting-out the plants, cultivating and protecting 
his crop, and finally marketing, all prolong the final 
solution of his main problem for many weeks. Or, in 
case of a class picnic, the problems of planning refresh- 
ments, making purchases, and apportioning expenses 
may all be solved in an afternoon. But in either case 
there is little danger of confusing the various elements 
entering into the problems. Circumstances compel 
each to be kept distinct, and one detail must be settled 
before another can be taken up. The essential fact 
which prevents children from jumbling the details of 
the problems of real experience, as they do those from
-P-A-G-E-71
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 53 
books, is that they see vividly each step necessary to 
the solution in the natural order in which it confronts 
them. Some pupils can visualize just as clearly, and in 
proper order, the steps involved in a book problem. 
Such pupils have no great difficulty in solving the 
problems presented in the text, and therein is sug- 
gested the most important thing needed in preparing 
pupils to study an assignment of problems. 
The way in which pupils may be led to visualize the 
steps of a problem may be illustrated by what was 
done in the case of the fifth-grade pupils who were at 
a loss as to what to do with the problem, mentioned in 
a preceding paragraph, of the boy who sold his popcorn 
to the grocer instead of retailing it by the pound. It 
was suggested that they “act out ” the problem. One 
pupil took the part of “the boy,” another the grocer, 
and three others acted as the latter’s round of custom- 
ers. All the others as they watched were to write 
down the questions they wished to ask as to quanti- 
ties not directly told by the book. Every one entered 
into the spirit of the pantomime, since no word was to 
be spoken. The boy pretended to carry in, one at a 
time, five heavy bags of popcorn; the grocer paid him; 
then the succession of customers each paid for a very 
tiny bag handed out by the grocer; there was not even 
lacking the grocer’s final look of exaggerated satisfac- 
tion over his profits. The questions written by the 
pupils almost without exception contained the follow- 
ing: “How much is the grocer paying the boy?”
-P-A-G-E-72
  54 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
“How many pounds can the grocer sell?” “How 
much did the grocer get for the popcorn?” “How 
much more did the grocer get than the boy did?” The 
question was then asked, “Can you all now find the 
answers to each question in the order they come?” 
One boy apparently voiced the general sentiment when 
he exclaimed, “ As easy as play!” 
Similar lists of questions were then made out by the 
pupils for each of the next five problems, “ acting out ”* 
all in which details were apt to be confused in visual- 
izing. This required just fifteen minutes. These prob- 
lems, with five more not discussed in class, were as- 
signed for study. Judging from the helplessness shown 
by the pupils at the beginning of the recitation, such a 
requirement, with no further instructions as to its 
study, would have resulted in haphazard juggling of 
figures, without aim or interest, and only those pupils 
who had tractable parents or generous friends would 
have made a respectable showing at the next recitation. 
As it was, absolutely no help was given them beyond 
insisting that they “act out ” and “see” every step to 
be taken, and answer in its order every question that 
arose. But the class set to work in eager confidence. 
Study time holds no dread for pupils who are sure they 
know what to do. 
Checking up the work. On the following day when 
reports were called for, every pupil was ready with the 
first five problems. It required only two minutes to 
check over and compare results. Of the next five,
-P-A-G-E-73
  KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 55 
assigned without detailed preparatory work, one 
fourth of the pupils had worked all, and the majority 
had worked three or more. Any pupil who had not 
succeeded with a problem was asked to read his ques- 
tions, to determine whether he had “seen ” the details 
of the problem. Thus it was immediately shown 
wherein he had missed a necessary step. Pupils who 
thought they could make him “see” this by action or 
rough blackboard illustration were allowed to do so, 
but no one was allowed to work the problem for him. 
Eight minutes sufficed to put all pupils on the correct 
road toward the solution of their unfinished problems. 
The remaining time was then free for a forward look 
at the next study work, to which was added an elastic 
assignment of supplementary problems for pupils who 
were able to do one or more in addition to the mini- 
mum for the class. 
Some such plan, modified according to the needs of 
the particular grade or grades, may profitably be sub- 
stituted for half of the familiar type of backward- 
looking recitation on problems. The one essential is 
that the daily review and assignment shall provide in 
some way for a forward look which will ensure that 
pupils know what to do, and are started far enough on 
the right road to prevent the stultifying practice of 
merely “putting down” the figures in sight and 
mechanically “doing something” with them. Arith- 
metic lends itself admirably to individual instruction, 
and in all exercises for the mastery of fundamental 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  
56 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
principles and processes, some provision for individ- 
ual work and progress is desirable even where the 
teacher has a comparatively large group. But in the 
problems growing out of the applications of these proc- 
esses, it has been the writer’s observation that more 
reality and consequent comprehension can be secured 
through group participation, or, better still, through 
group projects. The individual project is, of course, 
valuable, but rarely provides sufficient variety of 
application. When problems are once made “real,” 
either through actual material or, vicariously, through 
an interested and vivid visualization of the actual 
steps of their development, pupils are safely prepared 
for independent study in which it is necessary to break 
up similar problems into logical parts. Dean Daven- 
port once said that “ most students suffer from mental 
dyspepsia, due to bolting their reading.” It is cer- 
tainly true that acute mental disturbances regularly 
follow the effort to swallow problems at a gulp. Any 
amount of preparation necessary to prevent this is 
time well spent. 
The problem in geography. The question of prepar- 
ing pupils to study problems in arithmetic was dis- 
cussed in rather lengthy detail because the first need 
of problem study usually occurs in connection with 
that subject, and, further, the most fundamental prin- 
ciple found there applies to such study in other sub- 
jects. That is, the necessity of having the pupil see 
that he can and should break up a problem into rela-
-P-A-G-E-75
  KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 57 
tively simple elements is essential under all conditions. 
But the problem, as made use of in the modern teach- 
ing of such a subject as geography, has taken on a 
broader significance, and requires special considera- 
tion. The complexity if not the difficulty of the solu- 
tion is much increased by the fact that the data neces- 
sary for the final conclusion must be selected and 
tested by the pupils, instead of being furnished com- 
pletely by the conditions of the problem as in mathe- 
matics. The consequent need of guidance in finding, 
selecting, and evaluating facts with reference to their 
significance in the solution of the problem set adds 
peculiarly important features to the task of preparing 
pupils for intelligent activity in this type of study in 
geography. 
The nature and necessity of problems in the study 
of geography. The modern conception of geography, 
upon which all textbooks written or rewritten during 
the twentieth century have been based, is that of rela- 
tionship between man and his environment. Out of the 
overwhelming mass of possible facts, only those are 
selected and included in our school geographies which 
are considered valuable for explaining why people live 
where they do, why certain industries are character- 
istic of certain localities, and, in general, how the 
physical environment influences the activities, rela- 
tionships, and mode of life of the people in any region. 
These questions or problems were definitely in the 
mind of the author when he selected his material, and
-P-A-G-E-76
  58 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
since, as already quoted, “in order to thoroughly 
understand a book, students must seek to frame the 
questions which it answers,” any intelligent study of 
the text in geography must, at the very least, be 
guided by some appreciation of these questions which 
the author is trying to answer through the material 
which he presents. So even the teacher who, on account 
of limited equipment and the absence of adequate 
illustrative material, has hesitated to try the problem 
method of teaching the subject, should realize that the 
spirit of that method must govern even the barest 
textbook assignment if the study is to yield anything 
better than the reproduction of disorganized facts, 
aimlessly accumulated. 
There is another reason why the study of most of 
the facts in geography should be directed toward the 
solving of problems of relationship. All scientific 
investigations regarding varying facility in acquiring 
knowledge, and length of its retention, demonstrate 
that these are directly dependent upon the need felt for 
and use made of such knowledge. There are many 
valuable facts in geography which should be learned 
and retained, but unless a need for these facts leads to 
a search for them, and their use in explaining relation- 
ships proves their value, they are likely to be what 
Bobbitt has aptly termed “ deciduous information ” — 
the sort that falls away after examinations as having 
no longer any use or permanent value. 
Formulating problems. In preparation for this type
-P-A-G-E-77
  
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 59 
of study in geography, the character of the problem 
and the manner of its formulation are extremely im- 
portant. It must be one that strikes the pupils as 
worth while. In fact it is, to them, no real problem at 
all, unless it blocks the pathway to something they 
wish to know. The use of stock problems, devoid of 
real interest to the pupils, may cause the method to 
degenerate into the most formal, lifeless exercise imagi- 
nable. Since it is essential that the pupils feel that the 
problems are really their own, it is very desirable that 
they be led to formulate them. This, of course, does 
not lessen the necessity of previous planning by the 
teacher, for a class can be skillfully guided in recitation 
toward a situation in which the proposal of new prob- 
lems comes naturally from the pupils only when this 
situation and the essential character of the problem 
have been foreseen and made the goal to which the 
teacher’s suggestions lead. 
As was pointed out in a more general way in the first 
part of this chapter, codperation by the pupils in fram- 
ing questions for any study adds much both to clear- 
ness of comprehension and interest in the assignment. 
In the problem phases of geography and history, the 
importance of such codperation becomes paramount. 
It is well to repeat also that their first efforts will be 
halting and crude. With sympathetic suggestions, 
however, improvement is stimulated, and the progress 
is surprising when once they are made to realize that 
they have as much share in the forward look as in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
60 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
backward look of the recitation. Strayer and Nors- 
worthy say, “A good recitation ought to culminate in 
the statement of the questions yet to be answered 
quite as much as in a statement of what has been ac- 
complished.’ The responsibility of the pupils should 
be equal in both phases, and their added interest both 
in that kind of recitation and in the subsequent study 
will be a revelation to any teacher who had never 
before realized that children prefer looking forward to 
looking back. 
Data, inference, and verification. The complete 
round of activity in the problem type of study in any 
such subject as history or geography falls naturally 
into the following steps: formulation of the problem; 
preparatory review of known material bearing on it; 
collection of new facts and data; inference or tentative 
solution; testing and verification of the conclusion. 
The first two belong to the forward-looking part of the 
recitation; the third should constitute the major work 
of the study period, but the recitation should ensure 
that the pupils know where to find the necessary data 
in textbooks or supplementary sources. Dodge and 
Kirchwey, in their excellent book, The Teaching of 
Geography, express doubt as to the advisability of 
having pupils attempt either of the last two steps 
during the study period. Any one familiar with the 
usual haphazard style of study will understand the 
reason for their doubt. But any improvement in study 
must lead toward greater individual independence in
-P-A-G-E-79
  KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 61 
judgment, and the study period should afford oppor- 
tunity for every pupil to make and test his own infer- 
ences. The most cogent reason, however, why this 
should be provided for in the study period is the prac- 
tical need for it. Mental processes cannot be divided 
sharply into separate steps. If any one is interested in 
a problem, he will, as he collects the facts bearing on its 
solution, naturally and inevitably make inferences 
or guesses as to what the conclusion will be. These 
conjectures begin almost with the acquisition of the 
first data, and constitute normal mental activity for 
the adult as well as the child. The difference is that 
the mature mind is more apt to suspend judgment and 
investigate further. The child finds this difficult and 
so is prone to “jump at conclusions.”’ If his inference 
seems satisfactory, he considers the problem solved, 
and sees no use in studying further. This fact, as will 
be pointed out in a later chapter, constitutes a fre- 
quent source of unfinished study. 
The only remedy for these premature conclusions is 
to see that the pupil is furnished with checks and tests 
with which to verify or disprove his conjectures. The 
nature of these will vary so widely that general direc- 
tions can hardly be given. Usually, however, they will 
consist of known and established principles with which 
the new inference must harmonize, or else a summary 
of necessary conditions for the new solution, so that 
enough facts must be found to satisfy all these before 
the inference can be considered trustworthy. These
-P-A-G-E-80
  62 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
tests may frequently be standardized, so to speak, for 
a series of similar problems, so that little time is re- 
quired daily in reviewing them. But just as the effi- 
cient mathematics teacher will insist that his pupils, 
in learning a new principle or application, shall learn 
also a check for accuracy in its use, so the teacher of 
any other subject, in preparing his pupils for effective 
study, should have them familiar with means of test- 
ing the'trustworthiness of their conclusions, wherever 
such tests are at all necessary or possible. 
Other subjects. The suggestions which have been 
made with regard to preparing pupils for thoughtful, 
intelligent study in arithmetic and geography will 
apply with only slight modifications to history, civics, 
physiology, hygiene, science, and certain phases of 
reading and literature. In a book to which reference 
has once before been made, Supervised Study in History, 
Miss Simpson gives some very valuable suggestions as - 
to how pupils may be led to formulate their own prob- 
lems in that subject, as well as how to have them ver- 
ify their own inferences. In most of the subjects 
named above, the testing of conjectures will include 
reference to trustworthy authorities for facts to prove 
or disprove the inference. 
In subjects of the more formal type, preparation for 
successful study will resemble more closely that for 
drill exercises. For example, in the formal phases of 
language study, it is the business of the recitation to 
give a clear understanding of the forms, so that the
-P-A-G-E-81
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 63 
study period can safely attend to the mastery of them 
by application and use. If the work calls for language 
expression, the recitation preparation should take 
what might be called the “unfinished story” form. 
That is, in the latter part of the recitation the pupils 
should be safely launched on their composition, while 
the teacher has opportunity to see that they have 
something to express and have demonstrated that they 
at least know how to start. The study period can then 
be used for completing what the recitation has seen 
properly begun. 
The time for the study period. After all that has 
been urged regarding the desirability of getting study 
well started during the recitation time, it hardly needs 
to be added that the proper time for the-study period 
_is_as soon after the recitation as possible. The points 
to be studied are most clearly and accurately in mind 
then, and interest is at its highest point. Whatever 
wisdom there is in the maxim, “Strike while the iron 
is hot,” surely applies to the study period. The fact 
that the next recitation does not come until the fol- 
lowing day is an added reason for study immediately 
after the recitation in any subject. For whatever is 
to be retained until the recitation must be well enough 
learned to hold for a whole day, a condition far more 
favorable to its permanent retention than if it were 
only necessary to remember it during the few minutes 
just preceding the recitation. Under the best condi- 
tions there is no break to mark the end of the recita-
-P-A-G-E-82

64 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
tion and the beginning of the study period. The 
former prepares for and begins the work of the latter, 
and when all pupils comprehend what is to be done 
and are fairly started upon it, the teacher may quietly 
leave them to their study. 
Chapter summary. The first condition essential to 
successful study is that the pupils know definitely 
what is to be done. In order to ensure this, trouble- 
some words or difficult passages should be cleared of 
their dangers in advance, and pupils should be re- 
quired to restate and explain the assignment as a test 
of their comprehension of and preparation for it. \ 
Both to promote understanding of what is to be done 
and to inculcate a correct study attitude, pupils should 
be led to take an increasing share in and responsibility 
for framing the questions and problems of their own 
assignments. The character of the questions for study 
should lead constantly toward thoughtful study and 
away from mechanical finding of answers. In drill 
exercises and formal work, the vital necessity for hav- 
ing pupils know exactly what to do arises from the 
danger that they will nullify the work of the recitation 
by wrong practices in study time. 
The solving of problems is the severest test of study 
efficiency. In the mathematical type of problem the 
greatest need in preparation is to have pupils know 
how to break up the problem into steps, and “see” 
each successive development. In the “thought prob- 
lem,” as used in geography and history, teaching skill
-P-A-G-E-83
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 65 
is needed to lead pupils to codperate in selecting and 
stating the problem, and as an essential preliminary 
to thoughtful selection of data and careful testing of 
inferences, both of which are fundamental to good 
study and should be provided for in the forward- 
looking part of the recitation. 
QUESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. A number of students, who observed successive 
lessons taught by various teachers, reported that 
it was the regular custom of the teachers to ask, 
after making an assignment, if all understood 
what was to be done. Almost without exception 
the pupils would indicate that they did. In the 
following recitation, however, it usually devel- 
oped that a number had not understood fully 
what was assigned. What are the causes and 
remedy for this common difficulty? 
2. Select some paragraph in a history textbook, and 
show (a) how an understanding of it is dependent 
on discovering what questions the author was 
trying to answer; (b) how you would guide pupils 
to frame these questions. 
8. Mention various ways in which the extra time 
required for a well-understood assignment may 
be saved in the subsequent recitation. 
4, It is a matter of common experience that a reci- 
tation for which the pupils are poorly prepared 
consumes much more time and requires much
-P-A-G-E-84
  66 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
greater effort on the part of the teacher than one 
for which the pupils have made satisfactory prep- 
aration. How do they compare in educational 
value? Why is the teacher likely to overestimate 
the value to the pupils of the extra effort put 
forth in the first-named case? 
What advantages are there in the plan of having 
pupils prepare or choose each month their own 
standard samples of written work over the cus- 
tom of having the teacher decide the standard to 
which their work must conform? 
. What is the difference between teaching spelling 
and testing spelling? How would you teach a 
pupil to study a spelling lesson? 
. Discuss the relative advantages of having the 
study period for any subject immediately after 
instead of before the recitation period. 
. From your own experience or observation give 
examples of assignments that were misunder- 
stood and suggest ways in which the misunder- 
standings could have been prevented. 
. Thorndike, in his Education, p. 197, says: “Even 
gifted teachers often, in commendable zeal for 
interest and economy of time, prepare pupils in 
advance for every chapter to be read by out- 
lining it, eliminating all difficulties, and accepting 
the ability to give the substance of the chapter 
as all that the pupils are to do. The pupils may 
be left unable to study a book intelligently by

themselves. If they had been given problems to 
work out with its aid that were just within their 
capacity, they might have absorbed its substance 
less easily, but would have gained a more valu- 
able knowledge of its relations and uses, and also 
have had some training in the independent use 
of books.” 
To what extent has it seemed, in your own 
experience, that the practice of giving pupils 
ready-made outlines as guides for study weakens 
independent effort in the way set forth in the 
quotation? What other objections might be 
urged against this “‘predigested” type of outline 
as an assignment? 
Taking as a general topic “The Causes of the 
Revolutionary War,” suggest a form of assign- 
ment that would furnish adequate guidance for 
pupils without being open to the criticism ex- 
pressed in the quotation at the beginning of the 
exercise above. 
When a pupil has finished a study assignment in 
a suspiciously short time, it is not unusual for 
the teacher in charge of the study class to say, 
“You’d better go over it again.” What objec- 
tions are there to such an admonition? Can you 
suggest a better way to proceed in such cases? 
What do you consider necessary in order that a 
problem may be “real” to a child? 
After such an assignment has been given as is
-P-A-G-E-86
rr 
68 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
called for in Exercise 10 above, explain what 
measures might be taken to enable the pupils to 
know independently when this assignment has 
been satisfactorily completed. 
14. Which do you consider better as an assignment, 
poorly formulated problems proposed by the 
pupils, or comprehensive, well-formulated prob- 
lems proposed by the teacher? Give the argu- 
ments in favor of each. 
15. C. A. McMurry says, “The important project 
is always a problem and a mother of prob- 
lems.” Suggest some project appropriate for a 
sixth-grade class in geography, and show how its 
development would stimulate pupils to discover 
and set forth problems for their own study. 
16. When study involves the solution of problems, 
a very essential requirement for successful prep- 
aration is that the pupil shall verify his con- 
clusions. If an assignment in geography included 
the problem, “Why has the city of St. Louis 
grown to such size and commercial importance?” 
show how the pupils might be prepared in ad- 
vance to test the soundness of their conclusions. 
17. It is often said that the chief source of difficulty 
in arithmetic and algebra with many pupils is 
that they do not “know how to read problems.” 
Where does the responsibility for this weakness 
belong? What measures could be taken in the 
lower grades to lessen or prevent this difficulty?
-P-A-G-E-87
KNOWING WHAT IS TO BE STUDIED 69 
18. If pupils in a third- or fourth-grade class do not 
show much ability in framing questions for their 
own study, suggest some definite measures that 
might be taken to improve the situation.

  CHAPTER III 
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 
Interest and study. The fact that there must be 
interest as an indispensable antecedent to effective 
study can hardly be too strongly emphasized. Vigor- 
ous mental activity is put forth only when there is a 
feeling that the results sought are of sufficient value to 
justify the effort. In fact, McMurry defines study as 
“the vigorous application of the mind to a subject for 
the satisfaction of a felt need,” thereby emphasizing 
the fundamental fact that there can be no such thing 
as study without an impelling feeling or interest. 
Other modern educators have stated this principle in 
even more vigorous language, and most teachers prob- 
ably accept it as a general and abstract truth. But 
in actual practice, most assignments of work to be 
studied are made with no provision for securing posi- 
tive interest in what is to be done. Apparently it is 
either assumed that the needed interest will glow forth 
spontaneously at the opening of a textbook, or else 
most teachers are not fully convinced of the necessity 
and practicability of making such provision a definite 
part of their planning and assignment of work for 
study. 
The latter explanation seems natural when one 
remembers that these same teachers, while pupils
-P-A-G-E-89
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 71 
themselves, attended schools in which the prevailing 
disciplinary conception of education regarded the mere 
assignment of lessons as the chief and sufficient reason 
why those lessons should be studied. The fact that the 
work was uninteresting or even distasteful to most of 
the pupils was regarded quite as much a virtue as a 
fault — it provided better discipline. In spite of the 
system, a few of us, mainly from temperament, home 
influences, or personal likes, found the school-work 
tolerably interesting, and were influenced by that fact 
toward becoming teachers later ourselves. This fact 
that teachers are drawn largely from the unrepre- 
sentative minority to whose interests and academic 
temperament school-work happens naturally to appeal, 
and who thus are unappreciative of the lack of interest 
among other pupils, coupled; with the unconscious 
tendency of us all to teach as we have been taught, has 
retarded any general revision of school practice such 
as would make the stimulation of interest a definite 
feature in the assignment of lessons. The need for such 
revision becomes obvious when one follows the normal 
activities of a pupil to whom an uninteresting lesson 
has been assigned. 
Effects of uninteresting assignment. Attention is 
controlled directly by interest; that is, by a feeling that 
the object attended to has value or importance. This 
feeling may, of course, arise either from the belief that 
the object of attention threatens one’s happiness and 
welfare, or from the belief that it will contribute in a
-P-A-G-E-90
  72 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
positive way toward greater happiness, although with 
children the latter has much greater influence unless 
the danger is extremely menacing and immediate. 
Strictly speaking, to ask a child to study an uninter- 
esting lesson is asking a psychological impossibility, 
since the mind, from its very nature, refuses to attend 
to anything which is not felt to be worth the effort of 
attention. 
This difficulty was encountered by the old-fashioned 
schoolmaster of pioneer days, so he stimulated artifi- 
cial interest in the conning of lessons by a sternly 
devised and vigorously applied system of penalties — 
a negative type of interest, to be sure, but, as tradition 
has it, the danger was made sufficiently menacing and 
immediate to secure the form and appearance of dili- 
gent study. Tradition tells us also that nothing 
beyond the external forms and results of study was 
usually secured or expected, but, as the incentives 
were only skin deep, it was hardly to be expected that 
interest and effort would go deeper. This practice of 
depending on negative incentives to secure the sem- 
blance of application during study periods has been 
handed down to the present day, and candor compels 
the admission that, in very many schools, the assign- 
ment of lessons regularly omits any attention whatever 
to reasons for studying, but takes for granted the 
understanding that unpleasant consequences are to 
follow a violation of the conventionalities in this 
respect. The penalties have taken a much milder and
-P-A-G-E-91
  
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 73 
less muscular form in their transmission to the present 
day, but are still sufficiently menacing to cause the 
class to assume, more or less promptly, the attitude 
and appearance of study. Then begins a very instruc- 
tive illustration of the normal operation of the laws of 
interest and attention, especially if viewed from any 
angle except that of the teacher in charge of the room. 
How such assignments work out in practice. For 
any individual there are always numerous objects and 
activities that are more or less interesting. But one of 
the laws referred to above is that attention is given to 
the particular one of these which, at the moment, is 
felt to be of most interest or importance. So, in the 
case of the class to which the teacher has signified that 
it is time for study, habit and experience cause the 
feeling that the most important thing at that moment 
is to assume the position and begin the movements 
expected under the circumstances. George and John, 
in response to the questioning look of the teacher, 
atone for their delay in inaugurating the conventional 
activities by the ostentation with which they carry 
them out. When this has been executed to the appar- 
ent satisfaction of the teacher and she turns to other 
work, the relative importance of this activity dimin- 
ishes, and other interests begin to compete for atten- 
tion. Unless something has created an interest in the 
material itself, good intentions are unable to maintain 
the unequal battle, and the attention turns to some- 
thing which, for the moment, is more interesting. So  
-P-A-G-E-92
  4 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
George leaves the stage of his study desk set to carry 
on the appearance of work, adjusts a book to serve as 
a screen for activities, and gives his attention to what 
his interests suggest are worthier objects. 
The first thing that seems important enough to 
claim his attention is the coming match ball-game. 
This is a safe beginning because he has learned to look 
past his book at such visions, with nothing in his be- 
havior to attract reproof. After he has played through 
a critical stage of this game with such startling skill as 
to bring wild cheers from the spectators and a later 
offer from a big-league manager, who, by a remarkable 
coincidence, happened to be present, he notices that 
John, a little distance away, is busily engaged in con- 
structing something. The instinct of curiosity imme- 
diately suggests that this is of such importance as to 
deserve attention, so George sits alert and keenly 
observant, engaging for the moment in real study as he 
tries to solve the problem of John’s zealous activity. 
When he discovers that the object is a paper pin- 
wheel, the instinct of imitation prompts him to try the 
same, but, after an unsuccessful attempt, he uses the 
paper for drawing comic pictures, a line of activity 
which he has found to be a more satisfactory expres- 
sion for his creative impulses. Social instincts then 
prompt him to share the enjoyment of his productions, 
so he props up the paper so that other pupils may see 
his cartoons, and the evident appreciation on the part 
of his neighbors affords him keen satisfaction and con-
-P-A-G-E-93
  HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 15 
vinces him that such activity is well worthy of his 
attention. Just then he observes that the teacher’s gaze 
is upon him, and the importance of resuming a study 
attitude rises to the point of securing his attention, 
He realizes also that the study period is almost over, 
while the danger of total unpreparedness is sufficiently 
immediate and menacing to hold his attention to such 
a smattering preparation as will barely avert the 
unpleasant consequences attendant upon complete 
unfamiliarity with the work assigned, 
When recitation time comes, George naturally 
assumes a defensive attitude. Since his chief incen- 
tives for studying were negative in character, so his 
chief interest in the recitation is to defend himself 
against unpleasant consequences. In his defensive 
tactics he relies upon chance words or phrases which 
he can remember from the text, gives sidelong glances 
at the open book on his own or a neighbor’s desk, 
frames ambiguous replies in the hope that the teacher 
will interpret them favorably, reéchoes the whispered 
answers supplied by his neighbors, and endeavors in 
all possible ways to conceal his ignorance of things 
which he has never felt to be worth the effort of really 
learning. 
Opportunities missed. To expect improvement in 
the power of self-directed study to result from such 
activities as those just described is as absurd as hoping 
to harvest figs from thistles. And yet the sketch 
merely shows the normal activities of a normal boy,
-P-A-G-E-94
6 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
with reasonably good intentions, during the usual 
circumstances following the usual assignment. A boy 
possessing unusual courage and frankness, admirable 
American qualities, is apt to be visited with discipline 
if he acts as he feels and scorns the subterfuges of his 
classmates. The vicious effects upon the moral stand- 
ards of pupils should condemn the practice of turning 
them toward evasion and deception by asking the 
impossible task of study without interest, even if its 
intellectual results were in any way satisfactory. In 
the logic of actual results the double condemnation of 
the custom should be final. Its continuation seems 
strange in view of the opportunities in any school for 
enlisting the interest of pupils — opportunities easily 
taken advantage of by any teacher who has a sym- 
pathetic understanding of the instinctive sources of 
children’s interest. For example, each of the instine- 
tive tendencies which in its turn directed George’s 
attention toward some triviality, could have been 
utilized to claim his interest and direct his attention 
toward the legitimate work of the study period, as will 
be discussed a little later. 
The hunger of the pupils for anything at all inter- 
esting will make acceptable an assignment that has 
even the slightest sauce of interest. This hunger is 
shown by the eagerness with which they pay attention 
in the schoolroom to activities too trivial for more than 
a passing glance on the outside. Appreciation is at its 
maximum, and not only are funny things superlatively
-P-A-G-E-95
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 17 
funny in school, but anything which holds a touch of 
real life interest can also be made more interesting 
there than elsewhere. An illustration of this may be 
seen when there is brought into the school room a war 
trophy, a piece of scientific apparatus, even cater- 
pillars, or pet animals, provided the teacher is sensible 
enough to make a better use of the last-named than 
that historic pedagogue to whose school Mary came 
followed by her little lamb. The teacher who com- 
plains that pupils are prone to be looking for anything 
as an object of their attention except the lesson as- 
signed, should recognize instead their hunger for inter- 
esting things as an opportunity and invitation to use 
it by making even a moderate appeal to interest in the 
assignments. Children come to school hoping to find 
the work interesting; the school organization is ar- 
ranged to furnish conditions favorable to study; 
there is the minimum of competition for the children’s 
attention; everything is in the teacher’s favor. Under 
such circumstances, to supply the element of interest 
so indispensable to real study must surely seem easier 
than to endure the distracting consequences that 
inevitably follow the neglect of opportunities to stimu- 
late interest in work assigned. 
The problem of interest. In his Principles of Teach- 
ing Thorndike says, in regard to securing interest, 
“The problem of interest in teaching is not whether 
children shall learn with interest or without it; they 
never learn without it; but what kind of interest it 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
    
78 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
shall be; from what the interest shall be derived.” 
This puts the problem in the practical form in which 
most teachers meet it. They wish to know what kind 
of interest is to be made use of, and what is to be the 
source of it. They have heard of “soft pedagogy,” 
and of schools in which attempts to make everything 
“interesting ” have broken down all standards of work 
and behavior, so they are justly suspicious of that 
kind of so-called interest. Moreover, although they 
have seen the splendid work done by certain pupils 
who were really interested in some study and have 
earnestly wished that the entire class might catch the 
feeling, they know that interest cannot be plucked out 
of the air in any magical fashion, and wish to know 
from what sources it can be drawn and how it can be 
shaped to accomplish trustworthy and desirable results 
in the preparation of lessons. 
Interest and work. Many well-meaning people have 
fallen into the error of confusing interest with mere 
entertainment. The resultant attempts to make 
everything pleasant for the children at the expense of 
serious, earnest work are a travesty upon real teach- 
ing, and usually fail even to please the children. The 
most vital interests of children lie not along the paths 
of ease and pleasantness, but on the road to serious, 
strenuous effort. Thorndike makes clear the distinc- 
tion between activities that are merely pleasant and 
those that are interesting, and adds, “a tug of war and 
putting up the heavy dumb-bell the fiftieth time are
-P-A-G-E-97
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 79 
definitely painful, but may be very interesting.” The 
writer remembers a plucky little left end on a high- 
school football team, who, in a losing game, painfully 
threw himself again and again in front of the heavier 
opponents, and resisted all entreaties to spare himself 
and leave the game, because he wished to keep the op- 
ponents’ score from becoming what he considered 
disgracefully high. He scorned ease and comfort, and 
struggled on with grim fortitude on account of his 
interest. Every mother will testify how ready children 
are to risk life and limb and work themselves to ex- 
haustion in the earnest pursuit of some absorbing 
interest. In fact, a vital interest is the only means of 
. securing anything near the maximum of serious effort 
and energy of which children are capable. 
In this same connection another fact should be 
emphasized, which is in a sense a corollary of the prin- 
ciple just discussed. This is that children when work- 
ing from interest are partial to clear-cut, definite regu- 
lations, and rather high, exacting standards. The 
well-organized, accurately trained team holds the 
interest of its members better than the easy-going, 
unorganized team. Children in their play will tolerate 
no wabbly, ambiguous rules. The slipshod player is 
roundly criticized by his mates. The strict regulation 
of a Scout or Camp-Fire organization, including even 
unpleasant duties, has its type of appeal, and the vol- 
untary “gang” or club is always exacting in some of 
its requirements. For the purposes of this discussion,
-P-A-G-E-98
    
80 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
then, two important facts stand out regarding the kinds 
of interests and the activities that best stimulate and 
hold them: first, vital interests are active instead of 
passive, and are strengthened by the serious effort 
which they lead the child to put forth; and, second, 
work inspired by interest is most apt to retain that 
interest when done according to definite and reason- 
ably exacting standards. Or, to put it negatively for 
the sake of correcting erroneous impressions, the real 
interest with which good teaching should stimulate 
good study is not passive and easy-going in character, 
nor courted by weak-kneed, slipshod requirements. 
Harnessing interest. The recognition by educators 
that the term “interest” is somewhat indefinite, and 
subject to misinterpretation as well as misapplication, 
has led to the use of other terms which denote more 
definitely the active, organized type of interest just 
discussed. One of these is the term “motivation,” 
which signifies the employment of interest to secure 
the willing, intelligent accomplishment of specific 
tasks — the harnessing of interest, so to speak, as the 
motive power for the necessary work of the school. 
The object, of course, is to have the child realize the 
value and need of the work assigned, and only such 
natural interests of the child are appealed to as will 
furnish a motive for earnest purposive effort. Wilson 
and Wilson, in their book, The Motivation of School 
Work, put it as follows: 
The p child’s 's work i is ey whenever he sees a real use
-P-A-G-E-99
    HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 81 
in it — whenever it satisfies ‘some need he feels, provides some value he wants, supplies some control he wishes to pos- sess, secures some desired end, or helps him to attain any definite goal. —— 
The practical application of interest takes still more 
definite form in what is called the “ problem-project 
method.” The child undertakes a project which ap- 
peals to his interest and which may involve construc- 
tion, production, investigation, or some other line of 
purposive activity for the satisfactory completion 
of which he willingly assumes responsibility. In the 
development of this project he will frequently have 
need of reference to texts or other sources for informa- 
tion. Incidental problems may arise which must be 
solved before he can proceed, and these, indeed, may 
prove even more interesting than the original project. 
When the importance and significance of any phase of school-work is thus demonstrated to a child through 
its necessity to the attainment of some chosen end, this 
acquired interest frequently includes related phases 
of school-work also and awakens a new attitude toward 
the material of that subject. The problem as a means 
of stimulating and utilizing interest is often effectively 
used without the constructive features involved in a 
real project. So valuable are its possibilities in this 
respect that the problem method is now the prevailing 
one used by the best teachers of geography and his- 
tory. The conditions under which a problem consti- 
tutes an effective channel of interest will be discussed a
-P-A-G-E-100
82 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
little later in connection with the instinctive basis 
underlying it. 
The sources of interest. The question as to the 
sources from which interest is to be derived is an 
extremely practical one for the teacher. The com- 
plaint that it seems impossible to get a certain pupil 
interested in anything is not an uncommon one. The 
problem is simplified, however, in theory at least, by 
recognizing the fact that all interests spring from the 
fundamental instincts. Consequently new interests 
must either be derived from existing interests, or, 
under certain conditions, developed in response to and 
satisfaction of instinctive tendencies already present 
in the pupil. The utilization of these sources of interest 
is therefore dependent upon some understanding of 
the nature of the instincts themselves. Such under- 
standing is the more necessary in order to avoid being 
misled by the often-repeated but dangerous maxim, 
“Tt is always safe to follow a child’s instincts.” 
Adaptability of instincts. For practical purposes an 
instinct may be defined as an inborn desire for and 
tendency toward some particular type of activity. 
The motor adjustments necessary to the performance 
of this activity may or may not be inherited ready- 
made. Among the lower animals, instincts regularly 
include inherited preparations for the satisfying ac- 
tivity so nearly complete that there is only moderate 
need for later adjustments, and consequently small 
opportunity for modification or education. For ex-
-P-A-G-E-101
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 83 
ample, since a pig or a chicken instinctively “knows 
how” to perform practically every activity either 
desires to perform, the possible range of education for 
both of them is extremely limited. But in the case of 
man, the rich heritage of instincts fortunately consists 
mainly in desires and interests for the satisfaction of 
which he has no specific, ready-made adjustment, and 
for which he must consequently find through experi- 
ence a satisfying activity. Moreover, the range of 
adaptability and variation in the activity that will 
satisfy the instinct is in most cases generously wide, 
and therein lies the great opportunity of education. 
For example, the instinct of self-display, as a prelim- 
inary phase of the mating instinct, finds expression in 
a startling variety of ways if one considers the dress 
and behavior characteristic of the courtship customs 
of various countries. In fact, a sufficiently striking 
illustration may be found in our own locality when 
we reflect that this identical instinct prompts both 
the offensive behavior of a vulgar street-corner masher 
and the courteous attentions of a refined gentleman. 
The familiar remark that “human nature remains 
the same the world over” is a popular way of express- 
ing the fundamental permanence and uniformity of 
human instincts, but the great work of civilization 
has been to eliminate gradually the crude, the vulgar, 
and the vicious behavior as expressions for various 
instincts, and to substitute for them constantly wiser, 
better, and more altruistic forms of activity in satis-
-P-A-G-E-102
    
84 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
faction of the same instincts. The school has a similar 
task, and a tremendous advantage in the fact that its 
children come with a keen realization of the incom- 
pleteness and inadequacy in most cases of their means 
of satisfying the ambitious promptings of their in- 
stincts, and are hoping to acquire in school the knowl- 
edge and skill essential to the desired activities. The 
school must meet these instinctive needs and demon- 
strate the value and significance of the material it 
offers, or suffer from having the pupils turn in disap- 
pointment to other sources. Their resultant behavior 
is frequently silly and troublesome, but the insistent 
hunger for something to appease their instinctive 
desires seizes upon even the trivial or mischievous, and 
the undesirable interests thus formed force a double 
task upon later education. 
The scope of this volume hardly permits further 
general discussion in the field of instincts, but a sym- 
pathetic understanding of the reasons for the appar- 
ently irrational interests and behavior of children is 
so necessary to a correct teaching attitude, and an 
intelligent utilization of interest as essential to study 
that it seems fitting, before taking up a few particular 
instincts, to add a reiteration and a warning; the first, 
the source of all interest is in instincts, and it is only 
by making a new activity contribute in some way to 
the satisfaction of instinctive desires that interest in 
it can be aroused; the second, there is no surer way to 
lose the good-will and codperation of a child, and de-
-P-A-G-E-103
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 85 
velop evasion or hostility instead, than by attempting 
to suppress an undesirable interest without substitut- 
ing at the same time another activity that has an 
equally powerful appeal to instincts then dominant in 
the pupil’s life. 
Instincts most available for study motives 
Modern texts on psychology and child study give 
extended consideration to instincts, and contain lists 
of those involved in various phases of teaching. But 
reading on such topics should by all means be supple- 
mented by first-hand observation of children at play, 
because it is during their play that they reveal most 
freely their dominant instincts and corresponding in- 
terests. To mingle unobtrusively among children at 
play, to note their choice and pursuit of what seems 
to them the most important things in the world, and 
to observe how the developing train of instincts impels 
them to “outgrow” the simpler imitative and repeti- 
tive activities of the primary grades, and turn to the 
keenly competitive and assertive interests of the 
middle grades, and still later to dominantly social 
tendencies, will best help one to acquire that familiar- 
ity with instinctive behavior without which lectures 
and reading have little practical significance. On that 
account, teacher-training courses should require, if 
possible, that students of psychology and theory 
spend supplementary time with children on the play- 
ground, preferably mingling themselves in the play.
-P-A-G-E-104
  86 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
Teachers who continue to do this are the ones who 
best understand and are able to use the natural inter- 
ests of their pupils. 
Various authors have suggested lists of instincts 
that are of value in teaching. The most comprehen- 
sive treatments are to be found in Averill’s A Psy- 
chology for Normal Schools, Kirkpatrick’s Fundamen- 
tals of Child Study, and the first volume of Thorn- 
dike’s Educational Psychology; but the average teacher 
will probably find more practical suggestions in the 
latter’s condensed discussion on Principles of Teach- 
ing, where he gives the following list as of chief 
importance to the teacher: mental activity, curiosity, 
physical activity, manipulation, collecting, ownership, 
sociability, emulation, kindliness, pugnacity and mas- 
tery, and independence and defiance. Strayer and 
Norsworthy choose the following somewhat similar 
list for their discussion: physical activity, mental 
activity, manipulation, acquisition and collecting, 
rivalry, pugnacity, imitation, sociability, kindliness, 
and love of approval. On the following pages only 
those instincts have been chosen for special treatment 
which are of immediate importance in furnishing 
motives for study. 
Mental activity and curiosity. This instinct, in the 
opinion of Thorndike, “‘is the fountain-head of human 
intellectual development and has been in the past the 
chief support of school education.” The child won- 
ders, examines, speculates, “builds air-castles,” and 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 87 
engages in mental activity whether there is need 
for it or not. This instinct prompts many voluntary 
undertakings, from reading stories and solving puzzles 
to literary study and scientific research. After school 
years this instinct is usually operative in a compara- 
tively narrow field where habit and other influences 
select special lines of investigation as a recreative 
pleasure; but in childhood its field is wide and shallow. 
Its weakness as a source of interest lies in its suscepti- 
bility to every changing attraction, and it alone will 
not secure continued application to an undertaking if 
there are competing objects of attention, and is most 
effective when reénforced by other instincts. 
For example, a child’s interest in having the parts 
of a machine explained or an experiment performed by 
some one else is far less keen and continuous than if he 
takes it apart or handles the materials himself, thus 
supplementing curiosity with the joy of manipula- 
tion. It does, however, afford the readiest approach 
and quickest appeal to interest of all the instincts, and 
can be put to valuable use. It is the chief source of 
initial interest in the problem or question method of 
teaching, but, in actual practice, this interest will be 
found unsteady unless supplemented by the force of 
other instincts, such as are suggested in the following 
paragraphs, and which all prompt interest that is less 
prone to be fickle and vacillating. 
Physical activity and manipulation. This tendency 
is so much in evidence among school-children, and is
-P-A-G-E-106
  
  88 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
so frequently the source of most classroom disturb- 
ances and consequent annoyance to the teacher, that 
it seems strange, indeed, that it has not been more 
generally made use of in school, and its motive power 
enlisted as a helper instead of being allowed to serve as 
a disturber of the peace. The frequently used plan of 
depending on manual training or generous provision 
for physical exercise and play to relieve this tendency, 
and keep children quieter in school, is merely a defen- 
sive measure so far as study is concerned, and fails to 
use a valuable possibility for positive motives. One 
teacher, who had been much annoyed by a seventh- 
grade boy who was usually making darts, pin-wheels, 
gliders, or other objects instead of studying his history 
lesson, at last, half from desperation, half perhaps 
from inspiration, asked him to make models of the 
various means of transportation in use during the 
colonial period which they were then studying. He 
eagerly agreed to the attractive assignment, and in the 
succeeding days did more studying and searching for 
information as to how his models should look than he 
had ever before been known to do. The interest and 
pride which he took in his completed products were 
contagious, and the remainder of the class asked to be 
allowed to do some of their study in that way. The 
final display of their work in reproducing the styles of 
clothes for men and women, the colonial houses, writ- 
ing materials, weapons, spinning-wheels, and imple- 
ments, not only gave proof of the greatest enthusiasm
-P-A-G-E-107
  
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 89 
and most thorough familiarity with the period, but 
also represented the best and most willing study which 
that teacher had ever secured from any class. 
This accidental discovery, by the teacher of a sev- 
enth-grade history class, of the mine of interest to be 
found in children’s instinctive desire to handle mate- 
rials and make things, might as readily have been made 
in some other subject, for there is no instinct open 
to a greater range of satisfying activities, and conse- 
quently available for use in more different lines. The 
making of relief models, filling in product and industry 
maps, constructing type forms in miniature, and simi- 
lar constructive work, are only a few of the ways in 
which this tendency may contribute interest for geog- 
raphy study. The writer has never seen a more inter- 
ested class studying Snow- Bound than one which con- 
structed, as a group project, a reproduction in minia- 
ture of the living-room of the Whittier home, with the 
circle about the fireside. In the discussions, the rea- 
sons brought forward by each pupil to justify his opin- 
ion regarding some item showed most careful and 
intelligent study. Incidentally, the writer has rarely 
seen a class show such genuine appreciation of the 
spirit and message of the poem as this one — a result 
naturally to be expected from their keen interest in 
visualizing and “realizing” the details of the poem. 
Just as the problem method of attack draws its 
initial interest from the instinct of curiosity, so the 
project method finds its best ally in the manipulative, 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
90 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
constructive tendency — the instinct to make things. 
It has been a misfortune that the manual training and 
handwork in schools have so often been confined to 
formalized wood-working, paper-folding, or similar 
“cut-and-dried” work, thereby affording only a nar- 
row and barren expression for this instinct. The pres- 
ent tendency is happily in the direction of greater 
variety and elasticity in handwork, affording oppor- 
tunity for the pupils to develop a wider field of inter- 
ests and also permitting project and construction 
work in connection with other subjects. In most rural 
schools the only chance for handwork is in this way, 
and it is by far the most desirable, valuable, and inter- 
esting line that can be taken for much of the manual- 
training activity in any school. 
In the primary grades, of course, this instinct ap- 
pears as a tendency to undirected activity, restless- 
ness, and noisiness. The foolish, wasteful practice of 
merely repressing this is now generally giving way to 
methods that furnish an outlet for this tendency in 
more movement and directed activities. But even in 
the first grade it should be led along its natural line of 
development into purposive construction, the form of 
activity which most fully satisfies it. Without such 
guidance it finds expression along mischievous lines. 
The most important thing for the teacher to realize is 
that these fundamental instincts, like murder, “will 
out,” and, unless they are given an outlet favorable to 
study, they are very apt to appear in forms that not
-P-A-G-E-109
  HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 91 
only waste the time for study, but may cast a harmful 
influence over the whole work of the school. 
Expression and communication, Another very 
strong and serviceable instinct is the desire to tell 
things. It is social in character, and so universal that 
very few of us, upon hearing an unusual piece of news, 
can resist the tendency to tell others and enjoy the 
impression it makes upon them. In the worst forms 
it can take it animates the gossip and scandal-monger, 
but, fortunately, it is usually satisfied by more cred- 
itable activities. This tendency probably inspires 
more volunteer recitation activity than any other, and 
the most frequent display of disappointment by pupils 
is at not getting to tell something they know and wish 
to tell. From the first grade on it is always a difficult 
and delicate task to “hush up” the child who wishes 
to tell unnecessary things, without arousing the re- 
sentment that usually follows the thwarting of an 
instinctive desire. Although many teachers uncon- 
sciously rely upon this instinct to furnish life for the 
recitation, very few make deliberate and effective use 
of it as a means of stimulating study. 
Kirkpatrick, in his Fundamentals of Child Study, 
classifies the “expressive instinct” as one of the re- 
sultant instincts, “because it owes its origin to various 
other instincts.” In the developed and modified form 
which it regularly has assumed by the time pupils are 
old enough to be assigned work for independent study, 
the factors of imitation and necessity are subordinate
-P-A-G-E-110
  92 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
to the growing desire for social participation, and per- 
haps to an element of self-display. On account of this 
composite origin, it is satisfied only by such expression 
as meets an appreciative response from others. Con- 
sequently any plan for making the most effective use 
of this instinct in motivating study should include an 
opportunity for the pupil to secure such a response. 
This condition is not fulfilled when all pupils are asked 
to study and recite upon identical material. There is 
as little joy in telling what one realizes the class al- 
ready knows as there is in having to listen to what one 
already knows, and the response in the latter case 
is hardly characterized by stimulating appreciation. 
Under such circumstances it is not surprising that 
pupils in the upper grades and high school are apt to 
develop habits of fragmentary, lifeless, “ monosyl- 
labic” reciting — anything the teacher will tolerate, 
since they have nothing really interesting to tell the 
class. The inevitable effect of this upon their interest 
in study needs no comment. Meanwhile the instinct 
for expression and communication, finding no attrac- 
tive outlet through the assigned work, takes other 
paths in quest of an appreciative response, and every 
teacher knows how troublesome and harmful the re- 
sults may be. 
. Obviously, this instinct can be put to the best serv- 
ice only when each pupil can expect to contribute 
something to the recitation which the majority of the 
pupils do not already know. This is most fully ac-
-P-A-G-E-111
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 93 
complished in a socialized form of recitation, and 
especially where pupils are divided into codperative 
groups. But under any arrangement of classification 
and grouping, it is possible for each pupil to feel a 
touch of individual responsibility or opportunity in 
the assignment. If the assigned work includes, as a 
minimum, five topics, each pupil may be asked to 
choose how he will undertake to supplement some one 
of these by personal investigation. This supplemen- 
tary work may require the taking of measurements, an 
investigating trip after school, an interview with an 
official or resident of the community, performing an 
experiment, reference to an encyclopedia, or some 
other similar effort. Whatever form it may take, the 
pupil realizes that he is expected to be able to tell the 
class something new and interesting. Many pupils 
have had their study habits completely transformed 
in this way, for there is no keener incentive to careful 
preparation than the prospect of an interested, re- 
spectful, appreciative audience. Furthermore, when a 
pupil has earned and enjoyed the reward of attentive 
interest on the part of his classmates to some contribu- 
tion he has made, he at once feels an interest in making 
all his preparation worthy of that attitude. There are 
few ways in which superior teaching ability is more 
clearly shown than in using effectively this instinct — 
in guiding the development of wholesome self-respect 
and generously willing participation in class discus- 
sions, without allowing the tendency to become exag-

94 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
gerated into egotistic “showing off,” or to descend, on 
the other hand, into channels of clandestine, ques- 
tionable communication. 
Ownership. This instinct influences the interests 
of children all through their school life, but has been 
variously named from the forms of activity it inspires. 
Up to about the sixth grade the choice of these activi- 
ties is influenced almost wholly by sentimental con- 
siderations, and the term “collecting instinct” is 
most frequently applied. Later the economic factor is 
apt to become more prominent, and the tendency then 
is known as “acquisitiveness.” Adults are very apt to 
overestimate the appeal which economic considera- 
tions make to the interest of children. The number of 
children who have been admonished to learn their 
arithmetic because of its value for later money-making 
very far exceeds the number of those who actually 
have taken an interest on that account. It is true, 
especially in the upper grades and high school, that an 
effective appeal to interest can be made through 
economic channels, but the attempts to do so are so 
frequently ill-considered and futile that a warning 
seems in place. It should be remembered that senti- 
mental considerations continue to dominate the child’s 
choice of things with which to satisfy his desire for 
ownership, even after the economic factor becomes 
influential. Even the value of money is discounted 
in his eyes except as it leads to immediate possession 
of a desired object. Rare, indeed, is the child whose
-P-A-G-E-113
  
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 95 
interest responds to the call of “cold commercialism.” 
Consequently the instinct for ownership can best be 
utilized through connecting the work to be studied 
with the child’s wish to acquire immediately some 
tangible possession as an object of pride, affection, or 
expression for other instincts. 
The interest in making collections, due to this 
instinct, may be used very profitably in connection 
with the study of geography, history, elementary 
science, reading, and arithmetic. The investigations so 
far made indicate that this tendency is strongest at 
about the ninth or tenth year of age. Since this is so 
nearly the time that the interests effective in the 
primary grades are beginning to fail, and something 
must be found with which to meet a growing restless- 
ness and distaste for school-work, this instinct often 
presents the readiest and most serviceable pathway to 
interest. Especially in those numerous cases where 
the children are already interested in some line of col- 
lecting, the teacher should endeavor to make some use 
of it, either directly or as a means to stimulate interest 
in related lines. In the upper grades, where vocational 
interests may develop and give emphasis to economic 
values, there is opportunity to stimulate interest in 
whatever can be shown to have immediate and practi- 
cal value of that sort. In actual practice, however, 
the instinct for ownership is regularly found to have 
spasmodic and unsteady motive value, and so, al- 
though it is extremely serviceable at times, when
-P-A-G-E-114
  
  96 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
“taken at its flood,” the best regular use to make of 
it is in conjunction with some more stable source of 
interest, and especially with the constructive instinct. 
Love of approval. One of the earliest and most per- 
sistent of the social instincts is the desire for approval. 
Under the normal relationship between teacher and 
pupil in the primary grades, the child’s happiness is 
dependent upon winning an occasional approving 
word or smile. As the child grows older, he attaches 
increasing importance to the approval of his class- 
mates, but even in the upper grades, if the teacher has 
won the respect and cordial good-will of a pupil, his 
approval still carries great weight. Consequently a 
teacher of attractive personality can get a strong re- 
sponse through the use of this instinct. It is probably 
wise, however, to choose some other form of appeal 
instead of personal approval, if it is at all possible. 
In the first place, educators agree that Superintendent 
Schaeffer was right when he declared, “‘The aim of the 
teacher should be to make himself useless.”” The pupil 
who works mainly to win the approval of the teacher 
is hardly developing power of independent self-direc- 
tion, and if his next teacher fails to win his esteem the 
results may be disastrous. So, although a sense of his 
teacher’s approval will at all times justly have a 
strongly stimulating influence upon a pupil’s efforts, 
the wise teacher will hold this in reserve unless needed 
to bolster some flagging interest or encourage a dis- 
heartened worker, and endeavor always to stimulate 
through less personal appeals.
-P-A-G-E-115
  
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 97 
A far better use to make of this instinct is in con- 
nection with the pupil’s desire to have the approval 
of his classmates. A large part of his behavior is in- 
evitably influenced by that consideration, whether 
the teacher wishes it or not. The problem is to direct 
the recitation activities along lines that will make the 
material studied furnish a satisfactory opportunity for 
winning that approval. To do this means the adop- 
tion in some form of what is known in modern practice 
as the socialized recitation. Some typical examples of 
this are given later in this chapter. Probably the best 
evidence that a recitation is really socialized is for the 
pupils, in their participation in it, to recite primarily 
to and for each other rather than merely to please 
and satisfy the teacher. Naturally, also, the unsocial 
spirit of emulation gives place to a spirit of codpera- 
tive participation. Strayer and others have pointed 
out the inconsistency of setting up social codperation 
as one of the chief aims of the school, while retaining 
the practice of discouraging or even penalizing codper- 
ative work in school. As soon as the pupil is con- 
fronted with a recitation responsibility in which a cred- 
itable contribution from him will be welcomed by 
the entire group, his instinctive desire to win their ap- 
proval is enlisted toward better preparation, especially 
when he realizes that the unpopular thing will be to 
fail, instead of to “‘star,” as has formerly been often 
the case. In the past the pupil who courted popularity 
has rarely been much disturbed over his poor recita-
-P-A-G-E-116

| 98 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
| tions, but has taken care not to bungle his part in the 
class play, or fail to do his best on the ball team. The 
socialized recitation undertakes to capitalize this love 
of social approval and turn it into a motive for study. 
Miscellaneous instincts. In the writer’s experience 
and observation the foregoing groups of instincts 
furnish the most valuable and serviceable sources of 
interest available as motives for study. There are, 
however, other instincts that are capable of good 
service. The instinct of rivalry and emulation is a 
powerful factor in the efforts of men and women as 
well as children. Although it regularly supplies a 
strong incentive for study, no extended discussion of it 
is given here, because, in common practice, the tend- 
ency is toward over-use rather than under-use of it. 
Apart from the danger that it will lead pupils toward 
superficiality, and an emphasis on form rather than on 
deeper values, its influence is unsocial. Consequently, 
even in those situations where it performs almost in- 
dispensable service, the competition should be trans- 
ferred as soon as possible from an individual basis to 
a group basis and thereby socialized. 
Imitation is another instinctive tendency that may 
be profitably used. In the primary grades it is one of 
the most valuable allies that the teacher has. It may 
be put to good service while teaching pupils how to 
study, and in giving them a good start at it under 
supervision. In the upper grades it appears as a 
tendency toward conformity with the standards of the  
-P-A-G-E-117
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 99 
social group, and may be utilized in improving study 
through covperative group undertakings. Mention 
should also be made of the fighting instinct, with the 
related desires for mastery and independence. If situa- 
tions can be produced which put a pupil on his mettle, 
there is no finer incentive than the resultant grim, 
dogged type of interest that persists and conquers any 
reasonable difficulty. 
In many cases interests are derived from other 
interests so that sometimes it is not easy or necessary 
to try to analyze the original instinctive sources. 
Names that have been applied are mainly for con- 
venience in discussion, and vary with different authori- 
ties. The name merely suggests the general form of 
activity toward which the instinct tends, and that 
fortunately is capable of wide variation under guid- 
ance. Thorndike says, in this connection, “Original 
nature seems to decide that the individual will respond 
somehow to certain situations more often than it 
decides just what he will do.” It is the teacher’s busi- 
ness to see that the situations which call forth the 
response are wholesome in character. The resultant 
interests will have power and can yield service for 
school tasks only as long as they are an outlet for some 
instinctive desire and keep to the path it demands. 
The folly of leaving the path of interest, in an en- 
deavor to be more direct, in reality sacrifices both time 
and results. A good way of putting this truth is by 
Cook in Play Way, where he says:
-P-A-G-E-118
  100 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
The child’s hearty interest is a powerful engine which will drag a heavy load eventually to its destination. What though you claim to know where that be, and to know also a shorter road? Is it not better to follow the engine that pulls the train, than to drag it back, even though its route be roundabout? 
Illustrative applications 
Interest should be many-sided. As was suggested 
more than once in discussing the serviceability of 
various instincts, the best and most permanent results 
are obtained when interest is derived from two or even 
more instinctive sources. It is true that many pupils 
continue to prepare lessons in which they feel no posi- 
tive interest. They are influenced toward this by a 
sense of duty, by habits of obedience, by the desire to 
avoid unpleasant consequences, or sometimes even 
by ideals of scholarship. These influences have great 
value, to be sure, but the teacher who employs only 
such negative, or, at best, perfunctory, means of 
inciting to effort gets as meager results, in proportion 
to the energy expended, as an engineer would who 
might attempt to run machinery without lubrication. 
Sufficient interest to call forth either self-directed or 
effective study will be secured only when the formal 
incentives of the classroom are supplemented by one 
or more elements of positive appeal. For the teacher 
who insists on having defined a minimum requirement 
in this respect, there may be suggested the very con- 
servative standard employed by Dr. O. W. Caldwell,
-P-A-G-E-119
  
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 101 
Director of the Lincoln Experimental School in con- 
junction with Teachers College. He held that pupils 
in his school should be asked to study only such mate- 
rial as could be made “significant” to them. In other 
words, it is unfair as well as unwise to set tasks in 
which pupils see no utility or value, and no teacher has 
a right to give a study assignment without being sure 
that enough interest has been aroused to make the task 
seem worth the effort required. 
Since the pupils in any class will differ materially, 
not only in interests already formed, but also in the 
character and strength of the tendencies dominant 
with each child, it is important that the appeal to in- 
terest be as many-sided as possible. Utilize as many 
instinctive sources as can be brought to bear upon the 
material, and in each of these allow enough flexibil- 
ity to accommodate differences in temperament and 
capacity. For example, in the use of “projects,” pu- 
pils may and should be allowed some freedom of 
choice, not only as to the particular undertaking for 
which each is to be responsible, but also as to the man- 
ner of developing it, if variation is practicable. In this 
way he is free to give play to the constructive instinct, 
the expressive instinct, the investigating instinct or 
curiosity, or such others as may at the time most in- 
fluence his choice. This flexibility of appeal is also so 
well provided for in the socialized recitation that it 
is worthy of some explanation and illustration. 
The socialized recitation, As was suggested in a  
-P-A-G-E-120
  102 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
previous paragraph the socialized recitation represents 
an attempt to utilize the social instincts of children in 
providing interest and purpose for their school-work. 
Coiperative activity in groups, inspired by some 
common interest, is universally chosen by children in 
their play or voluntary work. Nor is this gregarious 
tendency peculiar to children. At all ages people not 
only seek groups for play and recreation, but also for 
the stimulation needed to carry on their most serious 
work and study. The familiar quip, that “Browning 
is a poet who can be successfully read only with a 
club,” plays upon a fact that applies equally to most 
other study. From the time when the stimulating 
social atmosphere of the English coffee-houses helped 
so much in literary production, down to our modern 
days of study clubs, literary clubs, science clubs, and 
every kind of learned society, study and learning have 
drawn their inspiration almost wholly from social 
stimulation. Since these social factors exert such a 
determining force upon the mental activities of adults 
and children alike, it would seem the part of far- 
sighted wisdom, as well as immediate utility, for the 
school to make wide use of any legitimate means of 
enlisting these social responses. 
Burnham, in his study of the investigations made 
regarding the influence of companionship upon indi- 
vidual ability, found that the mere presence of com- 
panions caused a remarkable increase over the ability 
shown by a child when alone. Experimental evidence
-P-A-G-E-121
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 108 
was conclusive that a child needed group stimulation 
for a full unfolding of his powers, and the instinctive 
hunger of a child for such stimulation is commented 
on by Burnham as follows: 
The social instincts are so strong in children that if they 
are so unfortunate as to be largely isolated from others they 
are apt to create imaginary companions and to live in a 
dream world of society. 
Among his conclusions, this is especially valuable: 
The investigations referred to have chiefly concerned the 
mere presence or absence of other individuals performing 
similar tasks. In a true social group the relations are more 
vital. Each individual feels a responsibility and performs 
some service for the group....Social beings that we are, 
no form of success is so stimulating as social success. When 
we reflect that under present conditions many of the children 
in our schools are so placed that a social success is impossible, 
we see the significance of this point. 
The socialized recitation meets this need. It fur- 
nishes the opportunity for each child to achieve “a 
social success,” to win the appreciative approval of his 
fellows by assuming responsibility and “performing 
some service for the group.” Kirkpatrick, in his anal- 
ysis of the social instinct, names the following tenden- 
cies or distinct forms: (1) gregariousness, or desire for 
companionship; (2) sympathy; (3) love of approbation; 
(4) competitive and codperative activity; (5) loyalty and 
altruism. Not only may the socialized recitation fur- 
nish an outlet for all these, and thus utilize them in 
stimulating better preparation and study, but it also 
heightens the usefulness of many other fundamental  
-P-A-G-E-122
  104 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
sources of interest. For example, the constructive 
instinct can be made to function much more steadily 
and effectively if the result of the construction, prepara- 
tion, and study is to help win “‘a social success” and 
heighten the individual’s importance in the eyes of his 
classmates. 
Such a recitation may take a wide variety of forms, 
dependent upon the subject-matter, type of lesson, 
the age of the pupils, and the size of the class. The one 
indispensable condition, as mentioned before, is that 
the pupils, in taking part, make their contributions 
and discussions primarily to and for each other, rather 
than directly to and for the teacher. Both because 
this can be made clearer by illustration than by ex- 
planation, and because other means of developing 
interest have been rather fully illustrated, most of the 
remaining examples will show how interest has been 
provided for study through the use of the socialized 
recitation. 
In history. The type of lesson in history which is 
usually found hardest to motivate is the review lesson. 
It lacks the attractiveness of new material, and pupils 
are not prone to take interest in reorganizing what 
they think they already know. The spur of an impend- 
ing examination is the means most frequently relied 
upon to get a perfunctory interest in effort that is 
usually limited to memorizing an outline or summary. 
The example given below will illustrate one successful 
attempt to secure interest in a history review by social- 
izing the lesson.
-P-A-G-E-123

The class was ready to review the events leading up 
to the beginning of the Revolution. The teacher 
decided to adopt the suggestion of having the class 
meet as a session of the British Parliament, to discuss 
the strange things that had been happening in Amer- 
‘ica. A Prime Minister was selected the day before, 
and, after the popular réles of Burke and Pitt had been 
filled, each pupil was allowed to choose how he would 
contribute to the discussion. Those who had mis- 
givings about being able to make a speech were allowed 
to prepare letters purporting to have been written by 
relatives in America, and enumerating events about 
which Parliament should be informed. The recitation 
period was too short for the animated and interesting 
discussion. The pupils who gave a realistic and human 
touch to the familiar events were rewarded by the 
frank appreciation of their classmates, while the laugh 
that went up at the expense of a lazy boy, whose letter, 
the Prime Minister said, sounded “as if it had been 
written by the author of the textbook,” was more 
effective than any reproof from the teacher could have 
been. The following week they met one day as the 
Continental Congress, but, at their own request, they 
held weekly sessions of Parliament thereafter until 
time to meet as a Constitutional Convention. 
The results of this type of socialized lesson were 
especially worthy of note. In the first place, the prep- . 
aration for a review lesson was the most interesting 
work of the week. Moreover, the daily study improved
-P-A-G-E-124
  106 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
noticeably as the pupils searched for and seized upon 
events that could be made use of in winning “a social 
success” at the weekly “Session.” The effect in im- 
proving their expression, especially in oral language, 
was also gratifying. Not the least of the good results 
was an excellent appreciation of the real significance 
of the American Revolution as a part of a still greater 
struggle —the long fight of the English-speaking 
peoples for self-government. These weekly “Sessions 
of Parliament” probably violated many traditional 
rules of procedure, and no doubt showed an exagger- 
ated sympathy with the colonists, but the pupils got 
a far more just and accurate conception of the attitude 
of the English common people, as distinct from the 
ambitions of the king, than classes in American history 
have usually acquired. 
The range of possibilities in making adaptations 
of such a plan to other periods is almost unlimited. 
Dramatization of events in history are extremely in- 
teresting to children, and are well worth doing, even 
though they take much more time than the extempore 
style of meeting described above. The socialized 
“game” device is also successfully used, in which the 
pupils are divided into contesting groups with certain 
of their number acting as judges. Some good illustra- 
tions of this are contained in the specimen lessons 
of Simpson’s Supervised Study in History, a book to 
which reference has previously been made. 
In arithmetic. In no subject has there been so many
-P-A-G-E-125
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 107 
attempts to make material “real,” practical, and close 
to life-interest as in arithmetic. The newer textbooks 
show, both in their titles and contents, modern prog- 
ress in this respect. The additional suggestions in the 
books on methods of teaching the subject leave little 
to be offered. But in making use of all such assistance 
and “practical problems,” teachers need to remember 
that a problem is not interesting to a pupil unless it is 
in some way made his own problem. The fact that it 
is “‘practical” carries small commendation in itself. 
Consequently there is need of some plan whereby the 
pupils will make, or at least meet, the problem or 
material as representing something which must be 
mastered in order to attain interesting ends. This can 
best be brought about usually through some type of 
project work, which may or may not be combined with 
the plan of socialized lessons. 
One way of utilizing social interests in arithmetic has 
been found satisfactory in the Training School of the 
Fresno State Teachers College. Miss Daly, the super- 
visor of third- and fourth-grade arithmetic, believed 
that a “school store” would be valuable in connection 
with class-work in that subject. Accordingly the pupils 
of the 4A section were given the project of collecting the 
material and getting current prices. The enthusiasm 
with which they undertook the task was most grati- 
fying, and, within a few days, there was an imposing 
array of empty cocoa tins, coffee cans, butter cartons, 
raisin boxes, and a long list of other receptacles. This
-P-A-G-E-126
  
  108 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
material, supplemented by display boxes which vari- 
ous manufacturers were glad to send us, furnished all 
that was needed in the way of a stock for our store. 
The fact should be emphasized, however, that the 
most valuable, and, to the pupils, the most interesting 
material was that which they themselves brought in 
and for which they learned the local prices. An in- 
expensive quantity of “play money” finished the 
equipment. One simple way of using it is for one of the 
class to act as cashier, while the others select their 
purchases, find individually the total cost to see if it 
comes within their “cash,” and then watch the cashier 
check the amounts and make change. The latter for- 
feits his position if caught in errors. The possible uses 
of such an improvised store all through the grades, in 
making real all phases of buying and selling, from the 
simplest combinations to business forms and accounts, 
are surprisingly varied, and we are still finding new 
ones. Pupils now, in working the exercises of the text- 
book, frequently criticize the prices quoted there as 
being out-of-date and incorrect, which at least shows 
some vitalizing effects in that they think of the work 
they are studying in connection with real transactions, 
instead of treadmill exercises unconnected with any- 
thing outside of the book. The mere announcement to 
any class that it will use the store at the next recita- 
tion is sufficient to call forth an enthusiastic response, 
and to demonstrate that there is a generous fund of 
interest available for such use as the teacher is re- 
sourceful enough to make of it.
-P-A-G-E-127
  
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 109 
Another semi-socialized project was in connection 
with the construction of a swimming pool for the 
school. An upper-grade class, divided into groups, 
made measurements of the ground, and, after getting 
the local basis for computing costs of excavating and 
cement work, prepared bids on the construction. 
These were later compared with actual bids of con- 
tractors, and the discrepancies discussed. Such plans 
for making their computations as have significance to 
them may be drawn from numerous sources, as house- 
hold accounts, measuring and equipping a playground, 
keeping books on the school supplies — anything that 
touches their lives nearly enough to make it seem 
worth while. 
In language. Probably no other subject is so de- 
pendent on social stimulus for its interest as language, 
because our use of language is so completely a matter 
of social import. We all try to use language well 
enough to communicate what we wish, and to impress 
favorably those whose opinions we value. If our com- 
mand of language is sufficient to accomplish this, and is 
apparently satisfactory to our intimate social group, 
we ourselves are very likely also to be satisfied with it. 
Consequently the best, and frequently the only way 
to interest a pupil in studying to improve his use of 
language, is through a situation that will demonstrate 
to him its present inadequacy for achieving the “social 
success” he wishes. For such a purpose the socialized 
recitation is indispensable.

  110 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
A teacher in junior high school-work, having a 
class whose oral and written English were equally 
poor, with no tendency toward improvement, had 
them organize themselves into a Commercial Club. 
Every pupil was to associate himself with one or more 
other pupils, so as to compose a firm, and announce 
the line of business represented. Their regular meet- 
ings were presided over by a chairman, elected for 
one week only by the Club. Every firm had a repre- 
sentative give an oral report of its transactions for 
that week. The social opportunity to play the réle of 
prosperous business men appealed keenly to their 
interest, and every pupil, in a surprisingly short time, 
developed the ability not only to make a straightfor- 
ward talk, but even to add touches of cleverness. The 
correspondence between the firms over imaginary 
transactions was displayed for general inspection, and 
showed the most careful preparation. One firm, 
fortunate enough to have as a member the son of a 
printer, had a meeting at his shop “after hours,” 
where they set type and printed some real letter-heads 
with which to astonish the rest of the Club. Finally 
their artistic ability was employed to the utmost in 
decorating the advertising posters containing official 
proclamation of the merits of each firm. These posters 
were so interesting that one of the State commis- 
sioners of education came, on special invitation, to see 
them, along with other evidences of originality dis- 
played by the members of the class. The enthusiasm
-P-A-G-E-129
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 111 
in their case was unusual, but it suggests what any 
teacher may do to stimulate interest in studying how 
to improve language. By guiding the class toward an 
organization in which each pupil can earn the reward 
of an appreciative social response only by improving 
his facility in the use of language, the teacher can 
safely rely on the social instincts to furnish all the 
stimulation needed for the effort. 
In geography. The resourceful teacher will be able 
to plan means of applying these principles to other 
subjects. The appeal of the problem method, rightly 
used, has already been discussed in connection with 
geography. The socialized lesson is also frequently 
used to promote interest in that subject. For example, 
the presentation in semi-pageant form of the peoples 
and industries of some important country, in which 
they show how they contribute to our own comfort and 
welfare, affords an excellent feature for a school as- 
sembly or a parents’ day, and the interest of the pupils 
in its preparation will stimulate study for many days. 
It possesses the virtue of permitting either entire 
simplicity in material and costumes, or greater elabo- 
rateness, depending on the resources available or the 
extent to which other work is correlated. 
In literature. It is sometimes difficult to make the 
study of literature connect effectively with the pupils’ 
interest. Since the chief function of literature should 
be to improve taste and cultivate wholesome perma- 
nent interests, it would be, better not to teach it at
-P-A-G-E-130
  112. TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
all than without interest. While the lack of interest is 
usually due to wrong selection of material — for read- 
ing and literature, above all other subjects, should 
call forth spontaneous interest — it sometimes happens 
that a teacher has no choice in the matter, and must 
do her best to save the class from a positive distaste 
for certain required reading. Using extracts for dram- 
atization, the assignment of selected parts to individ- 
uals for special presentation, and similar devices are 
frequently employed. 
The teacher who organized the Commercial Club in 
the language class found it necessary to teach The 
Lady of the Lake to an unenthusiastic class. She an- 
nounced that they would do it into a motion-picture 
scenario, and vote on what “stars” should be chosen 
to represent the various characters. Moreover, each 
pupil was to designate some actual spot within reason- 
able distance which could be adapted to serve as a 
“location” for each important setting. The writer 
confesses that he felt some misgivings lest the classic 
be cheapened under such treatment, but the evident 
anticipation of the pupils was such a welcome contrast 
to their former indifference that it seemed wise to 
await results. It must be admitted also that these, 
under the teacher’s skillful guidance, were most reas- 
suring. The thorough study of characters was evident 
from the spirited arguments as to what actor was most 
worthy to assume a certain réle, and it was significant 
that the question almost always was not whether
-P-A-G-E-131
  
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 113 
the part was a proper one for the actor named, but 
whether the actor was capable of the part. In the dis- 
cussion, also, of a location for the scenes, the pupils 
showed much greater familiarity with and appreciation 
of Scott’s descriptive passages than the usual class gets. 
The plan furnished evidence that it is best to take 
children’s interests as they exist, even if you do not 
approve them, and make them serve a useful purpose, 
while at the same time turning them into more desir- 
able channels. 
In drill subjects. In the primary grades it is fre- 
quently possible to hold interest in drill through the 
instinctive love of repetition and rhythm. As this 
weakens it may be supplemented by games and similar 
devices. The fact that subjects involving mechanical 
processes which require drill for their mastery are the 
ones best adapted to standardized measurements has 
resulted in the production of very satisfactory scales 
for self-testing. These appeal very strongly to an in- 
stinctive desire to beat one’s own past record — a kind 
of self-competitionin which the instinct for mastery fig- 
ures. Pupils who have a handwriting scale accessible 
will frequently set a goal for themselves on that scale 
and practice assiduously to reach it. Similarly pupils 
take an apparent pleasure in climbing up the successive 
steps and sections of standardized drill cards in arith- 
metic. All through the grades it will be found effective 
to use an occasional lesson in which games, contests, 
and other play elements brighten necessary phases of
-P-A-G-E-132
  
  114 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
drill, but teachers are fortunate in no longer having 
to depend so wholly upon such devices. One of the 
best features of the movement which has brought 
forth van tests and measurements is its valuable 
service in making it possible for the motivation of drill 
to be largely automatic with the pupils themselves. 
Chapter summary. There is no real study without 
interest. If the normal interests of the child are not 
satisfied through school-work, they will find an outlet 
in ways antagonistic to it. All interests are based on 
fundamental instincts, and interest in study can be 
aroused only when the material assigned is connected 
with the satisfaction of one or more of these — as 
curiosity, construction, expression, ownership, or va- 
rious social instincts. 
There are effective means of “harnessing” these 
instinctive interests, and some of them have been 
given special names, as the problem method, the 
project method, and the socialized lesson. The last- 
named has a double value in that it is extremely 
serviceable in almost every subject, and furnishes a 
wholesome preparation for codperative responsibili- 
ties in later life. 
The natural interests which children display are 
often objectionable to the teacher, but it should be 
remembered that these are the only raw material 
available and must be handled in some way. Since an 
attempt at suppression without offering an equally 
attractive substitute provokes hostility, it is wisest to
-P-A-G-E-133
  
HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 115 
make at once the best possible use of them in connec- 
tion with school-work and, at the same time, gradually 
guide them into more wholesome channels, both for use 
as motives for study and for vitalizing better stand- 
ards of taste and behavior. 
QUESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. In the Horace Mann School of Teachers College, 
the plan is used of having a pupil whe shows un- 
usual skill in reading appear before a section of 
pupils of nearly the same age, but less advance- 
ment, and read one or more selections to them. 
In this way the class is stimulated to strive for a 
higher standard, and the results seem to show 
that it is better to have the standard set by some 
one of their own age than by a teacher. What 
instincts are utilized by this plan to motivate 
study, first, for the pupil who does the reading, 
and second, for the class which hears the reading? 
Show how the same device could be modified and 
used in connection with other subjects. 
2. One of the most characteristic tendencies of 
children is toward self-glorification — the desire 
to borrow “distinction” from almost any source, 
good or bad, and to plume themselves upon such 
accidental matters as witnessing a wreck, being 
allowed to sit in an aeroplane, or receiving a 
greeting from some popular personage. Such a 
general tendency must be taken into account in

directing children’s interests. Can it be turned 
into some channel to stimulate study? If so, how? 
If not, how can it be prevented from interfering 
with study? 
. “A child in the sixth grade who has followed out 
several good projects probably has acquired 
valuable information and abilities which ordinary 
schooling could not have developed in a life- 
time.” — Freeland, Modern Elementary School 
Practice, p. 51. 
Show in particular how the above statement 
might apply to improvement in study. Outline

some such results as those mentioned. 
; Norsworthy and Whitley, in The Psychology of 
Childhood, say, with regard to play, “‘We see that 
so-called play resolves itself into the functioning 
of gradually ripening instincts,” and further, 
“There is no one specialized, isolated tendency we 
can call the play instinct with definite responses 
bound to definite situations; rather it should be 
regarded as the arousal of many instincts com- 
bined depending on the readiness of the neurones, 
the general law of exercise and specially subject 
to the law of effect.” What does this indicate as 
to the value for the teacher of intimate observa- 
tion of the children’s play? 
. In what sense is it true that there can be no study 
without interest?

dramatic instinct to motivate school-work. Sug- 
gest ways in which it might be of value for im-

. Dewey, in How We Think, says: “Teachers — 
and this holds especially of the stronger and bet- 
ter teachers — tend to rely upon their personal 
strong points to hold a child to his work, and 
thereby to substitute their personal influence for 
that of subject-matter as a motive for study... . 
In this way the teacher’s personality may become 
a source of personal dependence and weakness, 
an influence that renders the pupil indifferent to 
the value of the subject for its own sake.” To 
what extent may the teacher’s personal influence 
be used as a motive without encouraging “de- 
pendence and weakness” in each of these grades 
— second, sixth, ninth? What should always be 
the aim in employing this motive?

your observation in the schoolroom and show how 
the motives that prompted these disturbances 
could have been utilized for securing interest in 
activities favorable to study. 
11. Discuss, with illustrations, the relative strength 
and persistence of the interest shown by pupils in 
assignments arbitrarily given by the teacher, and 
in those which the pupils have themselves helped 
to “discover” and formulate. 
WA project may be either individual or social in 
character; that is, its completion may require 
simply the efforts of a single pupil, or it may call 
for the codperation of a group. Suggest the cir- 
cumstances under which, in your opinion, each 
would be the more appropriate type to use for 
stimulating interest. 
13. Educators agree that a problem makes little ap- 
peal to the interest of a pupil unless it becomes 
his own problem. Explain and illustrate what 
you consider necessary in order that a problem 
be regarded as a “real problem” by the pupil 
and not merely an assigned one. 
14. Suggest ways in which codperation from the 
pupil’s parents, or at least a knowledge of the 
pupil’s home activities may be valuable in over- 
coming indifference toward study. 
15. Writers who discuss motivation usually make a 
distinction between the superficial type of interest 
secured through incentives and devices and the  
-P-A-G-E-137

18. HAVING A MOTIVE FOR STUDY 119 
more effective kind resulting from genuine mo- 
tivation. Explain the distinction, in so far as you 
consider it a valid one, and illustrate the two 
ways of getting interest. 
One of the most enthusiastic claims for the proj- 
ect method is that it is “self-motivating.” Show 
ways in which this may be true. 
It is sometimes said that subject-matter which 
cannot be motivated should be cast out of the 
course of study. Give arguments for or against 
such a proposition. 
Try to recall the times in your life when you 
made the most earnest and effective efforts to 
bring about some improvement in the quality of 
your language. To what extent was the motive in

good impression upon your associates? What 
does your experience suggest as to English teach- 
ing in schools?

CHAPTER IV 
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 
Stopping too soon. The number of children who 
make a promising beginning on an assignment, but 
who give up before results of value are attained, is so 
great that many teachers consider this the chief cause 
of poor study. In fact, this belief is so general that on 
the report cards regularly sent to parents there is 
usually the item, Application, opposite which the 
teacher indicates her opinion of the manner in which 
the child spends his study time. It is but just to state 
that this lack of application is more often due to lack 
of interest than to any other one cause. There are, 
however, many pupils who attack an assignment with 
excellent intentions, and fair interest, but who find 
their attention wandering and, after conscientious 
attempts to bring their wits back to the task in hand, 
fail to muster enough concentrated effort to win suc- 
cess in study. Moreover, in the border-line cases, 
where the interest at best is feeble and its growth is 
dependent upon the success and mastery which per- 
sistence alone can give, it is highly important that 
every possible help to continued application be fur- 
nished. 
Factors influencing application. Leaving out of con- 
sideration in this connection the effect of interest, and
-P-A-G-E-139
  SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 121 
the comparative advantage of free over forced atten- 
tion in securing sustained effort, there remain certain 
other factors that exert a determining influence in this 
regard. So, whether the assignment is one in which the 
pupils already feel a positive interest, or is of that less 
attractive but necessary type in which use must be 
made temporarily of extraneous incentives for atten- 
tion, there may be, in either case, wide variation in the 
length of effective application. These factors are, first, 
the character of the task assigned; second, the stand- 
ards of the recitation; third, study-room conditions; 
fourth, the personal factor, differing with each pupil, 
but capable in every case of great improvement 
through the establishment of proper study habits. 
The principles upon which intelligent control of these 
factors must be based are to be found in the psychology 
of attention, some laws of which are usually ignored in 
the making of assignments. 
The psychology of attention. It has been definitely 
demonstrated that attention cannot remain fixed on 
one point longer than a few seconds. Further attention 
to that point is given only when something causes the 
focus of consciousness to return to it. When, therefore, 
any one seems to give prolonged attention to some 
detail, in reality his attention has returned to it again 
and again from brief excursions to other details or ob- 
jects. A fuller discussion of this fact, with suggested 
tests or experiments for demonstrating it, may be 
found in any comprehensive text on psychology. Va-
-P-A-G-E-140
    
122 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
rious terms and figures of speech are used to designate 
this vanishing and recurrence of attention. Many 
writers follow James in the expression “waves of atten- 
tion,” but Strayer perhaps uses a better term in calling 
it the “oscillation of attention,” since that more clearly 
indicates the swing by which the focus of attention 
returns repeatedly to some object. 
As will be shown later, the connection by which a 
particular object of study may be kept within this 
swing of attention depends upon another character- 
istic of consciousness. This is its inclusiveness — the 
fact that a number of objects or details may be present 
in conscipusness at the same time, although only one 
is receiving direct attention. These various figures 
upon the stage of consciousness may each in turn be 
sharply eal by the spot-light of attention, only 
to have it pass quickly on to some aggressive competi- 
tor. The number of these objects that any individual 
is holding in the margin of consciousness at any given 
time is a fair index of his mental alertness at that mo- 
ment. If the field of consciousness becomes reduced 
until there is no longer opportunity for attention to 
play from one detail to another, sleep ensues — per- 
haps as a safeguard against mental derangement. 
Elements controlling the swing of attention. It is 
the character of these things in the margin of conscious- 
ness which largely determines whether or not attention 
shall return to an object of study after it makes one of 
its inesapeble swings away from that object to one of
-P-A-G-E-141
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 123 
those in the margin. If these marginal objects are re- 
lated closely to the object of study, and thus point back 
toward it, so to speak, the return of attention toward 
the right point is easy. Its swing is back and forth 
along what might be called the radii of a circle, with 
the object of study as the permanent center. If, how- 
ever, some of these elements in the fringe of conscious- 
ness are out of harmony with the matter to be studied, 
there is danger that the attention may wander far 
afield. For as soon as it happens to rest upon one of 
them, the tendency of that object is to bring into con- 
sciousness a series of other matters with which it is 
more closely connected. So the attention is carried 
along from one to another indefinitely, usually getting 
farther and farther from the object of study, until some 
interruption of the series gives opportunity for a recall 
to duty. The influence of a number of associated 
elements in holding the attention easily to a central 
object may be shown by a familiar illustration. 
Mr. Brown attends a concert, at which a singer of 
fair ability is to interpret the songs of a certain com- 
poser. Although Mr. Brown has only average knowl- 
edge of and interest in music, he expects to listen at- 
tentively and hopes he will find it easy and pleasant to 
do so. While listening to the singer’s voice he is con- 
scious also of other matters, namely, a well-played 
accompaniment, a harmonious stage setting, the ap- 
pearance, movements, and facial expression of the 
singer, the presence of a congenial companion at his
-P-A-G-E-142
  
124 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
side, and an attentive, enthusiastic audience about 
him. He finds that his attention keeps turning to some 
one of these various things, but the tendency of each is 
to direct his attention back to the singer’s voice, so he 
experiences a pleasing variety in the objects of atten- 
tion while maintaining the appropriate center for it. 
This harmonious variety that is affording such satis- 
factory play for his attention is disturbed for a while 
by one discordant element. He is conscious of a buzz 
of conversation indulged in by two persons behind him. 
Whenever his attention is claimed by this fact, his 
thoughts turn to devising means of silencing it, to 
gloomy reflections on public manners, even perhaps to 
suggestions of violence and summary measures, until 
some other influence about him recalls his attention 
and he finds he has missed half of a song. Not until 
the conversation subsides does he find that his atten- 
tion is again safely and automatically held about the 
proper center by the harmonious character of the ele- 
ments present in his consciousness. 
The opposite influences are illustrated in the case of 
the average pupil who has been told to “study his 
lesson over.” He finds in the task insufficient variety 
for ensuring a return swing of his vagrant attention. 
He is still sufficiently awake, at least in the beginning, 
to have his consciousness alert for the variety of ele- 
ments which the assigned task does not supply. Either 
his surroundings or his fancy supplies the variety, 
and in consequence the movement of his attention is
-P-A-G-E-143
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 125 
regularly outbound with no provision for a return 
trip. 
“Variety in unity.” The necessity of having an 
assignment furnish this variety of elements converg- 
ing about a central feature, such as is required for 
holding the attention, is well stated by Colvin and 
Bagley in their Human Behavior, as follows: 
It seems certain that the more complex a physical object, 
or the richer in content an idea, the longer attention of a 
sustained character can be given. The application of this 
principle to school procedure is obvious. If the teacher 
wishes a topic to be held in attentive consciousness by the 
pupil, he must develop it in a variety of ways. When the 
attention “‘lets up” in one direction, it will then focus itself 
on another detail of the topic, and thus the mind will be 
constantly held within the circle of the subject under dis- 
cussion. This in part explains the growth of attention and 
interest as the pupil learns more and more about any of the 
school subjects. There is always a new aspect that can be . 
attended to when there is sufficient variety in the subject- 
matter. 
Assignments that hold attention. The application 
of this principle to the assignment of work for study is 
comparatively simple, and a little analysis of the cases 
in which pupils show the most consistent and continu- 
ous effort will produce valuable suggestions. If one 
asks a group of teachers what subject or what type of 
work their pupils are most apt to put uninterrupted 
work upon during a study period, the reply will almost 
always name exercises in arithmetic. The reason for 
this is twofold. In the first place, the requisite variety 
among closely related details is furnished by the  
-P-A-G-E-144
  126 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
printed exercises, the page upon which the work is 
being written, the rules or principles to be observed, 
and the act of writing. The second reason is the fact 
that any task involving muscular activity has thereby 
a great advantage in holding the attention — due 
probably to the fact that the movements themselves 
furnish an appropriate variety to satisfy the attention 
demanded for their direction. For this reason, also, 
a written lesson in any subject usually keeps the 
pupils busy without interruption, especially if they do 
not find it necessary to pause too much while deciding 
what to write next. 
The wrong and right use of writing in study. The 
very fact that written work absorbs the pupils’ atten- 
tion and keeps them employed has led to its frequent 
abuse in the assignment of work for study. The most 
vicious form this abuse can take is in having pupils 
write practically all the material assigned for study — 
a custom that is not yet extinct. While most teachers 
do not go that far in requiring written work, they often 
commit the same offense in lesser degree by giving 
assignments which cause pupils to think they are 
studying when they are merely writing things. Writ- 
ing is not a substitute for study, and the teacher whose 
first consideration, in requiring a large share of the 
preparation of an assignment to be written, is that it 
is a safe way to keep the pupils busy, needs a new con- 
ception of the meaning of study. Such preparation 
usually degenerates into a mechanical selecting of
-P-A-G-E-145
  SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 127 
material to be copied, and, instead of really learning 
to study, the pupils waste their time in cultivating a 
profitless substitute. 
If, however, pupils are not allowed to confuse 
studying a lesson with merely writing parts of it, a 
proper use of pencil and paper may be a most valuable 
aid to study. For example, an intelligent taking of 
notes which represent the condensed results of thought- 
ful analysis and reflection may not only reénforce 
study by preserving partial results, but also may help 
to crystallize thought through the necessity of finding 
terse, significant phraseology for the notes. The 
writer still remembers with gratitude the teacher who 
first taught him how to take notes and make a logical 
outline of material read. For him, at least, it was the 
beginning of a new attitude toward study and reading. 
To go back of the words of an author and seek his pur- 
pose, and then test his sentences as to the importance 
of each in attaining that purpose, formulating con- 
cisely at the same time one’s own interpretation of the 
author’s efforts — these are important steps in real 
study which may be inaugurated through intelligent 
note-taking. A discussion of how pupils may be 
taught to take notes and make constructive outlines 
properly belongs in the next chapter, and will be taken 
up in detail there, but the value of such work in secur- 
ing continuous attention and application deserves 
emphasis here. 
The fact that the words written should represent
-P-A-G-E-146
  | 
128 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
the results of study, partial or complete, instead of 
thinly disguised copying, makes for greater effective- 
ness in this respect, because the variety is both intel- 
lectual and mechanical, instead of merely mechanical. 
This insistence, however, that the use of pencil and 
paper during study periods should be properly directed 
and subordinated to the true aims of study, should not 
cause us to lose sight of their importance as mechani- 
cal factors in holding attention. The mere presence 
of a pencil in a pupil’s hand, waiting for something 
which is to be written, has a potent influence in re- 
calling the wandering attention to the task assigned 
and getting something produced worthy of being 
written. 
Making illustrations. Another means of holding 
attention, closely related to written work, is having 
the pupils prepare illustrations of the material studied. 
It is also, of course, subject to misuse, and, without 
thoughtful direction, may be an unprofitable use of 
time. But, properly used, it is extremely valuable, not 
only for keeping attention, but also for revealing 
misapprehensions and for clarifying ideas. First of 
all, it appeals to one phase of the manipulative, con- 
structive tendency which has unusual power for hold- 
ing the attention. In the second place, it impels a 
searching inquiry as to the essential features to be 
illustrated. The variety necessary for the swing of 
attention is furnished by the three major points of the 
task — the material to be studied, the effort to visu-
-P-A-G-E-147
  
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 129 
alize the details of this material and devise a scheme 
for illustrating it, and the manipulative activity in- 
volved in making the details correspond to the data 
furnished by the text or material studied. The possi- 
bilities of this device are much wider than one would 
at first be inclined to believe, and apply to almost 
every phase of school-work. 
For example, its use in history may include the 
making and coloring of rough maps to indicate move- 
ments in colonization, the extension of territory, the 
daily progress of military improvements; it may re- 
quire diagrams to show the rise and fall of political 
issues, the division of parties due to changing condi- 
tions, or even the relationship between various parts 
of the governmental organization and a scheme for 
showing which is primarily concerned with the de- 
velopments then under study; or it may deal with 
the representation of development in transportation, 
industry, inventions and use of resources. Unless 
these are taken as special projects by individuals or 
groups they need not be in any sense elaborate, and 
may be such as could be produced in a few minutes. 
The main purpose of this activity is to furnish a 
tangible goal in connection with each assignment 
which will make a continuous appeal to attention as 
well as require alert, purposive study. Such features 
of the assignment should, of course, take into con- 
sideration the illustrative material already available 
for the pupils, and the things which they are asked to  
-P-A-G-E-148
  
180 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
prepare should not be anything which can be copied. 
In short, just as was emphasized in another connec- 
tion, their results must show evidence of real study 
and not some substitute for it, however attractive the 
latter may be in appearance. 
Other forms of illustrative work. In other subjects 
the forms which illustrative work may take are quite 
as varied as those suggested in history. The widest 
present use is probably in geography, and even in that 
subject new application could profitably be made 
along such lines as illustrated reports by pupils on the 
industries or customs of countries studied, or the prep- 
aration of additional material for the school’s col- 
lection. Mention has already been made of the class 
which reproduced the living-room of the Whittier 
home while studying Snow-Bound. A sketch roughly 
made by each pupil to show how he sees the setting of 
a literary selection is often a valuable index of his 
study and grasp of the details. The objection has 
been heard that this is not literature, which in an 
zsthetic sense is quite true. But it does ensure a 
correct understanding of the background and setting 
such as is essential to any adequate appreciation of 
the literary qualities of the selection. The finer, artis- 
tic qualities of literature probably can best be appre- 
ciated through a proper presentation in the recitation, 
but this in turn is dependent upon a prosaic, intellec- 
tual grasp of the significant underlying facts. To 
obtain these is the province of the study period, and
-P-A-G-E-149
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 131 
the making of an illustrative sketch serves admirably 
the double purpose of getting the attentive effort neces- 
sary to secure such knowledge and of indicating erro- 
neous conceptions in time to correct them. The selec- 
tions from Irving most frequently used in school-read- 
ing are especially adapted to such treatment. This 
device is so valuable in nature-study, hygiene, and, in 
fact, all science work, as to be almost indispensable for 
the best study. The necessity of visualization in solv- 
ing arithmetic problems has already been discussed, 
and the illustration is a helpful means of promoting it. 
One desirable feature of this device is the value it 
has in suggesting and stimulating the selection of 
projects by various pupils for more careful and ex- 
tended preparation. For example, a boy who had made 
as illustrative work a rough map of his State, on which 
he had penciled the leading products of each section, 
thought of a plan for elaborating this into something 
unique. He talked over his plan with his teacher, but, 
except for such conferences, did all the work himself, 
and outside of school-hours. With putty he made a 
relief map of the State, and upon this he glued the 
grains, minerals, and commercial products character- 
istic of each section to form a self-interpreting product 
map of the State. It took more than a month to com- 
plete, but was so well done that it formed part of an 
exposition exhibit. Other examples might be given of 
the tendency for these improvised illustrative produc- 
tions to kindle enthusiasm for thoughtfully planned  
-P-A-G-E-150
  
  1382 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
and carefully executed projects. In most cases it is not 
wise for the teacher to press this feature, except to 
encourage the pupils to make voluntary selections and 
carry them out. The chief virtue of a real project 
springs from its spontaneity and the fact that the child 
regards the resultant problems as his very own. But 
the custom of asking illustrative work in connection 
with assignments is fully justified merely because of 
its effectiveness in holding attention properly through 
the closely related variety. For this purpose it is usu- 
ally best not to insist on great care in execution. If 
only the illustrative work provokes thoughtful study 
and a satisfactory understanding of the material as- 
signed, the chief objective has been attained. 
The problem or question as a means of holding 
attention. If, in talking to teachers or students, one 
emphasizes the necessity of variety among related de- 
tails as a means of securing sustained attention, there 
is one objection occasionally raised. Some one may 
say that the most continuous attention ever given is 
when one is reading an interesting story, and then 
there is no variety except the mere printed words, such 
as are to be found even in textbooks. A careful analy- 
sis of the factors which make a story interesting will 
not only answer this argument, but suggest at the same 
time another method of securing more consistent at- 
tention to assigned readings. 
Stories are not all equally interesting. A person may, 
indeed, read a few pages of one and lay it aside with
-P-A-G-E-151
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 133 
the remark, “I can’t get interested in that.” But 
another may prove so fascinating that it is extremely 
difficult to lay it aside even temporarily. What has 
made the difference? It is almost invariably the num- 
ber of unanswered questions which the author has 
succeeded in raising in one’s mind. Who really took 
the jewels? Will the hero discover the trap set for him 
before it is too late? Is the confidential secretary an 
accomplice? What can keep the daughter from mak- 
ing the sacrifice she plans? 
The popular appeal of the mystery story lies in such 
questions that are hovering in consciousness as one 
reads, and each takes its turn in the foreground of at- 
tention as the lines of the story furnish clues for guess- 
ing ahead as to the solution. The actual words before 
the eyes of the reader form merely the basis and cross- 
ing-point for the oscillations of attention. For an 
instant it flashes back to a past incident of the story 
and reinterprets it, then speculates on the actions of 
an absent character at that moment, or tries to fore- 
cast a solution for some of the various questions still 
unsettled. Indeed, the interest and attention may be 
so vibrant over the outcome of these problems that 
some readers ignore the lines before them and turn to 
the last chapter to relieve the high-frequency distrac- 
tion and thus allow attention to subside to its normal 
swing. 
Raising questions in assignment. The same condi- 
tions which hold the attention during the reading of
-P-A-G-E-152
  184 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
an interesting story must be approximated in any 
reading which requires continued attention. This fact 
is emphasized by Colvin and Bagley in the following 
sentence from the paragraph already quoted, “If the 
teacher wishes a topic to be held in attentive conscious- 
ness by the pupil, he must develop it in a variety of 
ways.” This development is effective in proportion to 
the number of questions which it inspires and leaves 
for the study to answer. These questions arise only 
after a pupil knows something about a topic, or has 
discovered that it is intimately related to others with 
which he is already familiar, so the form which this 
development of a new topic should take will be the 
establishment of relationships with known topics and 
suggestions as to new light which its study may throw 
on familiar issues. The amount of time and effort re- 
quired to accomplish this depends largely upon the pos- 
sibility of finding a close connection between the new 
topic and questions already formulated by the pupils. 
For example, no difficulty is experienced in getting 
boys to see that the topic, ‘“How the Indians Lived 
Before the White Man Came,” will probably answer 
questions they have already met in their play or on 
outings, and their reading with these questions in 
mind will be correspondingly attentive. Such a topic, 
however, as Washington’s Farewell Address, will re- 
quire much more development of relationships with 
familiar matters in order to provoke such questions 
as will ensure anything better than a perfunctory
-P-A-G-E-153
  
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 135 
reading of the assigned paragraphs. The net results 
of a study period spent by a class without some such 
reénforcement to help hold attention are so nearly 
worthless that almost any preliminary effort is prefer- 
able to the familiar but futile direction, “Study the 
next five paragraphs.” 
The topic mentioned above may be taken as a fair 
example of material which requires careful assigning. 
As an illustration of the sort of questions that might 
properly be developed as a preliminary to a reading of 
the Farewell Address, the following are samples that 
have been used. Did the events of Washington’s 
administrations indicate that the new Republic was in 
more danger from outside foes or from internal dis- 
sensions? What would be most likely to cause dangers 
from without? What perils might Washington fear 
from within? In your reading see if Washington gives 
any warning you had not expected. In the debate on 
the League of Nations, parts of this Address were often 
quoted; how much of it do you think still applies to 
present conditions? With such questions as this in 
mind before the pupil begins his reading, he has at all 
times something with which to test every sentence, 
and something to which every statement can be re- 
ferred. The consequent play of attention, as he makes 
now this, now that comparison, results in satisfactory 
study not only from the standpoint of continued appli- 
cation, but also in the essentials of intelligent conclu- 
sions and stimulated interest,
-P-A-G-E-154
  
136 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
The general responsibility of the assignment. The 
three ways which have been discussed do not neces- 
sarily include all the methods by which the assignment 
may furnish essential variety for holding the atten- 
tion. In the original outline of the factors influencing 
effective application, the nature of the task assigned 
was put first. This is because the law of variety as a 
basis for continued attention must be satisfied, and, 
unless the nature of the assignment conforms to this 
requirement, the resultant study is proportionately 
ineffective. The law itself has been frequently em- 
phasized on the preceding pages, because in the 
average classroom it is so frequently ignored. It may 
frankly be said that the discussion of practical means 
whereby the assignment could meet this need has been 
presented, not merely as an account of the most often- 
used devices for holding attention through the study 
hour, but also for the sake of reiterating the principle 
itself. If the essential responsibility imposed upon the 
assignment by the law of “variety in unity” is fully 
appreciated, the teacher will find wide opportunity 
for versatility in fulfilling it. The only final warning 
necessary is the reminder that the variety must have 
real unity, and each detail must be closely related to 
the central object of study. Otherwise, some element 
introduced to add interesting variety may have closer 
associations with foreign details, and instead of re- 
turning the attention to the proper field may serve as 
a distracting force to misdirect it. Properly chosen
-P-A-G-E-155
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 137 
variety in the assignment is, however, the solution for 
most problems of inattention during the study period. 
Standards of the recitation. The second factor influ- 
encing persistence of application has been termed the 
standards of the recitation. This is used to denote in 
general the grade of responsibility exacted and oppor- 
tunity accorded when the recitation calls for an 
accounting of results attained in the study period. 
Business-like preparation in any line is made only in 
response to business-like requirements, and is not 
regularly made when something less will suffice. In 
schools having a departmental organization, so that 
the same pupils have recitations under different 
teachers, it is often noticeable that one teacher secures 
more consistent preparation of assignments than 
another — a difference not wholly to be accounted for 
by interest in the subject or the popularity of the 
teacher. 
This factor is difficult to analyze, but, by recalling 
our own experience as students, we may find it easier 
to realize how wide a difference it may make in one’s 
thoroughness of preparation of separate courses even 
in the same subject. In the cases in which pupils regu- 
larly make the most complete preparation, there is 
usually no very conscious feeling of constraint on their 
part. To them it simply seems the natural thing to 
carry on their preparation to the point that befits the 
recitation. Bluntly stated, their tendency is to give 
just about as much preparation as they feel that the  
-P-A-G-E-156
  188 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
recitation deserves. To be sure, this is frequently less 
than the teacher has asked, for wholesome standards 
in the recitation are of gradual growth, and the teach- 
er’s demands are not the only force influencing them. 
Causes which determine standards. The oppor- 
tunity which the recitation affords has at least equal 
weight with its exactions in setting standards which 
affect study. It must offer just, or even generous, 
recognition of effort. Most pupils study not merely 
to satisfy, but also to please the teacher or their class- 
mates. Consequently a failure to show full apprecia- 
tion of every worthy contribution is almost as dis- 
couraging to effort as to require no accounting on work 
assigned. As was stated in the preceding chapter, the 
pupil’s interest should be directed toward something 
more stable as a permanent basis than merely the de- 
sire to win the teacher’s approval, and the use of this 
desire should be limited mainly to temporary needs. 
Such a condition exists when there is need of establish- 
ing more business-like standards in the recitation. The 
first requisite to securing a properly responsive atti- 
tude on the part of a pupil is for him to feel sure that 
the teacher is his personal friend and well-wisher, 
ready to give all credit due, and to interpret fairly 
all efforts and results. Appreciative approval, judi- 
ciously shown, is a proper, and often necessary, means 
of developing such an attitude and relationship. 
When established, this understanding between teacher 
and pupil makes safe the transition to a gradually
-P-A-G-E-157
  
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 139 
increasing use of the socialized recitation, with its 
many advantages. 
Unless the pupil is thus convinced of his teacher’s 
good-will and personal interest, the latter is apt to be 
regarded as a mere taskmaster and his assignments 
given only grudging and stinted preparation. But if 
the genuinely cordial relationship suggested above 
exists between teacher and pupils, the latter really 
welcome a procedure which holds them strictly re- 
sponsible for assignments that have been fairly under- 
stood and undertaken. The tacit understanding that 
pupils will be held to account for all assigned work 
is the second indispensable element in establishing 
proper standards of the recitation. When interest 
flags, when the task seems long and progress slow, 
when a resolute effort is needed to recall the wandering 
attention, the necessary incentive is often supplied by 
the certainty of a moment of reckoning in the recita- 
tion. Probably the most potent and desirable form this 
can take in the pupil is the feeling that his teacher 
will be disappointed in him if he fails to complete what 
he has undertaken. On the other hand, a pupil who has 
carefully prepared an assignment justly feels, and 
usually shows, decided disappointment if no account- 
ing is required and he has no opportunity to demon- 
strate his preparedness. This phase of the recitation 
need consume only a minor portion of the period, but 
it furnishes the business-like element necessary to 
stable continuity in school-work. Great achievement
-P-A-G-E-158
  
140 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
and notable progress spring only from correspondingly 
strong interest, but safety in toiling along the inter- 
vening lower levels is often dependent upon following 
the routine of accepted duty. 
The third element of importance in determining the 
standards of the recitation is the influence of the class 
as a whole upon the individual pupil. The tendency is 
for each pupil to adopt the level of the group. More- 
over, if he finds that indifferent, half-completed prep- 
aration on his part does not lower the estimation in 
which he is held by his classmates, the average pupil 
will feel inclined to quit at that stage if his study be- 
comes even moderately difficult. The teacher soon 
learns that any improvement in standards, to be ef- 
fective, must include the whole group. In any class- 
room, however, the group standards are determined 
mainly by the influence of a comparatively few 
leaders. Many teachers have succeeded in transform- 
ing the spirit of entire classes through winning the 
codperation of the leaders. By far the best way to lift 
group standards, however, is to employ the socialized 
recitation. The line of advance should always be 
through the strongest interests. Numerous suggestions 
of this sort were given in the preceding chapter. When 
once a situation has been developed in which each 
pupil finds that the esteem of his classmates for him is 
conditional upon his “making good” through careful 
preparation of an allotted part in the recitation, the 
victory is half won. By judicious encouragement and
-P-A-G-E-159
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 141 
extension of this means of winning class approval, a 
powerful ally can be enlisted for all study. A pupil who 
has earned popular approval by careful preparation in 
one subject is not inclined to jeopardize it by failure in 
another — and this feeling may be sufficient to turn 
the wavering scale in a discouraging moment of study. 
Making the assignment improve standards. In the 
task of raising the standards which the pupils have as 
to what constitutes satisfactory application, the teacher 
has an ally that is usually underestimated. This is 
the instinctive desire of every pupil to do things well. 
In his day-dreams he never pictures himself as a quit- 
ter or a second-rater, but always as performing dis- 
tinguished service. This attitude characterizes the 
usual attack upon an assigned task in the primary 
grades. To one who frequently has opportunity to 
observe the gradual loss of this assurance, so often to 
be noted through the upper grades, there is borne in 
the conviction that most assignments are not properly 
adapted to preserve this confidence and the instinctive 
desire to surmount difficulties. 
As will be reiterated later, there is nothing more 
stimulating for a pupil than to enjoy the habitual sat- 
isfaction of complete and successful preparation. One 
of the first considerations in an assignment should be 
to make this definitely possible. The practice of as- 
signing more than the pupils are expected to complete 
is ordinarily a bad one, and any assignment that does 
not enable pupils to know definitely before the recita-  
-P-A-G-E-160
  142. TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
tion how well and completely their preparation has 
been made, is open to similar criticism. The only 
justifiable purpose in making such an assignment, 
namely, to provide enough work to keep strong as well 
as weak pupils busy, can better be attained through 
the elastic assignment. This, with its minimum, aver- 
age, and maximum requirements, enables each pupil 
to undertake a definite amount of preparation, propor- 
tioned to this ability — preferably as he himself es- 
timates it — and to earn the satisfaction of definitely 
completing what he has undertaken. While enabling 
every pupil to maintain his self-respect and assurance, 
it stimulates growth and appeals to his ambition al- 
ways to undertake more, and thus qualify for a higher 
group. Inall grades the problem of adapting and grad- 
ing the assignments so as to present almost imper- 
ceptibly increasing difficulty, and yet encourage the 
habit of complete and successful preparation, is one 
that calls for the best judgment possible. But if such 
adaptation is consistently held as an aim by the teacher 
the matter of maintaining wholesome standards, both 
in the recitation and the study period, will present few 
difficulties. 
Study-room conditions. The influence of the pupil’s 
environment upon his perseverance in study is, of 
course, familiar to every teacher. Few schoolrooms ap- 
proximate ideal conditions for study, but, even as they 
are, most of them surpass the average home in this 
respect. Only two phases of the study environment
-P-A-G-E-161
  
SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 143 
need be discussed here, but these are both of impor- 
tance to the teacher who wishes to make the wisest 
disposition of her limited facilities in that connection. 
In the first place, the data collected and organized 
by Burnham verified the impression of experienced 
teachers that pupils study best when others about 
them are engaged on the same or similar tasks. This 
stimulating sense of companionship adds both to their 
persistence and effectiveness in doing work. The ad- 
vantage derived from this fact counterbalances many 
minor distractions that cannot be eliminated from 
schoolroom conditions. To make the most of it, how- 
ever, it is very desirable that classes be definitely 
scheduled for particular phases of study at particular 
periods, and that all get safely started with the least 
possible delay. It is usually in the protracted stage of 
getting ready to start that competitive activities have 
a chance to originate, and these in turn are likely to be 
continued or returned to later in such a way as to 
attract the attention and interrupt the study of neigh- 
boring pupils. 
The other phase of the study-room situation that 
deserves attention is the problem of distractions, and 
how their influence may be neutralized. As a matter 
of fact, there are many things going on ordinarily in 
the schoolroom which pupils do not find distracting. 
It is only the unusual and unfamiliar happenings, or 
those objects and activities with a potent, instinctive 
appeal, which capture a pupil’s attention when he is  
-P-A-G-E-162
  
  144 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
trying to study his lesson. For example, in the rural 
schools, pupils engaged in study are rarely disturbed 
by the familiar circumstance of other classes reciting 
in the same room. Almost the only exception to this 
is when a grade higher than his own is discussing some- 
thing in which he is already interested and about 
which he wishes to learn more. 
If, however, changes have been made in the seating 
arrangement, or any other significant element of the 
environment has been altered, the probability of 
having interruptions of attentive effort is increased. 
The best safeguard against such tendencies is the 
reduction to routine of those school activities which 
are essentially mechanical. In fact, to make all mat- 
ters habitual, which do not suffer in spirit thereby, is 
to eliminate delays, indecision, and waste of energy. 
The resultant gain is apparent not only in a more effec- 
tive utilization of energy along proper lines, but also 
in forestalling disturbances which “‘hatch out” pro- 
lifically in the idle moments when pupils are not sure 
what is to be done next, or how it is to be done, or 
are not yet accustomed to some unnecessary change. 
Routine should, of course, never discourage judgment 
and originality; but, as William James so impressively 
showed in his discussion on the value of good habits, 
it is the great emancipator which liberates us from the 
tyranny of trifles and leaves us free to make important 
decisions and prosecute undisturbed more worthy 
undertakings.
-P-A-G-E-163
  SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 145 
Another source of distractions is one that cannot 
be so easily controlled, because many unusual things 
that happen are not connected with the regular school- 
work. These inevitably occur in any schoolroom, and 
a pupil who is looking about for something to attend 
to besides his lesson is usually successful in finding 
attractions. An attempt was made in the first part of 
the preceding chapter to illustrate what happens in a 
case of this sort. As was emphasized then, it is pri- 
marily a matter of competition for attention, and, 
unless the assignment has furnished safeguards, 
features foreign to the lesson will be victorious. Ob- 
viously, the only thing that can be reasonably effec- 
tive is to prepare against the most probable sources of 
competition. For example, if a probable danger is 
distraction from watching some manipulative activ- 
ity, let the assignment include some phase of con- 
structive work for all, so that glances at what others 
are doing will, through suggestion, recall each pupil to 
his own work. This principle of homceopathic treat- 
ment can usually be adapted to meet the particular 
difficulty. A busy pupil is reasonably safe from or- 
dinary environmental distractions, especially if the 
work upon which he is busy is varied enough to com- 
pete with the extraneous circumstances. 
Study habits of the individual pupil. The fourth 
factor enumerated as influencing continued applica- 
tion is the individual one, which is, naturally, the 
most variable of them all. Without going into the  
-P-A-G-E-164
  146 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
question of individual differences as the basis for 
wide divergences in this respect, the important and 
undeniable fact remains that any pupil of reasonable 
intelligence is capable of marked improvement over the 
grade of proficiency in study he ordinarily possesses. 
This progress is possible through learning methods of 
attacking a task in the most effective manner, and 
through acquiring good study habits. Since the next 
chapter is devoted wholly to a consideration of proper 
methods of study, and how far their use may be made 
habitual, a detailed discussion will not be given here. 
There is, however, one phase of method and habit for 
the individual that has such vital bearing on the 
matter of persistence and successful completion of 
study, that this chapter should not be closed without 
due emphasis upon it. This feature is the rate of study. 
Momentum as a safeguard to application. As a 
means of improving concentration and lessening the 
susceptibility to distractions, there is nothing so valu- 
able as momentum in study —the impetus of an 
aggressive attack that aims to get results in short 
order. Strayer and Norsworthy say: “An hour spent 
when half an hour would do is thus not only wasteful 
of time, but is productive of poorer results and bad 
habits of study as well.” The pupil who is an easy 
prey to every trivial disturbing influence is the one who 
is dilly-dallying over his work, and looking around 
while waiting to get started. A pupil is most fully 
awake when he is striving for a definite goal, either on
-P-A-G-E-165
    SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 147 
the playground or in the classroom, and the quality of 
the activity he puts forth corresponds to his mental 
alertness. From many standpoints there is an advan- 
tage in working at top speed, but nowhere is it so pro- 
nounced as in holding the attention until work is suc- 
cessfully completed. 
The effect is similar to that produced when one is 
working in response to an absorbing interest. In that 
case all trivial details are disregarded, and the atten- 
tion moves swiftly and accurately along the path of 
vital relationships until the sought-for results are 
attained. When one sets out to complete any task in 
short order, the very situation holds a challenge that 
appeals to his interest. In order to make time count, 
he maps out a rough scheme for economy and effi- 
ciency of effort. This involves the selection of certain 
relatively important details that are to be kept as 
centers of attention and goals to be attained. In his 
subsequent study the swing of attention is quick and 
sure from one of these to another — in significant 
contrast to the weak, unstable movement of attention 
on the part of the loiterer, ready to be drawn from its 
path by any wayside influence. 
Encouraging rapid, aggressive study. The advan- 
tages of rapid, aggressive study are so pronounced with 
respect to the quality and certainty of results, to say 
nothing of amount, that it seems strange to find so few 
teachers deliberately trying to encourage and develop 
it. In fact, the opposite would seem to be true from
-P-A-G-E-166
148 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
the oft-heard injunction to “be sure and put a full 
hour of study on the assignment.” If the assignment 
has been made in such a way that the pupil knows 
when he has completed each part of it, and has learned 
how to test the accuracy of his results, such a time- 
consuming requirement is no more sensible than if, in 
sending a boy to the post-office, you commanded him 
to ride a full hour, for fear he wouldn’t quite reach 
there. The only excuse for such a command is in con- 
nection with an inexcusably indefinite assignment, so 
that the pupil will consume all the time working up a 
mass of details, in the hope that there will be included 
in the collection some samples of what will be required 
in the recitation. If the assignment is such that the 
pupil is never quite sure whether he has completed 
what is wanted or not, the time limit should, theoreti- 
cally, help by keeping him guessing at it longer. In 
actual practice it serves mainly to establish habits of 
“half-work,” of loitering over his books, of looking 
busy, and of employing various tricks of “study 
camouflage,” and prevents him from spending some of 
his time profitably on some very definite undertakings 
which he may have in mind. 
A far better plan in every way is to put a premium 
on rapid work. If, as was said before, the assign- 
ment has been such that the pupil has understood 
and accepted certain definite undertakings, it is much 
easier and more business-like to hold him responsible 
for these than for any meaningless consumption
-P-A-G-E-167
  SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 149 
of time. The modern world rewards most liberally 
those individuals who can do, in one hour, or day, or 
month, what had formerly taken two. The chief 
training for such accomplishments, as received in 
school, has usually been by the troublesome pupil 
who allowed the rest of the class to get a month ahead 
of him, and then, in two days, crammed up, and, to the 
teacher’s disgust, passed the examination with the 
others. What we need to develop is a substitute for 
cramming that will have some of its high-speed advan- 
tages without its superficiality and other objectionable 
features. The old admonition, “Work while you 
work,” had a sound psychological basis, and it is good 
pedagogy to offer inducements for pupils to do their 
work not only well but quickly. Especially the pupil 
who lacks concentration and the power of continued 
application should be helped to discover that in study, 
as in riding a bicycle along a narrow path, safety, 
directness, and success are dependent largely upon 
momentum — the impetus gained from losing no 
time in pushing straight toward a chosen goal. 
Chapter summary. A serious menace to success in 
study is the tendency to let down before results are 
attained, to allow the attention to wander, and to be 
interrupted by trifling disturbances. Strong interest 
lessens this danger, but even interest may flag tem- 
porarily, and help be needed to prevent failure. More- 
over, positive interest is sometimes dependent upon 
successful progress into new fields, and measures must 
be taken to ensure the necessary persistence.

150 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
In most cases there is needed an effort of will to 
carry study over these uninspiring levels. The factors 
influencing continuity of application are (a) the 
nature of the task, (b) the standards of the recitation, 
(c) the study-room environment, and (d) the study 
habits of the pupils. In controlling these factors so 
as to facilitate successful application, the law of con- 
tinuity in attention must be considered. This law, 
with its requirement of “variety in unity,” sets espe- 
cial responsibility upon the assignment to make the 
nature of the task furnish this essential qualifica- 
tion. 
The standards of the recitation should be so estab- 
lished as to demand and reward business-like prepara- 
tion. The study-room conditions should be made, as 
far as possible, favorable to uninterrupted study, and, 
when distractions cannot be wholly eliminated, the 
assignment should attempt to provide safeguards 
against them. 
Finally, the study habits of the pupils should be 
developed along lines of rapid, aggressive study, not 
only for better and quicker results, but also as insur- 
ance against the distractions that easily interrupt any 
so-called study which lacks momentum and vigor.   
QUESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. What means would you use to teach pupils the 
meaning and value of concentration in study? 
2. How may habits furnish aid in the matter of
-P-A-G-E-169
  6. SECURING CONTINUED APPLICATION 151 
continued application? IIlustrate with one or 
two specific habits. 
. When pupils are reading through a selection 
to collect information, it is an excellent plan for 
them to prepare rough preliminary headings 
under which to classify facts as they are found. 
Discuss the value of this from the following 
standpoints: (a) economy of time, (6) interest, 
(c) sustained attention and application. 
. Some teachers allow only a limited time for a 
hasty reading of a paragraph before the pupils 
are called on to tell what it contains. Discuss the 
value of this and similar devices for encouraging 
rapid reading and concentration, especially with 
reference to the probable influence on attention 
and application in independent study. 
. Summarize the arguments for and against having 
pupils do some written work as a part of their 
study requirements. Can you suggest ways of 
meeting the objections without sacrificing the 
advantages? 
A class which was studying Evangeline became 
very enthusiastic over collecting magazine cuts 
and pictures to illustrate the scenes and incidents 
of the poem. Discuss the value of such a plan as 
an aid to study, especially in regard to interest, 
clearness of imagery, and sustained attention. 
. Prepare a list of study questions on the geog- 
raphy of the New England States which you
-P-A-G-E-170

think would be adapted to holding the attention 
of a fifth-grade class during a study period. 
8. Have you ever known a case of unsatisfactory 
recitation standards for which the pupils them- 
selves were primarily responsible? What can be 
done to improve such a condition? 
9. Can you justify the claim that a well-chosen 
project secures more persistent application from 
children than any other type of school-work? 
Discuss the basis for such a claim, illustrating 
with some project you have personally carried 
through, either in or out of school. 
10. Give in outline or question form what you con- 
sider the essentials of a “business-like account- 
ing” to follow the assignment suggested in exer- 
cise 7 above. 
11. What are the differences, from a pupil’s point of 
view, between the “‘requirements” and “‘oppor- 
tunities” of a recitation? 
12. From your personal contact with pupils who stud- 
ied more faithfully and persistently for certain 
teachers than for others, what seemed to be the 
reasons for the difference? To what extent do 
these same reasons influence the study of all 
pupils? 
13. Make a list of suggestions that you think would 
be helpful in securing “momentum” in study 
and in guarding against distractions.

test might improve the quality of pupils’ study 
and interpretation in the following particulars: 
rate of reading; definiteness of aim; concentra- 
tion. 
A frequent problem in the study period is the 
case of the nervous, fidgety pupil who is prone to 
have his attention caught by the slightest dis- 
traction. What special measures would you take 
to help such a pupil learn concentration? 
Some pupils are able to study uninterruptedly 
and effectively in one subject, but only spas- 
modically in another. Can you suggest means of 
helping such pupils analyze the reasons for their 
successful study, with a view to applying the 
same principles toward improving their study in 
other lines? 
Under what conditions may intensity of applica- 
tion become a danger to a pupil? Suggest pre- 
cautions that you consider advisable in order to 
prevent overwork and nervous injury to such 
pupils as you think subject to such dangers. 
To what extent should individual differences be 
considered in: (a) the standards of the recita- 
tion; (6) concentration expected; (c) insistence 
on “speeding up”; (d) variety afforded in the 
assignment.

CHAPTER V 
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 
The importance of good methods in study. Modern 
efforts are being directed toward developing improved 
methods in almost every field where greater economy 
of time and energy is possible. The reasons why 
methods of study should be included are obvious. 
But the most important of such reasons are not merely 
the measurable ones of increased results or economy 
of time and labor, even though these should be suffi- 
cient. It would, of course, be an inexcusable waste to 
allow a pupil to continue spending two hours regularly 
on tasks which he could be taught how to do in one 
hour. In most cases, however, he will not spend the 
extra hour necessary for completion by a crude method 
of attack. Instead, his resolution, interest, and efforts 
weaken somewhere short of that time, and the result 
is apt to be not only unfinished preparation, but dis- 
couragement, distaste, and resentment as well. 
These emotional factors constitute the most urgent 
argument in favor of helping pupils to acquire the 
most direct and effective methods of study. The 
maxim, “‘Nothing succeeds like success,” holds em- 
phatically with study, and if methods can be developed 
that will yield reasonably complete and successful 
preparation before exhausting the rather limited stock
-P-A-G-E-174
eee a ie” ee Ch ee ae ee Pe Oe ee EE eye ae 
156 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
of interest, perseverance, and energy usually avail- 
able, the resultant growth of these last-named quali- 
ties will make easier the control of all factors influenc- 
ing study.) But although every consideration, both of 
material results and of the reaction upon the pupils, 
calls for teaching the best possible methods of study, 
there is no type of teaching activity so rarely to be 
observed as that which employs any considerable 
time in actually helping children acquire the technique 
of effective study. Even the teachers who give excel- 
lent assignments rarely investigate the methods of 
attack used by their pupils, apparently assuming that 
proficiency in that respect is inborn, or that it will be 
acquired by ‘‘muddling through somehow.” 
Systematic study rare. The first difficulty encoun- 
\/ tered by most teachers who try to find out how a pupil 
studies is in the latter’s surprise at such a strange ques- 
tion, and consequent inability to frame any significant 
reply. He will probably say that he “just studies,” 
usually meaning that he reads along, hoping to remem- 
ber at least parts of the material read. If the teacher 
succeeds in getting the pupil to give a frank demon- 
stration of just what he does when he is studying a 
lesson, the absence of any conscious plan or system in 
the matter is usually apparent. 
In the light of this, the pupil’s reply that he “just 
studies” seems after all a significant, although over- 
generous, characterization of the activity. The obvi- 
ous conclusion is that, if most pupils are to acquire 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 157 
proficiency in study, the basis for it must be taught to 
them as definitely as the basis for any other type of 
skill with which the school is concerned. Moreover, 
there is a growing conviction that there are very few 
activities of the school of as great importance as the 
development of this particular kind of skill. 
Study aims in primary grades. The place to begin 
teaching pupils how to study is obviously in the pri- 
mary grades, where the need first arises and where 
study habits begin to be established for better or 
worse. Even in schools where the number of grades, 
or groups within a grade, makes the recitation time 
very limited, it is often advisable to make the recita- 
tion partly or wholly a studying lesson. As has been 
stated before, pupils in the primary grades will be 
found ready to fall naturally into the right study atti- 
tude — that of regarding the material as furnishing 
answers to questions, and of guessing ahead as to what 
these will prove to be. 
This attitude, if encouraged and maintained, fosters 
the corresponding habit of deciding in advance what 
use is to be made of textbook or reference material, 
and actively pursuing that purpose, instead of pas- 
sively and aimlessly trying to “just study.” The chief 
object to be sought in the study training of primary 
pupils is the establishment of this attitude toward 
material for study and the corresponding habit. of 
action. Even if no further progress is made in the 
technique of study below the fourth grade than the
-P-A-G-E-176
—————— 
158 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
effective attainment of that object, the primary 
teacher may well feel gratified in reflecting that the 
essential foundation has thus been laid for all phases 
of skill in study. 
Studying with pupils. If this aim is kept clearly in 
mind, the details of a study lesson will present few 
difficulties. A beginning can be made in the latter 
part of the first grade, usually of a very simple char- 
acter, and intended to encourage the forward look 
and conjecture. This applies equally to the reading of 
stories, to a simple observation problem in nature- 
study, or to measurements and construction in hand- 
work. Growing facility may be developed in the 
second grade, but the greatest progress is usually noted 
in the third grade. This is due first to the fact that the 
mechanics of reading have by that time been suffi- 
ciently mastered that the individual words no longer 
present such an absorbing series of difficulties, and 
the attention is measurably free for more connected 
thought. Moreover, the mental development has 
reached a stage where problems and relationships are 
more interesting, and logical thinking is not only 
possible in connection with reading, but pleasurable 
as well. 
Consequently this grade is a peculiarly appropriate 
time for frequent use of the thought-guiding study 
lesson, in which the pupils study aloud with the teacher 
so that the latter can be sure they are all forming the 
habit of purposive, aggressive attack. Such activity
-P-A-G-E-177
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 159 
has added importance in view of the fact that in this 
grade also pupils are introduced to material from a 
broader range of subjects. In their first lessons in 
geography, for example, their learning how to look 
for and find out facts is of more importance at this 
stage than the facts themselves. Consequently, if 
there is time for any recitation at all, there is time 
for the open-book study recitation. The most impor-\ 
tant duty of the recitation in the preliminary phases C 
of any subject is showing how to study that subject, a 
fact that is valid not only in the lower grades, but all 
through school-life. 
Locating the objective in study. If the foundation 
of good study has been well laid in the primary grades, 
its later development will be largely a matter of learn- 
ing methods and acquiring habits of economy and 
efficiency. As will be discussed a little later, these 
naturally fall into groups appropriate to the particular 
type of task or assignment to be studied. But what- 
ever may be the character of the work to be under- 
taken, the first step in the procedure should always be 
the same, and therefore should be made effectively a 
matter of habit. (This may be called locating the ob- 
jective. \It will include a preliminary “sizing up” of 
the assignment, and a rough estimate of the relative 
importance of its various parts. The purpose in this is 
to locate the vital point of the undertaking, to which 
everything else is more or less tributary, and thus to 
set rather definitely a goal in the preparation which oe 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  160 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
must be attained before it can be considered even 
reasonably complete. At the same time two other 
important ends are gained by the preliminary estimate 
—a working basis has been established upon which 
facts may be organized as they are met, and an ade- 
quate relationship has been secured for holding atten- 
tive application and guiding it from one detail to 
another toward the desired end. 
Until pupils have acquired some skill in study, this 
preliminary estimate of relative values should be 
given attention for a time as a regular part of the daily 
assignment. But the occasional lesson on how to study 
should help the pupils learn how to do it for them- 
selves, and every effort should be made to develop 
independence in this respect. The successful working- 
out of a project, the carrying-on of a voluntary inves- 
tigation — in fact, any type of self-directed study — 
demands ability to locate for one’s self at least a tenta- 
tive goal, and to appraise in advance the relative 
significance of the details essential to its attainment. 
Some of the special forms in which this advance esti- 
mate will appear may be noted in the discussion on the 
following pages of the various types of task to be 
studied. 
Planning the attack. Closely related to this first step 
is another which should be taken in the preliminary 
stage of all study. It is a brief planning of the attack, 
a selection of the activities best suited for reaching the 
goal chosen as the main objective in that undertaking.
-P-A-G-E-179
  EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 161 
It may include decision as to the best source of needed 
information; certain headings or important condensa- 
tions may be deemed worthy of memorization — in 
fact, whatever is necessary to a direct, decisive line of 
procedure should be included in this preliminary plan. 
In actual practice this step is not as complicated as 
it may seem, for the assignment will usually belong 
rather definitely to one of the types enumerated in the 
following paragraphs. When the obviously simple 
matter of identifying the type has been settled, further 
judgment is concerned chiefly with choosing among a 
relatively limited number of activities those appro- 
priate to that type of work. 
With regard to both the first and second preliminary 
steps in study, the fact should be emphasized here 
that the most influential factors in their mastery by \ 
pupils are the requirements and methods of the sub- Vv 
sequent recitation. It is a truism that pupils prepare 
for what they think the recitation will demand. Con- 
sequently the teacher can exert a vital influence 
toward inculcating right methods of study if the 
character of the recitation puts a premium upon such 
preparation. For example, the first part of the recita- 
tion might well contain some such questions as these: 
What did you consider the most important thing to be 
accomplished in your preparation? How much of the 
lesson did you regard as worthy of memorizing for per- 
manent retention? What problems had to be solved 
to reach a safe conclusion in regard to this topic?!  
-P-A-G-E-180
  162 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
The recitation in which the teacher shows more 
concern over learning how the pupils proceeded in their 
study, and gives relatively less time to finding out all 
they remember, or to cross-examining them in an effort 
to have them tell what he thinks they should have 
remembered, not only saves time and nerves, but is 
productive of better results. The proper time, of 
course, to offer suggestions on how to study, and to 
give a start in the right direction, is in the assignment 
and forward-looking part of the previous recitation. 
But the responsibility for giving such procedure real 
validity and value in the eyes of the pupils, sufficient 
to stimulate initiative and independence in its use, 
rests with the subsequent recitation. 
Adapting methods to type of task. In any line of 
work the efficiency of methods will be dependent on 
how well they are adapted to the particular work to be 
done. In other words, they should vary to accord 
with the results desired, and consequently, each of the 
four types of study tasks will have its appropriate 
methods. 
These four types are: (1) memorizing, (2) drill 
work, (3) collecting and organizing information, and 
(4) solving problems. Occasionally an assignment 
will involve all these, but one will usually predominate, 
especially one of the last three. The first two seem 
closely related, but, as will be shown later, they are, 
in practice, distinct activities requiring separate 
methods. The characteristic difficulties belonging to
-P-A-G-E-181
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 163 
each type will be noted in connection with the methods 
of study adapted to meeting and surmounting them. 
1. Memorizing 
When memorizing is justified. Although modern 
practices in education have happily freed pupils from 
the wholesale memorizing that was once the rule, most 
educators will agree that there are still things which 
should be memorized. The most important difference 
is not simply the great reduction in the quantity of 
things memorized, but the fact that, in the modern 
conception, memorizing is preceded by thoughtful 
understanding and appreciation instead of being sub- 
stituted for them. In other words, only those things 
deserve memorizing which have been mastered in 
study or found of such importance as to justify the 
effort necessary for permanent retention. This basis 
prepares naturally for the first essential in methods of 
memorizing. 
Rational associations. If the principle that under- 
standing or appreciation should precede memorizing 
is observed, it will go far toward abolishing the waste 
and unreliability of mechanical memorizing. But the 
disturbing possibility that memory may even then 
fail at the critical moment makes it advisable to add 
further reénforcement, especially since there are two 
additional phases of rational association that require 
no extra time, and are extremely valuable as aids to 
memory. The first is the association of the materia)  
-P-A-G-E-182
  164 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
with the circumstances under which it will be needed. 
This is the most frequently used “trick” ‘of business 
men who have earned a reputation for unusual mem- 
ory. Visualize intently the situation that will demand 
the recall of what is being memorized. Try to frame 
sample questions to which this will furnish the needed 
answer. Keep this visualized setting in mind all the 
while you are repeating the words. Just as it is much 
easier to recall a person’s name if he is met under 
circumstances such as you would naturally expect, so 
the memory of anything is immensely aided if one of 
its associations includes the logical meeting-place. 
The second association that should be made is with 
the appropriate feeling which the material should call 
forth. This is of greatest value in memorizing a 
connected passage of some length, inasmuch as such 
material is not usually selected for memorizing unless 
it makes a distinct appeal to the feelings. One does 
not need the corroboration of psychologists to realize 
that the best-remembered events in his experience 
are chiefly those associated with strong emotional 
responses. A well-known actor once declared that he 
depended on his feelings to take care of his lines, and 
that he sometimes found it difficult to repeat “in cold 
blood” what came easily while “living the part.” 
For example, the pupil who is trying to memorize the 
Gettysburg Address should first of all understand its 
meaning. In repeating it he should try to visualize 
the circumstances under which he is to reproduce it so
-P-A-G-E-183
  
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 165 
as to be prepared against the appalling strangeness 
of seeing expectant faces before him instead of the 
familiar printed page and desk-top. But what would 
probably be of the greatest value in this case is to try 
to feel, as he repeats each line, the way he thinks Lin- 
coln must have felt in saying it. This method not only 
has a decided advantage over the cold-blooded style of 
memorizing in the practical matters of quickness and 
sureness, but its superiority in stimulating apprecia- 
tion and proper expression gives it double value. 
Learning by wholes. Another means of making 
memorizing easier and safer is the plan of “learning 
by wholes.” By this is meant the practice of repeating 
the selection as a whole, instead of breaking it up into 
sentences or stanzas. Although little seems accom- 
plished during the first few minutes, a fair test with 
careful timing will demonstrate the saving of time on 
an entire selection. The added safety comes from the 
fact that the habitual movement in practicing is from 
one sentence directly to the next, and so on uninter- 
ruptedly to the end, just as the required reproduction 
is expected to be. The familiar plan of learning one 
sentence or stanza at a time tends to associate the 
closing words of any unit with the beginning words of 
the same unit. The frequent result is the pathetically 
familiar example of the pupil who has forgotten what 
comes next and keeps going back to the beginning of 
the preceding lines. 
One practical way of using this plan is the following.
-P-A-G-E-184
  166 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
After the selection is understood and the pupil is ready 
to begin memorizing, he should read it through atten- 
tively. Then on the next reading, whenever he can 
anticipate a phrase, he should raise his eyes as long as 
he can continue without hesitation. At the first un- 
certainty he should glance back without waiting, and 
continue reading until he can look away again for a 
while. By continuing this, the need for glancing at the 
book becomes less and less frequent with surprising 
rapidity. Another device is to use a card to cover the 
lines below where one is reading, and not to expose the 
next line until hesitation makes it necessary. 
2. Drill work 
Proper preparation for drill. As was pointed out in 
an earlier chapter, practice during the study period 
may do more harm than good unless it is carried on 
accurately and attentively. Since it is the business of 
the recitation to supply the knowledge and interest 
necessary for this, it is a safe rule that practice on any 
activity should always follow and not precede the 
recitation on that activity. The frequency with which 
this rule is violated is the only excuse for stating what 
should be entirely obvious. Many teachers seem to 
think that some work on the new lesson should be 
assigned for study, and depend on the next recitation 
to straighten out erroneous forms, forgetting that it 
is far easier to establish a right habit from the be- 
ginning than it is to correct a wrong start.
-P-A-G-E-185
  EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 167 
The drill on some activities should be taken care 
of almost wholly in the recitation, but there remain 
others on which practice,should take place in the study 
period. For example, the pupil will do some writing 
in connection with his study; this should certainly be 
made to reénforce the penmanship work of the recita- 
tion instead of counteracting it. The fact that the 
material he is writing happens to have intrinsic im- 
portance only adds to the value of its form. Other 
things that should have correct instead of incorrect 
practice in the study period, whether as the main or as 
incidental features, are such items as the spelling of 
familiar words, applications in mathematics, punctua- 
tion, and language forms in general. The indispen- 
sable basis for making such practice in the study 
period profitable includes a clear knowledge of what 
the right form should be, and a motive sufficient to 
ensure consistent observance of that standard until 
it is made habitual. 
The device mentioned in an earlier chapter of hav- 
ing each pupil write every month a sample page which 
he voluntarily offers as the minimum standard of 
excellence for all his written work that month, agree- 
ing to rewrite any page that is below standard, works 
wonders for the habitual penmanship of a class. It is 
a simple matter to extend this, and have each pupil 
add to this personal standard of excellence at least one 
“jonah” spelling word or language form every month, 
agreeing to atone for every violation as he does with  
-P-A-G-E-186
  168 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
his penmanship. Care must be taken to keep this 
within the scope of what the pupils consider a fair 
self-appointed task, and to which they give willing 
coéperation. 
Setting safeguards against errors. It has been said 
that half the work of the school consists in unlearning 
wrong things, most of which are in the form of erro- 
neous or slipshod habits. Careless work during the 
study period contributes so largely to these liabilities 
that there is no more important problem in preparing 
for it than how to safeguard against errors in practice. 
Such safeguards, to be effective, must enlist the will- 
ing, active codperation of the pupils. Any device of 
the type mentioned in the preceding paragraph is of 
that kind, since the pupils set the standard and are 
their own taskmasters. 
The modern idea of drill insists that children be led 
to realize the value of proficiency in the proposed 
activity before being set to practice upon it. When 
this is done and the work properly motivated, pupils 
are usually eager to know how skill can be most surely 
and economically acquired. One teacher was extremely 
successful in securing their earnest colperation by 
explaining to the children in simple terms the prin- 
ciples of habit-building, emphasizing the importance 
of care, and the penalty of allowing exceptions. To 
illustrate these points she compared the attainment 
of skill to climbing a hill; every correct performance 
carries one up a step, but every mistake puts one back
-P-A-G-E-187
  
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 169 
five steps; there is no such thing as standing still and 
“not counting this time.” It would be wise for many 
more teachers to put the matter thus frankly to their 
pupils, and show that all skill and proficiency worth 
having must be earned by faithful effort; that an 
automatic system of merits and demerits bars the 
slipshod trifler from ever quite reaching success. Any 
means of arousing a keener appreciation of the fact 
that such proficiency and skill are worth the effort they 
cost should be utilized, from a general campaign like 
the “Good English Week” movement to the indi- 
vidual privilege of acting as class storekeeper. But 
when a pupil has chosen some line of practice, he 
should know that there are no returns on a “part- 
time” investment, and that during his practice eternal 
vigilance is the price of proficiency, as it is of many 
other valuable things. 
Distributing time in practice. Another principle of 
importance in drill is that concerning the economical 
distribution of time. A new process should be followed 
up rather persistently until the first stage of familiarity 
and control is reached. The remaining practice neces- 
sary for its full mastery should be distributed over a 
longer period of time; that is, a few minutes spent 
daily with systematic regularity is better than more 
prolonged practice. 
The advantages of this plan are twofold. In the 
first place, a satisfactory degree of skill can be reached 
by fewer hours of time actually spent in practice, when
-P-A-G-E-188
  170 ~=TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
it is thus distributed, than when it is bunched into 
longer or more frequent periods of effort. The only 
exception to the desirability of extended distribution 
is when it is of importance to reach a certain degree of 
skill as soon as possible. In that case it may be justi- 
fiable to spend the additional time necessary in prac- 
tice at once. The second advantage is in the fact that 
it serves as a safeguard against the danger of stopping 
practice too abruptly after a fair degree of proficiency 
is reached. Very many teachers are guilty of neglect 
in this respect. Apparently satisfied when their pupils 
show a certain mastery over a process, they leave it 
entirely for other work and are discouraged to dis- 
cover, some time later, that the hard-earned ability is 
lost and that the drill apparently must be done over 
again. 
) After skill is first acquired, it seems to pass through 
a probationary stage, and, unless used with some 
regularity, deteriorates rapidly,» Both teachers and 
pupils should realize this, and plan to prevent such 
loss, For example, the first general use of standardized 
tests in arithmetic showed frequently that there was 
a serious loss of skill in the fundamental processes 
through lack of adequate “follow-up” work. Since 
then there have been developed three or four very 
effective schemes for using brief periods of practice 
through the grades until stable results are ensured. 
Profitable use of the principle can be made in all lines 
of drill.
-P-A-G-E-189

8. Collecting and organizing information 
An index of skill in study. A large share of the time 
spent in study is devoted to the task of getting infor- 
mation from books. This type of work, while not usu- 
ally as difficult as problem-solving, furnishes perhaps 
the surest index of skill in study. Certainly there is 
no other phase of study in which there is such a wide 
divergence, both in the quality of results and in the 
time spent by children in securing them. It is not 
strange that this is true. Reading a book may mean so 
many different things. Its pages contain a thousand 
details to overwhelm a passive reader who does not 
make them keep their distance; there are countless 
opportunities for misplacing emphasis, misinterpreting 
statements, missing vital connections, and misjudging 
values. In short, a book is inert material, of which 
little or much may be made, depending upon the 
reader and his manner of using it. “A student must 
have real skill to glean from a book only what he needs./~ 
Knowing what to look for. Since it is so necessary 
to be prepared in advance for effective collecting of 
information, especial importance attaches to the first 
step in the study process, which has been called locat- 
ing the objective. In this type of work it means select- 
ing the prime question which can be answered only 
when proper information is found, and by which the 
value of all details encountered may be estimated; that 
is, the student determines in advance the nature of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  
  172 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
facts he needs for his purpose, so that he can give due 
consideration to related information, and ignores 
everything without vital bearing on his question. A 
librarian once told the writer that there were two 
classes of children who came to the city library — one 
who “knew what they wanted to find out,” and one 
who did not. She gave numerous instances showing 
the marked superiority of the first class over the second 
in respect to skill in reading. She named one twelve- 
year-old boy in particular who came in every week to 
see what new books or articles had come on aero- 
nautics. His first move was a swift skimming of them 
all, and the quickness-with which he determined that 
one was negligible, because there was “nothing new 
in that,” or selected parts of another for careful read- 
ing, was an impressive example of the effects of “know- 
ing what one wants to find out.” 
No one voluntarily does serious reading without 
some such definite objective. If a teacher wishes to 
learn a better way to teach fractions, or how to remove 
ink-spots, or where to spend a summer vacation, the 
resultant reading will probably be well-directed and 
effective, as well as enjoyable. But if the superin- 
tendent suggests to the same teacher that reading a 
treatise on ethnology would be of general value, the 
resultant attempt might be conscientious, but prob- 
ably not deserving of the three adjectives used above. 
The objection has been made that children fre- 
quently do not know what are the most important
-P-A-G-E-191
  
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 178 
things to look for. It happens with all of us that some 
of the most interesting facts discovered are incidental 
to our main search, and that we later revise our basis 
for judging the value of details encountered. Similarly, 
in traveling, our most valuable and interesting ex- 
periences may not have been foreseen in first choosing 
our trip and its destination. But to start out aimlessly 
on a journey to nowhere in particular merely to see 
what will happen to us, however appealing and gypsy- 
like it may sound in stories, in actual trial soon palls 
and is as tiresome as it is unprofitable. As a requi- 
site to whole-hearted participation, human nature de- 
mands some known destination before setting forth on 
an excursion, whether in study or travel. So, although 
children may not set what seems the most important 
goal, we should not lose sight in this connection of 
three reassuring facts — the goal they set is far better 
than none at all or one set for them; other valuable 
results will be secured incidentally in their quest; and 
the consequent revision of values will help to set a 
better type of goal in the future. 
The tentative classification, When a teacher sug- 
gests to pupils that they take a forward glance over 
the assigned work in order to determine what is to be 
the chief object sought, the response is likely to include 
a number of more or less related questions. These 
may form the basis of a tentative advance classifica- 
tion. In a statement already quoted, Strayer and 
Norsworthy say, “In order to thoroughly understand
-P-A-G-E-192
  174 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
a book students must seek to frame the questions 
which it answers.” An attempt to tabulate roughly 
in advance the important phases of information needed 
leads naturally to formulating such questions as the 
quotation suggests. These serve not only to give a 
necessary variety for stimulating and retaining atten- 
tion, but also to provide logical and convenient head- 
ings under which significant facts may be grouped as 
they are met. These may be revised or entirely 
changed in the light of new information, but their 
value is not lessened on that account. An individual 
who begins seeking information with no definite idea 
of what he is looking for, and no plan regarding what 
he is to do with it, will not only miss the valuable 
experience of having to readjust his plans on meeting 
the unexpected, but will miss most other valuable 
results of intelligent study as well. 
Teacher’s relation to these two steps. It is obvious 
that the pupils’ success in taking these first steps will 
be dependent upon enough advance familiarity with 
the general field covered to frame intelligent ques- 
tions. The duty of the teacher with respect to this 
preparation is suggested by the process which pre- 
pares adults fcr thoughtful study. The mothers in 
the district may have heard the name Parent-Teach- 
ers’ Association, or the fathers may have seen the term 
Civic League. The probability of any intelligent in- 
vestigation in either case is, however, still very slight. 
But if a speaker addresses the mothers on the matter
-P-A-G-E-193
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 175 
of an organization, and outlines some practical possi- 
bilities, immediately a number of questions arise in 
their minds which they wish to investigate. They 
consider the best sources of information, perhaps 
express their tentative classification in the form of 
committees, and otherwise decide in advance what 
they wish to learn and what use is to be made of the 
information. Similar action may result from a talk 
before the men on a Civic League. The librarian of 
that community is asked to suggest sources for very 
definite points of information, and the whole investi- 
gation is directed toward previously chosen objec- 
tives. The continuation of such activity is greatly 
stimulated if they hear other addresses which raise 
new problems and inspire to a yet broader vision. 
The method by which the best teachers prepare 
their pupils for intelligent, forceful investigation in 
some definite field is, in spirit, similar to that by which 
the parents were led. At the beginning of any division 
of subject-matter, its significance should be empha- 
sized by the teacher in a way that will provoke ques- 
tions, but leave the answers to later study. This does 
not mean that the teacher will suggest the questions. 
That would rob the work of spontaneity, and with 
skillful teaching is by no means necessary. For ex- 
ample, in history, upon beginning the study of the 
long struggle over the slavery question a teacher may 
set forth the situation, involving elements of economic 
and industrial demands, political traditions, rapid
-P-A-G-E-194
  176 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
territorial expansion, disputed States’ rights, and race 
prejudices, in such a way as to make the class alert 
for the developing problems and ready to question how 
each succeeding compromise tried to settle the diffi- 
culty, how far it really helped, wherein it failed, and 
whether open conflict was inevitable. In geography 
a similar introductory talk might serve to prepare 
for several weeks of study on South America, and 
might properly include our developing relations with 
that country, quotations from Roosevelt’s estimates 
of their future, and other material naturally requiring 
explanatory investigation. After such a presentation 
the pupils can suggest enough advance questions and 
sub-topics for their study to supply organizing bases 
for a whole series of lessons. Miss Simpson, in her 
Supervised Study in History, has very happily called 
this type of lesson “The Inspirational Preview.” 
The teacher who strives to develop inspirational 
skill, even at the expense of inquisitorial activities, is 
repaid not only in stimulated interest on the part of 
the pupils, but also in their developing more intelligent 
direction of their efforts. This should not be misunder- 
stood as suggesting flights of oratory, but it does call 
for giving at least an adequate preliminary view. The 
plan followed in some educational textbooks of placing 
the summary at the beginning of each chapter, matter- 
of-fact and uninspiring as it may seem, has neverthe- 
less some psychological justification. 
Evaluating data. After the main phases of the
-P-A-G-E-195
  EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 177 
information sought have been roughly outlined, the 
pupil is ready to collect appropriate facts and give 
each its proper associations. In doing this, he should 
hold, as the next important rule in this type of study, a 
critical attitude toward each statement he encounters. 
The judgment which he passes upon each item may be 
from either of two angles. In the first place, he should 
learn to decide how pertinent the information is to his 
purpose. Skill in this is absolutely essential to rapid 
study, or effectively “‘skimming” an article. While 
growth in this ability is gradual, the fundamental 
element in the activity is having a preconceived stand- 
ard always in consciousness as one reads, and slight- 
ing everything which does not possess some element 
in common with this standard. The performance is 
somewhat similar to that of a boy looking for a lost 
marble: with the image of it in mind he ignores in his 
search the countless other objects about him, unless 
perchance a smooth pebble or a round piece of paper 
holds his attention for a closer examination. Without 
this swift appraisal of values as each detail passes 
under his eye, the reader loses his poise; having no 
means of holding the host of details at a safe distance, 
he is overwhelmed. That pupil is, indeed, to be pitied 
to whom all sentences read seem to have equal value; 
who surrenders to a paragraph and drifts over it like 
a mariner without rudder or compass, and, after being 
tossed from one sentence to another, finally comes 
ashore at the end possessed of only chance flotsam.
-P-A-G-E-196
  
  178 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
While the rapid sweep in reading is to be encouraged, 
along with its swift evaluation of details, there are 
often times when judgment must be passed more 
deliberately. If there has been collected a number of 
facts bearing on a certain topic, the matter of deciding 
their relative importance requires careful considera- 
tion. Most pupils probably never pass this stage in 
their study. The recitation should, of course, provide 
for testing, and, if necessary, revising, these judg- 
ments. But it should also give training looking toward 
independent activity of that sort on the part of the 
pupils. This is one of the most important functions 
of the how-to-study lesson. Indeed, in the primary 
grades, the foundation for rapid thought-gleaning 
must be laid in this way. Learning how to locate the 
key sentence of a paragraph and to determine its 
importance for the main investigation is a slow and 
often difficult process. Its value justifies the use of 
many periods spent in studying with the pupils. 
The critical attitude. Along with collecting data 
should go a critical attitude as to the worth and reli- 
ability of the material found. When one textbook in 
a subject constitutes the single source of information, 
the opportunity for comparing and judging authorities 
is very limited. The natural result is that the children 
are inclined to accept without question whatever they 
see in print. An attitude which questions the reliabil- 
ity of an authority and looks for corroborative evi- 
dence, either on the facts or the trustworthiness of the
-P-A-G-E-197
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 179 
author, is of such importance to intelligent citizenship 
that some way should be found to develop it. Supple- 
mentary texts, reference books, current magazines, 
newspapers, and even personal interviews with local 
officials, travelers, or pioneer citizens, all furnish such 
valuable opportunities to compare various sources of 
information that practically every school can do some- 
thing in this line. 
This does not necessarily mean that immature 
children are competent to criticize the scholarship of 
the author of a textbook. But if two authorities disa- 
gree, it is quite within the children’s province to in- 
vestigate as to which is more reliable. Especially is it 
important for them to develop the habit of determin- 
ing for themselves, whenever possible, the accuracy of 
information, since training in study should look not 
merely to the daily preparation of lessons, but to the 
permanent need for critical investigation as a lifelong 
adjunct of citizenship. 
The proper taking of notes. Few practices in school 
are subject to so much misuse, and yet possess such 
valuable possibilities, as note-taking. The chief in- 
dictment against the notebook is the fact that it so 
frequently serves as a specious substitute for study. 
Such customs as copying a large part of what the 
teacher says in recitation, whether fully understood 
or not, as portentous words to be conned just before 
examination time; or copying, practically verbatim, 
headings and sentences from the textbook to be offered  
-P-A-G-E-198
  180 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
with some feeble comment, if any at all, in the recita- 
tion — these have justly provoked criticism which has 
gone so far as to question the value of any note-taking 
whatever. There are, however, certain ways in which 
a notebook may guide and stimulate right methods of 
study as no other device can, and on that account its 
proper use is fully justified. But in order to avoid 
having its usefulness counteracted by objectionable 
practices, definite training in note-taking should be 
given by the teacher in the study lesson. 
In the first place, as implied above, the method of 
\ taking notes should strengthen right methods of study. 
ie can do this in two ways: by guiding effort along 
proper lines, and by preserving the partial results of 
study in the most convenient and valuable form for 
further use. This can best be accomplished by having 
the notebook reflect the steps in collecting and organ- 
izing information as already partly given. It will in- 
clude first of all the assignment or field of investigation 
undertaken, with such directions, suggestions, and 
questions as the teacher and class shall have agreed 
upon in the forward-looking part of the recitation. 
Reference to this occasionally will help to keep clear 
the exact topics assigned. Next it should reflect the 
selection of the main objective, and the tentative clas- 
sification under it. It will usually be found most con- 
venient to have the items of this classification separated 
widely enough to leave space for writing in the data 
as it is selected later. This constitutes the preliminary
-P-A-G-E-199
  EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 181 
outline and guide, and serves as a sort of filing cabinet 
for information as it is encountered, evaluated, and 
classified in study. The student thus has his data 
ready in classified lists for such later use as may be 
desirable. 
Jt will sometimes happen that the organization of 
material must wait until the character of data from 
different sources is known. For example, in the divi- 
sion of work for a group undertaking, each pupil will 
take certain references and search them for data, the 
organization of which will be done in the group con- 
ference or recitation. In such a case, the taking of 
notes will seem to be of a different type, although 
logically it will be the same procedure as for a single 
division of the general classification. The tendency in 
making such a summary of the important facts in any 
reference will be to copy the paragraph headings, if 
the book has them. This again is a substitute for 
study — and a poor one at that; for headings may be 
ambiguous and even misleading unless interpreted in 
the light of the discussion following. The only safe 
method — the one with which training in such study 
should begin — is to locate the key or topical sen- 
tence. This will correct or corroborate the impression 
given by the heading. The note taken in that connec- 
tion should usually be neither the sentence nor head- 
ing, but an individual comment or restatement that 
will reflect the student’s estimate of the importance of 
that discussion for his investigation, 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  182 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
\ The task or game of locating the key sentence of a 
paragraph or story is one to which pupils, as low as the 
third grade, eagerly respond. ,It is so important as a 
basis, both of later note-taking and rapid reading, that 
it should receive generous attention in the study lesson. 
After a guiding question or two, such as, “Which sen- 
tence tells what this paragraph is about?” or “Is there 
any sentence that we could not do without in this 
paragraph?” even young pupils very quickly grasp the 
idea of relative values in a paragraph. When skill in 
this process has developed to the point where pupils can 
very quickly “husk out” the significant points in a 
series of paragraphs, the notebook is not only a justi- 
fiable but very desirable place for recording the results 
of this achievement. 
Making outlines. The final outline of material col- 
lected should embody the results of the completed 
organization. With his array of data before him, 
roughly tabulated and grouped under the headings of 
his tentative classification, the pupil is then in position 
to decide upon such revision and regrouping as the 
situation seems to require. Not infrequently the re- 
sults of his investigation lead to a new sense of pro- 
portionate values, and a correspondingly new general 
heading is chosen under which the material is to be 
organized. ‘Since the function of an outline is primarily 
to indicate organization,\the more faithfully it reflects 
relative values and subordinations among the data, 
the more valuable it is. On that account the character
-P-A-G-E-201
  EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 183° 
of the material itself and the purpose for which it is 
collected should be the guiding considerations in pre- 
paring an outline, rather than fixed rules of any but a 
very general nature. If the preliminary planning was 
well considered, the matter of reducing the final 
organization to outline form is comparatively simple. 
Its value, however, should not on that account be 
underestimated. As a means of enabling a student to 
sweep into one view an otherwise incomprehensible 
mass of details; as a stimulant to that final, clear, 
definite grasp of relationships which might otherwise 
elude him; or as a preparation for a coherent, concise 
report, either oral or written, the making of an outline 
is well-nigh invaluable. 
Making and mastering a synopsis. As a final step 
in making the results of this type of study readily 
available whenever need arises, it is wise to master a 
convenient summary. This will be much briefer than 
the outline just discussed, and may incline to the 
practical rather than the strictly logical, but its value 
as a feature of study is not limited merely to its utility 
in recalling material already mastered. The prepara- 
tion of the synopsis requires judgment as to the 
features most apt to be called for, and a corresponding 
conjecture as to the situation out of which the need 
will come. This thinking reénforces the previously 
made organization, and at the same time is such an 
admirable preparation for easy recall that the task of 
learning the synopsis itself is made easy. It should not

be forgotten, however, that this final summary is 
primarily for the convenience of the pupil. Therefore 
its length and character should be such as he finds most 
serviceable and easy of control. 
Chapter summary. See close of the following chap- 
ter for a summary covering Chapters V and VI. 
QUESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. “Many a whole recitation, also, may be occupied 
in discussing how lessons have been prepared, 
the teacher not seldom presenting her own way 
in detail, and allowing her pupils to compare 
theirs with it. Abstract theory about method of 
study will thus be avoided.” — McMurry, How 
to Study, p. 298. 
Select an assignment and show how it could 
be profitably followed by such comparison and 
demonstration of study methods as are suggested 
above. 
2. McMurry, in the same connection, expresses the 
belief that one fourth of the school-time might 
well be devoted to methods of study. To what 
extent, if any, do you think that the usual sub- 
ject-matter would be slighted by such a practice? 
Give reasons. 
8. Using as an example the poem, “Breathes there 
a man with soul so dead,” tell what rational as- 
sociations you would try to develop with pupils, 
and what other preliminary work you would 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 185 
deem advisable before having them try to mem- 
orize it. 
. What mental steps must be taken by a child in 
selecting the key sentence of a paragraph? Select 
a, paragraph appropriate for third- or fourth-grade 
pupils, and tell what you would do to guide them 
in taking these steps. 
. Is there danger that the pre-view and advance 
information necessary for a preliminary classifi- 
cation may dull the pupils’ interest in further 
reading along that line? Do you read with 
greater interest in familiar or unfamiliar fields? 
Ask pupils what lines of reading they prefer, and 
why. 
. Most writers agree that pupils should maintain 
a “critical attitude” in their study. What do 
you understand this to mean? To what extent 
should it be encouraged in their reading of fairy 
stories and literary selections? In their study of 
the official textbook in geography or history? 
. What reasons are there for the statement that 
the task of getting information from books 
“furnishes perhaps the surest index of skill in 
study?” 
. Give what you consider the typical methods of 
study pursued by pupils in doing “home work.” 
To what extent and how should the teacher try 
to alter these methods? 
. Select some simple reading material for pupils

beginning the second grade, and tell what pro- 
cedure you would follow in “studying with 
them.” 
What are the differences between the methods 
pursued by one who is trying to “look up” some- 
thing at the library, and those followed by pupils 
“doing” an assignment? How do the results 
differ? 
Why is learning by wholes not only more eco- 
nomical but safer than piecemeal memorizing? 
How would you prove this to doubting pupils? 
It is often said that drill work is largely a waste 
of time unless permanent codperation is secured 
from the pupils until the desired habits are es- 
tablished. Illustrate this by some such work as 
spelling, and suggest ways of securing this per- 
manent codperation. 
An enthusiastic lecturer, in discussing the ad- 
vantages of project work, declared that a child’s 
methods of investigation would take care of 
themselves if only he was sufficiently intent on 
finding some needed information. Would you 
fully accept the above statement, add some 
qualifying conditions, or reject it as misleading? 
Give reasons for the position you take. 
Tell what suggestions you would give pupils in 
order to help them determine for themselves 
what was the best method of attack for any par- 
ticular assignment.

To what extent and in what form would it be 
advisable to inform elementary-school pupils of 
the psychology of habit-building, as a means of 
making their practice more intelligent and effec- 
tive? 
To what extent is it true that any one voluntarily 
searching for information has, more or less con- 
sciously, a tentative classification under which 
to group facts as they may be found? Illustrate 
this in the case of a boy who is reading up on air- 
craft. 
In teaching eighth- or ninth-grade pupils how to 
take notes, name the various dangers you would 
attempt to guard them against. Suggest some 
instructions you would give for that purpose. 
Courtis, in discussing the results of experiments 
on drill in the fundamental operations of arith- 
metic, says: “Ten minutes a day, day after day, 
spent in intense, purposeful, snappy practice has 
proved adequate to develop proper habits of speed 
and accuracy. Why use more?” 
Discuss the bearing of this quotation on (a) the 
requirements set by the teacher for drill work; 
(b) the kind of practice which pupils may be 
induced to choose voluntarily as the easiest way 
of getting results.

CHAPTER VI 
_EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY (concluded) 
4. Solving problems 
Peculiar nature of the task. In a broad sense, the 
greater part of school-work should be connected with 
the solving of problems. The popular view has been 
that the chief concern of the student was to get infor- 
mation. But no one collects information strictly for its 
own sake. In most cases the information seems worth 
collecting because it is necessary, immediately or ul- 
timately, to the solution of some problem. So it is the 
problems, especially those that have vital importance 
in the eyes of the pupils, which give significance to 
school tasks. But many school assignments are more 
directly concerned with only a part of the ultimate 
process, and accordingly, for convenience, were dis- 
cussed in the preceding chapter as separate units of 
study activity. There remains to be taken up in this 
chapter only the distinctly characteristic steps of 
problem-solving — the final stage of the process in 
which the results of the preceding types of study are 
used as auxiliary to the achievement. 
Probably the best-known definition of a problem is 
the one which calls it ‘‘an obstacle in the path of 
_ thought.” The nature of the task of solving a problem 
would, however, be better suggested if it were called
-P-A-G-E-208
  190 | TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
“an unbridged gulf in the path of thought.” For the 
task is to supply a missing connection, a needed ele- 
ment whereby the path of thought is completed or 
extended to new territory. In the study of geography, 
for example, the problem may be met as to why the 
climate of the Pacific States is so much milder than 
that of the Atlantic States in the same latitude. 
Various suggestions may be brought forward to see if 
the needed explanation can be supplied. One by one 
they may be tested, but break down under trial, until 
finally one is found which stands all tests, and forms 
a sound basis for reaching a safe conclusion. The pro- 
cess is even more distinctly seen in the mathematical 
type of problem. This, stripped to the barest form in 
which it appears, consists of something given and 
something required. The “‘something required” defi- 
nitely indicates the part of the path which is missing 
— the place where a continuous connection must be 
established. If the nature of the process involved in 
problem-solving is clearly grasped, it will be easy to 
understand the nature of the steps to be taken in per- 
forming this activity as a type of study. 
Locating the vital point. It will be obvious from the 
preceding paragraph that the first step in logical prob- 
lem-solving is to determine the exact point where the 
connection is missing. It includes a survey, so to 
speak, of the known portions of the path up to the last 
sure footing and a glance beyond toward the desired 
conclusion, with a conjecture as to the character and
-P-A-G-E-209
eR err er rn eee 
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 191 
extent of the material needed to supply the lack. 
Teachers of mathematics will emphatically agree that 
the great difficulty in teaching pupils to solve prob- 
lems is to get them to wait until they know precisely 
what is given and what is required before plunging 
in and trying to find a solution. The need is equally | 
great, though not always so apparent, with other 
kinds of problems. The pupil who carries his pre- 
liminary survey to the point where he can say, “As 
soon as I find out two things I can solve this prob- 
lem,” is already half done. In other cases he may sub- 
stitute “try out” for “find out,” and the number of 
things may vary, but any amount of time necessary to 
locate the vital element of the problem so definitely is 
well invested. 
Mobilizing data. The next move is to bring to- 
gether the data upon which the desired conclusions 
may be based. This step may vary widely, in the time 
and effort required, from a simple rehearsal of known 
details to extended work in collecting and organizing 
information sufficient to be rated as a study unit in 
itself. If the problem is inductive the data will consist 
of all the individual details with apparent significance 
for a general conclusion. But if it is wholly or partly 
deductive in character, the data will include such 
general principles as seem to have value for the inter- 
pretation and disposal of particular details in the prob- 
lem. The plan of trying to have pupils distinguish 
between the two types in study seems, in actual prac-  
-P-A-G-E-210
  
  192 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
tice, to have little utility, and tends to add an unneces- 
sary element of formality. If the nature of the prob- 
lem is clearly seen, the children naturally select the 
appropriate kind of data. The rather strictly inductive 
or deductive type of development has each in turn its 
place for emphasis in the recitation, but such consider- 
ations may safely be left in the study period to the 
shaping force of the problem itself. 
The chief need for care in assembling data comes 
from the tendency of pupils to be satisfied with too few 
particulars. The danger in an inductive lesson of 
generalizing on insufficient data is well known, but 
there is equal danger of error in a deductive exercise if 
there is insufficient consideration of particular facts. 
A boy who undertook to explain why the interior of 
Florida was so thinly settled had difficulty because he 
noted only the familiar items of surface, soil, rain- 
fall, and temperature, neglecting the peculiar fact of 
drainage. Even in the very definite field of mathemati- 
cal problems, mistakes are due quite as frequently to 
disregard of some phase of the details given as to 
wrong selection of principles. In general, the best 
means of ensuring adequate consideration of details is 
through the step of verification, as will be set forth 
under that topic. 
Keeping inferences tentative. As soon as the ex- 
amination of data begins, inferences and conjectures 
immediately occur to the pupil. We have all experi- 
enced the difficulty of reserving judgment when the
-P-A-G-E-211
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 193 
first facts noted seem to point to the desired conclu- 
sion. With small children it is usually best to test such 
an inference at once, as they are not inclined to look 
earnestly for other possibilities until the first attrac- 
tive one has been tried and found wanting. But with 
older children, the attitude of deliberation should be 
encouraged. To withhold judgment and keep the 
suggested conjectures tentative until the data are 
reasonably complete, not only saves time in most 
cases, but also prevents overlooking other and perhaps 
sounder inferences in the haste to apply the first one. 
As a permanent possession, the value of the habit of 
reserving judgment and impartially weighing all sug- 
gestions before reaching a conclusion is great enough to 
warrant especial emphasis upon it in study training. 
Testing hasty conclusions. All children are prone to 
“jump at conclusions.” This should be accepted as a 
normal procedure until some degree of deliberation can 
be developed. The tendency in itself is not so disturb- 
ing as the disposition to be satisfied with these hastily 
reached conclusions. On that account it should be 
made the invariable rule that every conclusion reached 
in study is to be tested by giving it a new application, 
or seeing if it harmonizes with additional data. Just 
as the habit of carefully “checking results” in mathe- 
matics develops accuracy, confidence, and independ- 
ence, so the application of a corresponding test to all 
problem-solving activities will prove beneficial in a 
similar way. ; 
   
-P-A-G-E-212
  194 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
Making verification complete. The fact should be 
emphasized that the most vital step in problem-solving 
is that of final verification. No matter how brilliantly 
the other phases have been handled, unless there is 
strict verification the results are never quite trust- 
worthy. On the other hand, even clumsy and illogical 
procedure is atoned for if every conclusion is carefully 
tested, and the data faithfully reéxamined until finally 
an inference is reached which admits of complete veri- 
fication. Such methods may consume extra time, but 
that, important as it is, must not always be given first 
consideration in study training. 
Just as “the proof of the pudding is in the eating,” 
so the final test of a solution is in the way it works. In 
order to help make the verification complete and final, 
it is often advisable for the teacher to suggest definite 
ways of using it. These may be of a general sort, as, 
“Can you find any instance in which your conclusion 
fails?” or, “Can you think of any other explanation 
that would work as well or better? ” Usually, however, 
a special test, appropriate to the particular problem, is 
better. It is in this process that any inadequacy in 
the original data should be exposed. If pupils show a 
marked tendency to ignore important details, verifica- 
tion should be required which strikes directly at this 
point. Children are usually satisfied with any solution 
that works, and the one way of compelling sufficient 
consideration of data to warrant the conclusion is to 
propose a plan of verification which will demonstrate 
wherein the unwarranted inference breaks down.

The use of general rules. Most of the foregoing 
discussion on methods of study has dealt with the 
special ways in which the procedure should be adapted 
to the nature of the task and material. There are also 
features common to all types of study, and these are 
governed by the principles which apply to mental work 
in general. Consequently any general rules which 
embody these principles are of constant value, not 
only for the immediate task undertaken, but as in- 
dicating also the lines along which study habits should 
be established. The remainder of this chapter deals 
with measures of such a character. 
“ Warming-up ” and the “ flying start.” A consider- 
able part of the study period is regularly wasted in 
getting started. This waste has a tendency to con- 
tinue in various forms, as distractions are likely to 
originate at this time which persist in their disturbing 
influence. The best insurance against all the dangers 
that threaten a safe beginning on a study task is to 
make that beginning a vigorous, active one. Mention 
has previously been made of the safety that comes 
from momentum. The sooner this is acquired at the 
beginning of a study period, the greater is the proba- 
bility of successful study. Psychologists recognize a 
“ warming-up ” period at the start of any mental effort. 
This varies in length, but work does not reach full 
efficiency until after the warming-up is completed.
-P-A-G-E-214
  196 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
The time necessary for this is dependent to a consider- 
able extent upon the vigor of the attack. Indeed, some 
pupils begin so leisurely that they never complete the 
warming-up stage during the study period. 
In view of its many advantages, both defensive and 
aggressive, the “ flying-start ” habit is an extremely 
important one to cultivate. The responsibility for this 
rests primarily with the recitation, and, as was set 
forth in an earlier chapter, the best kind of recitation 
furnishes the necessary warming-up, inaugurates an 
energetic start, and merges without a break into the 
study period. But where there has been a break of any 
kind between the recitation and the time for study, 
special measures should be used to make a prompt, 
aggressive beginning the regular procedure. A rou- 
tine signal device, comparable to starting runners on 
a race, is sometimes used with success. The essen- 
tial thing to strive for unfailingly at the outset of a 
study period is a beginning marked by cheerful con- 
fidence and good-humor, but at the same time by 
business-like energy and alertness. This is a matter 
calling for frank explanation in order to enlist the 
codperation of the pupils. The very term, the “‘ flying 
start,” always appeals to them as a study slogan, and 
when it stands for a distinct saving in time and effort, it 
automatically assists in making the procedure habitual. 
Setting a premium on independent work. Frequent 
reference has already been made to independent self- 
direction as the goal in study training. Its value for
-P-A-G-E-215
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 197 
later life is obvious, but some of the advantages of 
independence in schoolroom study are not fully appre- 
ciated. As long as the child is expecting to call upon 
the teacher if serious difficulty is encountered, his 
maximum ability is never quite put forth, and devel- 
opment is correspondingly short of what it might be. 
Emerson’s essay on Self-reliance is a storehouse ef 
stimulating thought in this regard. 
The study period should be planned and supervised 
in such a way as to put a premium upon independence. 
If a beginning is not made in the primary grades, it is 
very difficult to get the pupil to think of the task as his 
very own, instead of something to be done with and for 
the teacher. One excellent supervisor of second-grade 
classes offers special recognition to those of her pupils 
who succeed in preparing a lesson without asking a 
single question during the study period. Children 
make more blunders in that way, but frequently learn 
more from their own blunders than from correct work 
for which frequent help is required. The writer is 
ready to admit the possibility of carrying this too far, 
but very many teachers are inclined to err on the 
wrong side of the line. The one compensation in the 
rural school of many grades is the fact that pupils 
develop independence in their study. The same ad- 
vantage may be added to the others possessed by 
better graded schools if the teachers in the latter will 
make the encouragement of independence a definite 
objective.
-P-A-G-E-216
  198 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
The individual time-record. The device of having 
pupils keep time-cards on their day’s activities has 
several excellent features. An effective form has a col- 
umn for each subject to be studied and an additional 
column each for sleep, meals, play, and idleness. At 
the top of each column the pupil puts what he con- 
siders a fair allotment of time for that particular thing. 
Along each horizontal line below he enters daily under 
the appropriate heading the actual time spent. One 
of the unexpected revelations to the pupil is the way 
the minutes count up in the last column. The fact that 
he has made a kind of systematic disposition of his 
time, and is to record daily his deviations from it, has 
a strong influence in favor of systematic habits. The 
card also stimulates intensive study and concentra- 
tion, as the pupil is influenced more than he realizes 
by his desire to complete his work within the time he 
has already allotted for it. Finally the device has 
beneficial effects not directly connected with study, 
in that the daily record of time spent in sleep, meals, 
and play calls the child’s attention to deficiencies in 
any of these which would otherwise pass unnoticed. 
Since the ultimate aims of a health crusade and plans 
for more systematic study are convergent, the time- 
card may well be utilized in both connections as help- 
ing the child take his first steps in self-engineering. 
Regularity of environment. The principle of sys- 
tematizing the details of study should be extended to 
cover also the circumstances under which work is done,
-P-A-G-E-217
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 199 
Whipple, in his collection of rules on How to Study 
Effectively, has emphasized the value of establishing 
both a “place-study” habit and a “‘time-study” habit. 
Many students have by trial convinced themselves of 
the greater ease of preparing lessons according to an 
habitual time-and-place schedule, even going so far 
as to compare the resultant mental efficiency to the 
physical benefits accruing from regular hours of eating, 
sleeping, and bodily activity. Whatever may be the 
force of other factors contributing to this efficiency, 
there is one entirely sufficient in itself and of unques- 
tioned validity, namely, the comparative absence of 
distractions in an habitual environment. 
When a pupil tries to do home study, a regular time- 
and-place schedule for doing it is absolutely essential 
to any certainty of results, as parents will readily 
agree. In the study time at school, while there is not 
the variety of competition to distract the attention, 
any change in the environment tends to make applica- 
tion more difficult. If, for example, a pupil is accus- 
tomed to study history while another group is reciting 
arithmetic, he will find application more difficult if 
the other group recites another subject instead. The 
explanation is simple. One’s attention instinctively 
turns to any new element in his environment, and the 
significance of that must be more or less definitely 
appraised before he can fully settle to prosaic tasks. 
But if all important elements of one’s surroundings, in- 
cluding time, place, and companionship, are familiar,
-P-A-G-E-218
200 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
habit can then exert its force toward beginning the 
activity that has become associated with that environ- 
ment. The “time-and-place habit” in study is always 
earnestly recommended to college students by writers 
and instructors, but its value probably increases all 
down through the grades, as primary teachers will 
realize who know how disconcerting to small children 
even a slight novelty in the environment may be. 
Under-learning and over-learning. Most pupils are 
unable to produce results in the recitation propor- 
tionate to the time spent in study because of the waste 
of under-learning. They almost get needed informa- 
tion clearly in mind, but stop while it is still so be- 
fogged as to be unreliable or misleading. They think 
they have solved problems, but fail to reach a point of 
unquestionably proved results, or even of knowing. 
precisely how those were obtained which they have. 
They almost master some important facts to be re- 
membered, but reproduce them, if at all, m a form so 
mangled and incoherent that they are useless unless 
completely rehabilitated. Many recitations are spent 
almost wholly in the task of piecing together these 
fragmentary offerings, or in the even more discourag- 
ing labor of trying to build upon an unstable and in- 
sufficient foundation. Pupils should learn that from 
the standpoint of actual results such study is a 
wretched waste of time and effort. The workman who 
carries his burden almost to the top of the wall might 
have saved his strength by leaving it on the ground
-P-A-G-E-219
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 201 
from the first. It is the last determined blow, or the 
last persistent ounce of pressure, which cracks the nut; 
without the completing effort, all preceding pains 
would have been wasted. 
If the need of complete mastery of certain essentials 
in a study lesson is properly presented to pupils, they 
respond readily. Even the pupil who does very little 
studying is anxious to get the fullest possible credit for 
the labor invested, and so can be interested in the 
practical advantages of doing well what is done at all. 
Pupils who make it their rule not to consider prepara- 
tion complete until certain points are known positively 
are not only certain to participate more creditably in 
the recitation, but are also learning a new satisfaction 
born of self-respect and independence. Just how far 
‘learning must be carried to ensure this mastery varies 
with individuals, and it is for each one to discover his 
own point of safety. Some writers advise over-learning 
to a slight degree as precaution against subsequent 
“shrinkage.” At any rate, the danger that pupils 
will voluntarily over-learn essentials is so slight as to 
be negligible, while the waste of under-learning is 
an ever-present and demoralizing menace to efficient 
study. Consequently, in doubtful ground between the 
two, safety lies on the side of thoroughness. 
Final try-outs of preparation. As a means of reas- 
suring one’s self as to the complete mastery men- 
tioned above, it is an excellent plan to take the last 
few minutes of study for giving the preparation a final
-P-A-G-E-220
  202 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
try-out or checking-over. Furthermore, this procedure 
~ has especial value for bringing to light important items 
that were slighted in the original preparation, and that 
otherwise would have been lost before they could be 
used. 
The writer once made a systematic trial of this plan 
with two successive classes in foreign language. Being 
in a position to supervise their study as well as hear 
their recitation, he gave a signal just ten minutes 
before the end of the study which meant that no new 
translation was to be studied further, but that the 
remaining time was to be spent in a rapid try-out of 
the preparation already made. In both cases there 
was a very marked improvement, not only in the 
quality of their preparation, but in the amount they 
were able to cover as sight work in class. After two 
months it was found that they could make so much 
more speed in the try-out of their preparation that five 
minutes sufficed. After they passed on to other teach- 
ers, various members of the classes voluntarily re- 
ported their continued use of the plan and its extension 
to other subjects. Since then the writer has read re- 
ports of similar applications of the same principle, and 
always with confident assurances of its value. 
Personal study rules. There have been published 
various lists of study rules, most of which have very 
practical value. From among these rather extended 
compilations, many principals have selected those 
rules that seemed to have special value for their school
-P-A-G-E-221
  
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 208 
and its conditions, and have arranged these for the use 
of their pupils. Such a plan is often productive of 
marked improvement in study. The longer such lists 
of rules are, the less effective they are likely to be, 
since the pupil, being unable to remember and use all, 
is inclined to make very little use of any. At the same 
time, in selecting rules for the use of pupils, the teacher 
is reluctant to omit any one which seems to have es- 
pecial value for certain individuals in the class, and, by 
the time all needs are provided for, the list is usually 
of some length. This difficulty can be satisfactorily 
met and additional advantages secured by having 
each pupil prepare a personal list of study rules. 
The material from which the pupil makes his selec- 
tions is a more comprehensive list presented by the 
teacher in some such form as that summarized at the 
close of this chapter. The teacher should go over the 
full list of rules with the pupils, explaining the reasons 
for each one. After the pupils understand the meaning 
and use of them all, they may be given a definite aum- 
ber of days in which to try the rules, one by one, in 
their study. At the end of that time they are to select 
a personal list of those especial rules which they have 
found the most helpful, or of which they feel the most 
need. The trials made of this plan indicate that the 
selections are usually rather well made, and, better 
still, the pupil, after selecting the rules, feels some 
personal responsibility for using them. Such a list is 
short enough for memorization, or at least for a ready- 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
  204 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
working familiarity, and does not have the indefinite, 
general character of the longer type. Moreover, an 
unobtrusive suggestion or two will usually secure the 
inclusion of those especially needed by that pupil, even 
if he has not of his own accord made a wise choice. 
Some such plan for inducing pupils to attempt to 
systematize their study becomes vitally important by 
the time high school is reached. Whatever form the 
arrangement may take, it should emphasize the ele- 
ment of self-direction. 
Mechanical helps to use of books. It is surprising 
how many pupils reach high school without having 
learned to make the most of what may be termed the 
mechanical helps to be found in any book. These 
include usually an index, table of contents, preface, 
headings and subheadings, differences in size of type, 
summaries, and perhaps appendices. Even paragraph 
indentations constitute a phase of mechanical help 
which many pupils in the upper grades fail to utilize 
fully. It is gratifying to note that Miss Simpson, in 
her Supervised Study in History, recommends, as the 
opening lesson for junior high-school pupils in that 
subject, a period spent in getting acquainted with 
these various mechanical features. Although the need 
is usually still apparent with pupils of that age, the 
training in such matters should be carried along from 
the primary grades. 
Even in his earliest connected reading, the pupil 
may begin to scrutinize the boldly printed heading or
-P-A-G-E-223
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 205 
title, both for its significance in forecasting the char- 
acter of the story and for the questions which it sug- 
gests as motives and guides for the reading. A little 
later he is ready to make conscious use of the para- 
graph indentation as visibly setting off rather dis- 
tinct units of material. After some practice in deter- 
mining in any paragraph the central fact with which 
all the sentences in it deal, the child is ready for a 
practical generalization. The essential working feature 
of this is the expectation that any paragraph, in which 
the opening sentences bear directly upon the topic 
under study, will all be of value for that study and 
consequently worthy of careful reading; while a para- 
graph in which the opening sentences promise no con- 
tribution to the information sought may safely be 
skipped for that investigation, and the next one tried. 
This is exactly what a mature student does in skim- 
ming a book for needed material. Trials of this general 
type of paragraph study in the third grade of our 
training school indicated that pupils of that age were 
keenly interested and easily capable of considerable 
skill in such exercises. The fact that so many older 
pupils ignore paragraph indentations, except as resting 
places, seems to be due to a lack of definite training 
in utilizing them as helps to study. The value of such 
use as a basis for the pupils’ own construction of para- 
graphs in written composition is of course obvious. 
Next in order of time and importance should come 
training in the use of the index and the table of con-
-P-A-G-E-224
    
206 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
tents. This, along with practice in finding alpha- 
betized information in reference books, may very 
quickly be taught through some kind of “dictionary 
game.” The time required for giving pupils explicit 
instructions and adequate practice in the use of these 
and other mechanical helps, such as the books to which 
they have access contain, is very little in comparison 
to its value to the pupils, whether measured in time 
saved and work accomplished, or in the added con- 
fidence and satisfaction arising from knowing better 
the use of one’s daily tools. Not the least of the time- 
saving features is the summary, which many books 
contain, usually appearing in the most usable form in 
the table of contents. Pupils should, of course, under- 
stand that the author’s summary is not something to 
be lifted out as a substitute for study, but a guide to 
the location of needed data. 
Too few teachers realize that the most profitable 
way in which the first recitation with a new textbook 
can possibly be spent is in learning all the ways in 
which the author and publishers have tried to help 
pupils in its study. The significance of the various 
kinds of type; the purpose and plan of the illustrative 
features; the appendix, if any, and the possible uses of 
material there; the preface, and especially the sugges- 
tions to students, such as some books contain; all these 
are examples of the things which may profitably be 
considered, especially with older pupils, in helping 
them get acquainted with a new book. To use an ex-
-P-A-G-E-225
  EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 207 
pressive colloquialism drawn from the business world, 
the aim in all this should be to “sell” them the book 
as well as teach them how to use it. The pupil who 
begins his new text with confident anticipation of 
satisfactory results from its study, and eagerness to 
try its accessory helps, is well started toward working 
out his own salvation in it. The teacher who adopts 
the methods of the demonstrating agent to the extent 
of accomplishing this is exemplifying a sound type of 
practical pedagogy. 
Outline summary. In summarizing the contents of 
Chapters V and VI, the plan is followed of presenting 
these as an outline of principles and rules of effective 
study. In this form they may be taken up with the 
pupils themselves in whatever way the teacher thinks 
best. Although the reasons for, and applications of, 
these principles and rules have been discussed from the 
teaching standpoint, it is believed that the adaptation 
necessary for presenting them to the pupils will not be 
difficult. 
PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF EFFECTIVE STUDY 
A. Preliminary steps. 
1. Locating the objective. Be sure before you start 
that you have a clear idea of the main thing you 
mean to accomplish. 
2. Planning the attack. Decide upon the kind of 
work needed in your preparation; that is, what 
information will have to be found, what facts,
-P-A-G-E-226
a 
| 208 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
if any, must be memorized, what practice will 
be required, and what problems will need to be 
solved. If the work is mostly of one kind, choose 
the set of rules in the following section which 
applies to it. 
B. Adapting methods to type of task. 
1. Memorizing. 
a. Understand the language. Get the thought 
of what you are learning and try to see 
why that language is appropriate for the 
thought. 
b. Associate the material with its use. Try to 
see the situation in which you will need to 
recall the language, and repeat it with this in 
mind. Also try to feel as you think the writer 
felt in using that language. 
Learn by wholes. Repeat the words in prac- 
tice straight through just as you expect to 
say them finally, not going over and over a c 
small portion at a time. 
. Drill and practice work. 
a. Be sure you know just what the form or pro- 
cess should be. Don’t take chances on repeat- 
ing something wrong. 
b. Be on guard against errors. Remember that 
one wrong practice cancels many right ones 
and doubles the work ahead of you. 
c. Distribute your time. After you have made 
a beginning, practice a little while at regular
-P-A-G-E-227
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 209 
times rather than tire yourself by too much 
at once. 
3. Collecting and organizing information. 
a. Decide upon the precise character and use 
of the information sought. Don’t read aim- 
lessly. 
b. Make a tentative classification. Choose 
headings under which to put the facts you 
are seeking. 
c. Keep a critical attitude. Make sure that you 
understand the reasons for statements, or 
that they rest on good authority. 
d. Take notes under the headings chosen. Use 
them as a guide to, and record of, your own 
investigations. Don’t copy in your notes. 
e. Make an outline of your final organization, 
showing your conclusions as to relative im- 
portance of facts found. Don’t hesitate to 
change your first classification if your infor- 
mation justifies doing so. 
f. Summarize your facts into a convenient 
synopsis for ready use when needed. Don’t 
make this longer than you can easily master. 
4. Solving problems. 
a. Select the vital point. Try to frame one or 
two questions, the answers to which would 
give you the solution. 
b. Collect the facts and principles that bear upon 
the question.  
-P-A-G-E-228
210 RAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
c. Reserve judgment while making a list of 
what seem probable answers. 
d. Try out each conclusion that occurs to you. 
See if other facts support it. 
e. Retest your final judgment by applying it to 
all the facts. Be sure it is right, and that you 
can prove it. 
C. General measures of economy and efficiency. 
- Make a “‘flying start.” Save your own time and 
energy by getting warmed up as soon as possible. 
Safe and easy progress really depends on quick, 
concentrated study. 
. Rely upon yourself. Don’t ask for help on the 
main points of your undertaking if it can be 
avoided. It is often better to leave a point un- 
settled for a while, if you can proceed on other 
parts unaided. 
. Use a time-card. Place an estimate on the time 
you expect to use for every activity of the day, 
and record your success in making it good. See 
how often you can beat your own record. 
. Have a regular time and place for study. Get 
used to the surroundings under which you study 
each subject, and don’t change them. Make 
habit help you. 
. Learn thoroughly the important things. You 
make a better showing with less effort by learn- 
ing a few things well than by stumbling over 
many. Facts left half-learned are unsafe and a 
waste of time. 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
EFFECTIVE METHODS OF STUDY 211 
6. Take enough time at the close of study to try 
out your preparation. Imagine the circum- 
stances under which you will need to use it, and 
see if it is sufficient. 
7. Make a personal list of studyrules. Choose afew 
which help you most in the ways you most need 
help. Don’t make the list too long at first, and 
use the rules till they become habit. 
8. Estimate quickly the value of a paragraph. If 
its opening sentences are important for your 
purpose, examine it all carefully. If they are 
not, pass quickly on to the next paragraph. 
9. Understand and use all the helps in your book, 
such as index, headings, and synopses. Get ac- 
quainted with the whole plan of it. If you don’t 
understand the use of some feature, find out 
about it; it may give you valuable help. 
QUESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. “While the technical facts and laws of psychol-

a majority of those who attend the elementary 
school, yet certain of the simpler facts which 
relate to the mental life should constitute a part

come to know some of the effects of mental 
habits. They can understand the origin and in-

study? Suggest ways in which such a pupil might 
be started toward improvement. 
It has been said that one important object in

this is the case, by taking as an illustration some

Whipple, in his booklet, How to Study Effec-

rules or maxims to follow in study. Among them 
are the following: 
Get rid of the idea that you are working for the 
teacher. 
Don’t apply for help until you have to. 
Don’t hesitate to mark up your own books to make 
the essential ideas stand out visibly. 
When the material to be learned by heart presents no 
obvious rational associations, it is perfectly legitimate 
to invent some artificial scheme for learning and 
recalling it,

  CHAPTER VII 
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 
What supervision of study means. During recent 
years the term “supervised study” has come into 
familiar use. It refers, in general, to the attempt, in 
some form or other, to systematize the conditions of 
study, and to give intelligent direction to the pupils’ 
efforts. The need which it tries to meet is twofold — 
the irregular and unsatisfactory results of home study, 
and the waste due to undirected study at school. In 
the former case, as most teachers have discovered, the 
pupils whose work most needs extra study do the 
least of it at home. The misuse of the study period at 
school has always been so prolific a source of disorder 
that many teachers have considered that problem the 
chief concern in supervising study. This misconcep- 
tion is criticized by Davis, in his The Work of the 
Teacher, as follows: 
Where the plan has been tried some teachers conceive 
their function to be monitorial — that of preserving disci- 
pline and keeping pupils at work. Necessary as these are, 
the teacher who finds time to knit, read extensively, or pre- 
pare a university extension lesson while supervising a class of 
studying pupils confesses by attitude a very inadequate con- 
ception of the work. 
In strict usage the term “supervised study” has 
signified that done under the immediate direction of
-P-A-G-E-235
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 217 
the same teacher who hears the recitation. This is by 
far the best arrangement, and should be provided for 
in programming if conditions will in any way permit. 
In many schools, however, where the departmental 
system prevails, this has not been deemed practicable. 
Ais a result it frequently happens that pupils from 
various classes study various lessons under the direc- 
tion of a single teacher. This situation is so often 
found, and suggestions for its improvement so often 
needed, that it has been considered in the following 
discussion along with the type of supervised study in 
which the teacher deals only with his own class. The 
attempt has accordingly been made to present sugges- 
tions applicable to either arrangement, and the term 
“supervision of study” has been used to denote the 
direction by a teacher of any study done outside the 
actual recitation period. 
Phases frequently neglected. An adequate concep- 
tion of the function of a teacher in charge of a study 
class must include alertness to the progress being 
made by the pupils. If a pupil is not studying, it is the 
business of the teacher to learn why he is not studying, 
as well as to see that he gets properly started again. 
And by this is not meant the usual admonition with 
its usual result of a more or less convincing imitation 
of study activity. The alertness should recognize 
which of the essential conditions of study is lacking, 
and utilize something besides disciplinary measures to 
supply the lack. To quote Davis again:
-P-A-G-E-236
  
218 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
The study supervision should usually find the pupil in 
need of help, and then render him the assistance needed 
rather than that asked. To do this requires not alone thor- 
ough acquaintance with every pupil, but a knowledge of 
mental laws as well. 
From the foregoing it may be inferred that the 
supervision of study carries many responsibilities not 
always fully recognized. By way of compensation it 
holds also for the real teacher unexpected opportuni- 
ties for achieving results of a most satisfying sort. 
Dangers of helping too much. The practice of giving 
too much help during the study period is even more 
objectionable than that of merely keeping order. It is 
during the study period, even more than in the recita- 
tion,that growth in independent self-direction should be 
stimulated. The pupil’s opportunities for achievement 
in this respect must not be taken from him by unneces- 
sary help. When a child in his study finds a wall which 
he cannot surmount, the teacher’s function is not to 
lift him over, or tear down the wall for him, but to 
show him how he may build his own ladder. The right 
kind of help leaves a pupil with a stronger sense of 
achievement and self-respect. It leaves him working 
harder than before, because more confidently and in- 
telligently. The best kind of help does not remove the 
difficulty, but adds another — a simpler one, which 
when surmounted puts the child in reach of the ob- 
jective he could not attain before. Any kind of help 
which does not make the pupil stronger and more self-
-P-A-G-E-237
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 219 
reliant in meeting equal difficulties later is generally 
worse than no help at all. 
1. The physical conditions of study 
Lighting. The first responsibility of a supervisor of 
study is to make sure that the environment is as favor- 
able as it can reasonably be made. Such a feature as 
the lighting of the study-room seems so simple and so 
obviously a matter for attention that it should be 
taken for granted. Yet it is by no means the rule to 
find study-rooms with the lighting as well regulated as 
the means provided will permit. The incoming light 
varies so much during any day that the only safe plan 
is for the teacher to pass about the room at the be- 
ginning of each study period and observe how the light 
falls upon eachrdesk. If there is an annoying glare, or 
an insufficiéncy of light, or vexing shadows, the prob- 
able result will be not only inferior study during that 
period, but a danger of permanent ill-effects also. The 
teacher who sits calmly at his desk, oblivious of his 
responsibility in this regard, merits a sharp reminder 
of his duty. 
Seating. Closely related to the matter of lighting 
is that of seating. This includes not merely some 
arrangement for discouraging social proclivities, the 
only phase considered in some study-rooms, but other 
matters of even greater importance. In the first place, 
the seating arrangement should be governed by the 
lighting conditions, and should allow no pupil to suffer
-P-A-G-E-238
  220 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
any bisianntd handicap in that particular, even though 
additional resourcefulness in discipline is called for in 
consequence. In the second place, the plan should 
provide every pupil with a working-desk and seat of 
the proper size and height. Scientific data on the in- 
jurious effects of ill-fitting desks show that careless- 
ness in this matter is nothing short of criminal. Even 
if this cogent reason did not exist, the advantage of 
having each pupil so seated that no physical discom- 
fort interferes with maximum effort is sufficient to 
repay the pains taken to secure it. 
Ventilation. The next important consideration is 
the matter of ventilation. Even where the heating 
and ventilating arrangement is automatic, there are 
numerous occasions when the personal attention of the 
teacher is necessary to see that the room has an ade- 
quate supply of fresh air. When the nostrils of the 
visitor are assailed by the unmistakable evidence of 
insufficient ventilation, he is not surprised to find the 
pupils restless or inattentive. To expect effective 
study under such conditions is so illogical that even 
mention of the matter would be an inexcusable prating 
of the obvious if experience did not disclose the all-too- 
frequent need of such reminder. 
There is probably no teacher to whose attention the 
importance of these and other related details of school- 
room hygiene has not been called. It is universally 
accepted, at least academically. But in practice the 
responsibility for poor study is so often traceable to
-P-A-G-E-239
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 221 
neglect in some of these particulars that no discussion 
of the duties involved in supervising study would be 
adequate without emphasizing the need of careful 
attention to environmental conditions. 
Individual handicaps or defects. In addition to 
giving attention to conditions that apply equally to 
all children, the supervisor should be alert for individ- 
ual handicaps. The most easily noted of these will be 
defective sight. The child who squints, frowns, holds 
his book too close, or otherwise gives evidence of dis- 
comfort or difficulty in reading should receive special 
attention. In a quiet way, without attracting unneces- 
sary attention or embarrassing the child, the teacher 
should try to discover the cause of the difficulty and 
whether anything has been done to correct it. A little 
common sense, supplemented by consulting a reliable 
source of information, will usually suggest the proper 
procedure. The inexcusable thing is to allow the 
handicap to continue uninvestigated, to the detriment 
of the child’s study and perhaps to the aggravation of 
the handicap, when a little help might result in decided 
improvement. 
Other defects should also receive consideration from 
the study supervisor. While partial deafness, speech 
difficulties, adenoids, and other matters affecting oral 
communication are usually more noticeable in the 
recitation than in the study period, even these have 
significance for the study supervisor, and may 
often be more profitably investigated and helped in
-P-A-G-E-240
  222 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
that connection than under the more conspicuous and 
embarrassing conditions of the recitation. The dom- 
inant characteristic in the supervisor’s attitude toward 
a pupil in the study-room should at all times be kindly, 
sympathetic interest. Especially must this be shown 
in dealing with the delicate matter of personal defects. 
It is better to avoid direct reference to them at all than 
to do so when there is any doubt in the pupil’s mind 
as to the motives or sympathy of the teacher. 
Minimizing distractions. Every teacher has some 
standard as to what constitutes permissible activities 
and counter-attractions in the study-room. These 
standards vary so widely that many points fall within 
the debatable territory. One objection to many of 
them is the fact that they are preconceived, and ap- 
plied without special consideration of the particular 
group of pupils concerned. The question as to what 
constitutes a distraction to study involves variable 
factors, depending upon the age of the pupils, the sub- 
ject of study, the time, and other conditions. The test 
as to whether anything is objectionable or not in the 
study-room is the effect upon the work of the children. 
It is much better for the teacher to be alert for deter- 
rent influences and to meet them as they appear than 
to rely on a cut-and-dried plan for conducting a study- 
room. As a matter of fact, it sometimes happens that 
the greatest distraction to real study is the teacher 
himself or herself, especially if the system used has 
been planned more with a view to appearances than to 
fulfilling the rea] functions of a study period.
-P-A-G-E-241
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 223 
If the teacher holds fast to the rule that all doubtful 
points are to be decided in the light of the effect upon 
that particular group of children, there are certain 
general principles which may be helpful as guides. In 
the first place, extreme quiet is not usually conducive 
to the best study. It regularly carries with it an at- 
mosphere of restraint and inhibition, which hinders 
full absorption in the work of study. The dropping of 
a book passes unnoticed amid the low buzz of normal 
study, but brings every one up with a start in an over- 
quiet room. Work is as contagious as idleness. The 
sight and sound of busy companions is an effective 
stimulant to any pupil to carry on in his study. On 
the other hand, no pupil should be unnecessarily noisy 
in study, especially if it disturbs his neighbors. Half- 
audible lip movements in study are of this type. The 
supervisor of the second grade in our training school is 
convinced that the elimination of lip-sounds increases 
the speed of silent reading very materially. Since the 
eye can move so much more rapidly than the lips, the 
habit of puffing and sibilating over every word is a 
heavy handicap to quick thought-getting as well as an 
annoyance to neighbors. Experience indicates that it 
can be eliminated with gain even in the second grade, 
and any indulgence in the practice beyond that grade 
should be discouraged unless a fair trial shows that it 
is really essential to the pupil’s study. 
It is neither possible nor desirable to lay down fixed 
rules regarding communication and movements of 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
  t 
224 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
pupils. In a comparatively small group some freedom 
in such matters is best. As the group becomes larger, 
the danger of abuse increases. It is wise to havea 
frank iyteement with the pupils, and have them assist 
in determining the restrictions necessary to the best 
work. If their codperation is thus enlisted, only a few 
simple restrictions are needed. 
2. Accessories to study 
Reference books and their use. One of the most 
frequent requests in the study-room is for needed in- 
formation. Consequently one of the first duties of the 
supervisor is directing pupils in finding out things for 
themselves. It may even develop that the recitation 
has not successfully completed its work of teaching 
the pupils how to find needed information in the text. 
More often, however, the study period will be the 
occasion of teaching how to supplement the text by the 
use of other sources. To be sure, it is easier and 
quicker to supply the information direct, and teachers 
sometimes excuse such help on the ground that it saves 
the pupil’s time for studying his “‘real Jesson.” Even 
granting the importance of the assigned work, the real 
question is whether learning how and where to find 
out for himself what he needs is not of so much more 
value to the pupil than the passive study of ready- 
prepared material as to give the former the right of 
way. 
In order to provide practice in the effective use of
-P-A-G-E-243
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 225 
reference books, the regular assignment should fre- 
quently include items requiring such supplementary 
investigation. Preliminary suggestions for the pupils’ 
guidance should be given in the assignment, leaving, 
however, some field for resourcefulness and the pleas- 
ure of discovery. The follow-up work during the study 
period can thus be centered on the pupils who most 
need further suggestions without spoiling the fun for 
those who can help themselves. 
Skillful use of the opportunities for stimulating 
individual investigation was made by a certain study 
supervisor in a junior high school. His work combined 
vocational guidance and supervision of the study-hall. 
Whenever a pupil had apparently finished his regular 
work, the supervisor made it a point to ask the pupil, 
as a personal favor, to find out certain industrial facts 
for use in the vocational study the supervisor was 
making. The particular topic was, of course, chosen 
with reference to the supervisor’s estimate of that 
pupil’s interests or aptitudes. Care had also been 
taken to procure from the central library the best 
available books for such use. The pupils found the 
doing of these little favors very interesting, and many 
of them voluntarily carried the investigations much 
farther. As a device for promoting vocational en-: 
lightenment it was unusually successful, and at the 
same time gave skill in independent investigation. The 
idea may be applied to almost every line of work, 
especially in connection with the volunteer phases of  
-P-A-G-E-244
  226 sepa FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
the elastic assignment, and its spirit is the ideal one to 
actuate practice in the proper use of supplementary 
sources in study. 
Ilustrative material. Mention has previously been 
made of the value of illustrative material for securing 
continued application to an undertaking. The extent 
to which such accessories contribute interest in under- 
taking a task, as well as safeguards to the attentive, 
persistent study necessary for successful completion, 
make them an invaluable adjunct. The best schools 
are now providing definite facilities and even special 
rooms for such activity in connection with study, des- 
ignating them by various names, from plain “work- 
room” to the impressive “‘ project laboratory.” 
The teacher who is not fortunate enough to havesuch 
special advantages for use with a study-class may still 
make profitable use of the principle. The study-room 
itself may and should be a workroom in a much more 
active sense than is the conventional one. At the very 
least there should be free use of the charts, globes, 
models, construction material, and collections. The 
spirit of the room should be that of a place for work — 
active, constructive work, instead of a place for pas- 
sivity and restraint. Such work frequently requires 
materials for manipulation and application, and full, 
normal study activity is often handicapped without 
them. There is, of course, a limit at which such acces- 
sories may become a distraction to other pupils, but a 
resourceful teacher can encourage much valuable use
-P-A-G-E-245
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 227 
of illustrative material without transgressing that 
limit. 
3. The spirit and tone of the study-room 
The working atmosphere. A boy who had been 
reported to a high-school principal for some prank in 
the study-hall was rather sharply taken to task in the 
office. His behavior was regularly good, and the prin- 
cipal expressed disappointment at conduct so silly and 
so unusual. He then asked the boy, “Why were you 
not studying, instead of planning such nonsense?” 
The reply was immediate; “Study? Nobody studies 
at that period.” The boy’s comment was perhaps an 
exaggerated characterization of a state of affairs due 
to a wrong spirit and atmosphere in the study-room. 
If there is a genuine working atmosphere, supervision 
is easy. Without it, discipline becomes a prominent 
and annoying problem. 
It has already been suggested that both work and 
idleness are contagious. Until one or the other be- 
comes habitual, for a certain group at a certain time 
and place, it is often a matter of priority in exposure 
that determines which shall be caught. An immediate 
and business-like beginning that suggests the impor- 
tance of making even the first minute count, will go 
far toward making such a tone habitual, and will 
furnish insurance against a counter-contagion. On the 
other hand, a dawdling and dallying start invites 
lengthening procrastination and idleness, until the
-P-A-G-E-246
  228 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
infection weakens even the good resolutions of reliable 
pupils. In setting this tone, the attitude of the super- 
visor is the most potent factor. If he presents the 
happy combination of an energetic, business-like at- 
titude with a genial manner, it is easy to set every- 
thing going at the first moment with the swing of 
cheerful, alert activity. The cultivation of this atti- 
tude and manner should be one of the first aims of a 
study supervisor. 
Attitude of pupils toward teacher. An excellent in- 
dex of the tone and spirit of the room is the attitude of 
the pupils toward the supervisor. If they regard him 
as a taskmaster or “overseer,” his opportunities for 
helping them toward real study are very slight. In 
fact, their tendency will be to regard themselves as 
working for the teacher instead of working for them- 
selves — an attitude fatal to independence in study. 
Pupils develop most in study under a supervisor 
whose leadership they fully accept and respect. They 
withhold this endorsement from a teacher who is either 
too exacting or too easy. In the former case the pupils 
resent the infringement upon their own initiative and 
individuality. On the other hand, they cannot respect 
one whose requirements fail to call forth their best 
efforts, and who weakens their respect by help too 
easily obtained. One feels admiration for the boy who 
was wrestling with a difficulty, but who scorned the 
suggestion that he ask his teacher because, as he said, 
“she always helps a fellow too much.” Most pupils,
-P-A-G-E-247
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 229 
unfortunately, do not cherish their self-reliance to this 
extent and willingly accept unnecessary help, but they 
realize instinctively that the procedure is unworthy of 
themselves and of the function expected of a teacher. 
Children accord their most genuine esteem to the 
teacher to whom they can take their difficulties con- 
fident of an appreciative appraisal and a just response. 
They are sure that if the difficulty is trivial, they will 
be made to see that fact without ridicule; if it is a real 
difficulty, they will be guided toward a point of attack 
where they may earn the satisfaction of a real achieve- 
ment, without a discouraging waste of their energies. 
Pupils who have such an attitude as this toward their 
study supervisor — adviser is perhaps a better term 
— reflect it in their attitude toward study and an ef- 
fort to keep the spirit of their work upon a worthy 
plane. 
Codperation in study. Reference has previously 
been made to published data showing the stimulating 
influence of associates upon the work done by any in- 
dividual. The modern tendency is to make a yet wider 
use of the social impulses in the matter of preparing 
lessons. It is probable that ways will be developed of 
making them extremely valuable allies to study. At 
any rate, the old idea of discouraging them as wholly 
subversive of proper study is no longer accepted. 
Strayer and Norsworthy criticize the usual custom in 
the following language: 
An over-emphasis upon marks and distinctions, and a lack  
-P-A-G-E-248
  230 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
of attention to the opportunities which the school offers for 
helpfulness and codperation, have often resulted in the devel- 
opment of an individualistic attitude almost entirely op- 
posed to the purpose or aim of education as we commonly 
accept it. 
The authors go on to comment on the odd fact that 
only in kindergarten and the seminar room for gradu- 
ate students is codperation on tasks encouraged, while 
in all the intervening grades “there is little or no op- 
portunity for communication or codperation,” and 
“helping one’s neighbors has often been declared 
against the rule by teachers.” 
There are two forms in which successful use is being 
made of the spirit of codperation in giving a whole- 
some tone to the study group. One is the extension of 
the characteristic activities of the socialized recitation 
into the study period. By this arrangement it is agreed 
in the recitation period what contribution is to be pre- 
pared by each pupil as his share of the group under- 
taking. During the study period, although each pupil 
has his individual task, the spirit of his work is essen- 
tially social and codperative. Brief conferences may 
be needed between pupils to preserve codrdination 
among various related parts. The result is a helpful 
stimulation to all concerned, and the spirit of the entire 
study group is almost always noticeably improved by 
the friendly interest which every pupil knows the 
others to feel in his doing his work well. 
The other form in which codperation is employed 
is in actual group work. While this is largely in the
-P-A-G-E-249
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 231 
experimental stage, it promises to bring about some 
radical revision in the accepted notions of appropriate 
activities in the study-room. Wherever there is special 
space available for group consultation without undue 
disturbance to others, it is immediately practicable 
and possesses unusual advantages, not the least of 
which is the fact that it is the normal way in which 
human beings outside of school codperate when they 
wish to learn new things. Work which involves prac- 
tice for skill, memorizing, or other activity directed 
toward individual attainments must necessarily be 
mastered by individual study. But such matters as 
organization of information or solving and verifying 
general problems are often most effectively and profit- 
ably handled in group study. This requires compar- 
atively small study classes in order to be practicable, 
which adds another argument against the wasteful 
custom of herding crowds of pupils into a so-called 
study-room. Most study-rooms, however, have facili- 
ties for some utilization and encouragement of the 
spirit of cojperation, and the resultant improvement 
in the tone of the room will justify a fair trial of it. 
4. Correlation between recitation and study supervision 
Special lessons for special difficulties. The most 
vital objection to the practice of having the study 
period supervised by some other than the recitation 
teacher is that there is ordinarily no system of definite 
codperation between the two. Perfect correlation  
-P-A-G-E-250
    
2382 =TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
between the activities of the study and recitation 
periods is possible, of course, only when they are under 
the same teacher. But even then the opportunity for 
diagnosing class difficulties which the recitation should 
cure is often overlooked. If a class seems to be having 
unusual difficulty with a lesson, it is the duty of the 
supervisor to discover what type of lesson it is, and the 
particular nature of the difficulty. If it is not that 
teacher’s own assignment, the facts discovered should 
be reported to the proper teacher so that special atten- 
tion in the recitation may be given to that need. In no 
other way can the work of the recitation be adequately 
adapted to helping pupils learn effective methods of 
study. A preliminary statement from the pupils as to 
how they expect to proceed, and a careful investiga- 
tion of results at the next recitation, will reveal to a 
certain extent the nature of the pupils’ difficulties, but 
experienced teachers know how easy it is to misinter- 
pret study activities by recitation evidence alone. 
It is only in the actual process of study that one can 
discover the use of clumsy, ineffective methods of 
attacking a plain assignment. A how-to-study lesson, 
as suggested in the preceding chapter, especially 
planned to meet the needs discovered, will effect a 
great saving in time. Moreover, the immediateness of 
application will make it much more permanently 
valuable than if it had not been aimed at the type of 
weakness of most direct concern. 
Follow-up work. A closely related phase of correlat-
-P-A-G-E-251
  
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 238 
ing the study and recitation is the practice of “‘follow- 
up” work: that is, the study period should not only 
be used to discover wherein special instruction on 
study methods is needed, but should serve the recipro- 
cal function of testing adequacy of such instruction 
and supplementing it in any necessary details. For 
example, a class has been taught how to collect and 
organize information, and has been assigned a topic 
upon which to employ the methods given. The super- 
visor, if not himself the teacher of the class, should 
know of the special lesson and assignment so as to be 
alert for evidence of misconception on the part of any 
pupil. A word or two of individual instruction, such as 
certain pupils seem always to need, will suffice to 
straighten out an error of application which otherwise 
would have been a permanent handicap. 
The ways mentioned are merely suggestive of the 
possibilities of correlating the work of the study and 
recitation periods. If the study work is supervised by 
the recitation teacher, it is possible, even while hear- 
ing another recitation, to observe details that will be 
extremely valuable for use in making the recitation 
more helpful. If circumstances make it necessary to 
have separate teachers, the situation is an unfortunate 
one, but there is no excuse for making it doubly so by 
the lack of a definite working plan of codperation be- 
tween the two instructors, or a shirking on either side 
of the joint responsibility. 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  284 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
5. Supervised study and the individual pupil 
Diagnosing difficulties. The first responsibility of the 
supervisor toward the individual pupil in difficulty is 
to determine the particular nature of that difficulty. 
There is no phase of teaching ability more rare than 
skill in this respect. The common error is in assuming 
that it is necessary only to see what the pupil should do 
and have him do it. Accordingly there is addressed to 
him a series of leading questions, such as, “Don’t you 
see this?” and, “Now, don’t you see that?” The pupil 
vaguely feels that it would be a confession of utter 
stupidity to answer in the negative, so he often gives 
assent when in truth he sees only baffling words and 
cryptic lines. The natural result of such treatment is 
the feeling on the part of the pupil that he should go 
ahead and do something, whether he understands it or 
not, with the hope of being able to conceal his con- 
tinued ignorance on that particular point. 
A real diagnosis of difficulties must begin by getting 
the pupil’s viewpoint. The first step is to determine 
just what line of attack the pupil is taking and why he 
has chosen it. The right way of doing the task is not 
nearly so important for the moment as discovering the 
pupil’s way of thinking, and where he left the right 
path. Until the exact point of confusion is discovered, 
any attempt to rush him ahead on the right process is 
likely not only to carry along the element of perplexity, 
but also to make its correction harder in the future,
-P-A-G-E-253
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 235 
Most difficulties have their origin in a misunderstood 
or inadequate assignment. If the trouble seems to be 
of that sort, the proper course is to have the pupil tell 
what was assigned. When he has been helped to a 
proper interpretation of the assignment, he is ready to 
decide on a method of attack appropriate to that type 
of task. The real obstacle, when located, is usually a 
small item, but the look of genuine relief on a pupil’s 
face when he once more sees his way clear is proof of 
its importance to him. It is difficult to use general 
rules in locating the difficulties of pupils, because they 
may appear in so many unexpected forms. The one 
thing that can be set down as indispensable is the 
ability to call forth frank expression from the pupil — 
a willingness on his part to let the supervisor know his 
blunders in their worst light. It hardly need be said 
that such frankness comes only from confidence that 
his mistakes will not be viewed with amusement, 
ridicule, reproach, or surprised superiority — with 
anything, in fact, except helpful sympathy. 
The ‘‘ounce of prevention.” In most study classes 
certain pupils seem to be clumsy in their methods of 
study, prone to become confused and discouraged in 
their undertakings. The danger is that the consequent 
lack of confidence may become fixed, or even amount 
to indifference. The pupil who regularly gets things 
wrong is tempted to conclude that it does not matter 
much what he tries first. With all pupils of habitual 
inefficiency in study the supervisor should apply the

“ounce of prevention” at the beginning of the study 
period. One teacher found practically her entire study 
group without confidence or system in their study. 
Accordingly she adopted this plan of advance pre- 
ventive measures. At the beginning of the study period 
she said: “Let us first decide exactly what we expect 
to accomplish in this period. Raise your hand as soon 
as you decide this, and do not begin study until you 
have settled it.” A look of interest was at once appar- 
ent at this novel procedure. When it was done, and 
tested in two or three cases, she said: “Now make a 
list of the three most important things to be done in 
your study, and decide how you will know when each 
one is satisfactorily prepared. As soon as you have 
decided this, raise your hand to let me know, and then 
begin your study.” Those who were late in raising 
their hands were, of course, given special attention, 
and the attempt was made to have every pupil know 
by items his plan of study before he started. 
Most supervisors will find a relatively small number 
of pupils in special need of formally taking such ad- 
vance steps. As soon as these are led merely to make 
a list of definite things which they are to do in definite 
order, the improvement is usually marked, because 
their seabihe is most often due to regarding the de- 
tails as a tangled mass and so floundering about with- 
out getting a firm grip upon any segregated point. 
The few who still need suggestions on advance plan- 
ning are jee? problems for special treatment in

the recitation period, followed by correlated supervi- 
sion. 
Recognizing relative maturity. In all phases of 
supervised study the maturity of the pupils should, of 
course, receive due consideration. No sensible person 
would expect much capacity for self-direction among 
very small children. Growth in this capacity should 
be steady as pupils advance through the grades, but 
this latter fact is ignored in some study-rooms. As a 
result an examination of the standards in this respect 
to be observed in different intermediate schools re- 
veals a wide variation. No one relishes being treated 
as more childish than he really is, and the supervisor 
who holds to primary standards with older pupils can 
never secure genuine codperation. On the other hand, 
if a pupil feels that his ability to carry responsibility 
is fully appreciated, he responds accordingly. This 
should not be understood as favoring loose 1equire- 
ments — that is perhaps worse than autocratic insist- 
ence on proper ones. The pupil should be allowed to 
feel that he may earn the privilege of undertaking 
some phases of self-direction, and that the retention 
of that privilege is dependent on his worthy use of it. 
There is nothing in a teacher’s attitude to which pupils 
respond with more appreciation than a full recognition 
of their stage of maturity, and nothing which they 
resent so keenly as its absence. As a basis for a whole- 
some spirit in the room, and for the codperative effort 
necessary to growth in self-direction, this appreciative 
response from the pupils is almost indispensable.
-P-A-G-E-256

‘‘Speeding-up” study. The value of alert, aggres- 
sive study has been so often emphasized in earlier sec- 
tions of this book that mention of it here hardly seems 
necessary. But a dragging, dawdling, time-killing 
pace is such a besetting sin of the study period that 
the supervisor needs to be on constant guard against 
its influence. It is a strange and unfortunate fact that 
many ae aggravate this habit by their well- 
intentioned attempts to discourage it: that is, when a 
pupil is idle, it seems the proper thing to remind him 
that he should get to work. But a frequent result of 
this is that he develops a sort of hybrid activity, just 
far enough removed from idleness to escape reprimand 
as such, but wholly unworthy of being called study. 
Many pupils can thus make a simple assignment, 
which ead be finished in a few minutes, serve for a 
whole period as a cloak for pernicious loitering. The 
resultant preparation is practically worthless, but 
they possess an incontestable defense in the matter of 
time spent, and, in fact, they often think they have 
really been studying. 
The only effective method of speeding-up study 
activity is through positive rather than negative in- 
centives. The assignment and time-card can assist by 
having pupils set the number of minutes within which 
they expect to finish each item assigned. With older 
pupils convincing experiments can be used to show the 
greater results in proportion to the effort when advan- 
tage is taken of momentum and the incisive power of 
 
-P-A-G-E-257
  
“THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 289 
concentration. If provision has been made whereby 
the pupils are able to test the completeness of their 
preparation, a reward may be given for intensive study 
by some freedom of choice as to further employment, 
preferably in connection with making the assignment 
itself, although it may be provided in the study period 
if the situation justifies it. 
Helping pupils test their preparation. Although 
responsibility for preparing pupils to test the adequacy 
of their own preparation belongs to the recitation and 
assignment, as discussed in Chapter II, the immediate 
need for applying such tests is so often apparent in the 
study period that the supervisor cannot ignore it. A 
familiar figure in the study-room is the pupil who has 
stopped work and whose reply, when asked about his 
study, is, “I think I have my lesson.” On a par with 
this pupil, who gives himself the benefit of the doubt, 
is the conscientious one who, in equal uncertainty as 
to the completion of his preparation, continues to fuss 
over the work from a sense of duty. Both need to know 
how to test their preparation, and the duty thus falls 
to the study supervisor, either as follow-up work from 
the recitation or as a direct measure to meet an obvious 
need. Suggestions for doing this will be found in the 
preceding chapter. 
Self-engineering in study as the goal of supervision. 
The term “self-engineering’’ has previously been 
used in reference to the pupil’s activity in testing 
methods of study and adopting for permanent use 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  
240 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
those which he finds most helpful. In a somewhat 
broader sense the term very aptly designates what 
should bal the goal in the supervision of study. It 
implies, first of all, that the pupil should be led to dis- 
cover his own strong points and weak points in study. 
On the basis of this knowledge he chooses a method of 
attack that will stress the needed points, just as the 
engineer reénforces the places of critical importance. 
The first stage of this process seems to present little 
difficulty to most pupils, as they are usually quite 
ready to declare what things are easy for them and 
what are uncomfortably hard. In games and in various 
forms of physical activity children are not only aware, 
as a rule, of their shortcomings, but usually take means 
of atoning for them by some protective trick. Self- 
engineering would carry this principle into their study. 
Put in the pupil’s own phraseology, he would not only 
realize where he was most likely to fall down, but 
would also plan how to guard against the repetition of 
that mistake. 
Ultimately, of course, this goal must include the 
setting of his own task by the student. The value of 
acquiring proficiency in this as an adjunct to wise 
citizenship, and the corresponding importance of hay- 
ing pupils take an increasing share of responsibility for 
directing their own investigations, has already been 
touched upon. Independence in thought must charac- 
terize the trustworthy citizen, and its encouragement 
linked with self-restraint belongs among the important 
aims in the supervision of study.
-P-A-G-E-259
  
THE SUPERVISION OF STUDY 2A 
A third important phase in which self-engineering 
should appear is proficiency in judging accurately of 
one’s own results. ‘The pupil should not only be able 
to set his own objective and plan a safe campaign for 
reaching it, but he should be able to satisfy himself 
with regard to the success or failure of his efforts. Of 
the three, the last is probably the most vital of all the 
elements in self-directed study. All three, however, 
stand out as the dominant aims which should guide 
the organization and technique of the supervision of 
study. If these are successfully accomplished, the 
result may fairly be characterized as the attainment of 
the goal of supervised study. 
Chapter summary. The supervision of study in- 
cludes those features of organization or study-room 
management which aim to systematize the conditions 
of study and give intelligent direction to the pupils’ 
efforts.\ This can be done far more effectively by the 
same teacher who conducts the recitation, but, where 
conditions still prevent such an arrangement, valuable 
supervision can be given by any study-room teacher, 
It requires alertness to the pupils’ difficulties and in- 
volves responsibility both for discovering the causes 
of these and for helping the pupils find ways of over- 
coming them. /The supervisor should be on guard 
against giving the wrong kind of help. The best kind 
is that which influences the pupil to work harder and 
more intelligently, and leaves him stronger and more 
confident for the next task. |
-P-A-G-E-260
  
242 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
The first responsibility in supervision is for making 
___-the physical conditions as favorable as possible for the 
best work by every pupil. | This includes attention to 
lighting, seating, and ventilation; tactful consideration 
of individual defects or handicaps; and the minimizing 
of distractions that interfere with proper study. The 
accessories to study, such as reference books and illus- 
trative material, should be properly arranged, and the 
pupils guided in the use of them. 
. (The spirit and tone of the study-room are of vita 
importance. Every care should be taken to secure a 
codperative response from the pupils toward the 
_teacher in charge. | This spirit of codperation should 
extend to the attitude of the pupils toward the work of 
each other, so that mutual interests may be utilized as 
far as practicable. The correlation between the study 
and recitation work should be close and intelligent at 
all times; the recitation teacher should have full in- 
formation as to study-room weaknesses so that special 
lessons may be given to correct them, and these lessons 
in turn are to be followed up by supplementary help in 
the study period. 
‘he greater share of the supervisor’s time will be 
_given to individual cases. Difficulties should be care- 
fully analyzed. Pupils with any habitual weakness 
should be fortified in advance against recurrence of 
errors. The relative maturity of children should be 
recognized, and constantly increasing responsibility 
offered. Pupils should be helped toward vigorous,

intensive study, and shown how to test and make cer- 
tain their preparation. | At all times the aim and goal _ 
of supervision should be the development of ability 
to engage in independent, self-directed effort — the 
encouragement of self-engineering in study. 
QUESTIONS FOR STUDY 
1. How may a study supervisor help a pupil over a 
difficulty and at the same time increase the lat- 
ter’s independence? 
2. Suggest ways in which small numbers of pupils 
may do group study to advantage. What are the 
advantages in such study? 
3. A study supervisor noticed that a certain pupil 
regularly began work in an apparently satisfac- 
tory manner, but after a few minutes would usu- 
ally stop studying and begin gazing about. Al- 
though this boy was not inclined to be disorderly 
at such times, he was an appreciative spectator 
whenever a disturbance was visible. Tell what 
steps you think should be taken in an attempt to 
discover and correct the causes of this pupil’s 
ineffective study. 
4, What are the advantages in having the study in 
any subject supervised by the same teacher who 
conducts the recitation, over (a) study super- 
vised by another teacher; (b) home study. 
5. If a teacher supervising a study class observes 
that a pupil is not studying, what objections are
-P-A-G-E-262
  
A4 TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
there to following the usual custom of reminding 
him that he should get to work? 
. Give an example from your own experience or 
observation to show the ill effects of furnishing 
too much help to pupils in their study. Can you 
suggest a better way in which the same situation 
might have been handled? 
. “Guided at first by the teacher, and gradually 
more and more by their own developing experi- 
ence, the pupils must learn to judge of the value 
of their own work, their own recitations, their 
own theories. To be helpful in this respect, the 
teacher must be on such terms with his pupils 
that his presence does not stand in the way of free 
mental activity. A teacher who frightens his 
class, or who is over-serious, or who is sarcastic, 
will not be able to make much progress in train- 
ing pupils to study, since his attitude retards 
rather than accelerates thinking on the part of 
the class.” — Earhart, Training Children to 
Study, p. 143. 
Show how the above has especial application 
to the study-room supervisor. Mention other 
characteristics which might prevent a teacher 
from securing the best response from pupils dur- 
ing the study period. 
. Outline a plan of codperation between teacher 
and supervisor, with suggested “follow-up” 
work, to help a pupil who is discouraged and 
gives up too easily in his arithmetic study.

Name at least four of the most common kinds of 
distraction occurring in the average study-room, 
and suggest ways of obviating each. 
Make a list of all the reasons which you consider 
legitimate ones for allowing pupils to change 
seats during a study period, and give the condi- 
tions that would justify each. 
It has been urged that the study-room “‘should 
be essentially a laboratory.” In what sense 
would you accept this statement, and to what ex- 
tent do you consider the laboratory spirit desir- 
able in the study-room? 
If pupils have no questions to ask the study 
supervisor, what objection is there to the latter’s 
marking papers or preparing work of his own 
during a study period? 
A very frequent cause of half-hearted study is the 
idea on the part of the pupil that he is “working 
for the teacher.” What can the study supervisor 
do to correct this? If, in your opinion, it calls for 
codperation with the recitation teacher, suggest 
a plan for such codperation. 
Describe, as you would to pupils, the amount of 
self-direction in study that may reasonably be 
expected by the time the elementary grades are 
completed. Explain what means you would use 
to induce them to set such a standard for them- 
selves. 
Make a list of all the accessories and study-helps  
-P-A-G-E-264

  TRAINING FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY 
which you think any study-room for upper-grade 
pupils should contain, telling what use the chil- 
dren of any particular grade should be able to 
make of each. 
Exercise 7 called attention to conduct and char- 
acteristics to be avoided in a study supervisor. 
Conversely, there are certain positive qualities 
which should be cultivated by every such teacher. 
Make a list of such qualities, explaining the in- 
fluence of each upon the working response of the 
pupils. 
Tell which of the characteristics named above 
would most influence the diffident pupil who 
cannot or does not readily reveal his difficulties 
in study. Suggest ways of drawing out such a 
pupil and helping him to overcome his diffidence. 
Name four or five inducements or incentives that 
you consider legitimate for speeding-up the rate 
of study. What checks would you use with these 
to prevent the quality of work from deteriorat- 
ing?

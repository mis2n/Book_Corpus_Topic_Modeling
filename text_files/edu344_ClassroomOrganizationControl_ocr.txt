EDITOR’S IN’ =ODUCTION 
Tue plan followed in the dev.\.pment of the present ad- 
dition to this series of textbooks is so well stated by the 
author in his Preface as to call for but little in addition 
from the editor of the series. That the author has worked 
out quite successfully the plan he has followed, and has 
produced a stimulating and a useful book, will doubtless be 
proved by its future use as a textbook for teachers in train- 
ing, and as a reading circle book for teachers in service. 
While not neglecting the psychological aspects of the 
problems of school management, the author has placed 
special emphasis on classroom organization and control as 
a social problem of large potential importance. Regarding 
the school as a great social instrument, education as a pro- 
cess of social adjustment, and school management as a con- 
structive social undertaking to the details of which the most 
careful thought should be given, he has stressed the impor- 
tance of the teacher conceiving clearly the important social 
purpose of the educative process, of making definite plans 
for classroom organization and control in the light of well- 
established social aims and demands, and of knowing how to 
determine the effectiveness of her labors in standard social 
as well as psychological terms. The volume is essentially a 
treatment of the old and ever-present problem of school 
management from the point of view of modern sociology, 
rather than from the psychological angle. While containing 
numerous practical hints and suggestions for the manage- 
ment of the details and the orderly conduct of classroom 
procedure, these, too, are stated in terms of a great under- 
lying social purpose rather than as devices of the do or 
don’t variety.

vi EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
  The prospective teacher who studies this volume care- 
fully while in training, and tries to answer the thought- 
provoking questions found at the close of each chapter, can 
hardly fail to go to the work of the classroom possessed of 
an important and highly useful insight into the deeper social 
values of good classroom organization and control. Teachers 
in service also, especially such as have but recently entered 
the service, should find the book equally helpful for profes- 
sional study, because its practical suggestions and important 
social point of view can be appreciated even better in the 
light of some classroom experience. 
Part IV is a very desirable addition to the usual volume on 
this subject. The chapter on “The Teacher’s Personality” 
is an excellent statement, and one which any teacher could 
read and re-read with continual profit to herself and her 
school. The next chapter sets forth an excellent program for 
personal development and professional progress. The im- 
portance to the teacher of health is emphasized in another 
well-written chapter; and finally, the teacher is told how 
she may measure her social usefulness and how she may set 
herself right in her personal, official, and community rela- 
tions. 
It is a pleasure to introduce, to the educational public 
and to the many new teachers this book will reach, so help- 
ful and so stimulating a volume by a former pupil and a 
present colleague.

  NOTE TO REVISED AND ENLARGED 
EDITION 
During the nine years since this book first appeared the 
general philosophy of education which it had attempted to 
interpret for use in the classroom has changed but little. 
The implications of this philosophy for practice have been 
greatly clarified, however, and much more generally ac- 
cepted. This tendency has been furthered to a large ex- 
tent by the application of scientific method to the study of 
education. The survey movement, which began only two 
decades ago, seemed to open wide the door that had been so 
nearly closed between the science and practice of education, 
with the result that both have greatly profited. 
For the schools the past decade has been an important 
period. Investigation and experiment applied to curriculum 
construction, to the work of supervision, to the field of tests 
and measurements, to textbook-making, and to schoolhouse 
construction have shown outstanding achievements. The 
implications of these attainments for the work of the teacher 
are large and important, as also are the many studies that 
have dealt more directly with the field of method and man- 
agement. Meantime, too, teacher-training courses in our 
universities, colleges, and normal schools have raised the 
standards of their work. Together, these facts have seemed 
to the author ample justification for the present revision 
and material enlargement of this book. 
In making the revision several of the chapters have been 
extended and in some cases largely rewritten, a new chapter 
on the teacher and supervision has been included, a collec- 
tion of practical problems has been appended to the different
-P-A-G-E-6
  viii NOTE TO REVISED AND ENLARGED EDITION 
chapters, while throughout the book much new concrete 
material has been added. An increased emphasis has been 
given, too, to the teacher’s contact with the work of the 
principal and the supervisor, an emphasis which is believed 
to be in line with the general tendency to enlarge the re- 
sponsibilities and so to increase the dignity of the position 
of the classroom teacher. 
It is a pleasure to acknowledge here the many helpful 
suggestions the author has received through the letters and 
comments of interested readers.

  PREFACE 
Tur management of a school is a many-sided problem, 
lying, roughly speaking, between the intimate details of 
teaching method at the one extreme, and the coarser ad- 
justments of administration and supervision at the other. 
As the term implies, the task is essentially an executive 
one — the manager, that is, the teacher or the principal, 
being a director of the activities of children in their pursuit 
of an education. 
The functions of this teacher executive are not only to 
direct; she must also formulate much of the policy she is to 
execute. To do this she must have some knowledge of the 
essential working principles upon which organization and 
management rest. These principles have been set forth in 
this book, not so much as a theoretical treatise, but rather 
by showing, as concretely as possible, how such principles 
are to operate among the plain practical facts which are to 
be dealt with in actual school situations. 
It is assumed that in managing a school the first step is 
a clear aim; the second, carefully formulated plans; the 
third, execution; the fourth, evaluation of results. Thus, by 
implication, it is demanded of school managers that they 
shall take a critical attitude toward their work, and dismiss 
the idea that experience is all that counts in preparation. 
The book is divided into four parts. In Part I the pro- 
blem of school management is set forth. The broad social 
aim and character of education and of the school as an insti- 
tution are emphasized, and the essential relationship be- 
tween a clear aim and any trustworthy plan of action is ex- 
plained — all these in their relation to the two large sets 
of factors, natural and environmental, in respect to which 
management is to be effected.
-P-A-G-E-8
  x PREFACE 
In Part II the discussion centers about the pupil as the 
object of management, showing how the school is to help 
the child to develop a real sense of membership in the 
group. This brings up questions of attendance, order and 
discipline, punishments, and incentives, with constant em- 
phasis upon what the school can do for the individual child. 
Part III describes the machinery necessary for managing 
children in groups, and explains the process by which such 
means may be made effective in achieving the principal 
educational aims. The organization of children, of subject- 
matter, of the day’s work, of the physical features of the 
school; the directing of study, recitation, and recreation; 
and, finally, the ways and means for measuring results 
achieved, are dealt with here, not as isolated structural 
parts, but as dynamic features of institutional life. 
Part IV undertakes to sketch out and to point the way 
toward the attainment of a set of standards in personality, 
professional development, health, and methods of work 
for the teacher as the instrument by means of which society 
hopes to attain its educational aims. 
The book is designed as a text for college and normal- 
school students and for teachers in service. It has avoided 
over-technical treatment, but wherever recent scientific 
studies have made it possible to substitute fact for opin- 
ion, these studies have been liberally drawn upon. The 
purpose has been to prepare a readable book which may 
help toward placing the management of our schools upon 
a more scientific basis. 
The author is substantially indebted to the editor of this 
series both for important suggestions and for continuous 
encouragement, and to Professor C. E. Rugh, of the Uni- 
versity of California, for the privilege of reading several ex- 
cellent unpublished manuscripts bearing on certain phases 
of the subject-matter of this volume.

THE MEANING AND AIM OF EDUCATION 
Ovuriine or CHAPTER 
1, Education as the free expression of native impulse: Education essential to life — The necessity for personal adjustment — Ideas and actions essentially related. 2. Education as inhibition in terms of social demand: Education not wholly individualistic — Learning to meet social demands — Natural versus artificial education. 8, The general aim of the school: No opposition between social and individualistic bases of aim — General aim from child’s point of view — General aim from society’s view- point — Need for specific statement of aims. 4. The more specific aims of the school: (a) Health and physical vigor as an aim — (b) Morality as an aim — (c) Knowledge as an aim — Knowledge useful for action — (4) The vocational or utilitarian aim — Right and wrong interpretations of this aim — making this aim effective — (e) The esthetic aim — (f) Other aims. 5, Summary — Questions — Problems — References. 
1. Education as the free expression of native impulse 
No one is in greater need of a clear conception of what educa- 
tion means than is the classroom teacher. The one who is 
to direct the child in the long program of becoming a man 
or woman must have some notion of what that program in- 
volves. It is not enough merely to learn a verbal definition 
of education, such as Plato, or Milton, or Herbert Spencer 
wrote, and then go on in the traditional way, “hearing reci- 
tations.” Education will mean “life,” or “preparation for 
life,” or “development,” or “growth,” or “adjustment,” or 
“change,” in a real and vital sense, only when the teacher 
manages the school in those terms. 
Education essential to life. We are too often prone to 
forget that whatever produces change or growth in the child 
is in that sense educating him, and that at most the school 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  4 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
plays but a small part in the sum total of a child’s training. 
However, the fact that most of our education is obtained 
in a way purely incidental to ordinary life procedure only 
lays a heavier responsibility upon the school for making the 
most of that small amount of time which is devoted spe- 
cifically to school work. If the school is to live up to this 
responsibility, it must give the child no false directions. 
Less than two centuries ago Rousseau saw that learning 
was essential to living, and suggested what has been more 
clearly stated since, namely, that the very same laws which 
underlie the processes of ordinary life activities are the 
fundamental laws of learning in the school. This seems 
obvious enough when stated, but, lest we might commit it 
to memory as one more interesting pedagogical axiom to be 
remembered, but not applied in managing a school, let us 
examine the suggestion more closely. 
The necessity for personal adjustment. First of all, when 
the child finds himself in a new situation in the nursery 
among his toys, on the lawn with his dog, or in a quarrel 
with another child, learning is essential if he is to succeed in 
making the adjustment which he desires to make. Since 
all of life is new to the child at first — all people, all places, 
all things, all his own movements even — it follows that 
necessity for learning confronts him at every turn. And 
this idea of necessity, as a feature of the learning situation 
outside of school, is too frequently overlooked when we 
enter the classroom, where we too often attempt to manage 
children in terms of adult notions. The numberless move- 
ments of the child — his looking, his listening, his turning, 
his touching everything — are necessary parts of the con- 
tinuous process of making himself comfortable in the midst 
of many strange situations. The school should not attempt 
to put an end to this ceaseless wiggling, for it is thus, bit by 
bit, that the child constructs the world he will live in as an
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE MEANING AND AIM OF EDUCATION 5 
adult and through which he will become aware of his own 
impulses, interests, and powers. 
The school must help the child to create new needs for 
himself, of course, but it must take care not to confuse 
things really needed with things imposed from without. 
Ideas and actions essentially related. Again, if we watch 
the child as he is learning in his big free world out of doors, 
as when he is shouting from the top of a tree, or bending 
over a puddle trying to capture a polliwog, or taking to his 
new toboggan for his first slide down the snowy hillside, 
we note a peculiar eagerness in his tones and movements 
which tells, not only that he is swinging forward to meet 
these adjustments with a will, but that all the vigor of his 
will is accompanied by a feeling of exhilaration and of joy 
in the doing and shouting. It is no set task, or master from 
without, but the feeling of mastery within that drives him 
to achievement after achievement. 
With him there are no ideas without actions to carry them 
out, no mere listening or learning about things, but in this 
real world of his all learning is accompanied by doing. 
Various psychological terms come to mind here, such as 
interest, feeling, and will, but we need not pause for such an 
analysis of the process of learning. Our interest is rather to 
describe what a few simple observations may bring to light 
as we examine the process under natural, as opposed to arti- 
ficial, circumstances, to sketch a true picture of that process 
as it is taking place according to nature. 
2. Education as inhibition in terms of social demand 
Education not wholly individualistic. But this is the 
meaning of education as it pleases the child to educate him- 
self, and not as it may please others to have him educated. 
And yet the school we are to manage is not a school of 
Robinson Crusoes, but a school in a democratic State.
-P-A-G-E-18
  6 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
Wherever we find a child — on the street, on the play- 
ground, at the market-place, in the bank, or church, or 
dining-car — he is forever inhibiting his own first impulses 
in order to meet the likes, or maybe the commands, of 
others. Obedience is the word, so important in the proper 
exercise of our rights and duties in a social world. 
Education, then, has a broader meaning than we have 
outlined above. It is not a mere matter of following one’s 
own interest or enthusiasm. It is not so individualistic as 
that. In the same sense that a child feels impelled to climb 
the highest tree, he may also feel impelled to restrain him- 
self where his companion’s rights or wishes are involved. 
But this restraint is a different kind of experience, and will 
often be exercised with reluctance rather than with pleasure. 
Yet obedience to the will or the wishes of others is essential 
in a social life, where codperation is the basis of unity, so we 
are also concerned with the meaning of this kind of learning 
as we see it in process outside of the school, and ask: How 
does the child learn the sort of obedience or codperation or 
inhibition which the social world will demand of him? 
Learning to meet social demands. A child’s first im- 
pulse is likely to be to refuse to share his sled with his play- 
mate, whereupon he shortly finds himself playing quite 
alone. Upon the playground he insists that the game shall 
be tag and not ball. Soon the game of ball is in full swing, 
and while he stands pouting he is embarrassed with ques- 
tions as to whether he has been hurt. He takes his own 
time crossing a busy street and is shocked when the police- 
man suddenly pulls him from in front of a passing vehicle. 
At a public gathering he talks in a hoarse whisper and sud- 
denly finds himself being stared at. Thus it is that the 
world teaches him to obey the laws of common social usage. 
It is not a mere case of being suppressed, but a case of mak- 
ing an adjustment where others besides himself are con-  
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE MEANING AND AIM OF EDUCATION a 
cerned. The boy shares his sled with the other children 
rather than suffer that feeling of loneliness. He enters the 
game selected by other children, he moves rapidly and at- 
tentively in crossing the busy street, and ceases to whisper 
in the public assembly, all because he desires the social sanc- 
tion of his acts. That is, he has been changed from a mere 
individual to a social person. 
But learning to restrain our impulses is not always a dis- 
agreeable experience. Our contact with others is not al- 
waysaclash. The most delightful team work the child does 
on the playground involves a continuous process of in- 
hibiting his own impulses. It is a matter of obedience to 
the rules of the game; not obedience which suppresses, but 
obedience which directs and gives meaning to the activity. 
Natural versus artificial education. Education, then, is 
doing, acting out one’s own or another’s will, experiencing, 
adjusting one’s self to real situations, conforming or coép- 
erating here, resisting or striking out alone there, always 
answering to the call of necessity with ideas, but with ideas 
put into immediate execution. It is this latter point which 
seems to contrast the meaning of education as nature pro- 
vides it with that we see in the formal, isolated, informational 
education which we too often find in the school. It is not 
merely to contrast the ideal with the real and practical 
meaning of education, but rather to force upon us the simple 
fact that education is merely the natural process of making 
needed adjustments to our social, physical, zesthetic, moral, 
and intellectual environment, and that the world regards 
that man as educated who makes those adjustments ac- 
curately, speedily, and sympathetically. Education must 
therefore mean not merely growth, or adjustment, but 
growth or adjustment with respect to a wide variety of social 
as well as physical situations to be faced in the world in 
which the child lives, and with respect to situations which 
are his very own.

3. The general aim of the school 
No opposition between social and individualistic bases of 
aim. What, then, should be the aim of the school? Obvi- 
ously it should be to facilitate the processes of growth 
described above. These are extremely broad in their scope 
and significance, including as they do the physical, the in- 
tellectual, the ssthetic, the moral, the economic, and the 
social, and involving modes of activity peculiar to each of 
these types of experience. 
Our aim, then, must be cognizant not only of the needs of 
the individual, but likewise of the needs of society. Nor 
should we assume that these are at cross-purposes with each 
other. No child is going to live outside of society, and since 
he is what he is because of the life his own and thousands — 
of generations before him have lived, it is futile to argue that 
the social and individual instincts and impulses are at war 
with each other. It has been well said that “the individual’s 
normal growth lands him in essential solidarity with his 
fellows, and that through the performance of his social 
duties and privileges the individual advances to his high- 
est and purest individuality.” 1 
The biological basis which educators have to offer for 
such a statement lies in the social as well as the personal 
nature of that equipment with which we are born, and which 
we therefore do not have to get by education. On the 
personal side, the child does not have to learn to cry, to 
wink, to take food, to shrink from a blow or a ferocious- 
looking animal; he does not have to learn how to feel hun- 
ger, fear, and wonder. On the social side he does not have 
to learn to imitate others, to enjoy group life, to feel bash- 
fulness, sympathy, and shame. ‘True, as he grows he will 
consciously inhibit and modify these native tendencies to 
1See Baldwin, J. Mark. The Individual and Society. (The Gorham 
Press, Boston, 1911.)
-P-A-G-E-21
  THE MEANING AND AIM OF EDUCATION 9 
act, but they are there, as original equipment, and quite as 
many seem designed to serve a social as a purely indi- 
vidualistic end. 
General aim from child’s point of view. In spite of this | 
substantial unity of social and personal elements in the 
child’s nature, however, there is still the practical possi- 
bility that the strong-willed individual may dominate the 
group to the extent of subordinating society to his own self- 
ish ends. Also the reverse of this may happen, in which 
the child’s individuality is suppressed by the demands of 
society, and so is permitted to play but a small part in his 
social functioning. Either extreme is undesirable. To di- 
rect the child in discovering the proper balance and _re- 
lationship between these two sets of interests would seem 
to be the general aim of the school, so far as the individual_{ 
child is concerned. 
General aim from society’s viewpoint. Wherever society 
is highly organized, it must, like the individual, become self- 
conscious, and for the sake of its own preservation, comfort, 
and progress must direct its energies with a clear purpose 
toward these ends. The school has arisen as an institution 
to serve this very function, and if this fundamental meaning 
of the school were more fully realized by the teacher, then 
this social responsibility or aim of education would express 
itself more fully in the organization, management, and in- 
struction of the school. 
“ Concretely, this means that the school is not only to give 
direction to free individual expression, but also to bring 
this free individual to a consciousness of his appropriate and 
rightful privileges and responsibilities as a member of society. 
It will acquaint him not only with the form of our govern- 
ment, but with the meaning of citizenship. It will teach 
him not merely to respect authority, but to feel a sense of 
loyalty to the principles which that authority is designed  
-P-A-G-E-22
  10 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
to protect. In other words, it will so shape its organization 
and instruction as to give the child a fund of knowledge and 
experience which will help him to discover both the oppor- 
tunities and the limitations within which he may hope to 
find his highest individual freedom. This defines the general 
aim of the school from. the standpoint of society. 
Need for specific statement of aims. This general state- 
ment of aim should afford the teacher a point of view from 
which to approach the task of managing a school, and an 
ideal to direct and inspire her in her work. For the more 
intimate guides to action, however, it is necessary to con- 
sider aims which are more immediate. The owner of a fac- 
tory not only sets up business success as his ultimate aim, 
but various aspects of this larger purpose — the purchase 
of raw materials at the lowest price, the most economical 
organization of his plant, the simplest and clearest method 
of accounting, a knowledge of markets — present themselves 
as clear and definite problems, or aims, through which alone 
the ultimate goal of business success can be attained. 
So in education, that aim which looks for a perfect ad- 
justment of the individual to society must be made defi- 
nite and concrete for immediate and practical use in the 
classroom. If children are to become socially efficient in 
the sense of being capable of rendering the greatest possible 
contribution to humanity, as well as to have capacity for 
enjoying to the fullest the richest gifts of others, we must 
train and educate them physically, economically, intellectually, 
morally, and esthetically. Each of these interests then be- 
comes a definite problem in education, so that when we say 
the school is aiming at physical training, the task becomes 
much narrower than when we make the aim social adjust- 
ment or efficiency. 
An examination of each of these narrower aims should 
therefore help to make clear the more specific terms in
-P-A-G-E-23
  
  THE MEANING AND AIM OF EDUCATION il 
which the school is to be managed. It is not to be assumed, 
however, that any one of these narrower aims can be 
achieved entirely apart from the others. We can hardly 
think of any kind of physical training that does not involve 
intellectual activity, and much of it is closely associated 
with moral and social training. In outlining an aim, there- 
fore, we are but defining the point of emphasis of the cur- 
riculum, or of the lessons or instruction in question. 
4. The more specific aims of the school 
(a) Health and physical vigor as an aim. With the 
ancient Greeks physical education was institutionalized 
in a national sense. But for more than a thousand years 
this worthy aim of the school was buried beneath the ascetic 
ideals of the medizeval monk, and, aside from the emphasis 
which chivalry placed upon this phase of training, the school 
gave little attention to the welfare of the body till well into 
the nineteenth century. But the developing humanitarian 
movement of recent times could not overlook such a re- 
sponsibility for the school, and, like every other new interest 
of our age, this problem has been attacked by science, and 
one of the larger contributions to educational thought in 
recent decades has been the idea that care for the health and 
the normal growth and development of the child are legiti- 
mate functions of the school. 
This conception represents the newer phase of the work 
in physical education, and is important in bringing the 
physician and teacher together in the task of producing a 
sound mind in a sound body. ‘This gives to medicine a 
positive and constructive as opposed to a negative or merely 
curative aim, and brings to its aid the constant care which 
_ can be exercised only by the school. As a result our school 
work in formal gymnastics is now being reorganized and re- 
directed by this newer aim, and plays and games which  
-P-A-G-E-24
    12 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
were once indulged in for social reasons only are taking the 
place of much of the former drill. The social and moral 
values are not lost in this new work, but the health value is 
greatly enhanced, and mere physical strength is broadened 
to include motor control and the expression of personality 
or character. 
To be effective in the management of a class, however, 
health and physical vigor must not be thought of as merely 
finished products to be attained. The teacher must have in 
mind a clear understanding of the child as he is, and of the 
various steps which the child must take in attaining this goal. 
There is the strong, healthy child, the average child, the 
undernourished, the sickly, and the crippled child, each with 
special needs. It is these special needs that must be defined, 
and their satisfaction must be set up as the teacher’s aim. 
With these defined she must then be able to define and direct 
the processes (activities and exercises, emotional as well as _ 
physical) which will carry the child step by step from where 
he now is to where he ought to be. Thus, a study of this 
aim, brought down from its general to its specific form, 
forces us to face the course of study not only as a whole, but 
in its smaller parts, even to each day’s assignment, as a step 
designed to change the child from what he now is to what he 
ought to be. 
(b) Morality as an aim. Morality is not a mere matter 
of doing right or being honest, but of knowing when and 
where to do right and be honest; it is not merely a matter 
of not stealing, but of standing positively and actively for 
the protection of society against stealing, and of learning 
how to earn an honest living. 
This makes the moral aim extremely broad and com- 
prehensive, to be sure, but morality is a big fact in a social 
world. There are points of emphasis here, however, such 
as habits of personal cleanliness, fair play in group games,
-P-A-G-E-25
  THE MEANING AND AIM OF EDUCATION 18 
respect for elders, all matters of common honesty and 
politeness, ideals of civic honor and of public service, and 
knowledge and judgment concerning the common moral 
situations to be met in ordinary community life. Training 
in these directions is essential, and practically achievable 
for the school. With the ever-increasing tendency of mod- 
ern life to dissipate the moral influence of the home, this 
responsibility of the school cannot be shifted. The idea 
of service and codperation as opposed to selfishness in 
these and other habits and ideals, and the ability to 
judge the right, are the specific points at which the moral 
aim finds its issue in the management and instruction of 
children. 
The playground offers endless opportunity for a child to 
make moral decisions, and so a wealth of material through 
which the teacher may incidentally, in classes, in projects, 
in her discipline cases, in cobperative work, and in her con- 
versation with children, bring this general aim of morality 
down to very specific aims. When a child has been unfair 
in a game the question of morality becomes a question of 
conduct. The aim now is to have the child reflect upon his 
act and discover for himself that it was wrong, and then as 
far as possible to lay the foundation for a strong prejudice 
against that sort of unfairness. 
(c) Knowledge as an aim. Knowledge is perhaps the 
- most obvious aim of all, and the one which has received the 
greatest emphasis in the school. To this there might be 
little objection were it not true that in practice we have 
thought of knowledge only in the narrow sense of informa- 
tion, the teacher’s problem having been mainly that of seeing 
that children accumulate a prescribed quantity of facts. The 
school has too rarely raised the question as to what know- 
ledge is for, and as a consequence its actual use has been too 
largely that of mere intellectual ornamentation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
    14 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
As a practical school aim, knowledge must be regarded 
from the standpoint of its use, rather than from the stand- 
point of a finished product. Only when it has been applied 
to the solution of tasks, old and new, has its full value been 
realized. With young children, especially, knowledge must 
not remain isolated. With them it must be knowledge how — 
how to skate, how to sing, how to sew, how to speak and 
write correctly, how to be polite, how to enjoy music and 
poetry, each activity yielding information, but information 
tied up with conduct. 
To illustrate further: The date of 1492 is often taught 
merely as the date of the discovery of America by Colum- 
bus. In such isolation it is almost void of meaning. The 
date can have little meaning until the child is given a setting 
forit. What was going on then? What was there in Europe 
and America? Who thought of doing that? How did 
people live then? When such a fact has a rich setting it 
then has significance, and only then is a real knowledge- 
aim achieved. 
We seek knowledge only that we may act. Recognizing 
this meaning of knowledge as the one of first importance 
for the school is only taking account of the natural motive 
a child has for getting knowledge, namely, in order that 
he may do something. Gradually, however, as the child is 
able to conceive future or remote, as well as immediate, 
needs, information not immediately applicable may be- 
come a legitimate aim. A knowledge of geometry, of the 
Euphrates Valley, of the technique of language construc- 
tion, of a foreign tongue, to a considerable degree may re- 
main in the child’s mind as information, but always with 
the idea that it is to be applied in getting more knowledge 
in the college or university course later on. 
This brings us to a particular point of emphasis in con- 
nection with knowledge as an aim, and that is the use of  
-P-A-G-E-27
  
  THE MEANING AND AIM OF EDUCATION 15 
knowledge in getting more knowledge.! How to study, 
once a motive for study is present, is a constant problem, 
not only in the school but everywhere. Not to recognize 
this is to ignore one of the most important functions of the 
school. We must not only impart the accumulated know- 
ledge of the past, but cultivate method and zeal in getting 
new knowledge. In a democracy every child must be a dis- 
coverer. 
(d) The vocational or utilitarian aim. The cultural and 
the utilitarian in education have long been set over against 
each other as if mutually exclusive; and so they were in a 
sense. When education was for the leisure class only it was 
not necessary that it should be of a sort useful in making 
a living; consequently a knowledge of the classics and of 
mathematics served well to separate the “cultured” from 
the “uncultured.” In those days industrial life was simple, 
and by a crude and wasteful system of apprenticeship the 
industries trained their own workers. But to-day, with the 
rising tide of democracy and with industries highly mechan- 
ized, education is for all, and the demand is for trained 
workers. : 
This necessitates a new definition of culture, which is 
‘slowly but surely working itself out under the new condi- 
tions. It also places upon the school the new and impor- 
tant task of training for other than the merely professional 
vocations. There are the trade, industrial, commercial, 
agricultural, and home-making pursuits to train for, and 
the school is asked to formulate aims to meet these new 
demands. Such aims cannot be formed by pushing the 
responsibility back upon the occupations. The school must 
see in these conditions the demand for practical as opposed 
to purely theoretical study, and arrange its curriculum, 
equipment, and class exercises accordingly. 
1 See Chapter XIII for a fuller treatment of this problem. 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
16 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
Right and wrong interpretations of this aim. The dan- 
ger which the school faces in undertaking this new aim lies in 
the natural inclination to interpret this new training in terms 
of its disciplinary value at the one extreme, or in terms of 
the degree in which it merely facilitates the earning of 
money at the other. No such false interpretation as the 
former, or narrow interpretation as the latter, can possibly 
be accepted if we insist upon the meaning and general aim 
of education which we have set forth above. No training 
could be counted utilitarian from the school’s point of view 
if it is so narrow in its use as to be unsocial. It is not train- 
ing to earn a living merely that is wanted, but training how 
to live intelligently and happily on what we earn as well. 
Making this aim effective. For us to ignore the respon- 
sibility of the school as a means of bringing the child into a 
proper attitude toward the work side of life, and into some 
understanding and some appreciation of the processes by 
which society gets its food, shelter, and clothing, is on the 
face of things quite absurd. If this responsibility of the 
school is recognized, however, the general aim above stated 
must be made specific for each subject and for the various 
school activities. Arithmetic problems must come out of 
the work of the shop or the business with which the child has 
daily contact and actual responsible contact. The correct 
language must become the language of the playground, the 
street, andthe home. The school club, or society, or student 
body rules must be the rules of business and political life, and 
the child must sense the fact that they are. Justice on the 
playground must be the justice of the courts discussed in 
civics. Only by such thinking and planning can the teacher 
bring the general aims of vocational training to bear fruit 
in the management of her pupils. 
(e) The esthetic aim. To be able to enjoy the beauties 
in nature and in art is to have access to constant sources of
-P-A-G-E-29
    THE MEANING AND AIM OF EDUCATION 17 
inspiration. To be able to enjoy a landscape, or to catch 
the vision of the poet, the musician, or the painter, is at 
least in some degree possible for us all. Landscape and 
cloud effects cannot be fenced in, art galleries and libraries 
are open to all alike, and however busy we may be with the 
problem of earning our bread, yet there is time amid the toil 
for us to tap these rich sources of pleasure if only we learn 
how to see them. 
Aside from the individual pleasures which children may 
derive from such sources, the school must not ignore the 
fact that common esthetic ideals and pleasures rank along 
with common political and religious ideals as bases for social 
solidarity. When two people find that they see the same 
beauty in a picture they are thrilled by the discovery of a 
new means of communication. If all the people who visit 
the park could see the beauty which the artist finds in the 
shrubbery-fringed lagoon, the park would by force of this 
fact become a social center. We cannot all go to the park, 
or to the opera, but we can all see the fields and the sky, we 
can all read poetry and enjoy pictures, and we can all listen 
to Victrola or radio music, and it is the business of the school 
to make of these esthetic experiences a common language. 
(f) Other aims. We have by no means exhausted the 
number of aims. Those we have mentioned might be mada 
still more specific and detailed as we apply them in selecting 
our subject-matter and in working out our methods, and 
many others might be stated. We might speak of skill, of 
information, of good manners, of respect for expert work, of 
methods of study, of graceful movement, of industry, of 
honesty, of civic duty, of good recitations, of school loyalty, 
of good spelling, of rapid addition — all — as aims, for train- 
ing to all of these ends is within the legitimate function of the 
school. Yet each of these is included under one or more of 
the above captions, and to discuss them further would be to
-P-A-G-E-30
  18 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
discuss separate phases of the subject which this book can 
cover but briefly. 
The point to be emphasized here is that the teacher needs 
to have a broad conception of the meaning and end of her 
work, and some clear notion of the several larger purposes, 
in order that the details of daily problems may be dealt with 
in their proper perspective. Is the particular plan selected 
for handling a given situation, such as the passing of wraps or 
the collecting of papers, conducive, in as large a way as is 
possible, not only to meeting those immediate needs, but to 
giving training and experience in the direction of the broad 
social and moral aim of the school? This is the question 
which the teacher must keep constantly in mind in the con- 
duct of her school, if she is to apply anything like scientific 
method to its management. 
5. Chapter summary 
We have seen that education gets its meaning from the character 
of human nature itself. Not human nature in isolation or quies- 
cent, but human nature in society and in action. Starting from 
one set of instincts, education is free self-expression; from another, 
it is the inhibition of the impulsive self in terms of the claims of 
society. The conflict between these views is only apparent, and 
the aim of the school is to facilitate the child’s development in 
both these directions, to the end that the man will be also the 
citizen. 
The teacher needs to state her school aims in the light of these 
larger facts and principles. This can be done only when we think 
of the social and individual needs which the child must face in his 
expanding world. Every child must maintain life and keep himself 
physically fit; he must deal justly with his fellows; he must ration- 
alize his conduct, and know the world of facts with which he must 
cope; he must earn his bread; and he must enjoy life. Thus we set 
up the physical, the moral, the knowledge, the vocational, and the 
esthetic aims, in terms of which the school, the curriculum, the

and on theory and principles of education.

children must be organized and directed. Making these aims 
specific for the various courses and activities of the school is the 
responsibility of the teacher.

1l. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
What are some of the most important things a child learns outside of 
the school? 
a. Does the school offer any opportunity to the child to learn these 
same things? 
b. What part of a child’s school experience, if any, seems to you 
to give support to these things? 
. Mention some school experiences which are designed to teach the 
child to inhibit his own selfish impulses in favor of the wishes of the 
group. 
. At what points is it possible to misinterpret the cultural and utili- 
tarian aims of the school so that they represent conflicting purposes? 
. In what sense is it the duty of the school to teach obedience? 
. In what way may supervised play be useful in carrying out the moral 
aim as discussed above? 
. Name several special aims which could be appropriately classified 
under the physical aim. Analyze each of the other aims similarly. 
. What specific and what general aims do you expect to achieve by a 
given system of distributing wraps? 
. Explain the influence of prizes in school work in terms of their effect 
on social and moral training. 
. If to impart knowledge is one of your aims, what school work do you 
include under the term knowledge? 
What studies would be most useful for sesthetic training? 
Explain the function of a well-decorated, well-lighted and ventilated, 
properly-seated and equipped room, in the achievement of the above 
aims. 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
. Explain how the child builds up the concepts that are to guide his 
thinking and conduct in political, in social, and in economic matters. 
a. What are some of these concepts? 
b. What can the school do in determining their character? 
c. How is this latter problem connected with project work, with 
opportunity rooms, with the extra-curricular life of the school? 
. In the following figure: 
oy let x stand for the teacher and pupils at work (or play, or a conference 
in a discipline case). Let y stand for the general aim of “health,” or 
“citizenship,” or “worthy use of leisure,” or “social efficiency,” or
-P-A-G-E-32
    20 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
“vocation,” or “worthy home membership.” Let the line indicate 
distance or the problem of making this general aim specific for the 
immediate need of the situation x. For instance: The general aim 
of the course in hygiene is “health.” By accident a pupil has received 
a severe wound. The children saw the wound and watched the 
nurse dress it. In class the teacher uses this case to explain certain 
facts about bacteria: How they attack a wound that is not perfectly 
clean, how they are certainly present in such a wound, how to destroy 
them, and what will happen if they are not killed. Apply this scheme 
of analysis to several different types of management situations, as 
“punishing a child,” “organizing a group project,” “conducting a 
history recitation,” or “organizing a club.”

1. The changing point of view 
Tue traditional schoolmaster gave little thought to the why 
of his work. De expected the children to learn their les- 
sons, and to recite them, remembering to be properly sub- 
missive to the teacher’s authority, which authority was 
symbolized by a long list of rules and a birch rod, both con- 
spicuously displayed in the classroom. 
Under the old régime there was little thought of educa- 
tion as development. The child was regarded as a little man, 
and accordingly the aims of instruction and management 
were crudely stated in terms of adult needs. This attitude 
dominated education until social and economic pressure had 
forced upon the school a broader function, and until a more 
scientific knowledge of the child, of society, and of the edu- 
cative process had made possible a reinterpretation of its 
aims. 
To-day the school is expected to turn out a definite pro- 
duct.’ This means that the teacher must not only know the 
materials and forces with which she must work, but that 
she must be able to shape and to direct these to the ends 
desired.

    22 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
2. Theory and practice must join hands in the schoolroom 
Traditional versus personal methods inmanagement. It 
is not enough to study the aims of teaching as we study a 
lesson in history. As our study of the child, of subject- 
matter, and of society gives us the basic principles upon 
which we construct our general educational theory, so this 
theory must enter into the making of the plans and devices 
by which we govern children in the schoolroom. 
It is much easier to study about the aims of school man- 
agement than it is to keep a constant check on one’s own 
teaching, to see that those aims are being realized in the form 
of stronger, more intelligent, and more socially effective 
children. It is easier to accept the traditional modes of 
procedure in class work, to apply the same penalties for 
petty offenses, to keep records, and give tests, in the same 
way year in and year out, than it is to make new plans to 
meet the changing needs. It is easier, in other words, to 
avoid the responsibility of knowing the definite purpose of 
each plan and device which enters into the management of 
the room, of stating the extent to which that plan is being 
realized, and then of revising procedure where shortage in 
achievement is discovered. That is, it is easier to dawdle, to 
guess, to be irresponsible, than it is to apply industry and 
intelligence in the execution of a constructive program which 
has been planned to accomplish a given end. 
Theory versus tradition. When we can give no scientific 
reason for doing a thing we usually rely upon tradition to 
guide us. The medizval dictum, that the child is born in 
sin and is therefore by nature bad, gave rise to a pedagogi- 
cal practice which was designed to suppress all native im- 
pulses in children and to enforce a rigid discipline through 
a hard-and-fast, machine-like organization. This point of 
view, essentially characteristic of all phases of medieval 
civilization, fastened itself upon the school as one of its
-P-A-G-E-35
  THE FUNCTION OF THE AIM IN MANAGEMENT 23 
most harmful traditions — harmful because it prevented 
just what we have described above as the normal process of 
education. That tradition is not as yet dead. There are 
the militarists in school management to-day, and on the 
whole they are true to their medieval ancestry in the sense 
that they offer no scientific justification for their practice. 
Their aim is determined for them; they are cogs in a great 
and ancient machine which ignores progress as a funda- 
mental characteristic and ideal of our age. 
Importance of the modern social aim. The teacher who 
has developed a scientific notion of the aim of education, is 
confronted with the force of just such unreasoned pressure 
as this, when she attempts to put these notions into prac- 
tice. She is everywhere hemmed about with the traditions 
of the past, and, unless she is willing to conduct her school 
in terms of the needs of a civilization that no longer exists, 
she must guard against the natural tendency to take this 
traditional line of least resistance. The only way to fortify 
against this is to cease to be directed by inspiration, or luck, 
to provide one’s self with a rational purpose, adapted to 
present-day needs, and to make that purpose a constant 
check on practice at every turn. 
Means and method dependent upon aim. The reason 
that teaching without a clear aim is bound to lead to more 
or less chaotic procedure is because of the fundamental re- 
{ation between the end sought and the method by means of 
which that end is to be realized. If I do not have clearly 
in mind what it is I wish to do, I can scarcely hope to choose 
the most intelligent method for doing it. 
When a fire alarm is sounded, every teacher and pupil 
must get out of the building as speedily as possible. The » 
fire drill is a method of training children in those particular 
types of codperation and self-control which are necessary 
to achieve this end. Certainly such codperation and self-
-P-A-G-E-36
24 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
  control could not be obtained if the drill called the children 
out one class at a time. This illustrates very simply how 
the means, or method, is practically determined by the aim 
“in view. In other words, real training or education can only 
result when the conduct or management is directed in terms of 
a predetermined aim. Therefore, any management which 
is not clear and specific with respect to its aim cannot be 
economical, or in the highest sense educational. It is almost | 
as true to say that the aim is not well defined until the plan 
by means of which that aim is to be realized is fully outlined. 
~And this principle applies just as fully in the details of learn- 
ing to write, or to draw, as it does in the movement of 
pupils, or in the distribution of supplies. Let us now 
illustrate. } 
3. A clear aim makes for efficiency 
Mistaking means for ends. Since the method and the 
end in school management are so intimately bound to- 
gether, it is obvious that the teacher who has a well-defined 
aim has taken an important step in the direction of effi- 
;~ ciency. Efficiency in management insists first of all upon™ 
getting results, and in getting those results it insists that 
every moment of time, and every part of the school machinery, 
shall give an educational account of itself. Or, stating it neg- _ 
atively, that no false moves shall be made, no unsatisfactory 
habits formed, no purely suppressive measures used, and no 
uncritical procedure followed. 
Every teacher will readily sanction this, but it must be 
remembered that it is more easily read than practiced. The 
do side to school management is a problem in itself, which 
every beginning teacher must face. This may make clear 
what to do, and what not to do, and later chapters may ex- 
plain the how, but there will still be left the actual exe- 
_eution, which will call for clear thinking and persistent effort.
-P-A-G-E-37
ee oe THE FUNCTION OF THE AIM IN MANAGEMENT 25 
The pin-fall-quiet theory. Without a definite notion of 
what is to be accomplished one may easily mistake means 
for ends. A quiet schoolroom is only a means, and yet how 
often the ancient schoolmaster has prided himself upon being 
able to hear a pin fallin his room. How often, too, has that 
achievement been made at the cost of a free and cheerful 
atmosphere of work. The reason a schoolroom should be | 
kept quiet is that quiet is one of the conditions under which | 
attention can be concentrated, work can be done, and right | 
work habits built up. 
We must remember, though, that the habits developed 
here are for use in the outside world where there are many 
distractions. Hence, work habits which are developed in an 
absolutely quiet room are not only developed under re- , \ 
pressive measures, but they defeat their own end by un- / 
fitting the child for thinking and working under normal con- 
ditions outside the schoolroom. This is but a single illustra- 
Sion of how the teacher without a clear aim is misled into 
thinking her task is done, when in reality it has only begun. 
An indefinite aim makes for loss of time. If a clear aim 
is insisted upon throughout the entire day, then recess 
periods can no longer be thought of as temporary relief from 
hard work. They may mean this, but they must mean more. 
They must mean play or change of work which does not 
allow a large percentage of the children to stand around 
as if waiting for the next thing to happen. All must play, 
and that play must be designed to yield definite social, 
recreational, moral, and intellectual values. This it will 
not do if left undirected and aimless. Play must be super- 
vised, just as study is supervised, and when some tangible 
aim is set up for it to achieve we shall realize that no incopsid- 
erable part of a child’s education, as defined in chapter I, 
will be accomplished during these moments of the school 
day which, until now, have been regarded as waste time. © e
-P-A-G-E-38

26 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
But the recess period is not the only point at which 
moments slip by without yielding an educational output. 
How much time is consumed in getting into action when the 
class assembles? What is the speediest and most educative 
method of distributing supplies and wraps? Are children 
permitted to bring useless and impertinent ideas and facts 
into the class discussion? Is a poorly prepared pupil per- 
mitted to consume an unreasonable portion of the class 
period in trying to bluff through a recitation? These are 
among the hundreds of loose joints we find in schoolroom 
work. If our aim insists that every moment shall render 
educational account of itself, there will be a general tight- 
ening up of the program throughout the day. 
Relation of aim to motive in work. Time, however, is 
not the only measure of waste in school work. Lack of a 
clear aim not infrequently provides a wrong motive. Thus 
children may march into the room in good order, not be- 
cause they care for, or see any point to that kind of training, 
but for fear that if they are disorderly they may have to re- 
main after hours and study. The motive here is fear of 
punishment, and not a desire to codperate in an effective 
method of getting into the room quickly and in good order, 
or to learn to walk in good form. 
Clear aim essential in habit formation. Likewise in the 
matter of habit formation a carefully studied aim is neces- 
sary to insure right procedure. To develop the habit of 
neatness in respect to language papers, and carry the idea 
no further, is to build up a habit which, unsupported by 
others of its kind, is so specific and narrow in its application 
as to be next to useless in after life. How much better to 
consider the full importance of neatness as a virtue, and 
insist upon a hundred habits of neatness instead of one. 
Neatness in all written work, in dress, manners, and wher-

  THE FUNCTION OF THE AIM IN MANAGFMENT 27 
these two conceptions of what to aim at in the matter of 
formulating plans for the development of habits of neatness 
is just this: In the one case the habit serves one narrow aim, 
which may or may not carry over into letter writing or 
preparation of documents in after life; in the other the single 
habit is so supported by others as to make it a guarantee 
against slovenliness in any line at any time. It is probable, 
too, that the building-up of the large number of habits of 
neatness will consume but little more of the teacher’s energy 
and time than will the driving in of the isolated habit in 
respect to language papers alone. 
A clear aim insures a critical attitude. We also must not 
fail to see that a clear aim tends to keep the teacher con- 
stantly critical of her own work. She does not follow a plan 
which shows no promise of bringing about certain precon- 
ceived results. She reads books, listens to addresses, and 
studies the reports of experiments and investigations more 
intelligently because at every point they are criticized in the 
light of some function which they may perform in her own 
work, She is more sympathetic with children, because her 
aim is always with respect to the individual child. She 
makes the greatest possible use of supervision, of teachers’ 
meetings and conferences with her principal, because she 
does not listen meekly to what her superiors tell her without 
demanding of them answers to specific questions which have 
arisen in her own work, a thing she could not do if she had 
not constantly held her work to answer in terms of a specific 
end. 
4. The teacher’s problem 
How to bring this discussion to bear in practice. This dis- 
cussion becomes very specific as a teacher looks about for an 
explanation of what she is doing and how she is doing it. 
Wholesome surprise awaits the teacher who will carefully
-P-A-G-E-40
28 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
scrutinize her course of study, her daily program, her plan 
of moving the children in and out of the room, her seating 
plan, her plans for handling wraps and supplies, her marking 
system, the classification of her pupils, her plans for looking 
after window shades and ventilators, and her standards 
governing such matters as the children’s moving about in 
the room, going to the library, conversing with one another, 
keeping desks and room in order, and neatness in dress, 
courtesy, and correct speech — each from the angle here 
suggested. Specifically, why am I doing this in this par- 
ticular way? Specifically, what is the aim of this course, 
this recitation, this or that routine procedure? 
If a teacher will try to write down a justification for each 
plan, method, or device that she uses she will quickly find 
that there are at almost every turn in her work aims more 
desirable than those she has been using. 
Illustration of how to apply it. Let us set down the aims 
of marching the children into and out of the building. On 
the face of things such a plan is formal and seems to destroy 
individual initiative. If we examine its possibilities we 
shall see that: 
1. It saves time for school work. 
2. It makes possible a casual inspection of the children as to 
dress, manners, health, and general attitude of mind. 
8. It is good moral and social training, since it requires each 
student to fit into a moving program where attention to co- 
operation is necessary. 
Whether these aims are realized will depend largely upon 
whether the teacher pursues them consciously. What will 
be training in purposeful codperation if children enter into 
the spirit of it can easily become repressive if the children 
are opposed to it. If they are herded in and watched and 
spied upon they are very sure to act as prisoners act. When 
that is the case, they are not being trained in codperation 
but in opposing social order.
-P-A-G-E-41
  THE FUNCTION OF THE AIM IN MANAGEMENT 29 
Similarly, the inspection aim may become a menace if it 
is not kept to its true purpose. Or it may result in most 
friendly and helpful contacts with the children. A smile or 
a word may drive away tears and frowns, anger and disap- 
pointment, and restore self-confidence, happiness, and the 
desire to codperate all along the moving lines of children. 
There is not space to analyze other aims and plans, but 
this idea of checking over one’s entire program of work is 
urged here as indispensable to sound management. 
5. Chapter summary 
To summarize the ways in which the aim functions in school 
management, then, let us remember that the modern school has 
moved away from the old hand-to-mouth and mechanical modes 
of school management, and in the direction of a scientifically- 
planned procedure; that the greatest enemy to scientific school 
management is the ignorance of fundamental principles and the 
consequent pressure of outworn school traditions; that sound 
theory will work; that a clear aim involves a critical study‘of the 
means and methods by which the aim is to be realized; that a clear 
aim leads to efficiency, because it counts every moment of time, 
demands results, and discards useless machinery; and that a clear 
aim reflects itself in the teacher’s habits of thought and work and 
in the training of the children. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. In what ways have the old conceptions of school management failed, 
and what is the basis of the new conception? 
2. How has the medieval doctrine “that the child is by nature bad” 
disappeared, and what has been the influence of the new aim on school 
practice? 
8. Show by concrete illustrations from school-management problems 
how the aim very largely determines the method of procedure. 
4, How might a strict adherence to the principle that every momeht of 
school time and every part of school machinery must render educa- 
tional account of itself have changed your own program when you 
were in the elementary school, in the high school, in the normal school, 
in college? Is this principle being enforced in your school? 
5. Do you know of any school, or system of schools, which is carrying

1. The factors enumerated 
Divisions of this book. In our brief interpretation of the 
meaning and aims of education we have had in mind: first, 
the native equipment of the child; second, the fact of con- 
tinuous development or growth of the child; and third, the 
physical and social terms in which, and ends to which, that 
growth must be directed. Accordingly, any adequate treat- 
ment of school management must concern itself with three 
large problems, namely: the child, individual and social, as 
the objective of all management; the process, by which the 
environmental conditions are to be used in exercising control 
over his development, or over the methods by which his de- 
velopment shall take place; and the teacher, the agent 
through whom society directs the process. These problems 
will constitute the subjects for Parts I, III, and IV of this 
book. 
2. The child to be educated 
To know the child for educational purposes means to 
know the essential facts and principles regarding the child’s
-P-A-G-E-44
    32 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
nature as these are involved in his development toward the 
intellectual, physical, moral, vocational, and sesthetic aims 
set forth above. 
The period of infancy. Biologically the child is imma- 
ture, both with respect to his organs and with respect to their 
functions. It is noteworthy that this immaturity is greater 
in its duration than obtains with any other animal known. 
According to John Fiske, who first called attention to the 
importance of this period of prolonged infancy, those organs — 
and functions which are perfect at birth rarely change very 
much, and are changed with great difficulty; whereas those 
which are not perfect at birth are easily capable of change 
Not only, then, are early perfections, physical and mental, 
not conducive to further modification, that is to learning, 
but lack of such perfection makes learning not only possible 
but absolutely necessary. 
Immaturity an educational resource. This makes imma- 
turity a positive factor rather than a negative one. A set of 
forces is there, which are designed to perfect the adjust- 
ments of the child to the world he is to live in. These 
adjustments may be left to chance or given careful direc- 
tion. Giving direction to them is precisely what is meant 
by conscious education. To the teacher, then, this im- 
maturity, or infancy, means plasticity, adaptability, Pos- 
sibility for further growth. . 
Negatively it means that the child is not an incomplete 
adult, that childhood is not a time to hasten through, as if 
it were a period of waiting instead of a period of growing 
and living. It means that we are not dealing with organs or 
functions which are already fixed, with adjustments already 
made; that we are not to spend our time in breaking the 
child’s will; and, most of all, that we are not to let a moment 
of time pass in which opportunity to direct the growth of the 
child may be lost. ‘ 
   
-P-A-G-E-45
  HUMAN FACTORS CONCERNED 33 
The native equipment of children. That the period of 
infancy is a time in which the child is perfecting his adjust- 
ments to the world, and so a most important educational 
resource, does not mean that the child has no ready-made) ,,/).0 “ 
equipment for life when he is born, or by the time he enters ,, 
school. He has an abundance of such equipment, and with 
the passing of years that abundance increases. These mate-| 
rials exhibit themselves as tendencies to respond to certain \ 
situations in certain typical ways, and are referred to as 
reflexes, or instincts, or predispositions, and constitute the | 
original mental make-up of man. 
When the situation is simple, and the response very 
prompt and direct, and the bond between them hard to 
modify, as the opening or closing of the pupil of the eye 
with decrease or increase of light, the tendency to respond is 
called a reflex. Where the situation is not so simple, the 
response more variable, and the connection more easily 
modified, it is referred to as an instinct, as, for instance, the 
tendency to pay attention to bright colors, sharp contrasts, 
and moving things, or to imitate the acts or seek the com- | 
panionship of others. When the situation and response are \ ~~ 
both extremely variable, and the connection between them | 
very modifiable, it is referred to as “capacity” or “‘predis- \ 
position.” Thus when a child responds readily and accu- | 
rately to all kinds of musical or mathematical situations, we | 
think of that child as having unusual capacity for music or | 
mathematics. 
  3. The school and the native equipment of children 
The task of the school. This original equipment is quite 
varied, and as yet has not been fully described. Enough is 
known about it, however, to offer many suggestions to the 
teacher. First of all, the school is largely concerned with 
just this task of modifying these original tendencies to act, 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
34 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION ~ 
and in selecting the right modes of behavior and reducing 
them to habits. In the evolution of the human race this 
original equipment is of ancient origin, and must have 
served to adapt man to a far different life from that which 
he must now live. Consequently the child will display some 
instinctive tendencies which are not only not useful, but 
destructive in our modern society. These must be elim- 
inated by preventing them from having a chance to get ex- 
pression. Others will be useful in their original primitive 
form, and will need to be stimulated and nourished. Since 
some of them are transitory, it follows that if they are not 
promptly reduced to habits, the possibility of building upon 
them may be lost. Since they do not all appear at the same 
time, education must not only strike while the iron is hot, 
but must also be constantly on the alert for the appearance 
of new instincts. A brief discussion of some of the more im- 
portant of these may be of service here. 
The play instinct. The tendency to play is probably one 
of the most striking, and for education one of the most useful 
of these bits of native equipment. Play was frowned upon 
by our Puritan ancestors as being not only useless and waste- 
ful, but positively wicked. To-day, under the direction of 
education, it is regarded as a most useful starting-point for 
many school processes. Through play the child not only 
becomes acquainted with many objects and persons, but, 
through the adaptations necessary in his games, he becomes 
conscious of his own powers. 
A very large part of what the child has learned before en- 
tering the school he has learned through play. Thus have 
children always familiarized themselves with the funda- 
mentals of the arts of peace and war. In his games he has 
sowed, harvested, hunted, invented, explored, argued, and 
fought. Nor have these playful achievements always re- 
sulted without serious effort. And the spirit of that effort
-P-A-G-E-47
* HUMAN FACTORS CONCERNED 35 
is one of the important subjects of study for the teacher who 
would have the work of her room pervaded by a similar 
spirit of freedom and of definite purpose. 
The constructive instinct. The tendency of children to 
construct and to destroy is early noticeable. No object of 
interest escapes thorough handling. It is seen, touched, 
lifted, squeezed, turned, thrown up or down, accordingly as 
it is of quality, size, and weight to make such manipula- 
tion possible. The block house is erected and destroyed; 
the picture is examined, then torn to pieces or thrown aside. 
All this to the end that the child may more fully sense his 
world of materials, and find out the real meaning of his own 
acts or powers as their meanings are reflected in what hap- 
pens to his materials as he toys or toils with them. 
The teacher has only to understand the principles under- 
lying such behavior to see that their conscious application 
will make number work, drawing, geography, and many 
other features of school work thoroughly concrete and ob- 
jective. The child’s idea of a mountain, a valley, an animal, 
or a temple, expressed in clay, is not only the best test of 
what he knows about these things, but it is the best starting- 
point for him in his effort to learn more about them. 
* The instinct to imitate. Unconsciously the child copies 
from the models about him. A properly arranged and 
decorated schoolroom, good organization and management, 
a teacher with correct speech, manners, and dress, and with 
kindly ways, all these are desirable models, and they are in 
large degree under the teacher’s control. 
The instinct of curiosity. Curiosity is the instinct that 
prompts that endless questioning by children which the tired 
parent or teacher too often dismisses lightly. Examine a 
child’s questions. They are about everything, from ants to 
stars, from digestion to volcanoes, and from steam to gla- 
ciers. They are the little feelers through which the child is 
   
-P-A-G-E-48
36 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
struggling to gain a kinship to his world. This inquiring 
disposition can practically be stayed by forbidding the child 
ever to ask a question in class, or, by directing the ques- 
tions, they can be made the basis for developing the true 
scientific spirit and method of work. 
Other instincts. There is also the collecting and hoard- 
ing instinct, which may turn to postage stamps, through 
which a world of geography may be learned, or to shells, or 
nests, or cocoons, through which the child may enter into 
most intimate converse with nature, and, if the teacher is 
wise, it may even be extended to the collecting of ideas or 
facts about a given subject in history, civics, composition, 
or art; the instinct of emulation, through which one child is 
stimulated to his very best effort by the fact that he is being 
outdone by another child; and the gregarious instinct, which 
is the basis upon which the ideas and ideals of social order 
may be constructed. 
All these are the crude, raw materials, which, together 
with their modifiability, are, if properly handled, the great- 
est asset which education has. To study the ways in which 
these native materials express themselves, and the ways in 
which they grow into permanent modes of behavior, is to 
study the very essence of both human nature and educa- 
tion. 
4. How the child learns 
The principles underlying conscious behavior, the getting 
of ideas, the formation of habits, the control of attention, 
are factors with which intelligent teaching must reckon. 
How does the child explore, or shall we say construct, the 
world he is in? We have discussed his native equipment 
above, and have seen how nature has provided motivating 
forces which push him out to explore the world about him 
and lead him to try to controlit. Leaving aside that kind of
-P-A-G-E-49
  HUMAN FACTORS CONCERNED 37 
conduct which is purely reflex or instinctive, and so largely 
unavoidable for the child, what are some of the principles 
which operate to direct his conscious behavior? 
The function of the senses. The contact which the child 
has with the objective world is through his senses of sight, 
hearing, smell, touch, and taste. Some knowledge of these 
would seem to be our first step in a study of the principles 
underlying conscious behavior. All the ideas we have are 
the direct or indirect result of our sense experience. Excel- 
lent evidence of this is seen in the nature of sense experience 
itself. If we hear a sound, or view a strange object, we im- 
mediately change the position of the body, to the end that 
we may more fully drink in the sight or sound if it is pleasant, 
or shut it out if it is unpleasant. In other words, no sensa- 
tion is complete without some bodily movement as a re- 
sponse. This seems to mean that the reason for sensation is 
that we may adjust ourselves properly to the new object or 
situation, that is, that we may get a meaning for it. 
A child’s ideas, information, and therefore knowledge of 
things social, esthetic, intellectual, moral, economic, and phy- 
sical increase in proportion to the number and character 
of the sensations he feels and to the number of responses he 
makes to these stimuli. For education this suggests the 
importance of concrete as opposed to verbal training, of 
doing as opposed to mere remembering, of organization in 
terms of social relationships which are natural, of govern- 
ment in terms of leadership. It means that sense training 
must be a fact, as broadly applied in school management 
and instruction as it is in the child’s own free life at home 
or on the street. 
Principles of habit formation. Getting ideas, or infor~ 
mation, or meaning, is but one side of education. There 
is yet the other side, which has to do with the development 
of skill or the formation of habits. Habit is the line of least, , j \ nan — We 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
resistance in conduct, and our concern in education is to 
see that right habits are formed and that wrong habits are 
prevented. How, then, arerighthabitsformed? Ifstatedin 
simple terms there are three principles we need to follow. 
First, get clearly in mind the full nature of the perform- 
ance that is to be reduced to habit. 
Second, go through the performance repeatedly, with 
closest attention to every detail. 
Third, never permit an exception to the mode of action 
decided upon. 
As James says, we can thus make our nervous systems our 
enemy or our ally. Habits are bound to be formed on the 
playground, in respect to methods of study, neatness, polite- 
ness, language, and recitation, and it is for the teacher first 
of all to get a clear notion of the habits she wishes to estab- 
lish, and then to stick persistently to the application of these 
three principles till the performance has become as me- 
chanical as if it were purely instinctive. An important re- 
ward for this persistence is the freeing of consciousness from 
many simple duties, and the guarantee that these duties will 
be performed promptly, accurately, and in the right place. 
5. The problem of health 
New interest in health questions. Physical development 
is another angle from which we must view the child as a 
factor in our task of management. City health depart- 
ments are growing, health statistics are accumulating in 
gymnasiums and laboratories, diseases and preventive 
measures are being studied as never before, children are 
being taught physiology and hygiene, laws are being en- 
acted for the control of contagious diseases, and the pro- 
blems of health and their influence in education are being 
studied in every school of education. Yet step into almost 
any school and we find evidences of malnutrition, adenoids, 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  
HUMAN FACTORS CONCERNED 39 
diseased tonsils, defective hearing and vision, lack of nerv- 
ous control, and we read that scarcely one third of our 
American school children are free from physical defects 
which are prejudicial to health. 
Health problems and school work. Surely this makes a 
difference in the problems of school management and in 
self-defense, if for no other reason, the teacher should for- 
tify herself against this extra burden. The child who has to 
open his mouth and thrust his chin forward in order to 
breathe has too often been scolded for lack of attention, 
when in fact he was using practically all his energy in get- 
ting his breath. 
When we recall that on the average two of every three 
children in the room are thus handicapped, we are inclined 
to say that a large part of the teacher’s responsibility in 
management turns upon matters of health. 
Prominent symptoms of most of these ailments can be 
detected by any intelligent layman who will take the trouble 
to look for them, and with no great amount of reading 
teachers may be able not only to solve more intelligently 
many knotty management problems, but they may, by a 
little intelligent and sympathetic direction of children and 
parents, be able to save hundreds from suffering and disease. 
Such a service should be looked upon by teachers not only 
as a privilege but as one of their sternest obligations. It 
is children we are to manage, and not merely textbooks, re- 
port cards, time schedules, fire drills, and such other material 
details of school work. 
6. Individual differences 
No two children alike. There is yet another angle from 
which the child must be understood — that is from the 
1 A book of value to teachers in this connection is The Hygiene of the 
School Child, by Dr. L. M. Terman.
-P-A-G-E-52
  40 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
standpoint of his unlikeness to other children, or from the 
standpoint of his own individuality. We are accustomed 
to speak in terms of averages — the average score attained 
in the test, the average number promoted, the boy of aver- 
age intelligence or size — as if the aim of the school were to 
turn the children out each as nearly as possible like the 
others. We are often satisfied if the child is up to the aver- 
age in deportment, application, and studies, forgetting that 
no two children are alike. 
In color of eyes, height, complexion and length of arms, 
there are wide differences among children of the same age. 
In exactly the same way children differ in respect to mental 
ability. The range from idiocy to genius is the possible 
range of intelligence. If a few thousand children were 
selected at random and competently measured for intelli- 
gence, it is probable that a very few would be marked as 
idiots, and imbeciles; that a few would rank as geniuses, 
and that every possible grade of intelligence between these 
extremes would be represented. Human nature is just this 
variable, and while so wide a variety of intelligence would 
probably not be found in a single classroom, yet if we refer 
to a single trait of intelligence, such as the ability to spell or 
the ability to sing, we should find that there is a wide differ- 
ence between the poorest and the best, and that the members 
of the class were very much unlike in the exact nature of 
their responses in these tests.! 
Significance of differences for the school. In grading and 
promoting children, in making lesson assignments, in ap- 
pointing pupils for special duties, in seating the pupils, in 
developing incentives for work, in administering punish- 
ment, in supervision of games, in dramatizing stories, in 
making class excursions, this fact of individual differences 
must enter as a determining factor. 
1 The significance of all these differences is brought out more fully in 
later chapters.
-P-A-G-E-53
  HUMAN FACTORS CONCERNED 41 
This is not a matter to be deplored; it is rather to be 
prized as the guarantee of society’s capacity to progress. 
Just as it has been the great biological fact in the evolution 
of the human race, it has also been the great social fact. If 
we were all alike, no one would discover a new way to do 
things. It is our unlikeness, our variability, that needs to 
be treasured. So instead of trying to bury it in the school- 
room, by preparing every task for that mysterious average 
pupil, let us stimulate these differences so that, by supple- 
menting one another in school, they will enrich school life, 
just as variation, biological and social, has enriched human 
society. 
7. Chapter summary 
In this brief sketch of the nature and extent of the problem 
which the child presents, it has been the purpose to emphasize the 
fact that it is human nature that management has to deal with, 
and that regarding this human nature there is a well-defined body 
of knowledge — biological, psychological, and physiological — 
upon which rests any rational interpretation of the true import of 
the child as the first factor and the sole object in all school manage- 
ment.

PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
1. Suppose, in a class of thirty pupils, abilities to do the work of the grade 
range from barely passing almost to the point of granting a double 
promotion. Discuss the problems to be faced by the teacher: 
a. In assigning a new lesson. 
6. In arranging for group projects. 
c. In telling a story. 
d. In supervision of study. 
e. In developing class morale or group spirit. 
2. Make a careful study of the objectionable social traits shown by the 
pupils of the class. Give specific cases, and frequency with which 
each has been observed: 
a. Matters of politeness. 
b. Matters of correct dress. 
c. Matters of fair play. 
d. Moral issues. 
e. Failure to codperate. 
8. Prepare a careful prescription for remedying such defects. What 
habits or attitudes are to be removed or changed? What new habits 
or attitudes are to be formed? Finally, where, in the course of the 
day’s work, may the teacher find good opportunity to attack the 
problem?

In the preceding chapter we enumerated three factors as 
having to do with school management. The first of these 
was the child; the second was the environment; and the third 
was the teacher. The facts regarding the first of these were 
set forth above, and we shall attempt here to sketch out the 
field covered by the other two, hoping to show something 
of the nature and extent of the knowledge of which the 
teacher must possess herself if she is to deal intelligently 
with these two factors in her problem. 
1. Environment 
Our point of view. It is better to think of the environ- 
mental factors from the standpoint of the part they play 
in directing the child’s education, rather than from that of 
their own formal or physical make-up. In thinking of 
desks from the standpoint of their perfection as pieces of 
furniture, it is easy to overlook the importance of the height 
of the seat from the floor, or of the adjustability of the seat, 
and to think rather of the general form, stability, and ap- 
pearance. Similarly, in marching children into and out of 
the building it is often easier to think of the procedure in 
terms of its military precision than to think of it in terms of 
its contribution to the social and physical training of the
-P-A-G-E-56

children. The most formal scheme of promotion is the best 
looking on paper, and the easiest to administer, but it is also 
of least educational service. Our starting-point, then, should 
be the process, rather than the machinery by which that 
process is determined. 
The materials to work with. In addition to the factor of 
child nature, above discussed, the teacher must deal with 
the physical equipment and the plans of operation by means 
of which this child nature is to be changed. 
Over many of these latter materials the teacher will have 
but little control. The building, the furniture and equip- 
ment, the playgrounds, and generally the curriculum are 
all there, ready prepared by her superiors and predeces- 
sors. 
There are other aspects of the situation, however, in re- 
spect to which the teacher is not so helpless. She may not 
be able to determine the color and texture of window shades, 
but she can determine whether the shades render service. 
She may have to use unsuitable textbooks, but these she can 
edit and supplement in numerous ways, while the dust- 
covered equipment of whatever sort can be made to serve 
some purpose, so that what was evidence of neglect and 
waste may be made to look clean and orderly. 
All these features are means and instruments in the hands 
of the teacher, and will be effective only as the teacher de- 
velops skill in bringing their influence to bear upon the grow- 
ing child. A dirty and disorderly room and playground are 
sure to be reflected i in the dress, manners, and speech of the 
children, and in a lack of loyalty to an institution in these 
respects so much below the standard of their own homes. 
On the other hand, by systematically connecting the work of 
instruction with these things, it is not only possible to en- 
hance their appearance and increase their usefulness, but to 
develop within the children a sense of ownership and pride
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE ENVIRONMENT AND TEACHER AS FACTORS 45 
in the school which is sure to spread to the community at 
large and ultimately to react favorably upon the school. 
Directing the process. It is in terms of child nature, and 
with the use of such physical surroundings and equipment 
as may have been provided, that the teacher is to work out 
her plan of action. First of all, let us insist that all action 
be planned action; second, that plans, as far as possible, shall 
be worked out before the school year opens, and go into 
effect the very first day; and third, that all plans shall be 
frequently checked up in terms of their educational service, 
and not in terms of the ease with which they work. 
In making plans the first step is to get clearly in mind 
what is to be accomplished, and the length of time in which 
it is to be done. This means that the course of study and 
the textbooks must be checked up against each other, and 
rough monthly plans of the work outlined. These rough 
plans will furnish the basis for making the daily or weekly 
lesson plans for teaching, and will tend to keep the work of 
the year well balanced. Then there are the daily time 
schedule; the basis of grading and promotion; the plan of 
seating the children; the movement of the class into and out 
of the building; the handling of wraps and supplies — all 
these represent problems of organization, a full grasp of 
which every teacher must have. The modes of procedure 
in these matters will represent the main structure of the 
school. 
The real test of efficient management. But the real pro- 
cess of management is more complex than this would seem to 
make it. The main plans of operation, though more or less 
fixed in character, must yet be sufficiently flexible to meet 
the needs of child nature, which we have shown above to be 
extremely variable. Meeting these needs successfully, 
making these finer adjustments to individual cases, is the 
real test of efficient management. The control of attention,
-P-A-G-E-58
  46 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
the development of right motives for work, handling the 
child with defective vision or hearing — the nervous, the 
mischievous, the dull, the bright, the morally degenerate, 
the half-fed, the ill, as well as the normal child — cannot be 
done by rule of thumb. For each of these cases specific 
plans must be made which will sometimes test the patience 
and inventiveness of the teacher, as well as the elasticity of 
the regular routine procedure. 
Illustrating educative value of environmental factors. To 
emphasize the teaching value of these factors, let us set 
down a partial list of these environmental items over which 
the teacher must exercise control, and see how such items 
may be utilized, just as textbooks and other curricular ma- 
terials are used in giving instruction. As suggested above, 
we may properly think of plans of procedure along with such 
physical features as desks, window shades, bookshelves, and 
supplies. 
For instance: 
1. Plapiof entering and leaving the building. Aim: not mere 
suppression of noise and disorder, but self-control, poise, and 
proper standards of social propriety. 
2. Plan for care of wraps. Aim: to save time, in part, but espe- 
cially to establish habits and attitudes affecting the proper 
use and care of clothing as these habits and attitudes affeet™ 
health, taste in dress, and notions of neatness and order in the 
room. 
8. Care of window shades. Aim: to protect eyes against im- 
proper light, and especially to train children to pay attention 
to such matters. 
4. Plans for collecting and distributing pupils’ work and sup- 
plies. Aim: not only to save time, but to train children to 
organize and to act as parts of an organization. 
5. Daily time schedule. Aim: not only proper distribution of 
effort to different tasks, but also training in definite and 
orderly use of time, in bringing tasks to completion on time, 
and in judging the character of a task by estimating how long 
it will take to complete it. 
 
-P-A-G-E-59
  THE ENVIRONMENT AND TEACHER AS FACTORS 47 
6. Plans for use of school library. Aim: to stimulate an attitude 
of inquiry and to help the child to gain actual knowledge from 
books; to develop intellectual independence; and to gain 
familiarity with library etiquette. 
This list could be extended or made more detailed, but 
these are typical aspects of the environment which sets 
limits to the child’s actions in school. Each of these is more 
than a restraining force, however; when properly used it is an 
actual teaching exercise with a definite aim. This means 
that there is a real problem in method here for the teacher, 
just as there is in any other instructional activity. 
It is not meant here to suggest how the teacher should 
handle these problems. She may prefer to have the children 
march quietly into and out of the building, or she may pre- 
fer to have them enter in their own way. She may prefer 
this or that method of seating her pupils. She may have 
monitors for caring for the window shades and pupils’ 
wraps. The point here is that these features of the school 
mechanism have large educational possibilities, atid a good 
teacher will treat them not as bars to restrain free action, 
but as orderly methods of guiding and stimulating freedom 
of action and assumption of responsibility. 
.. School management a rational process. Thus the process 
of management is to be from start to finish a rational pro- 
cess, involving the making of plans and their execution. 
These plans become more complex, more flexible, more in 
terms of individual natures, as we pass from their coarser 
and external to their finer and internal features, from the 
gross structure of the school to the management of individual 
children. To make the operation of these plans rational, 
the meaning and aim of education, and the nature of child 
life and its modes of learning must alike be kept in mind as 
the plans are evolved. In their coarser features they may 
be designed outside the school, but in their final application 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
    48 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
they cannot be made away from the cases they are to fit. A 
study of these plans, and of the physical features of the school 
environment which enter into their working, will be the 
purpose of a later section of the book. 
2. The teacher 
New professional demands. Finally, we are to deal with 
those facts which pertain to the teacher herself. These we 
are putting last in order because we wish to emphasize the 
scientific as opposed to the personal approach to the study 
of school management, and to show the character of the 
task before outlining the qualifications of the one who is to 
execute it. 
The school of to-day is by no means the simple in- 
stitution it used to be when teacher and school were con- 
sidered synonymous terms. Then a little book learning 
coupled with a pleasing appearance constituted the neces- 
sary equipment for teaching, but to-day the task has broad- 
ened and become technical and the demand is for men and 
women who have been scientifically trained along these 
lines. 
The teacher’s relationships. The teacher is but a part of 
a complex institution, and to know well how to perform her 
function is not only to know her own immediate task, but to 
know it in all its implications, physical, social, and pro- 
fessional. To be able to work harmoniously with her school 
trustees, her superintendent, her supervisor, her principal, 
her fellow teachers, and to be able to make the school a factor 
in community life, demands a broad grasp of the larger pro- 
fessional and social problems of public education. 
Through the board of education the people delegate au- 
thority to those who manage the schools. Its members 
stand as the representatives of the people and are responsible, 
not for running the schools, but for employing competent
-P-A-G-E-61
  
THE ENVIRONMENT AND TEACHER AS FACTORS 49 
officers and teachers for that purpose. While the teacher is 
ultimately responsible to this board she must remember that 
the board is concerned only with large questions of school 
policy, and not with matters of teaching and management. 
Professional relationships. The teacher’s most impor- 
tant relationships are with her immediate co-workers in the 
school — the superintendent, the supervisor, the principal, 
and her fellow teachers. Her own duties as a member of 
this group will be a constant study, since upon her full co- 
operation here depends her own success and that of the en- 
tire enterprise. These relationships will be fully examined 
in later chapters. In them, it must be pointed out, lie some 
of the most difficult problems the teacher will have to face. 
Directing one’s own energy in full sympathy and accord with 
that of the entire faculty calls for a clear understanding of 
the respective functions of each member in addition to a 
high degree of self-control and self-effacement. 
Relationships with parents and community. Finally, the 
teacher is responsible to her patrons. She is a servant of the 
community. Her relationship to parents will be more or 
less intimate accordingly as she is in a rural, village, or city 
school. In any case she must formulate, or assist in for- 
mulating, a school policy, and that in terms of community 
needs. To do this she must know the people and their social 
and workaday interests, and become in fact a real member 
of the community. 
It would seem to require an unusual person, of unusual 
training, to establish proper relationships and to bear all 
the responsibilities thus far suggested, and so it would. An 
unusual person in character and personality, an unusual 
person in professional equipment and ability to grow, an 
unusual person as to insight and leadership, an unusual 
person in physique. In part IV we shall consider the teacher 
from these points of view.

3. Summary of Part I 
Tn the above chapters we have attempted to outline the problem 
of school management, and to show in a brief way the fundamental 
bases upon which any scientific handling of children must rest. 
We have tried to see just where the problem of management lies, 
and to develop a point of view from which the teacher may ap- 
proach the actual practical task in the schoolroom. 
In doing this we have seen that the teacher, who is society’s 
agent, will have to deal with two large sets of facts. First, facts 
about original child nature; second, facts about all the forces which 
combine in the school to give direction to the changes which are 
to be wrought in that nature, as the child grows to manhood and 
to citizenship. Over the first of these sets of facts the teacher has 
no control, but over the second she has a very wide control. This 
last set of facts we have arbitrarily, and for purposes of study, 
divided into two groups. The physical and formal features of the 
institution we have grouped under the head of “the management 
process,” in order to accentuate the function of such features, 
rather than their form; while those which have to do with the 
direction and control of the process were to be dealt with under 
the title of “teacher.” We are to think of school management, 
then, by thinking of children; of the process of their development; 
and of the person who directs that process 
hi   
    
      he aim of the school with respect to each is clear} This in- 
Volved a study of the biological, psychological, and physical factors 
in child nature on the one hand, and of sociological and institu- 
tional facts on the other. 
This study of individuality brought to light the fundamental 
relation between theory and practice in school work, from which 
we saw not only the relation of aim to management, and of correct 
method to the accomplishment of a given aim, but also the respon- 
sibility of the teacher with respect to the why of all her work. 
Finally, the nature and scope of the teacher’s task from the 
standpoint of the physical factors she is to deal with, the plant and 
equipment, the formal organization of children and materials, and 
her relationship to her community and to her fellow school officers, 
was examined. | From this we saw that the task of managing a 
school is far more complex to-day than it was when social and

industrial life were simpler, and that the teacher’s task is one which 
involves technical knowledge and professional skill, as well as a 
good personality. 
In the chapters which follow we shall examine in greater detail 
the problems affecting the child (part 1), the process of manage- 
ment (part m1), and the teacher (part 1v), which have been out- 
lined in the above discussion. Ook

2. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
. What advantage is there in thinking of a blackboard, a plan of pro- 
motion, or a daily time schedule in terms of their use in the school? 
. How would you classify the materials with which the teacher must 
work in managing a school? 
. What is a correct basis for measuring the efficiency of a management 
plan? What is the advantage of making out as complete plans as 
possible before the time they are to go into effect? 
. Why do most plans have to be slightly elastic? TIlustrate. 
. For what kind of problems is it impossible to have fixed plans? 
. Why is it economical to develop set ways of carrying on certain 
features of schoolroom procedure? What plans of this type have you 
used? What educational return did you expect from them? 
. Is there relatively less emphasis placed upon the teacher’s personality 
than formerly? Why? 
. In what sense is the teacher a state officer? 
. Explain the teacher’s relationship to the various other school officers, 
and show why, in a large school, success is dependent upon the way 
in which the work of individual teachers is codrdinated. 
What should be the relation of the teacher to the social life of the 
community? 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
. Draw up a list of questions you might wish to submit to your super- 
visor on each of the following subjects: 
a. Getting a clear general aim for management work. 
b. Getting a clear aim for the task of doing away with use of slang 
and incorrect speech. 
c. Utilizing extracurricular activities for social training. 
d. Bringing the plan of seating pupils to bear upon the solution 
of problems of order and codperative study. 
Outline a plan for handling the wraps in a class, and explain how you 
would hope to get educational returns on its use.

The purpose of this part. The child is the fundamental 
point about which all our study of management must finally 
center. He is the sole object for whom all plans are to be 
made, and only in so far as any plan or device facilitates his 
development can it be considered effective. 
We have set forth above the ends which are to be sought 
in the child’s training, showed how those ends must function 
in management, and indicated the materials which must be 
dealt with in attaining those ends. 
The interests of the child are therefore the beginning and 
end of every plan, or program, or basic principle, which 
enters into our study of this subject. How to help the child 
to comprehend the meaning of the institution of which he is 
to become a part, how to bring him into congenial rela- 
tionship with his teacher and with the other members of the 
school, how to secure his regular attendance, to manage him 
when he is disobedient and disorderly, to reform him when 
he is unsocial, to provide him with appropriate incentives for 
right behavior and study, and to know when we have secured 
the desired results, will be our next group of problems.
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
1. The child’s contact with the school 
Responsive character of childhood. The child is natu- 
rally responsive to kindly treatment. His membership in 
the home has given him six years of most intimate and per- 
sonal experience with his parents, who have thus far d’ 
rected him. Now the teacher is to stand in loco parentis, 
and it will be her task to assume this responsibility in reality. 
This means that she shall seek to establish between the child 
and herself, and between the different children, those same 
intimate personal relationships they have thus far known 
only in the home. If this is really undertaken the response of 
the child will be immediate, and the development of a real 
sense of membership will go forward rapidly. 
With such relationships once established the school can 
then guarantee to the child the widest freedom for personal 
development, and at the same time teach him the larger 
meaning of his place in a social world. ‘There will be room 
for his play, for his imagination, for his reasoning, for his 
judgment, for his will, all, to find expression in terms of the 
claims put upon them by his fellows. 
Developing new companions. Previous to his entering 
school the child has had but few companions outside the 
home. With this limited experience in forming new com- 
panionships, he now faces the necessity and opportunity of 
becoming a member of a new and larger circle. 
Heretofore we have largely ignored this as a problem in 
managing children. The child was allowed to shift for him- 
self. If he found friends easily he soon felt himself a member 
of the new circle; if he was timid and quiet he went along 
suffering until, in a sense, he was swallowed up by the group. 
Just here we find the teacher’s responsibility as a manager. 
“Becoming a member” in a classroom has much in common 
with becoming a member of a church, of a business corpora- 
tion, of a lodge, of a golf club, of a sewing circle, of a political
-P-A-G-E-69
  MEMBERSHIP AND ATTENDANCE 57 
party, or of a profession. We are greatly in need of scientific 
studies of how the child develops this sense of membership, 
and of the handicaps suffered by college students and by 
adults in facing social situations of this character.! 
The least a teacher could do would be to study her own 
pupils, and to take a hand in getting the timid ones adjusted 
and the bolder ones subdued. For this the very first day of 
school is important. Get acquainted with mother and child 
as they enter; take special pains with those who are new in 
the community. Remember that no two children are alike. 
The teacher as leader. In this program the teacher is 
the leader. It is her task to see to it that not one but every 
pupil shall live up to these possibilities. All shall work and 
play freely, all shall initiate ideas and actions. For the 
teacher the problem of establishing this membership, then, 
is not to be left to chance. It is a problem of executive 
training and deserves a far more careful study than has so 
_ far been given to it, or than can be devoted to it in the brief 
space available for it here. 
2. The attendance problem in the large 
The State’s interest in attendance. If such membership 
is to be established, then one of the first problems is that of 
attendance. Society is attempting to provide for all its 
children the kind of introduction to school life which we have 
just described. This is the State’s gift to its children, and 
from the standpoint of a trained citizenship, it is highly de- 
sirable that every child should improve this opportunity to 
the full limits of its possibilities by regular and punctual at- 
tendance. 
State legislatures have enacted compulsory-attendance 
laws in order to protect children from the ignorance and

in Journal of Educational Research, vol. xv, pp. 126-32. (Sept., 1926.)

58 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
selfishness of such parents as fail to appreciate the value of 
education, yet in the face of these laws our school records 
show that there are yet many difficulties to be overcome be- 
fore perfect attendance can be realized. 
Aspects of the problem. In the school the problem pre- 
sents itself in three different forms. First, there is the child 
who is rarely or never in school; second, the child whose at- 
tendance is irregular; and third, the child who is frequently 
late to school. The first of these is supposed to be cared for 
by the compulsory-attendance and child-labor laws of the 
State. Yet the attendance records in almost any city afford 
ample evidence that these laws are even yet to a large degree 
ineffective! The second and third types constitute the 
teacher’s problem in management. Who these absentees 
are, why they are irregular, the difficulties they create in the 
school, and how they can be most effectively dealt with, are 
questions which the teacher and principal must attempt to 
answer. 
8. Causes and consequences of such irregularities 
Causes classified. There are almost as many causes of 
these evils as there are types of human nature. There are 
just causes, such as illness, severe storms, serious trouble in 
the home, etc., which are legitimate reasons for absence or 
tardiness. But of unjust causes there isno end. Read the 
excuses which children bring to school: “Had to help 
mother,” “Father wanted me to run an errand,” “Didn’t 
feel well,” “Had to stay with baby,” “Wanted to stay out 
m Jay and rest.” These are typical. 
The cause may, however, lie within the school itself: a 
+ Out of 57,830 cases of absence in St. Louis, in 1913-14, taking this 
city as an illustration, there were 2383 which were due to truancy by 728 
different children. In this same year itwas found that 90.6 per cent of the 
truants were retarded in their work. (Annual Report of the Superintendent 
of Schools.)
-P-A-G-E-71
  MEMBERSHIP AND ATTENDANCE 59 
cross, unsympathetic teacher, a formal curriculum, a stiff 
and unnatural school atmosphere, a gloomy, uncomfortable 
room, are often causes which will not be mentioned in the 
child’s written excuses, and yet are true— and one is 
tempted to say justifiable — causes of such irregularities. 
What poor attendance means. School, like time and tide, 
waits for no child. Whether he is out for a good or a bad 
reason his opportunity is slipping by, and when he returns, 
after a day or a week out of class he will find his work harder, 
his own interest materially weakened, and the temptation to 
quit and go to work more pressing than ever. These are 
not mere opinions any longer, as numerous studies of re- 
tardation go to show.! In a recent study of the annual re- 
ports from one hundred and thirty-four city school systems, 
the writer found that practically one fifth of the superin- 
tendents of those cities had recommended some revision in 
the methods of handling the various problems of attendance.” 
There is yet another consequence which must not be 
minimized, and that is that such irregularity causes the child 
to lose respect for the school and for learning, while de- 
veloping in him habits of slovenliness where there should 
be habits of punctuality. From the standpoint of sound 
manhood, to say nothing of the claims of business and social 
life later, no pains should be spared to establish the proper 
habits, and to fix in the minds of children the importance of 
promptness and regularity in all school activities. At- 
tendance is one vital point at which this type of training 
should begin. 
4. The first step in meeting the issue, analysis 
Adequate records and reports necessary. In every man-

agement problem a full understanding of the facts and what 
they mean to all concerned — the child, the school, the 
State — is the first step to be taken. The State has provided 
the legal machinery for handling the problem, and it is the 
business of the schools to make that machinery effective. 
This is being done with some degree of success in the larger 
cities, where a complicated system of records and reports 
provides the necessary information for the officers in charge, 
but in the smaller towns and in rural communities, where a 
single attendance officer must cover a large territory, the 
work frequently is inefficient or entirely neglected, and thou- 
sands of children are out of school as a result. 
Cases demand individual treatment. As has been sug- 
gested above, the apparent cause of absence or tardiness is 
not always the realone. To get at the real cause the teacher 
must know her pupils at home as well as at school. Often 
the home conditions explain the case fully. Many parents 
are thoughtless or indifferent, and the complete lack of any 
system in his home life makes it practically impossible for 
the child to apply system to his school work. Under such 
circumstances the child deserves pity rather than repri- 
mand. 
But the home is not always the source of the trouble. 
There is the careless pupil, the physically defective, and also 
the truant. These cases must be studied fully. To punish 
hastily is often to aggravate rather than to remove the cause. 
Of one thing the teacher may feel reasonably sure, and that 
is that no two cases are alike. This means that each case 
must be studied individually if it is to be intelligently dealt 
with. 
Once the case has been carefully diagnosed some sort of 
remedy may be proposed. Whatever method is decided 
upon it must be in terms of the needs of the particular child 
in question.

5. The second step, what to do 
Make school life attractive. If the first step is to analyze 
the situation, the second must be to determine what action 
to take. Prevention is to be our first line of attack. We 
cannot assume that the issue will never arise, and conse- 
quently we must try to anticipate it. This may be done in 
two ways, one positive and the other negative. We may 
make school so attractive that the child will want to come, 
or we may resort to coercion. 
The school may be made attractive in two ways. First 
by seeing to it that the principles developed in the above 
chapters are fully applied every day, and with respect to 
every pupil who enters school. Tardiness is often overcome 
entirely by having opening exercises that are worth while. 
The school may also be made attractive by the use of re- 
wards, such as prizes, holidays, and the like. These are for 
the most part little short of bribes, and will usually react 
badly, for the reason that they imply that “being good” 
will purchase some sort of relief from the unpleasantness of 
school work.! The use of an honor roll, the keeping of indi- 
vidual records of the pupils by themselves, wholesome ri- 
valry between classes, a five-minute warning bell, and other 
similar devices may often be used to good effect, but a poor 
school will sooner or later offset the effect of the best devices, 
while a good school will make them unnecessary. 
Coercion the last resort. When all efforts of this kind 
have failed, then coercion is the only recourse, and no time 
should be lost in applying such measures as will get results. 
Here is where the teacher becomes a diagnostician. She 
must make a full study of each case, looking into the pu- 
pil’s home life, his physical condition, his likes and dislikes 
in school work, records of his past conduct and scholarship, 
the types of his associates in school and out; then, once all

the facts are clear, she must attack the causes of the trouble. 
Nor should she be satisfied until every cause has been re- 
moved. In such little investigations the teacher will often 
get the most pointed sorts of criticism of her own work. 
These she should treasure and not scorn. 
In some cases the teacher will be able to remove the cause 
with little or no friction, but in others she will not. Then 
some kind of force must be used. Here the possibilities of 
error arealsogreat. Scolding, threats, keeping in after hours, 
demerits, extra study, and all similar devices will only add to 
the child’s dislike of school, and should seldom or never be 
used. Corporal punishment, or loss of privileges may be re- 
sorted to or the case may go at once to the attendance officer. 
The attendance department. This takes the case out of 
the teacher’s hands, but suggests a certain other duty which 
she has in connection with matters of attendance, viz., that 
of keeping accurate and full records of every case, and of re- 
porting all cases promptly and in good form to the proper 
officer. The beginning of these duties lies in taking care 
that an adequate excuse is brought from home by the child 
each time he is absent or tardy. By a little tact and persist- 
ence, the standard for excuses can be brought up to where it 
belongs. The next step is recording the essential facts in 
each case for future reference and as a basis for a report to 
the attendance officer. In the large city the whole question 
of attendance is handled by a separate department, carefully 
organized for that purpose. A study of the organization and 
working of such a department is recommended to the teacher 
who wishes a larger perspective for this important aspect of 
her work.!

1915 has been published. See “The Bureau of Attendance and Child Wel- 
fare of the New York City Public School System,” by Paul Klapper, in

By these and similar means the teacher may hope to put 
an end to the various kinds of leakage that result from poor 
attendance. In doing so she will guarantee to the child pro- 
tection against the greed or ignorance of others and against 
his own lack of foresight, and also will provide him with a 
right point of view and a wholesome set of habits with re- 
spect to the matter of regularity and promptness in school 
work. Furthermore, if due precaution is taken to keep the 
principles of regularity and punctuality clearly before the 
child as principles, and fully applied in other things, as well 
as attendance, there is no doubt that the child will have one 
acquisition that is as useful out of school as it is in school. 
In this chapter we have outlined the problems to be treated 
in Part II, and have discussed the questions of membership and 
attendance. 
We have seen that the teacher’s first problem is to help the child 
to establish the right sort of contacts with the school, which if 
accomplished will give him an understanding of his duties and 
privileges as a member of a new social body. This is primarily a 
problem of socialization and executive training. 
To manage this well involves first of all the question of regular 
and punctual attendance. Attendance is not merely a personal 
matter with the child alone, it is of immense importance to the 
school and to the State as well. 
In most schools there are three general types of cases that have 
to be dealt with. These are the truant, the irregular pupil, and the 
pupil who is habitually behind time. Innumerable causes account 
for these cases, some reasonable and some unreasonable, which the 
teacher must understand before she can hope to control. In gen- 
eral her diagnosis of a given case will require a study of the child’s 
relationships with the school and with his work and play, as well 
as for an understanding of his health and of the home influences 
involved. Her success will depend upon her ability to perfect these 
adjustments, or perhaps finally upon resort to legal authority 
exercised by the attendance department. : . |

QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
. If regular and punctual attendance is a fair measure of the efficiency 
of your teaching, what figures would you use in finding your own 
grade of efficiency and stating it in percentage form? 
State (see State School Law) and explain: 
a. What officers are necessary to administer the law? 
b. What records and reports are necessary to make the law effective? 
ce. Just how would you proceed in placing one of your pupils in 
the hands of that law? 
. About what percentage of the total enrollment can we expect to be 
in average daily attendance? See city and State school reports. 
. Make a list of the main facts you would expect to bring to light in 
diagnosing a case of truancy. What would you do if you found the 
blame to rest entirely with the parents? 
. Why is a careful study of each case necessary? 
. In terms of the compulsory attendance law of your State, what con- 
stitutes a legitimate excuse for absence? 
. What is the influence of irregular attendance on the rate of promo- 
tion? Look up half a dozen prominent studies of retardation, or make 
a study of the past attendance records of an eighth-grade class in 
your school. 
. In what way does the child who is frequently out of school for a day 
or two at a time impose an injustice on his class? Make a careful 
study of a few cases in your own room to see just the nature and 
amount of trouble that each case causes. 
. What special devices do you know for overcoming tardiness? 
. What objection is there to the granting of a half holiday to the class 
at the end of the month, if attendance has been perfect? 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
. Make as complete a list as you can of the institutions of which a boy 
may now or later have reason to become a member. Make separate 
lists for age-groups, as follows: 
a. Age 6 to 12 years. 
b. Age 12 to 18 years. 
c. Age 18 years and upwards. 
Analyze the meaning and responsibility of membership in éach case 
in terms of knowledge, skill, and personal habits or qualities required, 
and then bring together in groups the names of pupils that are alike. 
. Having prepared a similar list and analysis for girls, consider where the 
child may expect to learn how to behave as a good member of any of 
the institutions in question. To what extent could the school hope to

lay the foundations for these future needs, and where in the school 
would the instruction be given?

1. What we mean by discipline 
Two types of discipline. In a well-governed school pro- 
blems of order and discipline! do not exist apart from pro- 
blems of directing the regular work and play of school life. 
In a badly governed school the opposite is true. In the one 
case the question of discipline is only an incident, a phase of 
the total school procedure} ‘In the other discipline is by 
necessity an end in itself, since there the behavior does not 
facilitate study, recitation, and orderly play, and may even 
seriously disturb them./ So when. we speak of discipline 
we have in mind the mode of behavior, the manner of living 
and working together in the schools When these tend to 
bring teacher and pupils into pleasant and profitable rela- 
tionships, and so to produce a natural and comfortable-so- 
1 The practical schemes that are being used by city superintendents for 
rating their teachers place the item “efficiency in discipline” as of very 
first importance. (See The Fourteenth Year Book of the Nawondl Society for 
the Study of Education, part u, p. 19.)

cial atmosphere, we call it a well-disciplined school. When 
they do not we say the school lacks in discipline. 
Meaning of natural discipline. Problems of order and 
discipline are by no means confined to the school. In fact 
their real meaning may be best understood if we first exam- 
ine typical modes of behavior in other institutions. If we 
look for the problem of discipline in such places as the street 
car, the church, the hotel, the bank, or the street, we find in 
each place particular modes of behavior which are adapted 
to the comfort and convenience of those present. Yet in 
no two of these places is the behavior the same, and in no 
one of them is the behavior well adapted to school purposes. 
So, when we say that the school must be like life we do not 
mean that its discipline must be like the discipline in the 
shop or home, or at a picnic. (We mean, rather, that school 
discipline is to be just as intimately adapted to school life as 
is the discipline at church to religious life, or as is the disci- 
pline on the street car to the convenience and comfort of 
the passengers. 
2. The teacher’s problem 
The application, not the formulation, of principles. The 
teacher’s problem, then, is one of establishing and maintain- 
ing standards of conduct.!. These standards cannot be 
copied from standards in vogue outside the school, but must 
be determined by the nature of school life itself. 3 
This does not mean, however, that school discipline has 
nothing in common with discipline elsewhere. Common 
ideals and standards of politeness and codperation obtain 
everywhere the same. Just as people who are entering a 
car step aside until passengers desiring to leave the car have 
1 Investigations have shown that weak discipline is more often the 
cause of teachers’ failures than is any other one thing. See Buellesfield, 
“Causes of Failures among Teachers,” in Educational Administration and 
Supervision, vol. 1, p. 489 (September, 1915).

    68 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
got off, so, in school, the same principle of politeness demands 
that a child shall not break into a line or into a game when 
by so doing he will discommode other pupils. The > difference 
is not in the principle of conduct, but in the occasions which 
call the principle into action. “Thus the teacher’s task is not 
one of developing a néw set of moral or social principles of 
behavior. Hers is the much more practical task of seeing 
that the accepted standards of society are not obscured by 
the new set of conditions which the child meets with in the 
school, and that they are properly applied in the behavior 
\. best adapted to life in the school. 
The child’s need for information. When the child enters 
eta for the first time he is quite as much a stranger to the 
_ appropriate modes of behavior there as is the country youth 
to the signals of a traffic officer in a large city. And just as 
the boy from the country has to learn the law and the eti- 
quette of city streets, so the new pupil must learn the law and _ 
the etiquette of the schoolroom. Consequently disciplining 
a school involves first of all, a clear conception of the best 
odes of behavior, that is, a clear aim, on the part of the 
Heacher; and Secondly—the-estapTishent oF Bose modes 
discipline a post ‘uctive program, web dexslonmagyt 
‘cftried out with the om ering class and maintained from 
grade to grade, problems of restoring order would seldom ap- 
pear apart from other aspects of instruction. Since this is 
often not the case the teacher is confronted not only with 
the task of establishing the right standards, but, first of all, 
with that of breaking down wrong standards.    
3. Bad discipline and its causes 
When a school is disorderly. We have said that a school 
is disorderly when the accepted modes of behavior are not
-P-A-G-E-81
  ORDER AND DISCIPLINE 69 
suited to the chief aims of the school. If people began to 
enter the train before the passengers had alighted there 
would be much loss of time. If automobile drivers had not 
adopted the rule of “keeping to the right” there would be 
confusion, to say the least. Ladies remove their hats at 
the theater, the clerk waits on the customers in the order 
of their coming, and people enter the church quietly be- 
cause these are the accepted “‘best ways” for all concerned. 
Similarly in school there is confusion, loss of time, and 
little accomplished when the accepted ways of doing things 
are not ways which are best suited to the end sought. If all 
talk at once no one can hear; if some play while others work 
there is little satisfaction for either group. If children move 
at widely different rates of speed in entering or leaving the 
room there is friction and discomfort; if a pupil does not 
respond promptly when called upon to recite there is loss of 
time for all. 
Yet the order at the station, on the street, and in the store, 
is not always perfect. The call of the conductor to “Let 
the passengers off, please”; the quiet voice of the usher say- 
ing, “Please remove your hat”’; the clerk’s “Pardon, sir, I 
believe this gentleman is ahead of you,” suggest to us that 
some one has failed to conform to the accepted best style of _ 
conduct. {Some people fail to conform because they do not \~< 
know the accepted procedure, others because they tempo- 
rarily do not think, and’ others in order to get an advantage “ 
for themselves.) Similarly in school(there is the same need 
for a firm, quiet command to set the ignorant, the forgetful, 
and the mischievous or mean pupil straight in line with 
the best behavior. } 
Studying and removing the causes. The school that is a" 
failure because of disorder is one where the many instead of 
the few ignore the best ways of doing things, where the com- 
mon principles of politeness have given place to indifference
-P-A-G-E-82
  70 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
and insolence, and where much of the conduct is designed 
to defeat the chief aims of the school. The net result in 
extreme cases is anarchy, the occasional expression of mob 
violence, and general social disintegration. 
If such infringements of good order in the school are to 
be corrected, the cause must be studied and removed. (The 
teacher cannot long remain a mere police officer in her room. 
Why then does the question of correction arise, why are the 
accepted modes of behavior in the classroom disturbed by 
the ignorant, the forgetful, or the malicious child? It is 
with the motive that any effective remedy must deal. CA 
child should not be punished for not conforming to a pro- 
cedure which he does not understand.) A brief analysis of 
a few typical causes of bad order, therefore, should at least 
furnish the teacher with a more critical point of view for 
meeting such cases. 
Bad order due to lack of understanding. The child who 
is entering school for the first ‘time has much more to learn 
outside of books than inside. He has a whole set of new 
adjustments to make, some physical, some intellectual, 
but mainly social. He is facing life in a new and strange 
institution, and has before him the large task not only of 
understanding the institution but of becoming a part of it. 
He must learn to play a part, to codperate with a group of 
strangers in a new enterprise. If with such children the 
teacher fails to make very clear the plan of work from hour 
to hour there will be hesitating, with continuous miscarriage 
of the program. However innocent this disorder may be 
as to motive, it is none the less dangerous to the develop- 
ment of right habits of procedure. 
There are certain other cases which come under this head 
that the teacher must learn to recognize. Children come 
from different types of homes, where different standards of 
politeness and refinement prevail. It is therefore much more  
-P-A-G-E-83
ee Reh eS Ree Ochs nae OTe aE Ue aN Ty nn Pewee ee a 
ORDER AND DISCIPLINE 71 
difficult for some children to conduct themselves acceptably 
in the school than it is for others. “The teacher must not 
mistake crudity which is due to lack of home training, for 
crudity which is due to indifference or malice.’ 
Bad order due to forgetfulness. The second group of 
cases are those which are due to inattention and forgetful- 
ness. How frequently a child excuses himself simply by 
saying, “I forgot.” And so the child forgets the lesson 
assignment; forgets to bring his book to school; forgets his 
place in the line when fire drill is called; forgets about crowd- 
ing, about leaving his books in order, keeping his written 
work neat, cleaning his shoes, washing his hands, or being 
courteous to other pupils. ' 
Such disorderliness is serious because it is so deep seated. 
It is a case of disorderly mind, of slovenly habits of thought 
as wellasof conduct. True, there may be behind this habit- 
ual inattention and forgetfulness certain physical or mental 
defects which tend to distract the child’s attention, and these 
are among the sources to which the teacher must look for the 
full explanation of the causes. But habits of inattention and 
forgetfulness may also be due to external causes. If there 
are no established ways of doing things in the school, ways 
which the teacher regularly insists upon, then it is easy to 
forget any exception to this. If assignments are not made 
with care, and if pupils are not regularly held up to those 
assignments, inattention is sure to result. If the teacher 
excuses a second or third offense there is little to induce the 
child to remember. 
Bad order due to mischievous or malicious motives. The 
third group of cases are those which the child himself re- 
cognizes as disorderly behavior. They range all the way from 
innocent pranks to studied malicious acts designed to de- 
stroy good order. Bubbling childhood must not be ignored. 
There must be room in the school for laughter and fun as   
 
-P-A-G-E-84
    72 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
well as for serious study. Yet there is a point beyond which 
jokes and pranks cannot wisely be permitted to go. 
It should be remembered that a large percentage of the 
little annoying mischievous acts is committed merely for 
fun, and that the fun is not in the act: itself but rather 
in displaying the act before other pupils, . John purposely 
mispronounces a word in reading, or attaches a paper to 
Tom’s coat, merely to cause a laugh. Throwing spitballs 
at the blackboard would not amuse James were it not for 
the fact that other children are looking on and marveling 
at his daring. The bent pin, the sly nudge, the hidden hat, 
the chalk down a neighbor’s back are further familiar illus- 
trations. ; 
These acts, while by no means harmless, do not present 
the serious problem which arises in cases of dishonesty, 
theft, immorality, and fighting. Of course home training, 
or a lack of it, influences in these as well as in other direc- 
tions. \If the moral standards of the home are low the 
children from that home present a special problem for that 
very reason.) But the causes are not all in home training, 
or in human nature, or in mental or physical defects; they 
are often in the associations formed by children. One bad 
pupil in a school may lead several good ones into very wrong 
ways.) ‘A cigarette smoker is likely to have imitators even 
among children from good homes if careful supervision is not 
exercised.. The gang, or the clique, or the club, is in many 
schools the most dangerous source of trouble. Out of fra- 
ternity the boy or girl is kindly and genteel; in it, snobbery 
often becomes a fashion which spreads like an infection to 
good and bad alike. Alone, the boy does not think of 
smoking, or gambling, or robbery; in the gang, he goes with 
the crowd. It is these associations, these social forces or 
fashions, which constitute the real cause. 
Looking for the underlying causes. In all cases of bad
-P-A-G-E-85
  ORDER AND DISCIPLINE %3 
conduct, then, we must look below the surface for the real 
motive. It may be deep down in human nature, it may be 
in present mental or physical conditions, it may be in home 
training or street training; but it may also be within the 
school itself.) If so, look to the general ideals of conduct and 
of work which are being enforced and see whether those 
ideals are steadily, or only spasmodically insisted upon. 
Look to the hygienic conditions of the room, and to the 
facilities for work. | Look to the social life, to the relations 
between pupils. Is John mischievous simply because he sits 
near James; have swearing, or “smoking, or bullying, or 
coarse play, jokes, and laughter become fashionable because 
of a certain pupil; is there any sort of group organization 
which is tending to isolate certain children from others? 
Or again, is the teacher a model of gentility and good breed- 
ing, is she industrious and businesslike in her work, and is 
she thoroughly human with it all? These are the possible 
sources to which we must look for the explanation of bad 
order in the school. Over a few of these causes the teacher 
may have no very direct control, but most of them she 
can reasonably hope to remove once they are fully under- 
stood. 
4. The influence of bad discipline 
Positive and negative influence. The influences of bad 
discipline are both positive and negative. Positive, in that 
the individual child and the class as a whole develop habits 
and ideals of behavior which are detrimental in life; nega- 
tive, in that the fundamental aims of the school are being 
defeated. Likewise the influence may be only temporary 
or it may be permanent; it may be direct or indirect. 
If the immediate value of good behavior is in a happy, 
well-directed schoolroom where efficient work is being ac- 
complished, its ultimate value is in sound moral, social, and  
-P-A-G-E-86
4 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
intellectual habits and ideals. Consequently any disorder 
whatsoever is a force in opposition to these ends. If a child 
is permitted to use coarse language, to leave his desk and 
books in disorder, to walk noisily through the room, to wear 
his hat in the house, it is true that the immediate effect ap- 
pears to be of but slight consequence, and such acts are often 
permitted to pass unnoticed or with only a slight reminder. 
The ultimate effect, however, is a group of habits and ideals 
of slovenliness where there should be habits nd ideals of 
refinement. 
Immediate and remote bearings of conduct. In such 
cases it is not the immediate but the remote bearing of the 
conduct that counts. The school may suffer slightly, but 
it will not immediately go to pieces under such strain. 
Similarly, the child may seem a bit less refined but not 
specially unruly. But if such acts are allowed to pass un- 
noticed their accumulated effect will ultimately not only 
rob the child of the opportunity to develop habits of 
refinement but fasten upon him habits of the opposite 
sort. Similarly, by its influence on others it will coarsen 
the behavior in the room and in time lower the aecepted 
standard of good order. 
In other cases of a more serious nature the same principles 
hold true, only that the influence is increased in intensity. 
An act which involves genuine disobedience, gross neglect, 
or base immorality, is immediately destructive of the sense 
of decency and justice both to the child and to the group, 
and if allowed to pass unnoticed by the teacher such conduct 
will quickly undermine the order of the school. 
All behavior enters into environment. All behavior, 
“good or bad, by o1 one > or by n many pupils, constitutes a part 
of the environment, and operates as one of the educational 
forces under which the child is placed. As such its influence 
is good or bad in some degree. It is not neutral. There is  
-P-A-G-E-87
ORDER AND DISCIPLINE 15 
no waiting between acts; growth is going on in terms of 
whatever forces there are present. 
Again, every act in the room which is recognized by the 
teacher as in the least unruly or out of line with her ideas 
of good order consumes a certain amount of her energy 
which might otherwise go into her teaching. A constant 
drain of this sort will in time result in nervousness which 
rapidly lowers the teacher’s power to control either by ex- 
ample or by precept. The same influence will be felt by the 
pupils, particularly by those who are sensitive to any sort of 
noise or friction. (Disorder therefore thrives on what it 
feeds upon. The same, however, is just as true of orderli- 
ness and system. 
5. Conditions essential to good order 
Public opinion and authority the bases of control. As 
on the train, in the store, or on the street, so in the school 
there are two forces which operate to maintain good disci- 
pline. These forces are public opinion and legal authority. 
Just as the burglar is not restrained by public opinion from 
imposing upon society, and so makes it necessary to have 
peace officers who can apply force, so in the school there is 
the occasional pupil who for one reason or another will not 
conform to the accepted usages in the school without 
coercion. (Likewise as the mere presence of a policeman re- 
strains many from unsocial acts on the street, so the mere 
presence of a strong teacher who habitually deals promptly 
and vigorously with offenders in the school, constitutes an 
important restraining force. ) 
The teacher to help form public opinion. For the teacher 
to control public opinion in the school, then, is of the utmost 
importance. If John is told in the presence of the class that 
he is not to repeat a certain act, he will almost certainly look 
about to see whether the other pupils are with him or against 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  16 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
him. If he feels that the teacher’s reprimand is in disfavor, 
he is very sure to cause further trouble. If, on the other 
hand, he detects no sympathy in the glances which other 
pupils give him he is very likely to yield promptly to the 
teacher’s wish. 
How to get and maintain control over public opinion 
in the school thus becomes the teacher’s first large problem 
in establishing conditions for good discipline. This can be 
done only through the exercise of leadership. A boss who 
controls a school by a constant display of authority will win 
only, by suppressing the children’s freedom in a very large 
sense. If in the end such a teacher does not appear to have 
failed it will be only in appearance, for under such oppres- 
sion children do not learn to think for themselves and to 
control and direct their own energies among their fellows. 
While authority is in no sense to be surrendered by the 
teacher, neither is it to be used for mere display, or because- 
to lead is often more troublesome than to drive. 
Knowledge the basis of leadership. (No one can-dead 
who does not know the way. The teacher who does not 
know more than she must teach, who does not frequently 
do some fresh thinking about her subjects, cannot long hide 
these limitations from children. And while children respect, 
even reverence wisdom, they are quick to scoff at a lack of it, 
and no teacher can quickly regain a child’s confidence on this 
point once it has been lost. This applies also to dress, man- 
ners, speech, and general attitude. 
System saves time and friction. A place for everything 
and everything in its place is a maxim which applies not 
only to furniture, supplies, window shades, and wraps, but 
to children, to recitations, to study time, to illustrations in 
teaching, and to ideas as well. The teacher who begins the 
day without a definite plan of her work will frequently have 
to retrace her steps. The geography class is called, and only
-P-A-G-E-89
  
ORDER AND DISCIPLINE 17 
after the recitation is started does the teacher discover that 
a certain important map has not been hung; that the speci- 
mens of grain, stone, or oil from the fields, quarries, or wells 
of the region being studied are still in the cabinet. Anas- 
signment in history is made by saying, “To-morrow we will 
take the lesson on the settlement at Jamestown,” but no 
suggestion is made that the children look at the maps, and 
no reference is made to a delightful little book full of stories 
about John Smith. Consequently the next day when these 
things are brought in by the teacher they are but half ap- 
preciated, because the children were not properly prepared 
forthem. Time is lost by trying to do for the children things 
they would have done for themselves had their work been 
properly systematized. 
Similarly in moving the children into and out of the room, 
in getting supplies distributed, in the fire drill, where the 
procedure from the beginning should be systematized and 
reduced to habit, there is certain to be.confusion and all its 
evil GOnsequences where and when such system fails to do 
its work. 
Energy and persistence ‘are contagious. If the teacher 
knows her work thoroughly, has it well systematized, and 
then pursues it with energy and persistence, the example 
will surely be followed by her pupils. Chancellor Jordan 
has said that “the world steps aside to let a man pass who 
knows where he is going.” It is this type of man who puts 
his knowledge to account in the achievement of a purpose, 
and does not quit until that purpose is achieved. Such a 
teacher is irresistible as a leader of children, who are quick 
to imitate behavior which they admire. Such a teacher does 
not leave tasks half done, nor does she permit pupils to do 
so. If a theme is handed in which is not neat, then the 
paper must be done over. Nor does it stop there, for all 
written work is watched for the same thing, and the idea of 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
78 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
neatness is pushed further to include arrangement of books 
and papers, clean shoes, hands, face, nails, and teeth, clean 
language, and clean sport. 
(The teacher who makes no mean no, and yes mean yes, is 
the teacher who is obeyed without question or argument. 
When snowballing has been forbidden on the street the mat- 
ter is not left to care for itself. While the wise teacher 
will not make herself a spy she will take care to know 
that such acts have ceased, and where they do not she 
will deal with them promptly until they have been com- 
pletely stopped. , If she tells a boy that he must have his 
hair combed she will follow the case morning after morning 
until the habit is fixed. The very certainty that the teacher 
means what she says, that she will do exactly what she says 
she will do, and do it in no half-hearted way, will perhaps be 
feared by a few who can only be conquered by fear, but it} 
will be respected by all, and imitated by most. Such dis- 
integrating forces as laziness, slothfulness, irregularity, can- 
not thrive in such an atmosphere. 
Fair play and good cheer. Pessimism and discontent! 
cannot thrive in an atmosphere of fair play and good cheer. 
In every schoolroom justice, seasoned with mercy, of course, 
must be dealt out to all alike. (There must be no favorites. 
The most troublesome child is likely to be a strong admirer} 
of the principle of the “square deal,” and all children will 
support the teacher in her insistence upon the application 
of that principle on the playground, in the recitation, in her 
own assignments of work, and in her administration of 
punishment. 
But justice, or fair play, is cold and harsh unless applied 
in a spirit of good cheer. (The successful banker is one who 
can refuse a loan to his customer and yet send him away] 
feeling that he has been well treated.) Anger is no part o 
justice, and in almost any case will be resented. In school]  
-P-A-G-E-91
  ORDER AND DISCIPLINE 79 
government it is often necessary to be firm, but firmness is 
always strengthened and never weakened by kindness. A 
cheerful face and cheerful words dispel suspicion and pessi- 
mism and stimulate codperation. The clouded, tear-stained 
face of a pupil entering to relate a grievance is often 
brightened by a cheerful remark from his teacher, who, 
anticipating the child’s errand, deliberately sidetracks it 
until the child is in a mood not to exaggerate the facts. 
Self-control a large element. It is almost self-evident 
that one who cannot control himself cannot control others. 
Children as well as adults respect the man of poise, be- 
cause he is not one to be moved by mere sentiment to do 
foolish things. The teacher who can so control herself under 
vexing circumstances that she does not act hastily, or show 
nger, or speak harshly, is the teacher to trust, if only for 
the reason that the children need such an example before 
them to imitate. 
- Other elements of leadership. There are other elements 
of leadership which enter in a lesser way, such as a good 
voice, proper dress, manners, and speech, and good health, 
and which will help to determine the extent to which the 
teacher will be able to direct the public opinion within her 
school, and so to maintain high standards of order and dis- 
cipline through the power of leadership. 
If the teacher will apply the principles here set forth to 
the physical conditions of her room and equipment, to her 
relations with pupils, to her instruction, and to her own pre- 
paration for her work, she will have provided the most favor- 
able conditions possible for good order. This is attacking 
the problem in a constructive way. Pupils living in such an 
atmosphere will have a program so full and so well organized 
that there will be little time left for irregularities of any sort. 
In spite of such a program, however, the exceptional 
case will arise, over which public opinion and good teaching  
-P-A-G-E-92
    80 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
will have no influence. Such cases can be met only by th 
firm hand of authority. If obedience is not willing, it must 
be enforced. How force is to be used, and its relation to the 
fundamental task of instruction will be problems for another 
chapter. 
6. Chapter summary 
To summarize, then, let us keep in mind that school discipline 
has to do with modes of behavior in the school, in the same sense 
that applies on the street, or elsewhere in the world outside the 
school; that such problems can never be separated from the regular 
work of instruction; and that they are, for the teacher, an end in 
themselves only when behavior constitutes rebellion against the 
school. Let us remember that the teacher’s problem hinges on 
establishing the commonly-accepted moral and social principles of 
conduct in the behavior of her pupils individually and as a group, 
keeping in mind that bad discipline is detrimental in the school in 
precisely the same sense that it is detrimental on the street, and 
that it can be corrected only by removing its cause; that the cause 
may be inherent in the child’s mental or physical make-up, in his 
present physical or mental conditions, in his previous training or 
the lack of it, or in the way in which the school is conducted. 
Let us remember that the teacher must study each case with a 
view to removing its cause; or anticipate cases by setting up condi- 
tions which will tend to prevent their appearance. And further, 
that such conditions can only be established through the influence 
of leadership and authority. Leadership involves a full knowledge 
of what and how to teach, the use of systematic methods of work, 
the application of energy, persistence, justice, and good cheer; 
and the use of self-control, good manners, and correct dress, voice, 
and language. ( Authority must be used sparingly and with dignity, 
and never for mere display, or because it is easier than leadership. 
( Finally,(we must bear in mind that true leadership will always be 
backed up by public opinion, which is one of the most potent forces 
or control in the school, as it is everywhere else in life. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Explain the meaning of discipline in the light of the statement that 
in a well-governed school problems of order and discipline do not 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
  
  
10. 
Il. ORDER AND DISCIPLINE 81 
exist apart from problems of directing the regular work and play of 
the school. 
. When is a school said to be badly disciplined? Mention several cases 
of bad behavior in the school, and several cases of a similar sort which 
might occur on the street or at a public assembly. What common 
elements do you find in the two sets of cases? 
. To what extent and in what specific ways do the established principles 
of good behavior apply in schoolroom behavior? 
. To what extent is the problem for a foreign child, or a child entering 
school for the first time, a problem of learning lessons from books? 
To what extent is it a problem of adjusting himself to a new and 
strange set of physical and social conditions? Is the teacher’s large 
problem in such cases that of teaching book lessons, or is it mainly 
that of establishing modes of behavior that are well adapted to the 
handling of book lessons? What are some of the things a child would 
have to learn during his first week in school? 
. What is the importance of establishing right modes of behavior from 
the start? Mention certain parts of school procedure which should 
be reduced to routine. 
. Outline the causes of bad discipline, and suggest typical cases under 
each type. Why is “I didn’t think” a poor excuse for a child to offer 
as an explanation of wrong behavior? How can children be taught to 
remember the right thing to do? 
. Why is it necessary to study each individual case of disorderly con- 
duct separately? What would you look for as the possible explana- 
tion of a disturbance due to too much whispering? 
. Explain, by typical cases, what is meant by positive and negative 
influence of bad conduct. 
. In what ways does popular opinion operate in the control of the 
school? Should the teacher definitely undertake to formulate the 
public opinion of her class with respect to such problems as (1) the 
degree of quiet best suited to the work, (2) the extent to which whis- 
pering is permissible, (3) fair play on the playground, (4) hard work, 
(5) good manners, (6) right use of library, (7) proper reading matter? 
Where will authority be effective in formulating public opinion? 
Under what circumstances would any use of force cause the teacher 
to lose control of public opinion? 
Name the elements of leadership which a teacher must show posses- 
sion of if she hopes to direct public opinion in her room. Outline 
several cases, to show how these elements play a part in control. 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
. Make as complete a list as you can of the particular things a child will 
have to learn about being an active member of a school group, in a 
   
-P-A-G-E-94
    82 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
school where pupils enjoy large freedom of movement and where they 
are in a manner self-governing, though where the actual authority 
and machinery of control are retained by the teacher. 
2. What is the nature of the problems faced by a teacher who has two 
pupils like the following: 
a. Very talkative; a born and determined leader who does not wait 
for group decision, but tries to have the say in the class and out; 
nervous in manner, always moving; does not mean to be impolite, 
but often is; not bad, but wears out everyone except himself. 
b. Extremely quiet; never speaks except when spoken to, even timid; 
does his work well as assigned, but never adds an original touch; 
follows well, but with no enthusiasm; prefers to be alone. 
8. Describe a well-disciplined school. 
a. Keep in mind the ideas of self-control, self-confidence, and in- 
dividual independence and responsibility. 
6. Show where and how training in self-restraint, in leadership, and 
in followership are taking place. 
c. Suggest types of information that are being acquired, habits 
and attitudes that are being formed, and skills that are being 
developed.

1. The reason for punishment 
| The group more important than the individual. However 
skillful the teacher may be in directing the public opinion 
in her school, however cleverly she may lead her pupils in 
the establishment of right modes of behavior toward one 
another, toward their work, and toward their play, there will 
always be the exceptional child, who, for one reason or an- 
other, will not conform to the accepted fashions of his little 
society. For such children there must always exist the rule 
of force. The school must be protected against the mis- 
conduct of any of its members who are inclined to ignore the 
rights and wishes of others, for society never sacrifices the 
group for the individual. 
Penalties, therefore, must constitute a part of the ma- 
chinery for maintaining good discipline. As such, though, 
they exist for use only in these exceptional cases, and are 
never for display.

2. Society’s attitude toward punishment 
The old idea. Throughout the Middle Ages and in our 
own colonial days and later, the idea of restraint was domi- 
nant. It was assumed that the child was by nature bad, 
and that punishment was necessary to bring him to 
humility and repentance. In the school the ferrule, the 
cowskin, the rawhide, and the rod were held in high re- 
spect. 
Everywhere, even in college, corporal punishments were 
common. We read of extreme corporal punishments ad- 
ministered in public, of pupils being made to flog one an- 
other, to stand on sharp pegs, to sit on nothing, to stoop and 
hold a nail or peg in the floor; of boxing ears, thumping on 
the head, shutting children in dark rooms, forcing them to 
hold their arms in a horizontal position; and of the use of the 
dunce cap as common practice. Along with this went a 
lengthy list of rules with specified punishments for each in- 
fraction. 
The new idea. This old idea of suppression has given 
place to a conception almost the opposite. We now think 
of the child as neither bad nor good by nature, but as having 
capacity for either. This removes the emphasis from sup- 
pression and places it upon guidance and instruction, and re- 
places the admonition of “‘don’t” with that of “do.” 
This change in attitude has not ruled out the idea of pun- 
ishment, but it has changed its meaning. The old idea of 
breaking the child’s will was wholly negative and psycho- 
logically unsound. The end is not to destroy; it is to con- 
struct. Repression, therefore, is not the end, and only in 
extreme cases is severe repression even a part of the process 
of correcting a pupil. Instead we look to the task of re- 
directing — of shifting the child’s energy from wrong to 
right attitudes. This is a task of instruction. 
Even with this change in viewpoint, however, we have
-P-A-G-E-97
| apes Maier eee aes Cac Ce iis nd aie elec iid} 
SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS 85 
found no perfect panacea for stubborn unsocial behavior 
that resents the usual methods of guidance. We have first 
to stop a force before we can reverse its direction. Where 
stopping the unsocial conduct is not accomplished by sug- 
gestion it may require force. It is at this point that punish- 
ment, somewhat like a stone wall in our path, must appear. 
Just how our new conception of punishment defines this 
stone wall is of importance. 
3. The meaning and end of punishment 
Punishment means pain. (Punishment means pain and v/ 
loss inflicted upon offenders, and unless there is pain, physi- 
cal or mental, there is no punishment. ) This is obvious 
enough, but it is sometimes overlooked by teachers who 
mistake their own feeling of relief at having “disposed of 
the case”’ for pain to the offender. A cuff on the ear, a sharp 
rebuke, an order to do so-and-so next time, consumes the 
teacher’s ire and leaves her feeling easier, while it may only 
provoke a knowing smile from the children, which pleases 
the offender. Such procedure not only is not punishment, 
but it is a severe blow to good order and tends to destroy the 
dignity of the teacher’s position. 
Must not express anger. “ Punishment must not mean Way 
merely an outlet for the teacher’s anger. Historically pun- } 
ishment has been supposed to represent the claims of jus- 
tice, and never the claims of some overwrought emotion on 
the part of the one who administers it. Punishment is to 
uphold the just claims of the school and not the personal 
rights of the teacher. The teacher is always in danger of 
interpreting an offense in terms of a personal insult to her- 
self, whereupon punishment becomes a matter of “get- 
ting even” with the pupil. No offense should ever be so 
interpreted. It may be so intended by the pupil, but the 
teacher will add much to her power by making it clear that   
   
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
the offense is against the school and against the teacher’s 
position, and not at all against her personally. That will 
make the teacher’s attitude that of protector of the rights 
of others and not of her own. Calmness and reasonableness 
then, instead of anger, should characterize her attitude, and 
the administering of punishment, will mean pain and regret 
instead of personal resentment. 
Immediate and remote dims. The immediate aim of 
punishment then is to maintain the dignity and rights of 
the school and of the teacher’s position, and to inflict pain 
on the offender. It is to reéstablish right relationships. The 
remote aim is to make those relationships more secure. This 
latter purpose tends to broaden the possible service which 
school penalties may be expected to render. 
Right relationships are not reéstablished until the of- 
fender is himself again a codperating member of the group. 
This he cannot become until he is completely reformed, 
when he will again possess the confidence of his fellow pupils, 
and of the teacher. Reform of the offender thus becomes 
one of the ultimate aims of all punishment. yo 
Every time a pupil commits an offense in school, his little 
society suffers a break in the bonds which secure to it all 
its group privileges. Consequently, punishment becomes a 
step not only in reéstablishing those bonds, but in making 
them more secure against a similar danger in the future. 
Punishment is thus used as a means of publicly condemning 
wrong, and of warning others against similar offense. 
Fundamental aims in punishment. There are thus set 
up three fundamental ends to be achieved through the ad- 
ministration of punishment: 
1. To give expression to society’s disapproval of wrong. 
2. To deter others from committing like offense. 
8. To reform the offender. 
Retribution not an aim. This purposely omits retribu-
-P-A-G-E-99
SE Se en eT a ee ee ee ee ee ae ee ee 
SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS 87 
tion as an end of punishment, and definitely declares against 
such a purpose, and that for two reasons: 
1. Society should not, any more than the individual, pun- 
ish in order to “get even” with the wrongdoer. It is not 
“getting even,” but self-protection that society wants. 
“Getting even” is a motive in fighting or quarreling, but 
society, the school, is not in the fighting or quarreling busi- 
ness. 
2. Reform of the individual cannot be wrought by such 
means. Punishment must stimulate the offender to change 
his ways. If the school merely “hits back” the offender 
is left in a resentful instead of a regretful mood. And re- 
-sentment is not the beginning of reform.   4. Characteristics of effective punishment 
Certainty the chief deterrent. A good punishment is one 
that is certain to come when deserved, one that causes pain 
without serious or permanent injury, and one the meaning 
of which the child fully understands. It is not so much the 
severity as the certainty of punishment that deters children 
from doing wrong. It is obvious to every student of 
American politics that the greatest weakness of our munici- 
pal governments lies in the fact that punishment for wrong- 
doing is by no means certain. The same principle holds 
true in the school. 
It is human nature to enjoy taking a risk. Every boy 
worth educating loves adventure. But when punishment 
is certain the element of risk or adventure is eliminated. 
There is no longer uncertainty or chance, and consequently 
no special appeal is made to this primitive instinct. 
It must be painful. Second to the certainty of punish- 
ment is the discomfort it brings. To control the nature and 
amount of the pain is the important and difficult task. The 
punishment must be just if it is to effect reform. Pain may
-P-A-G-E-100
  88 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
be in the form of sorrow, remorse, or chagrin, or it may be 
purely physical. It will certainly be different with differ- 
ent individuals, and must be administered accordingly. 
Whether the pain shall be mental or physical or both is not 
the question here. There must be real hurt, hurt which is 
genuinely repulsive to the offender. How great the hurt 
should be will depend upon the nature of the offense; how 
it shall be produced will depend upon the temperament of 
the offender. 
It must be understood. Finally, a punishment is only 
effective when the child understands fully what it is for and 
why he must accept it. That means that he must fully 
appreciate the nature and extent of his offense, and the 
relation of the punishment to the particular offense com- 
mitted. That is, he must see that this suffering which he 
is to undergo is a reasonable, and as nearly as possible, 
a natural consequence of his deed. Or, to put it in psy- 
chological terms, he must form a mental association be~ 
tween the pain and the misdeed which provoked the pain. 
5. The theory of natural punishment 
- Spencer’s theory. Punishments may be thought of as 
natural and artificial. A natural punishment is one which 
comes unavoidably as a consequence of some act or neglect, 
while an artificial punishment is one which is arbitrarily 
assigned as a consequence. Herbert Spencer was the first 
great expositor of the theory of natural punishments. His 
argument was based upon the biological principle that the 
true function of pain is to put a check on activities that are 
harmful to the organism, while pleasure has the effect of 
causing the beneficial activities to be continued. In other 
words, whatever is painful is harmful, and whatever is 
pleasurable is beneficial. Carrying this biological principle 
over to the moral aspect of the activity, he would argue 
   
-P-A-G-E-101
  SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS 89 
that any conduct the total moral results of which are bene- 
ficial is good conduct, while any conduct the total moral 
results of which are not good would be bad conduct. Thus 
bad conduct would bring its own punishment in the form 
of pain, and good conduct would bring a reward in the form 
of pleasure. 
Not always satisfactory in practice. Of the virtues of 
such punishments, Spencer declares that they are inevita- 
ble; that they are proportionate to the degree of offense; 
that they are constant, direct, and unhesitating; and that 
they hold throughout life. Under certain circumstances 
these are real virtues. Applied in the school, however, 
such punishments may occasionally be dangerous. Sup- 
pose a child should refuse to get his lessons during school 
hours. The natural consequence would be that he would 
have to learn them after school hours. If he persisted in 
whispering to pupils near him he would be seated away 
from other pupils. If he quarreled on the way home he 
- would have to go home quite alone. If he cheated in the 
games he would be banished from them. In such cases 
natural punishment would be effective, though not always 
desirable from our present viewpoint. We should note 
in these cases, however, that the consequences of the act 
appear almost immediately upon committing the act, they 
affect only the offender, and they are reasonably proportion- 
ate to the offense. 
The practical limitations of this theory. Such is not true, 
however, of all cases. If a child persists in playing truant 
the natural result will be a poor education. This may some 
day be painful to the offender, but certainly not in the im- 
mediate present. Consequently it would not serve as a 
deterrent until too late to be of use. John Stuart Mill, in 
arguing for the endowment of schools, said: “Of their 
bodily wants and ailments, mankind is generally con-
-P-A-G-E-102
  90 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
scious; but the wants of the mind, the want of being wiser 
and better, is, in the far greater number of cases, unfelt!”’ + 
This fact makes a natural punishment in such cases in- 
effective, in fact dangerous, for the reason that the offender 
is soon to become an imposition upon society, and the sum 
total of suffering it may produce may be out of all pro- 
portion to the offense at the time it was committed. 
Whatever we may think or like, however, the law of 
natural punishment does obtain. Wherever there is wrong- 
doing there is some kind of suffering. As a fundamental 
principle this may perhaps be held up to the children 
through concrete illustrations, and taught with some good 
effect upon their attitude toward wrong and toward penal- 
ties for wrongdoing. 
Artificial penalties must be resorted to in certain cases, 
however, if desirable ends are to be met. These penalties 
are arbitrary, to be sure, but for that reason they are con- 
trollable, and may be made to fit cases where natural pun- 
ishments are undesirable. That is, where natural laws are 
ineffective, they must be supplemented. 
6. Kinds of punishment 
Punishments have been enumerated and classified often 
and in various ways, and long explanations of how, when, 
and where they are to be applied have been given. Prac- 
tically all agree that severe types of punishment should 
not be banished from the list of available penalties for 
misconduct in the elementary school. 
This book is attempting to present a constructive pro- 
gram, to put emphasis upon instruction and leadership as 
opposed to coercion. Yet every practical schoolman knows 
that a severe shock of some sort is frequently necessary 
before certain children will accept the leadership of the

SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS 91 
teacher and enter upon a codperative program with the 
school. 
What kind of shock, or how to produce it, is after all 
not an easy question for the inexperienced teacher who is 
confronted with the practical task of punishing a child. 
How can she produce the results characteristic of effective 
punishments? 
Corporal punishment. ) Bodily punishment will produce 
pain, and can be administered soon enough after the of- 
fense for the association between the misdeed and the pain 
to be established. It(should be used only in extreme cases, 
after every. milder-method~has failed-to get results; only

yet, as rapidly as possible it should be dispensed with, and 
he should be made to feel himself a member of a group   
which is bound together not by force but by the spirit , 
of codperation toward the common good. 
Reproofs and rebukes. Many children will respond very 
readily to a sharp reminder that what they are doing is 
wrong. This does not mean that scolding, threatening,
-P-A-G-E-104

\ and nagging are to be sanctioned. Such procedure always 
brings the teacher-pupil relationship into the realm of 
quarreling. The offense and the punishment then become 
personal matters which engender bad feeling on both sides, 
and stimulate argument on the part of the pupil instead of 
submission to the teacher’s will. A sharp reproof, brief 
and to the point, without a threat of further punishment 
“if it happens again,” will often restore the unruly child to 
a proper attitude. Reproof or rebuke must be in as few 
words as possible without being satirical or sarcastic. It 
must never admit of a reply, and must be fully backed up 
by action if necessary. 
Other punishments. There are numerous other possible 
punishments available if used with proper discretion,/Cer- 
tain privileges may be taken away from children, such as

7. The administering of punishment 
Need for punishment a teaching situation. As was 
pointed out in the chapter on order and discipline, manag- 
ing children’s conduct is a part of instruction. The object 
is to develop types of behavior which are best adapted to 
the place and to the purpose of the school. This may be 
accomplished, in most cases, by mere suggestion or by 
example. In some cases definite instruction is necessary; in
-P-A-G-E-105
SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS 98 
others requests that such instruction be applied. In a few 
cases it will be necessary to command observance of such 
instruction, and in a few coercion will be needed, and we 
meet with the question of administering that coercion. 
The point to. be emphasized here is that all these are 
cases for instruction. They are different in a few respects, 
but they are all teaching-situations. The result sought in 
all cases is regard for the rights of others, high moral ideals, 
and right habits of conduct. The unruly child may not 
like to develop the habits appropriate to school life, but 
when occasion demands the school must force him through 
the essential processes. 
This point of view with respect to punishment should 
help to relieve its administration of some of its disagree- 
able features. Punishing a child should be looked upon as 
teaching the child, and the method of punishment should 
be studied in exactly the same sense as is the method of 
teaching arithmetic. The teacher who takes such an atti- 
tude views the whole procedure objectively. This is a 
matter of first importance, since it eliminates the strictly 
personal element and so prevents anger, or any other emo- 
tional state, from interfering with the process. 
Like other instruction punishment is individualistic. 
Once punishment is accepted as a teaching problem its in- 
dividualistic nature is more easily realized. In this, as in 
all instructional work, individual differences play a large 
part in determining the method to be pursued. All children 
should know how to use good English, but we know that 
exactly the same methods cannot be used in any two cases. 
Our methods always vary slightly to meet individual needs. 
Similarly, if two boys commit the same offense they must 
both be corrected, but the methods to be used will neces- 
sarily vary to meet the particular needs of each case. 
This principle has a rather wide significance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  94 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
1. It means that however many rules of behavior the 
teacher may make, she cannot assign a given penalty for 
the infraction of any particular rule. Suppose a rule is 
made against truancy, and corporal punishment is assigned 
as the penalty for breaking it. Now suppose two boys 
break this rule, one because he is a confirmed truant, the 
other because he was coaxed and bribed into it. Corporal 
punishment must follow. We can imagine the following 
results. The confirmed truant suffers the punishment 
without a whimper, and actually in glee at the privilege 
of showing his grit. The other boy is humiliated to the ex- 
tent of feeling that he has forever lost his honor and brought 
shame upon his home. Certainly no one would say that 
corporal punishment here has fulfilled the requirements 
for effective punishments. 
2. Every case must be fully diagnosed before a penalty 
is enforced. It would be little short of crime to punish a 
child, such as truant number two above, with corporal 
punishment, while for a boy such as truant number one 
such treatment would be next to folly unless it could be 
made almost brutal in its nature. Temperament, mood, 
sex, age, size, physical and mental condition, motive — 
all represent types of individual differences which punish- 
ment cannot wisely ignore. 
Time and place for punishment. Where and when pun- 
ishment should be administered are likewise important 
questions. No child should be seriously punished in the 
presence of other children, and that for two reasons. First, 
for a sensitive child it is extremely degrading to be so hu- 
miliated in the presence of his fellows, and leaves him 
crushed rather than punished; or if he be of the brazen, 
dare-devil type, then it is just his chance to show off. In 
either case the real aim is defeated. Secondly, it arouses 
sympathy for the offender which he does not merit, ter- 
   
-P-A-G-E-107
  SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS 95 
rifies the younger and more timid pupils, and throws the 
whole room into a state of excitement, fear, pity, anger, 
and resentment. The many are thus made to suffer for the 
one. 
As to the proper time for punishment, there can be no 
set rule other than to keep in mind that if the offense is to 
be associated with the pain of punishment the two must be 
as closely related in point of time as is possible. How 
closely this may be will depend upon the nature and extent of 
the penalty necessary. A penalty may often consist of 
two parts — anticipation and realization. For some chil- 
dren an afternoon’s dread of a conference with the teacher 
after school is a more effective punishment than is the con- 
ference itself. In such a case punishment follows immedi- 
ately after the offense, and continues till after the con- 
ference is concluded. For some other child, however, the 
afternoon would be spent in preparing plans to defeat the 
purpose of the conference, or in gleefully announcing to 
the boys that he is “in for it” to-night. In such a case the 
passing of time will certainly weaken the effect of the 
penalty. 
The teacher’s responsibility. One other caution should 
be added, and that is that every teacher should in the main 
rely on herself to do the punishing necessary in her own 
room. Sending children to the principal’s office is too often 
a mere farce in school practice. A good principal will not 
permit his office to develop into a mere peace officer’s job, 
and will not be slow in making it clear that teaching, dis- 
cipline, and punishment all belong to the same program, 
and that the teacher cannot easily unload the disagreeable 
part of her work on his office. But even from the teacher’s 
point of view very few cases should go out of her hands. 
To use this method often amounts to holding the princi- 
pal’s office over the children as a constant threat, and goes
-P-A-G-E-108
TF ge ee Te en ee eee Fe oe a a ae 
96 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
far to destroy the prestige the teacher may establish in 
other lines. 
Finally, the teacher should depend upon leadership as 
far as possible, and when punishment is necessary think of 
it as a suggestion that leadership is weak at some point. 
She should remember that punishment must be instruc- 
tive as well as corrective, that all offenses are against the 
school and not against the teacher, that anger will destroy 
the teacher’s power, belittle her office, and produce only 
resentment in the offender. She should also remember to 
be deliberate and fully self-possessed, to talk little, to act 
promptly where action is necessary, and never to promise 
something that she does not mean to carry out. Still fur- 
ther should she remember that an important measure of 
her success as a teacher is the extent to which the need for 
punishment in her room diminishes. 
8. Chapter summary 
In bringing together the chief points in this chapter we should 
keep in mind first of all that some occasion for punishment is al- 
most certain to arise in every classroom, and that plans for dealing 
with such cases cannot be wisely neglected. 
The old idea of punishment as repression has given place to the 
idea that punishment is a form of instruction. Punishment must 
mean pain to the offender, and must be administered, not as an 
expression of personal resentment on the part of the teacher, but as 
an expression of the entire school’s disapproval of the wrong done. 
Its purpose is to help in the establishment of this conception of 
society’s rights against wrongdoers, to deter others from similar 
acts, and to reform the offender. Its aim is never retribution. 
, Neither teacher nor school can ever stoop to mere revenge. The 
theory of natural punishment is applicable only in part, and that as 
a general principle only. 
Punishment is effective only when its certainty is guaranteed in 
advance, when it causes real pain and regret, and when it is fully 
understood. Corporal punishment, when used with discretion, has 
proven effective, while its complete abandonment has usually  
-P-A-G-E-109
SCHOOL PUNISHMENTS 97. 
resulted in weakened control. Reproof and rebuke, the loss of 
privilege, and, as a last resort, suspension and expulsion are useful 
means of curbing unsocial conduct. 
Finally, punishment must be looked upon as a part of instruc- 
tion. It must be administered in a like spirit, and with the same 
regard to individual differences among children, and when severe, 
never in the presence of other children. With rare exceptions each 
teacher should control her own class and administer the necessary 
punishments, never forgetting that the first step should always bea 
full and complete diagnosis of the case in hand. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Justify the statement that problems of punishment are merely pro- 
blems of instruction. Why should a teacher never permit an offense 
to become personal? 
2. Take a common school offense, such as quarreling, and show what 
relationships have been broken by it. When have these relationships 
been restored? 
8. Explain and justify the three purposes of punishment, as set forth in 
this chapter. Why is retribution not a reasonable aim? 
4, Explain Herbert Spencer’s theory of natural punishments, and point 
out its strong and weak points for school use. Cite cases in which 
such punishments would be useful. 
5. How would you characterize an effective punishment? What is meant 
by “the child must fully appreciate the meaning of the punishment”’? 
6. Under what circumstances, if ever, is corporal punishment justifiable? 
In what ways does it fulfill the requirements for an effective punish- 
ment? Point out its limitations. 
7. Enumerate a list of punishments which you think could be used ta 
good effect in school. Make a second list which you think of rather 
doubtful value, or to be used only under peculiar circumstances. 
8. What has the question of individual differences to do with the admin- 
istration of punishments? Why is it dangerous to make rules in school 
with definite penalties for infraction? Would you make rules without 
naming the penalties? Why should the penalty be administered as 
soon as possible after the offense? What is included in the diagnosis 
of an offense? 
9. Describe or characterize a child to whom you would never administer 
corporal punishment. One whom you would not rebuke sharply. For 
what kind of child is mere suggestion adequate punishment? Re- 
proof? Lowered deportment? When should suspension and expul- 
sion be resorted to? 
10. Of what kinds of privileges would you deprive children by way of 
   
-P-A-G-E-110
  98 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
punishment? Why not assign tasks as punishment? Why should 
teachers rarely refer cases to the principal? 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
1. After long preparation a group of pupils were to present a play and 
expected visitors. John, out of envy and jealousy, hid a part of the 
equipment for the play and enjoyed the embarrassment he had 
caused. Later the offender was located and brought to task. When 
confronted with the facts he at first denied it all, and scoffed at the 
thought of it. Write out a dialogue between yourself and John in 
which the case was settled (settled in any way you choose), and in 
which a punishment was decided upon. Show how you utilized the 
opportunity to give instruction in which punishment played a part. 
@. Describe cases of punishment where each of the following was used 
as means of punishment, and explain whether such a method could be 
used to proper educational ends: 
a. Laughed at the child and tacitly encouraged other pupils to do 
the same. 
b. Scolded the pupil, calling him stupid and mean. 
ce. Kept him an hour after school, and at recess time. 
d, Refused him a coveted place as leading character in a play, or as 
president of his class, or as captain of his team. 
e. Had a long talk with him explaining the offense, and impressing 
the child with how very bad he had been. 
f. Used corporal punishment.

1. Meaning of the term 
Bridging the gap. Every one knows that managing and 
teaching children are simple and pleasant tasks when the 
children are vitally interested in the essential aims of the 
school, but, as was pointed out in Chapter I, some of these 
ends may, for the child, seem extremely remote—remote 
in the sense that he feels no interest in them and sees no 
way in which they are likely to profit him in later years. 
This situation is to a certain extent unavoidable, unless 
this gap between the child’s present and his adult future 
needs can somehow be bridged. To do this means simply 
to fill it in with something that has a present meaning and 
significance for the child. 
The younger the child the more completely is he occu- 
pied with the immediate present. The world is all new to 
him, and wherever he goes there are fresh views to take of

things at hand. It is largely by experience and training 
that we are able to look ahead in life, and the child is sc 
busy getting experience that he feels little concern about the 
distant time when he may need this or that information o1 
skill which the school proposes to give him so far in ad- 
vance. 
The disciplinary conception of study. These are facts 
which the past has largely ignored on the assumption that 
doing disagreeable tasks under compulsion is the best means 
of getting an education. This was not only the assumption 
of our Puritan educators; it is one which has fought stub- 
bornly against every subsequent proposal to make school 
work interesting. Consequently, even after psychology 
had won the fight for “interest” in instruction, the ancient 
school traditions, backed up by theological prejudice favor- 
ing a stern suppression of every activity in any way pro- 
ductive of pleasure, prevented any attempt to remove the 
artificial barrier which centuries had erected between 
interest and so-called discipline. This battle has been won 
only recently for school practice, and the meaning of 
the term incentive will become clear for the teacher only 
when she understands the part which interest plays in 
education, and the real relation of interest to serious 
effort. 
Interest related to effort. When a given lesson or schoo 
task is attractive to the child, and he works at it on his ow: 
initiative, we say he is interested in it, or that the subject i 
interesting to him; when the task is unattractive and ten 
to repel him we say the task is uninteresting to him, o 
that he is not interested in the subject. If we study th 
behavior of the child under these two sets of circumstance: 
we will see that in the case where interest is present thi 
child is attentive to the subject, that the more attractiv 
the task the more concentrated his attention becomes an
-P-A-G-E-113
  INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 101 
the greater becomes his effort. In the case where interest 
is not present we see the child’s attention constantly flit- 
ting from the task; he is easily distracted, and assumes 
the attitude of a careless spectator. Thus we are easily able 
to distinguish an interesting from an uninteresting lesson, 
or an interested from an uninterested pupil. And we are 
familiar with the difference between the amounts of work 
accomplished under the two sets of conditions. 
The practical meaning of interest. Now why are some 
tasks interesting and others disagreeable? Interest is a 
comprehensive term which includes not only the personal 
emotional inclination of the child toward a lesson, but also 
the objective results which he foresees in the lesson and 
wants for himself. How to find in an uninteresting task 
something which the child recognizes as pertinent to his 
own needs is the question. 
First, we have the child, always with a capacity for hav- 
ing an interest in things which really concern him; second, 
we have the school aim, the lesson to be learned. The child 
is or is not interested according as the lesson does or does 
not contain something which he recognizes as valuable to 
himself. If he is not interested it is because he feels no 
important connection between his own self and what the 
lesson offers. The explanation then, of why some tasks are 
interesting and others are not is to be sought, not in the 
nature of the child alone, nor in the nature of the task alone, 
but rather in the connection between the two— in the 
actual relation of what the child now knows and feels and 
can do to the new facts or skills we are asking him to ob- 
tain, to the new appreciation or mental processes we are 
asking him to experience. 
Training the pupil in proper habits. Where this connec- 
tion is close there is no problem of management. The child 
will study without direction. He is interested and attends 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  102 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
to his work because he sees where to begin. But where this 
connection is not close the child is not interested, and then 
the task of management is present. 
Three possible lines of procedure are open to the teacher: 
First, she may leave the child alone, to study or not as he 
pleases; second, she may force him to study by holding 
punishment over him; third, she may undertake to man- 
age him with respect to his difficulty. The last is her plain 
duty. To leave the child alone is to waste his time and to 
force him to adopt the trial-and-error method, from which 
he will soon turn away in disgust. If driven by fear of 
punishment he will learn to despise the subject, and in 
time the school. In either case he will miss his opportunity 
to develop right habits of work. This is only another way 
of saying that he is forced to develop wrong habits of work, 
by which the school defeats its own end. 
The teacher’s task. How to provide an incentive, how 
to fill this gap, how to find some facts or activities akin to 
what he now knows and wishes to do, is the question for 
the teacher. 
2. What makes an incentive effective 
Incentive a means, not an end. Incentives are only 
means, and must not be permitted to replace the ends which 
they are designed to serve. Young children admire bright 
colors, and will readily attend to the number lesson if per- 
mitted to use brilliantly colored objects to count with. 
The question is, do they attend to bright colors, or to 
number experience, in such a case? The end sought is 
facility in the use of numbers, the means or incentive is 
bright-colored objects to work with. Does the incentive 
really fill the gap, or only seem to fill it? Certainly it makes 
a vital appeal to very genuine instinctive interests in the 
child, and makes the numbers objective and concrete, which
-P-A-G-E-115
  INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 103 
means making them real to the child. According to our 
definition that is the way an incentive should function. 
A close examination, however, shows that something has 
been overlooked. Are the colored balls and the number 
experience inseparable? Must the child get the one if he 
gets the other? At once we realize that it is possible for 
the child to make counting, adding, or subtracting, a mere 
incident in the jolly experience of rolling bright balls or 
piling up colored blocks. So, while playing with colored 
balls and blocks seems on the face of things to serve per- 
fectly as an incentive for studying an abstract and unin- 
teresting number lesson, we see that it is very easy for the 
means to be converted into an end, the real end being re- 
garded by the child as a mere inconvenience incident to the 
pleasant game. 
Other illustrations could be given: Mary studies very 
often, not so much to learn as to win a prize; James takes 
pains with his written lesson, not to improve his skill in 
writing and correct use of English, but to avoid the negative 
incentive which is to remain after school and do his work 
over. So, to be effective, an incentive must not be so at- 
tractive in itself as to dominate the situation to the exclu- 
sion of the more important fact of the relationship which 
it is designed to establish between the known and the un- 
known, between the child’s present active self and his task. 
Neither should it be so uninteresting as to create a motive 
of fear or dread. 
Appeal must be immediate. To be effective an incentive 
must make an immediate appeal. That means that it must 
appeal to some native instinctive interest, or be so inti- 
mately related to the child’s present purpose that it tends 
to illuminate that purpose. An extended knowledge of 
psychology is not so necessary as are a few simple observa- 
tions to show us what this means in practice. It is char-
-P-A-G-E-116
    5 
104 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
acteristic of young children to take little thought of the 
morrow. They live in the present, and an ever and rapidly 
changing present. Their toys are attractive for only a short 
time at best. Their world is mainly a world of things, while 
the teacher’s world is quite largely a world of ideas, laws, 
and relationships. 
It is only because the teacher has had a long experience 
with things that she is now able to deal with principles. 
Consequently the incentive appropriate to early school life 
must be something concrete and striking from a sense stand- 
point, something which at once affects the child’s narrow 
personal world almost in spite of him. The young child 
loves change above all things. His life is dominated by his 
instinctive liking for intensive stimuli of all kinds, for 
play, for building and destroying, and he is extremely in- 
quisitive about strange and wonderful things and hap- 
penings. 
Incentives must be adapted to age. Incentives which 
appeal to these instinctive tendencies without falling into 
the danger of replacing the real end sought will be appro- 
priate for early childhood and for older children who are 
mentally retarded. With more advanced children these 
eruder and simpler likes do not fully disappear, but others 
develop. With the larger mental content of growing years 
comes also an increased power to see ahead and to see rela- 
tionships which are not so intimate; also greater power to 
reason — all of which means ability and willingness to lay 
aside an immediate for a future good. Incentives may then 
be of a higher order, without being less intimately related to 
the child’s immediate interests. That is, the appeal is now 
not only to the instinctive but also to the acquired inter- 
ests. ‘The number experience, at first had in connection 
with games and play, has itself become an interest to which 
we can appeal. Thus, as soon as the child has completed 
 
-P-A-G-E-117
  
INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 105 
the arithmetic work of grade four, he will be permitted to 
apply it in manual training and shop work in grade five. 
This privilege becomes a real incentive to the child, but 
makes its appeal not only to his original primitive instinc- 
tive interest in construction, but also to his acquired in- 
terest in the use of numbers. 
It is of course to be remembered that the transition from 
the use of incentives which appeal to the cruder instincts 
to the use of those which appeal to later instincts and to 
acquired interests, or, as we may say, the transition from a 
lower to a higher order of incentives, will be very gradual. 
The higher incentive must bring some new aspect of an 
acquired interest into the light by suggesting an untried 
value for it. 
Appeal should be positive. The most effective incentives 
will inspire positive rather than negative attitudes and ac- 
tivities. There are two possible ways of bridging the gap 
between the child and his uninteresting task. One is by 
compelling him to accept an alternative which is less at- 
tractive, or more repulsive, than the task itself, the other is 
by providing an interesting intermediary experience which 
leads naturally into the task itself. Both will be effective at 
times, and many incentives will actually contain elements 
of each, as when a child works hard both to win a prize and 
for fear he will not win it. 
That the positive is the more important element should 
be kept in mind: 
‘First, because common experience and observation teach 
us that when we work from fear we work with less confi- 
dence in our own ability, and that we go grudgingly, and 
with much less energy. ' 
Second, because psychological experiments have verified 
these common observations, and state their conclusions 
by saying that fear tends to depress and choke up our
-P-A-G-E-118
    106 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
channels of energy, while confidence and hope in our work 
tend to brace us up and to liberate energy for the task 
ahead. 
Third, because, with a negative incentive there will be 
a tendency for a child to form a mental association, not 
between punishment and his own laziness or indifference, 
but rather between punishment and the lesson. 
Use negative incentives sparingly. Our last chapter 
dealt with punishments. If we will reconsider that chapter 
from the standpoint of this discussion we shall have before 
us about all that can be said in justification of negative in- 
centives. They cannot be entirely dispensed with in school 
management, except in rare cases. In managing instruc- 
tion, though, as opposed to the management of other kinds 
of behavior, they should be used as sparingly as possible. 
This is not said with a view to drawing a sharp line of dis- 
tinction between the task of learning to play, or to keep 
clean hands and teeth, or to be polite, on the one hand, and 
the task of learning an arithmetic lesson on the other. The 
two are psychologically not so unlike as the traditional 
schoolmaster has made them. ‘The one is a little more 
directly social in its bearing on the child’s present self than 
the other, but they are both learning processes. 
Children meet with disagreeable tasks on the playground 
just as they do in the recitation room. The only reason we 
fail to see this is because we have not looked upon the child’s 
playground experiences as part of his constructive program 
of education. When we have developed play into something 
real and vital in education, then the need for a study of 
incentives suitable for play and other lines of social and 
executive training will appear. 
Danger in competitive prizes. Finally, incentives to be 
effective in school must not be injurious to the many while 
they serve only the few. It is a poor achievement that is  
-P-A-G-E-119
  INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 107 
better measured by what some one else has not done than 
by what the achievement itself represents. A child is not 
necessarily good or bright because others are bad or dull. 
The incentive which involves competition therefore runs 
the risk of putting emphasis in the wrong place, and may 
result in teaching a child to wish ill luck to his fellows rather 
than to strive harder to win for himself. 
3. Types of incentives 
Incentives vary with age and individual nature. As was 
pointed out above, the gap which an incentive is to bridge 
may be very narrow or very wide. The boy who is well up 
in his language work, but who is not fond of writing themes, 
may find his recent first experience in a snowstorm an in- 
centive amply strong enough to overcome his dislike of 
writing. Not so, however, with the boy who not only does 
not like to write themes but has been scarcely able to keep 
up with his class. The one knows how and merely needs 
something interesting to write about, the other lacks basic 
knowledge and skill. The incentive in one case has merely 
to overcome a little mental laziness, while in the other it 
must stimulate the child to seek knowledge as well. Con- 
sequently, when we speak of types of incentives, we must 
remember that we are dealing only with general principles, 
and that the ultimate test of the value of an incentive lies 
finally in its actual use. 
An incentive which is good from the standpoint of the 
general principles involved, is not necessarily good every- 
where and under all circumstances. Its function is always 
specific with respect both to the individual child and to the 
particular circumstances in question. The following classi- 
fication of incentives is suggested as a basis for a critical 
examination of this important aspect of management. 
(a) Incentives more or less incident to the regular organ-
-P-A-G-E-120
    108 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
ization and management of the class. There are certain 
features of school procedure which are indispensable to a 
proper handling of children in groups, many of which can 
be made effective incentives for practically all members of 
the class. Such are grading, promotion, class marks, moni- 
torial services, holiday programs, and school exhibits. - 
Let us restate in brief form principles set forth above, to 
which all incentives must conform in order to be effective 
for service: 
(1) An incentive is only a means to an end, and so must not be 
so attractive in itself, and so widely separated from the end 
it is meant to serve, as virtually to replace that end. 
(2) Its appeal must be direct, and to some basic instinctive 
interest, or to some present and pertinent acquired interest. 
(3) It must as often as possible be positive rather than negative. 
(4) It must not be injurious to other children. 
With these criteria in mind, let us examine the above 
features of the regular working machinery of the school 
to see how they may be turned to good effect in this con- 
nection. 
(1) Grading, promotion, and class marks. Perhaps the 
greatest evil that attends the use of grading and promotion 
as school incentives is that they too often become ends in 
themselves, in the mind of both teacher and pupil. By un- 
pedagogical methods the teacher fairly drags the child 
through the required amount of work in order that his failure 
may not reflect unfavorably upon her own efficiency. The 
child fears demotion or being left behind; or craves the social 
distinction of skipping a grade; and so in desperation mem- 
orizes but does not digest the subject-matter covered. The 
appeal is to the emulative and social instincts, and it is 
direct. This is well, but the stimulus often is negative 
rather than positive, and the desire of the child too fre- 
quently is that, if he fail, his friends also will fail, or that
-P-A-G-E-121
  INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 109 
if he is permitted to skip a grade certain others will not be. 
This does not mean that these incentives are essentially 
bad, but rather that it is easy to put the emphasis in the 
wrong place, and so to destroy what might be a wholesome 
stimulus. 
Competition is not unwholesome when both means and 
end are legitimate. Good management will see to it that 
the real end — work done — is attained, and further, that 
the child shall learn to compete, not only with others, but 
with his own past record as well. When this attitude is 
established the value of grading = promotion as in- 
centives is unquestioned. 
(2) Monitorial service. The necessary monitors for the 
classroom may be chosen on the basis of merit in a given 
study one week, on the basis of entire scholarship standing 
another, and on the basis of deportment or application 
another, each time making the appointment an incentive 
for special effort at some particular point. Measured in 
terms of the above principles there is little danger of abuse 
of such devices. 
(3) Holiday programs. Certain places on holiday pro- 
grams can be made open on condition of attainment in 
various lines of work, preferably those most nearly associated 
with the material which the program is to present. Of 
course all the places could not be assigned in that way, for 
there will be certain pupils who ought under any cir- 
cumstances to be on such a program, and certain others 
for whom such training is not important. 
(4) School exhibits. Occasional displays of children’s 
work, either in competition with one another or in competi- 
tion with other schools, will, like interclass and inter- 
scholastic games, debates, and spelling matches, tend not 
only to bring out the very best individual effort but to de- 
velop a sense of school loyalty, as well, which is thoroughly 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  110 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
wholesome. The danger here is that the single item for 
exhibition may receive an undue amount of attention, to 
the detriment of regular class exercises and routine matters 
which are of greater importance. 
Thus practically all such devices as these must con- 
stantly be guarded in their effect upon each individual child 
if they are to be of large service. They have the ad- 
vantage of being always at hand, and intimately associated 
with one or another aspect of the regular life of the school. 
The teacher who is ingenious in finding out ways to use them 
and who carefully guards against their abuse, will find 
incentives of this type valuable sources of help. 
(b) Incentives incident to good teaching method. A 
second group of incentives, which are perhaps more pro- 
perly thought of as special methods and devices, should at 
least be mentioned here, if for no other reason than to show 
that, like the first group of incentives, their function is to 
elicit interest in the immediate situation and to bridge over 
the gap from the known to the unknown, or from the old to 
the new. 
(1) Devices as incentives. It was pointed out above that 
the gap to be filled by incentives is sometimes very wide 
and sometimes very narrow. A story is related, a picture 
is displayed, some object is measured, a lesson is dramatized, 
and we usually think of these as teaching devices or as 
features of the special methods in use. Yet their function 
is to sustain and direct attention, to develop an interest 
in the end sought, which is the function performed by in- 
eentives. The difference is that in the one case the gap is 
narrow both in point of time and in knowledge or skill 
needed, whereas in the other it is wider. In the latter, at- 
tention is to be sustained for a longer time, a more per- 
manent interest is to be developed, more work is to be done. 
This is but a difference in degree and not in kind. 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 111 
If a device is a feature of the refined details of teaching 
method, then ‘an incentive is a feature of the coarser struc- 
ture of method in the large. 
(2) Types of devices which serve as incentives. Whether 
we call these incentives, or devices, or special methods, is not 
important. It is important that the teacher shall make their 
use conform to the principles we have set forth for evaluat- 
ing incentives. 
The use of pictures, maps, pets, flowers, field trips, dram- 
atization, underscoring words with colored chalk, writing 
letters to children in foreign countries, and other devices of 
this sort, practically without end, would come under this 
group. They are designed for use in particular situations, 
and so are highly specialized. Every young teacher should 
collect great stores of such, and should exercise her own 
ingenuity in working out new and original ones. To be- 
come versatile and resourceful in the use and invention of 
such incentives should be a constant aim of every teacher 
who wishes to keep out of pedagogical ruts. 
(c) Incentives not essentially connected with the regular 
organization or management of the school. In this group 
would come prizes, honor rolls, special privileges and im- 
munities, class rank, and public commendation, all of which 
have been brought into use in the school, not because they 
are in any way essential to its organization, but because of 
the strength of the appeal which such things make. Every 
normal child loves a tussle, either physical or intellectual. 
To be able to win by main strength or by wit means to the 
child social prestige, personal power, self-confidence, and 
success. The big question with regard to all such incentives 
is: Are they, by the fact of their lacking any real connection 
with the life of the school, more easily separated from the 
end which they are designed to serve? 
(1) Prizes. There are almost numberless incentives of 
 
-P-A-G-E-124
  112 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
this class, some valuable intrinsically, and others which 
bring some special distinction only. The former are likely, 
indeed will almost surely become ends in themselves, and so 
violate our principle number one. ‘The latter are only 
slightly less likely to do this, and both kinds will have the 
following objections in common: 1, the number of contest- 
ants quickly narrows down to a few of the brightest pupils 
who are least likely to need an incentive, all others becoming 
disinterested spectators; 2, certain sensitive pupils, who 
feel themselves losing in a desperate attempt, are depressed 
and disheartened, and lose confidence in their own abilities; 
8, the winners often develop an overconfidence amounting 
to offensive and, for themselves, dangerous conceit; 4, the 
tendency is to stratify the children in all social and intel- 
lectual matters, whereas the contest may involve only a very 
narrow mental trait, such as spelling ability. So there is 
scarcely a point in our principles which is not violated by 
the use of such incentives. 
(2) Honor rolls, special privileges and immunities, class 
rank, and public commendation. It is often argued that 
when the prize is available for all who attain a certain stand- 
ard, then most of its evils are done away with. This is 
at least partly true of the use of honor rolls, but there are 
certain other considerations which have to be watched. As 
an incentive for regular and punctual attendance, a monthly 
half-holiday is often granted, and on such days the children 
go home or roam the street. The natural inference which 
the child draws is that school work is regarded by all, even 
teachers, as hard and disagreeable, and that this half- 
holiday is pay for having patiently endured nineteen and 
one half days of it. ‘If this half day were devoted simply to 
a different line of work, say a field trip to a factory, a shop, 
a park, a Jake, or a mountain side, in which the object is to 
gather material for Monday’s language lesson, or for the
-P-A-G-E-125
  
INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 113 
study of civics, nature, or industry, then the prize would 
in itself become a very legitimate end and would be far 
more interesting to the child than merely going home. 
Furthermore it would stimulate interest in school work 
instead of marking it as drudgery. 
So much depends upon how all kinds of prize incentives 
are used, and they are so easily possible of abuse, that the 
best advice regarding them seems to be: 
1. Use single prizes of intrinsic worth not at all. 
2. Use single prizes which mean only some mark of dis- 
tinction rarely, remembering that the spirit of rivalry is 
abundantly stimulated on the playground and in debates; 
and 
8. Use prizes which are open to all, such as honor rolls, 
half-holidays, and freedom from examinations, only when 
they can be intimately bound up with some legitimate phase 
of the real work of the school. 
(d) Incentives based upon acquired interests and ideals. 
There is, finally, another group of incentives, best charac- 
terized, first, by the fact that they are not external either 
to the school as an institution or to the nature of the child; 
and second, by the fact that they have to be developed. 
Such are love of knowledge; pride in the good name of the 
school; love of justice, honor, cleanliness, fair play, prompt- 
ness, regularity, and codperation; and an earnest desire 
to be worthy of the friendship of teacher and fellow pupils. 
We are not born with these high ambitions and purposes, 
but with right training in the home and school all have 
capacity for developing them. Though we know all too 
little about the psychology of ideals, we are all fairly fa- 
miliar with their practical working. The man who cannot 
be bribed, who stands by his duty to others in the face of 
personal loss, who desires power that he may render servy- 
ice, is the man who is living up to his ideals. Such incen-
-P-A-G-E-126
  114 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
tives as these cannot be dragged into the school like prizes, 
they must be developed by example, by good teaching, and 
by strong personal appeal. They are means and end all 
in one. 
School loyalty is not made up of hurrahs, class songs and 
yells, and other superficial signs of loyalty, though these 
may have a place in its making. There must be behind 
these a common aspiration, a common life, shot through 
with habits of codperation, of fair play, of justice, of hard 
work and clean living. So it is with love of knowledge and 
other high ideals. They are powerful as motivating forces, 
once they are firmly established in our conduct as well as 
in our beliefs. 
There is no lesson so dull that an incentive cannot be 
found which will make it interesting to the normal pupil. 
Sweeping out the office is uninteresting to the boy passing 
by, but not so to the boy inside who looks upon his work 
as the beginning of a professional career. It is the teacher’s 
business to help her indifferent pupil to the office boy’s 
point of view. This she can do if she is resourceful and con- 
stantly on the alert for new motivating material. 
4. Incentives, and some newer methods of teaching 
Incentives and the socialized recitation. The study of 
this problem of incentives has led more recently to some 
interesting developments in the field of methodology. We 
have heard much in recent years of the socialized recitation, 
of motivation of school work, the project method, the Dalton 
Laboratory Plan, and many more. Running through all 
these conceptions, at most only partly new, are two ideas 
that are of interest to the student of this problem of in- 
centives. These two ideas are suggested by the terms “so- 
cialized recitation” and “project.” 
A socialized recitation is a codperative enterprise in which
-P-A-G-E-127
INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 115 
there is free and reasonably informal discussion of the 
lesson. This is merely, an extension of the older question- 
and-discussion type of work, but it is a rather important 
extension. In the older form the child recited, answered 
questions, and occasionally asked a question. The pro- 
cedure did little to stimulate interest in the total per- 
formance. Each pupil was held to account by the teacher, 
who took the initiative and assumed responsibility for the 
development of the lesson. The class consisted of a number 
of individuals, no one of whom felt responsible to any 
other one, and no one of whom felt responsible for plan- 
ning the work. 
The socialized recitation includes discussion and questions, 
but it introduces also the idea of group effort and group 
responsibility. Thus the pupil who has worked side by side 
with others, but always as an individual and as a follower, 
now becomes a member of a firm jointly responsible with 
others for the development of the lesson. 
The thought here is that in this kind of social activity 
the child finds an incentive for serious independent thinking, 
and he experiences something new in the form of responsi- 
bility for taking a hand in the lesson. He will be dealt 
with by his fellows if he becomes too inquisitive or if he 
talks too much, and may be brought to task by questioners 
if he remains too silent. In this he senses what it means 
to behave as a member of society, and the experience, being 
stimulating and enjoyable, provokes real effort. 
Incentives and project work. The general idea of the 
project method is, that instead of having set lessons as sug- 
gested by the usual textbook, the child will pursue a piece 
of work that seems to him to be a single unified whole, the 
beginning and end of which he sees from the start as he does 
not see those in a textbook course. This unified piece of 
work — such as making a table, dressing a doll, preparing 
 
-P-A-G-E-128
  116 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
plans and dramatizing some incident in history or litera- 
ture — becomes a project when to this comprehending of 
unity the child adds a purpose to do, to carry out, to inter- 
pret, or to analyze for himself. 
One may choose to apply the term project to “the mak- 
ing of an object,” or to “the purpose and will and pursuit 
of the task of making an object,” or to “the object itself.” 
Our interest here is in the total situation: child facing a set 
of facts, a piece of work, or a task which he comprehends 
as a whole, to which he wants to react, and to which he does 
react in a way that results in his mastering the task. Some- 
thing appealed to him. The fact that he grasped it as a 
whole and saw in it a possibility of doing something that 
would give expression to his own power was undoubtedly 
a large part of the inducement (incentive) to attack it. 
Having attacked it, the desire to possess the finished pro- 
duct (object or analysis or set of facts) must have entered 
as a further stimulus (incentive) to work to the end; and 
finally, having completed it, the thrill of success must have 
urged him on to seek new worlds to conquer. 
These are illustrations of how we are seeking to motivate 
the child’s work to the end that he may: 1, get work done; 2, 
get experience in actual group effort; and 3, learn to work 
independently. Le 
5. Summary of Part IT na 
In Part I we set forth the ends which are to be sought in the 
child’s training, showed how these ends function in the manage- 
ment of the school, and described the materials with which the 
teacher has to deal. In this Part we have discussed the pupil as 
the object of all management, explaining how he is to be brought 
into an understanding of his place as a member of the school group; 
the problem of attendance; order and discipline; school punish- 
ments; and incentives in management. 
Upon entering the school the child’s first problem is that of be- 
coming oriented with respect to his duties and privileges as a mem-
-P-A-G-E-129
  INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 117 
ber of a new social body. The teacher’s problem is that of assisting 
him in making the right contacts with this institution. 
The question of attendance thus becomes of very first impor- 
tance, and that not to the pupil alone, but to the school and to the 
State as well. As a management problem it usually presents itself 
in the form of truancy, irregularity, or tardiness, and each case 
demands individual treatment, for the reason that its causes lie 
within the numerous influences under which the child lives and 
works. ‘The teacher is especially advised to look closely into the 
child’s school relationships as a possible source of the trouble. 
The second problem was that of order and discipline. Discipline 
here was thought of as those modes of conduct which are peculiarly 
appropriate to school life, and the teacher’s problem as that of 
determining the most suitable practices, and then of applying to 
those practices the common principles of politeness, honor, and 
integrity which prevail everywhere. For the teacher it is a matter 
of developing within herself the power to lead, and her study is 
always of how to apply that power to individual cases. 
The third problem, that of punishments, brings the pupil into 
his most critical relationships with his social group, and the teacher 
into her most critical teaching relationship with the child. Pun- 
ishment must mean pain to the offender, and must result in his 
realization of a broken relationship with his school for which the 
responsibility is his very own. The offender must be made to feel 
the power of public indignation at his wrong if his punishment is 
to weigh heavily with him. This the teacher’s leadership must 
provide for, all cases being treated impersonally and in terms of 
their individual merits. 
Finally, we have discussed the difficult but important question 
of incentives: what an incentive is, what makes it effective, and 
the different types of incentives that are possible of use in the 
school. One’s incentives for doing a thing are his reasons or mo- 
tives for doing it. Where, as is necessarily the case in many in- 
stances in the school, the task is not closely related to the child’s 
present interests, it is necessary to bridge the gap between them. 
This is the most vital point in the entire teaching process. To be 
able to select facts, incidents, and exercises that will serve as a 
means to this end is the teacher’s problem. This requires intimate 
knowledge of the child and of the task, and skill in manipulating 
the incentive in terms of the child’s peculiar needs. 
We have grouped incentives as those incident to school organi-  
-P-A-G-E-130
  118 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
zation and management, those incident to good teaching method, 
those not essentially connected with school work, and those based 
on acquired interests and ideals. 
In these chapters the reader should have come to realize that 
the child is the center of all our interest as we develop machinery 
for dealing with children in large groups. Children are widely 
different from one another in their power to learn, and the test we 
set for ourselves in the remaining portion of this book is: Can the 
machinery of school management be so constructed that it will 
recognize and make full use of this wide diversity in human nature 
while adjusting itself to the welfare of the group? 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. What is meant by the term incentive, and why are incentives needed 
in school work? 
2. Explain how the study of incentives comes to be a study of the 
psychology of interest and attention. Why do we call one task inter- 
esting and another not interesting? Does the effort which you or 
your pupils put forth because of interest in a task seem to you to 
have the same, greater, or less disciplinary or educative value than 
the effort which is put forth under some penalty or disagreeable cir- 
cumstance? Cite cases to illustrate. 
3. Why is it that a given incentive may be effective with a child one day 
and not the next, or with one child and not with another? Does this 
answer explain why a successful use of incentives in the school in- 
volves careful judgment and skill on the part of the teacher, as well 
as a knowledge of the object or activity used as the incentive? i 
4, Can you recall a case in which an incentive failed because the pupils 
treated it as an end instead of a means? 
5. State the four principles to which an incentive must conform if it is 
to be effective. 
6. What is the difference between an incentive and a device? Explain 
how they are alike. 
7. What is meant by a negative incentive, and what is the most serious 
objection to its use? Under what circumstances are negative incen- 
tives justified? Give illustrations of where they would be effective, 
and also of where they would be ineffective. 
8. Suggest an incentive that would be useful to one pupil but detri- 
mental to others. 
9. Make up as long a list of incentives as you can for each of the four 
general types mentioned above. 
10. Show how the following incentives may be made effective: promo- 
tions, prizes, class monitors, school exhibits, field trips, pictures and
-P-A-G-E-131
  
INCENTIVES IN MANAGEMENT 119 
railroad maps, freedom from examinations, love of truth, school loy- 
alty, love of knowledge. 
11. Take the same list and explain how each may fail of its purpose, 
stating its failure in terms of the four guiding principles laid down. 
12. When may an incentive be used legitimately as both means and end? 
Explain a case that could be worked out by the teacher. 
18. Why is fear of having to copy a list of words, commit something to 
memory, or remain after school for study, almost invariably a wrong 
incentive? 
14. Is an incentive something that is supposed to replace teaching effort, 
or is it merely a part of an effective teaching process? Explain. 
15. Define: “project method,” “socialized recitation.” 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
1. By reference to any of the books on project teaching, select a project 
for a third-grade pupil in arithmetic. Outline the project, and explain 
how you would put a pupil to work on it. Explain how the procedure 
would provide good incentives at various stages of the work. 
2. If we think of a desirable incentive as one which provokes genuine 
continuous effort to accomplish an end, such as to make or to undo 
something, to go somewhere, or to gain a certain knowledge or skill, 
then suggest how a teacher might try to provide incentives for the 
following: 
a, Memorizing a selected poem. 
b. Making a copy of a map. 
c. Dramatizing a harvest scene. 
d. Preparing rules and bylaws for a school club. 
e. Describing the procedure in a court trial. 
f. Preparing a cage or a home for a newly adopted pet. 
8. Explain how you would try to develop right incentives for the follow- 
ing cases: 
a. The children are decidedly untidy with their papers and books. 
b. The children are crude in dress, speech, and manners. 
c. The handling of wraps on entering the building is slow, noisy, 
and generally lacking in orderly procedure. 
d. The class hates arithmetic. (For instance, the fourth grade.) 
e. A child has lied and deceived the class and the teacher, and when 
found out refuses to admit his guilt.

1. The problem of Part III 
Tuus far we have thought almost exclusively from the point 
of view of the individual child, keeping the group aspect 
and the machinery of the school somewhat in the back- 
ground. This has been done in order that, first of all, we 
may have the idea fully established that the school is made 
up of children, and that the ultimate test of the school and 
of its management is what they can do for the individual 
child. We have not, however, ignored the fact that the 
child’s world is social, as well as intellectual and physical, 
and that his training is to take place very largely within a 
group, and that it is always training for group life. In chap- 
ter five we attempted to show something of what this group 
life in the school may mean to the child if he is properly 
managed with respect to the social aspects of the institution 
of which he becomes a part. 
In this section of the book it will be our purpose, not to 
lose sight of this viewpoint, but to examine the machinery 
essential to the management of children in groups and to 
study the processes by means of which this machinery may 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
    124 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
be made effective as a means for achieving the principal aims 
of the school. The organization of the physical features of 
the school; the organization of the children, of the curric- 
ulum, and of the day’s work; the planning and directing of 
the efforts of the group at study and in recitation; the check- 
ing up of results by group tests; and the changing and shift- 
ing of machinery to meet the constantly expanding needs 
of the children and the community — these will constitute 
our problem here. In this we shall combine the study of 
the bare structure, the fixed and static features of the school, 
with a study of those flexible and dynamic features which 
are essential to the proper functioning of the structural 
parts. Thus we shall avoid the necessity for studying the 
machinery of the school aside from the part it plays in mak- 
ing for economy and effectiveness in the group enterprise. 
2. The nature and purpose of organization 
Division of labor a necessity. Education has become one 
of our most popular enterprises, and with this increase in 
its popularity has necessarily gone a great increase in the 
diversity of its interests. Hence the school problem has 
become rapidly more difficult, both from the standpoint of 
numbers of children and from the standpoint of aim. The 
school is no longer a mere matter of teacher and pupil, it is a 
whole State and its children trying to conserve the best 
ideals of the past and to anticipate the endless variety of 
occupational, social, and cultural needs of the future. 
The principle of division of labor has therefore become a 
pressing one, and the school organization of a decade ago 
finds itself ill adapted to the school problems of to-day. 
The State, the county, the city, and the district officials 
unite to form a vast machine for handling this problem in | 
the large, and it is within this larger system that each 
teacher is to operate, not as a mere cog in a wheel, but as
-P-A-G-E-137
  
  ORGANIZING THE SCHOOL "195 
an intelligent personality, responsible for the solution of 
certain details in the greater problem. The purpose of this 
machinery is only to systematize and to divide responsibil- 
ity, to the end that such specialization may result in effi- 
ciency. The teacher needs this larger perspective for her 
work in order that she may be the better able to define her 
own immediate aims and to relate means to ends in attaining 
them. 
Organization means systematization and economy. 
Without forgetting the principle set forth earlier in the book, 
that every moment of time and every piece of school ma- 
chinery must give educational account of itself, we may set it 
down here that a further requirement of all organization is 
that it shall accomplish its ends with a minimum loss of 
time and energy and with the greatest possible stimulus to 
tight effort. That is, organization must mean systematiza- 
tion of work with reference to its proper aims. 
There are many factors to be dealt with in school or- 
ganization, some of them more or less fixed and unchange- 
able and others quite adjustable. As the teacher faces the 
task she must recognize not only that she will have to 
organize and operate with reference to these fixed points in 
the situation, but also that her class is part of the more com- 
prehensive machinery of the school cotton system. 
She cannot alter the plan of the building or of her room, with 
their entrances and exits, cloakrooms, and windows, and 
she will have to recognize the main structure of the printed 
course of study. Beyond these, however, there is much 
to do to put things in order. It is with reference to the fixed 
limitations of the building and the courses of study that she 
will have books, papers, supplies, wraps, and materials to 
store, distribute, and collect; she will have children to 
classify, seat, and move into and out of the building and to 
the library and the blackboard many times each day; and
-P-A-G-E-138
  126 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
she will have to break up the course of study into lessons, 
and adjust the hours of the day to recreation, study, and 
recitation. To bring all this to order, to the end that the 
modes of procedure — that is, the organization — will not 
only economize time and energy but will in themselves 
produce a cultural effect on the children, is the teacher’s 
task of organizing her school. 
Organization as means and as end. We cannot too 
often or too insistently restate the principle that good 
organization must serve both as a means and as an end. It 
will not only facilitate study and recitation, but will es- 
tablish habits of economy in respect to the use of time, fur- 
nish useful drill in codperative movements, and in all give 
excellent training along executive lines. The boy who has 
learned how to keep his place in line, how to arrange and 
distribute materials with dispatch, how to put his own desk 
in order, has learned something that will be useful to him 
outside of school. In thus organizing it is not a matter of im- 
posing a system upon the school, but rather of reducing the 
normal procedure of the school to a system. 
Not all organization, however, will thus reduce itself to 
mere mechanism. Some plans are for activities which run 
through the whole term without change and will quickly 
reduce themselves to habits, while others have to do with 
activities which are not often repeated, or which are for 
individual rather than for group guidance. These will have 
vo be made anew for each occasion and followed out con- 
sciously rather than mechanically. These latter have to 
do more especially with the handling of the study and reci- 
zation of lessons, while the former have to do almost 
exclusively with the movements of the children and the 
handling of equipment.

  ORGANIZING THE SCHOOL 127 
3. Plans for the first day 
Importance of first day. To bring this conception of 
organization to bear on the teacher’s preparation for her 
first day’s work is very important. First impressions are 
lasting ones, and the teacher should make that day stand 
out as one with a clear-cut program of orderly and effective 
work. Instead of being given over to leisurely registration 
of pupils and assignments of lessons, it should be the first 
day of regular work as nearly as possible under the condi- 
tions that will prevail throughout the year. This means 
that the teacher must be prepared with very specific plans 
covering every feature of the day’s program. 
Getting oriented. Such plans begin with her own work 
in its relations to the school, or even to the city or county 
asa whole. What is the larger educational problem of the 
community? What is the general policy, and who is re- 
sponsible for making that policy? ‘To answer this she should 
obtain recent copies of annual reports, bulletins, circulars, 
courses of study, and syllabi, if any such have been pub- 
lished, and look them over. If there are no such publica- 
tions, then a personal conference with her principal, super- 
visor, or city or county superintendent will be desirable, 
in order to talk over in advance the general plans for the 
year’s work. Early teachers’ meetings and the principal’s 
bulletin board will clear up the problems common to all 
teachers in the building. 
The teacher’s own preliminary arrangements will call 
for a visit to her building and room, where she will familiar- 
ize herself with the plans of entrance and exit for the chil- 
dren; with where the wraps are to be placed; with how to 
regulate the ventilation and light; with the arrangement 
of desks and blackboard, the location of drinking fountains, 
lavatories, and toilets; with the facilities indoors and out 
for play activities; with the library; and with the location 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  128 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
of maps, charts, pictures, chalk, pencils, and paper. She 
will find the last year’s register, with some information 
about the children and their work; and perhaps a well- 
marked copy of the course of study. Nor will she forget to 
leave such information for her successor when she moves 
to another room or position. 
Putting the schoolroom in order. Preparatory to begin- 
ning her work the teacher will see that her room is in order. 
This means a great deal, again, partly because of the in- 
fluence of first impressions. T id be clean, the 
blackboards an pen- 
cils, pens, and paper should be on her desk. and lace

day arrives the teacher should be in her room early. She 
should call at the principal’s office for a moment, not to 
visit, but to receive any final instructions regarding the 
plans for the day, or to ask any necessary questions. She 
should greet any of the other teachers she meets and then 
go to her room to be ready to meet the children as they 
arrive. She has already arranged her room and so on this 
morning has merely a few details to look after. Those 
should not prevent her from meeting her pupils and an- 
swering their questions as they enter, all anxious to see the 
new teacher.
-P-A-G-E-141
  
ORGANIZING THE SCHOOL 129 
Starting and organizing the school. When the gong or 
bell calls the children in she should know precisely how they 
are to enter. She should know where she is to be, just 
where her class will form into line, and just how they will 
enter her room. She should know exactly how the wraps 
are to be disposed of, and what she is going to say and do 
“next.” If these plans have all been carefully worked out 
beforehand they should go through perfectly. The open- 
ing speech should not be long. A very few remarks, not 
about what “you must or must not do,” but about what 
“we are going to do” this very day. While talking the 
teacher should also be working, handing to the children in 
front slips of paper and pencils to be distributed to those in 
the seats behind them. Soon all are busy writing what she 
has asked for: name, age, grade, name and address of 
parents, and any other information necessary for the sys- 
tem of individual records which she will prepare for the 
principal’s office. 
These slips are collected by the same method. The 
teacher now unrolls the daily program and hangs it up 
where all can see, while monitors pass out the books or 
other articles next needed. Things are so well planned and 
so quickly and simply explained that these new monitors 
are catching the spirit of this very quiet but very business- 
like teacher, and are passing it on to other children who 
are busy following directions. The first section of the pro- 
gram is explained, assignments are made, and soon one 
group is busy preparing a lesson, and another with the 
teacher at the board, perhaps, with some work she placed 
there the day before. Somehow it is only about nine 
thirty o’clock, and all are at work. The opening speech 
is past and the school is actually running. 
Advance planning makes all organization easier. It is 
easier to give these instructions than it is to carry them out,  
-P-A-G-E-142
  180 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
but here they are, without mention of the thousand details 
and interruptions which the teacher will have to meet, and 
the only other suggestion is that no teacher will ever open 
her school in such an ideal way who has not learned two im- 
portant lessons: first, how to plan her work so that she 
will know exactly what she is going to do; and second, how 
to make every moment of her time count. If these lessons 
have been well learned the children will return to their 
homes at night with a definite idea of what they have done 
and of what they are to do the next day, and also with the 
right kind of fireside report about the new teacher. 
4. Mechanical features of the organization 
Routine procedure. Certain parts of the organization 
must be reduced to habit as soon as possible, both because 
a thing done by habit will be done in the same way each 
time, and because it will be done more speedily. Such rou- 
tine procedure has sometimes been looked upon as being 
suppressive of individual initiative. It would, of course, 
be possible to carry it to such an extreme as effectively to 
prevent children from thinking for themselves. It is not 
militarism, or blind obedience that is wanted in the school, 
except in a few places where blind obedience can render the 
best sort of service to the individual as well as to the group. 
Most of the routine proposed here will be of such a char- 
acter as to recommend it, both for its educative value to the 
individual and for its value in facilitating the movements 
and work of the group. 
The psychology of habit formation demands: first, strict 
and full attention to the activity that is to be reduced to 
habit; and second, continuous drill which allows no devia- 
tion from the original mode of procedure. This law is an- 
other excellent reason why certain of the teacher’s plans 
should be fully worked out and carefully executed the first
-P-A-G-E-143
  ORGANIZING THE SCHOOL 131 
day. If it is decided to have children march in to music, 
then the sooner this plan is initiated the better it will be 
for the habit that is to be formed. 
Entering and leaving the building. This will be a simple 
or a complex matter according to whether the building is of 
one room or of many rooms or stories. In any case, march- 
ing in will serve as an excellent opportunity for teaching 
children how to walk and how to codperate in filling or 
emptying a building. A fairly good speed will prevent 
dawdling, save time, and give a proper tone to work when 
the children arrive at their seats. A little study of how fast 
the line can move to advantage will be desirable. No sloy- 
enly behavior of any sort should be permitted. If talking 
in a low tone while in line is found to interfere with the 
movement of the line it should be stopped. There are few 
places where some supervision of the lines will not be neces- 
sary, though the idea of self-government in the lines should 
be cultivated. 
In most schools these lines will form and pass to or from 
the building at least eight times a day, or forty times a 
week. If it takes two minutes for each trip, that means 
more than five hours per month devoted to this exercise. 
It would be a pity if nothing of real value came from the 
expenditure of so much time. The aim should be, first, an 
orderly entrance and exit in as short a time as is conducive 
to safety and comfort; second, careful training in how to 
keep the chest and head up, and how to move with accuracy 
and decision. That is, demand of this bit of machinery that 
it shall not only be a means to an end, but that it shall show 
in the carriage and manners of each child a definite educa- 
tional output. 
The fire drill. At irregular intervals, in buildings where 
there is the least danger from fire, these very same lines will 
be formed and the very same movements will be gone
-P-A-G-E-144
  182 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
through with at a slightly increased speed. Such drills 
should always be strictly supervised by the teachers, who 
will invariably be the last persons to leave the building. 
Drills will be called at the times least expected, and if a 
call comes at any time when the children are in process of 
entering they should be drilled in facing about and reversing 
their movements. In such drills the lines should not break 
till the last child is some steps from the building. This 
insures against fright or panic of any sort. 
Handling wraps. Some forty times a week the children’s 
wraps must be handled. Where it is possible for the lines 
to pass through the cloakrooms the wraps may, during 
most of the year, be deposited on assigned hooks as the 
children enter and leave. Where this cannot be done a 
group of monitors should be assigned to collect and dis- 
tribute them. Here careful planning needs to be done in 
advance, and the time accurately figured. Once the best 
time standard is established, the monitors, newly appointed 
from time to time, will know what is expected of them, and 
they will take pride in living up to the standard set. 
Distributing and collecting papers, and pens. There is 
constant need for a plan of distributing the necessary books 
and supplies which the children use at their seats, and most 
of this sort of work can be done according to a set plan by 
monitors. Where papers are to be collected, they may some- 
times be passed forward, the children in the front seats 
placing them in orderly piles on the teacher’s desk. 
In all such work the teacher will need to watch the time 
consumed and keep her standards for speed and order high. 
Each moment lost by a monitor means not one moment but 
as many as the number of pupils he serves. 
Leaving the room. Freedom to leave the room at will is 
desirable, but such privilege is almost sure to be abused. 
While over-leniency is a little better than too great restric-
-P-A-G-E-145
    
ORGANIZING THE SCHOOL 133 
tion, there is an opportunity here for some very important 
work. Though the subject of the proper use of the toilet 
is perhaps a delicate one to handle, it is an important one 
from the standpoint of health as well as from that of social 
and moral development. A frank but good-natured talk 
with the boys and girls separately will go far toward 
starting right habits along these lines. 
Keeping desks and room orderly. Good order about a 
pupil’s desk first of all expedites his movements in getting 
the book, pencil, or paper he wants without bending over 
to look for it. Secondly, an orderly desk is conducive to 
clear thinking. Knowing exactly where this or that book 
or paper is will be next to knowing where this or that idea is. 
Habits of this sort can easily be extended in number and 
variety to include the entire room and playground, to the 
end that bits of chalk and paper on the floor will be picked 
up by the first child who sees them, the basket ball will 
always be in its place, and the window shades and pictures 
on the walls will be straight. 
Habits of this sort will not form themselves, however. 
_ The very first day they should be started carefully, and 
then, with eternal vigilance, one may hope to succeed in 
getting all these things done so perfectly that they need not 
be thought about. 
Personal cleanliness. Along with these habits go those 
relating to personal cleanliness. John’s stubborn hair can 
be parted if he works long and often enough with it. Many 
children have never learned to clean their teeth and nails 
at home, and some appear never to have learned to keep their 
hands and faces clean. It is not only the business of the 
school to teach the importance of these things, but it ought 
to be one of its first and most important duties to fix such 
knowledge in the form of established habits. 
The daily program and other details. There are certain
-P-A-G-E-146
  134 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
other features of the necessary organization which involve 
habit formation to a limited extent, such as the order of 
study and recitation periods — which will be treated in a 
separate chapter — the arrangement of written work, the 
use of reference books, and the passing of articles to other 
pupils. The customary routine of roll call will be made un- 
necessary by the fact that, since the children are assigned 
permanent seats, the teacher has only to have the seats 
numbered, to note down the numbers of the vacant seats on 
a card, and to make the record in the evening as she is pre- 
paring her room for the next day’s work. 
The necessary signals. Some kind of simple system of 
signals, such as words or movements, will be found neces- 
sary in order to produce unity of action. A bell or gong 
sounds three or five minutes before time for entrance. 
Games cease and children go to the drinking fountain or 
lavatory to make ready for the second bell, which means 
form in line. Immediately the line is formed some one 
teacher or older pupil at the entrance gives the signal, a 
simple tap of a bell or wave of a hand — and the line enters, 
each child passing promptly to his or her seat without de- 
lay. If wraps were not deposited on entering, a second sig- 
nal starts the monitors who collect the wraps, which are 
found on the side of the desk near the aisle down which the 
monitor passes. In some rooms a simple signal for be- 
ginning work is desirable for the sake of the few who have 
not learned to make the right use of time. In calling classes, 
and collecting and distributing supplies, other signals are 
necessary. In all cases avoid the noisy or ceremonious. 
The quiet businesslike way is best and most effective in all 
cases. 
In all the above plans the aim is concerted action, prompt- 
ness, and regularity. While these habits are all specialized 
for school purposes, yet every one of them is of value in
-P-A-G-E-147
  
  ORGANIZING THE SCHOOL 185 
itself. Some are for reasons of health and general cleanli- 
ness and refinement; others are insurance against panic, 
and might be useful, to a certain extent, in a burning 
theater or a sinking boat as well as in a school building; 
others are essential elements in all scientific and scholarly 
training, and not one of them robs the child of anything that 
is essential to his individuality or initiative, nor do they 
accustom him to too much blind obedience. 
5. Chapter summary 
In this chapter we have explained the problem that is to be 
treated in Part III, where we change from emphasis upon the indi- 
vidual to emphasis upon the group. Here we have tried to make 
clear that all effective school machinery must serve both as means 
and as end. That is, it must not only conserve both time and 
energy, but must furnish the child with useful knowledge, skills, 
and ideals as well. 
We have shown the application of these principles in suggested 
plans of organization for which the teacher is responsible. From 
what has been said it should be clear that habits of order in enter- 
ing the room, in distributing supplies, in promptness, in keeping 
the desks and room clean must be firmly established, and that 
success depends, first, upon a right start, and second, upon ever- 
lasting persistence in keeping at it.

1. The problem of grading 
Our system taken for granted. The idea of graded schools 
and courses has been so long established in practice that we 
are inclined to pay more heed to the smooth working of 
the machinery than we do to the ends to be served. As one 
looks at Figure 1, he is impressed with the orderly arrange- 
ment of a school system. We read there that the city of 
Berkeley has seventeen elementary schools, four junior high 
schools, and one senior high school. The Franklin School 
of three buildings has twenty-one classrooms, in which 
six hundred and twenty-one pupils are housed for instruc- 
tion. These children spend their first year in the kinder- 
garten and their next six years in grades one to six inclusive. 
From here they follow the arrow down to the Burbank 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
GRADING AND PROMOTING 139 
Junior High School, where they spend three years, from 
which they pass to the senior high school to spend three ad- 
ditional years. Normally a pupil enters this system at the 
age of five years and completes it at the end of his seven- 
teenth year. 
As one reviews this chart, which, in the matter of grading, 
is typical of American public schools, he is impressed with 
the very precise and orderly arrangement. Each block in 
the bar stands for a group of children, and for a collection 
of subject-matter, and one thinks of the children moving 
block by block through the system as the years pass. 
System versus the individual. On reflection, two ob- 
servations come to mind. Does this grading system work 
as smoothly as the chart suggests? And, what are the facts 
and principles to which its shaping and operation have to 
conform? Was it worked out in terms of the children and 
their needs, or is it merely an administrative framework 
through which the child is shifted more or less automatically 
and without regard for his particular interests or abili- 
ties? 
If the system is in line with the conception of education 
set forth in Part I above, then it has to be built up, and we 
are obligated to operate it in terms of the requirements of 
the children. This means that it must facilitate learning, 
not only in the broad sense that it will enable a child to fit 
into his proper place without loss of time, if he should move 
from school to school or city to city, but in the sense that it 
will enable each individual child to work up to the proper 
limits of his capacity to do the work of the school. 
Let us inquire why such a system is necessary, upon what 
principles it must be constructed, what are the practical 
difficulties to be overcome in using it, and by what devices 
we are able to meet and solve these difficulties.

2. Class and individual systems of instruction 
Group work a necessity. In the previous chapter we 
dealt with the more or less external features of the school’s 
organization, taking classes for granted. Here we are to 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  
GRADING AND PROMOTING 1 
examine the principles and plans essential to the formation 
of these instructional groups. The problem is at once one 
of economy and of sound teaching principles. A commu- 
nity has a large number of children to teach, there is a fairly 
well-defined body of knowledge to be taught, and financial 
resources are in a measure limited. How best to give to 
each child this common fund of knowledge and experience, 
and how to do this in the most economical way, is the ques- 
tion. 
The basis upon which such groups will be organized will 
depend upon whether we expect to teach the pupils together, 
as a class, or separately, as individuals. If by groups, then 
they must be organized somewhat on the basis of the work 
they are capable of doing; if by individuals, then each pupil 
must be permitted to work as rapidly as he can without 
reference to what others can do. 
Group versus individual instruction. What are the rela- 
tive merits of these two points of view? The arguments 
for the class plan of instruction are: 
1. It brings the child into intimate contact with other pupils, 
whereby he learns that there are children who are as original 
or as stupid as he, and so learns to know his own ability in 
terms of the abilities of others. 
2. He is forced into competition of all kinds, competition in 
ideas, in speed and accuracy, in the requirements of the vari- 
ous skills, and in good manners, and is thereby stimulated 
to do his very best. 
8. He learns how to codperate with his fellows in all the various 
class exercises. 
4, Through these intimate contacts he develops a more cosmo- 
politan point of view, a broader basis for human sympathy, 
and a saner view of his own rights and duties. 
5. Practically none of these things can be effectively accom- 
plished by strictly individual instruction. 
Certainly life outside of the school is full of competition
-P-A-G-E-154
    142 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
and codperation, and certainly for training along executive 
lines these social contacts are indispensable. 
The advocates of individual instruction, on the other 
hand, will insist that: 
1. Group instruction attempts to meet the needs of the fictitious 
“average child,” and so loses sight of individual differences. 
2. It tends to become mechanical and to operate on the principle 
of the survival of the fittest. 
8. This failure to meet the needs of the individual causes great 
nervous strain on the weaker pupils. 
4, Group instruction tends to discourage those who find it hard 
to keep up with their grade. 
§.. Individual instruction in most of these matters has the oppo- 
site effect of conserving the health and energy of the individ- 
ual and of adapting the method and the content to the par- 
ticular needs of each child. 
These arguments seem to the writer to point out abuses 
which are entirely possible but by no means inherent in 
the group system. There must be a middle ground between 
these extreme views which will conserve the best elements 
of each without including the evils of either. This ground 
the graded system has attempted, during the last half- 
century, to discover. 
3. The proper bases for grading 
Grading related to other problems. Any system of grad- 
ing is intimately connected with two other problems in 
school organization, namely, that of curriculum making 
and that of promoting children from grade to grade. For 
each group of children there is a corresponding section in 
the course of study, and the promotion of a child from one 
grade to another must mean that he has completed one sec- 
tion of the course of study and is ready to begin the next. 
Here we are concerned with two problems: first, the re- 
lation between groups of children on the one hand, and the
-P-A-G-E-155
DS Fo a Eh OE Late ee Nee oe ee ee ee ee CMR NE eRe se eee ee 
t 
GRADING AND PROMOTING 143 
relation between groups of subject-matter on the other; 
and second, what are the principles underlying the organi- 
;zation of each. (The organization of subject-matter will 
be treated in the following chapter.) Shall we group chil- 
dren in terms of an arbitrarily prearranged course of study, 
or must the length and character of the sections of the 
course of study be determined by the nature of the group 
of children to be taught? 
If we were to organize the subject-matter of arithmetic 
in the most careful and logical manner we should find that 
the natural divisions of the subject would be unequal both 
in length and in difficulty, and the same would be true of 
history or geography materials. Secondly, the logical divi- 
sions of arithmetic would not correspond in length to those 
of history. This being true of other subjects, we can readily 
see that the bare logic of subject-matter cannot become the 
basis for the organization of the curriculum, to say nothing 
of its significance for the organization of groups of children. 
What then are the principles underlying the grading and 
classification of children? The aim of grading is to make it 
possible to teach a given subject to a number of children at 
the same time. This means that the children must be homo- 
geneous with respect to the task, and our problem is to find 
the essential basis of this homogeneity. 
Possible bases. There are numerous ways in which we 
might group children for instructional purposes. 
1. We might group them with respect to sex. But while inves- 
tigations have shown that boys and girls differ in respect to 
their achievements in school, these differences are not so pro- 
nounced as to warrant separate groups for instructional pur- 
poses.? 
2. We might grade children on the basis of chronological age,

J. B., Spelling Efficiency in the Schools of Oakland, California. 
   
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
but our retardation studies show that chronological age is no 
index to what children can do in school work.! 
3. We might use physiological age as a basis, but, while we know 
that physiological age often does not correspond closely to 
chronological age, we do not know how closely it corresponds 
to ability to do school work.? 
4. We might use psychological age, that is, general intelligence, 
as a basis, only that this does not tell us what specific prepa- 
ration a child may have for doing work of a given kind. 
5. We might use school examinations, but we know that such 
tests are untrustworthy. 
6. We might use “time in school” as a basis, but tests show that 
children of the same age, sex, physical conditions, and train- 
ing vary greatly in the amounts of work they can accomplish 
in a given time. 
So far as possible our basis should be that of ability to 
do accurately a definite piece of work at a given rate. 
Precisely what are the elements that together constitute 
this ability is our real problem. 
When children may work together. From this we are 
reminded that children are unlike in almost every particu- 
lar. To teach a dozen or twenty children in a group it is 
of course not necessary that they should be exactly alike. 
It is only necessary that they be so nearly alike that on a 
given problem they will all require about the same amount 
of assistance. It is a question then, first, of what are the 
traits which determine a child’s ability to do a given amount 
of a given kind of work in a given time; and second, are the 
individual differences in these traits so pronounced as to 
make impossible or extremely difficult the grouping of 
children for purposes of teaching. 
Correct bases. In order to settle these questions let us 
repeat: first, that in their bearing on instruction sex differ-

ship,” in The Psychological Clinic (1907), pp. 115-20. See other references 
at close of chapter. 
   
-P-A-G-E-157
GRADING AND PROMOTING 145 
ences are small; that chronological age does not at all 
clearly indicate ability to do work; that school examinations 
are not satisfactory, because they only show what a child 
knows, and not how rapidly he can do a given piece of work; 
and that time in school is not a practical basis.!_ Physiologi- 
cal age to a certain extent, and psychological age almost cer- 
tainly, indicate how difficult work a child can do, and how 
rapidly he can do it. They fail only to show what previous 
formal preparation the child may have had for doing the 
work in question, the extent to which his health and emo- 
tional make-up may interfere with his work, and the per- 
sistence he will show in carrying out his work. 
Individual differences in general intelligence. In view 
of the fact, then, that it is upon the basis of intelligence and 
previous training that we must_group_the children forwin- 
structional purpos i i- 
ative statemen' e_ individual dj ne 
dren in respect to physiological and psychological agewand 
in respect to previous preparation for a given piece of work.f 
If we had eight hundred children to grade the best metho 
would be to determine, first, their general intelligence, per- 
haps by physiological, and certainly by psychological tests, 
and second, their previous preparation by educational tests. 
The accompanying diagram shows the distribution of 905 
unselected children, five to fourteen years old, with respect 
to general intelligence. This distribution is based upon the 
Stanford revision of the Binet-Simon tests for measuring 
general intelligence? The term “intelligence quotient” 
(I Q) means the ratio of mental age to chronological age. 
A mentally normal child has an I Q of approximately 100.

| Tests and the Classroom Teacher, chaps. 2, 5, 6.

-P-A-G-E-158
  146 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
If, however, an eight-year-old child tests as ten years old 
mentally, then his I Q would not be 100 but 125, or 25 
above the normal. A study of this figure shows that these 
905 children range in I Q’s from 56 to 145; that is, from very 
low to very high mentality.

The distribution of intelligence. This diagram gives, 
perhaps, as true a description of the range of intelligence 
among elementary-school children as can be given to date, 
and we should note the following facts which this diagram 
brings out: first, that about one third of the children tested 
are normal (96-105); second, that almost exactly as many 
are above as below normal; third, that the distribution of 
those above normal corresponds closely to the distribution 
of those below normal. That is, the .33 per cent who have 
I Q’s between 56 and 65 are offset by the .55 per cent at the 
upper extreme with I Q’s between 136 and 145, and so with 
the other groups. Certainly the child at the upper ex- 
treme can work at an incomparably faster rate in school 
subjects, or at anything else, than can the child at the lower 
extreme. 
For any scheme of grading or promotion whatsoever this 
j
-P-A-G-E-159
  GRADING AND PROMOTING 147 
distribution of human intelligence is fundamental fact num- 
ber one. 
How these differences show themselves. The next ques- 
tion is, how do these individual differences in intelligence 
reveal themselves in the educational output of a group of 
children who have worked together on a given subject for 
a given length of time. This can be answered best in terms 
of the results shown by giving some standardized educa- 
tional test. For this purpose the following diagram, repre- 
senting the scores attained by 416 sixth-grade children in 
a test in addition, is presented. Presumably these children 
had had approximately equal training in addition, and yet 
twelve of them failed to complete one problem correctly, 
while two others completed eighteen correctly. Just as 
many worked less as worked more than six problems. 
It is obvious that these children have worked with widely 
different degrees of effectiveness during their first six years 
in school. That is, assuming that all started equal in their 
knowledge of addition, we find these differences at the end 
of six years. The most satisfactory explanation for these 
differences in adding ability is difference in mentality. 
These mental differences were there to begin with, but in 
grading the children they were ignored. Simply because the 
children all entered at the same time, and were about the 
same age, it was assumed that they could all work together. 
This diagram proves that that was a false assumption. The 
result is that about one fourth of the group is wasting its 
opportunity trying to do something it cannot do, while 
another fourth is doing the same, since, not having to 
work to keep up with the class, the pupils are developing 
habits of inattention, indifference, and laziness. 
In order to show that it is not a mere guess as to whether 
mental ability explains such a display of results as this, let 
us examine some actual cases. For this purpose two
-P-A-G-E-160

tables are introduced, one for first-grade pupils, and the 
other for high-school pupils.

M = number of examples completed by median child. 
In the first is shown the mental ages of one hundred and 
forty-nine first-grade pupils, and with this their teachers’ 
judgments of the quality of their school work. From these 
figures it is very clear that high mental age counts in 
quality of work. These pupils are roughly of the same chron- 
ological age, but vary as to mental age. With this variation 
in mental age it is easy to see a corresponding variation in 
the quality of the work they are able to do in school. 
In our second table we have a somewhat similar story for 
one hundred and thirty-one high-school pupils. Here we

see not only a decline in the average high-school mark that 
corresponds to the decline in the intelligence quotient, but 
we see further that the brighter the child the more likely he 
was to go through high school and on to college. 
These tables present facts that are typical of those being 
brought to light everywhere throughout the country as we 
study the influence of intelligence on school progress. It is 
obvious that if this one factor counts so much in success,

also enter as modifying factors in difficult cases, but in- 
telligence and previous training are basic and fundamental. 
4. Difficulties in applying these principles 
Difficulties stated. It is easy to say that children should 
be graded and promoted on the basis of their abilities to do 
work of a certain degree of difficulty, but there are many 
practical difficulties to be overcome in carrying out this 
dictum. When school opens in the autumn, twenty or fifty 
pupils, five to seven years old, enter for the first time. If we 
measured them for intelligence we should find them dis- 
tributed very much as in Fig. 2, page 146, though probably 
without showing the lower extreme. If we measured them 
for knowledge of subjects to be studied let us assume that 
we should find them all equal, or nearly so. Now how shall 
we apply these two facts in grading such a group? Cer- 
tainly they must all begin at the same place in their studies, 
namely, at the beginning. 
Practical solution. Then they may as well begin together 
in a single class, or in two classes if there are more than 
forty. Our problem is, how to provide for the different 
rates of progress which our intelligence test indicates as pos- 
sible for the different children? It is not reasonable to ex- 
pect the child with an I Q of 80 to keep pace with the child 
whose I Qis 130. It is necessary, therefore, that practically 
from the start the class should be divided into three groups, 
with those whose I Q’s are below 95 in one group, those 
whose I Q’s are 95 to 106 in another, and those whose I Q’s 
are above 106 in a third. According to Fig. 2, this would 
divide them almost equally into three groups. Any one 
teacher can handle three such groups far more effectively 
than she can handle them as one group. 
Teacher’s judgment not trustworthy. To show that this 
is practically possible we have only to add that it is pre-  
-P-A-G-E-164
  152 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
cisely what is being done now in most of our city schools, 
with the exception that intelligence is often determined, 
not by adequate psychological tests, but by the teacher’s 
judgment alone. To show that the teacher’s judgment, 
though an indispensable factor always, is often erroneous, 
we have only to cite the results of careful investigations of 
this question.1_ These studies show that the bright children, 
though accelerated for their chronological age, are almost 
always retarded for their mental age. This means that the 
teacher (or the grading and promotion machinery) did not 
let the bright pupils go as fast as they were capable of going. 
Just the opposite of this is found to be true of children of 
low mentality? 
The point is that the teacher is too often satisfied with 
John’s leading his class, when the fact is he ought to be 
leading the next class above. It is merely one more point 
at which ox-cart methods in school work must give place 
to the more refined methods of science. 
The principle applies in ungraded school. But here we 
have assumed that the entering class would have the en- 
tire attention of one teacher, whereas, save in large schools, 
this is not possible. Probably at least two thirds of all the 
children in the United States do not enter school under such 
conditions. Instead they enter rooms containing from two 
to eight full grades, and it is in such places that the for- 
mation of these special divisions of each grade is difficult or 
impossible, for in addition to the differences in native in- 
telligence, there will necessarily be great variations in age, 
1 Dr. Terman has shown that teachers almost invariably overestimate 
the intelligence of children of low mentality, and that they underestimate 
that of children of high mentality. See his Measurement of Intelligence, 
chap. 11. These findings are clearly borne out by the results of recent 
educational tests.

size, and previous training. Instruction under such cir- 
cumstances is of course difficult, but it can be made more 
effective if the teacher knows the kind of intelligence she 
has to work with. She can then add library and report 
work to the assignments of the brighter pupils, and ease 
up the load on those not so bright. We might say that the 
more widely her children vary in intelligence and in 
previous training the more individualistic her instruction 
must be made. 
5. Flexibility the essential element 
Need for frequent reclassification. In any system of 
grading flexibility is the essential element demanded by the 
facts we have pointed out above. If children vary in in- 
telligence, as we have already shown, and can consequently 
work at different rates of speed, the system of grading must 
make possible a frequent reclassification in order that those 
who are capable may not be held back by the slower pupils, 
and in order that the slower pupils may not be overworked 
or discouraged. Numerous systems, varying from no elas- 
ticity to extreme individual instruction, have been devised 
to meet these demands. 
Two ways of obtaining flexibility. There are two possible 
methods by which such flexibility may be provided. One is 
to have a single course of study for all and correct inequali- 
ties by regrouping or promoting at frequent intervals, push- 
ing the bright pupils ahead and the extremely slow ones 
back. The other is to have two or more courses of study, 
differing in the amount of supplementary work to be done 
in addition to covering a certain minimum common to each. 
The difference between these two plans is obvious. In the 
one all children who complete the eight grades will have cov- 
ered the same ground, some in six years, perhaps, others 
in seven, eight, nine, or even ten. Some will therefore be  
-P-A-G-E-166
  154 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
twelve, others sixteen years old, when they are ready to 
enter the high school. By the other plan, if it is carried out to 
its logical limits, all are the same age, that is fourteen, 
when they finish the elementary school, and all alike have

covered the essential facts and principles in the course of 
study, but in addition to this the brighter pupils have en- 
riched this common core of learning with much supplemen- 
tary work. 
The single-course plan. The working of the two plans 
will be made clearer by the following diagrams. Let us sup- 
pose that the course of study for the elementary school is 
divided into eight equal parts, each part representing the 
work of one year, and that each year’s work is divided 
into ten sections, each representing a month’s work. The 
vertical bar in Fig. 4 will represent the end of a half-year’s 
work. Let us imagine a class of thirty pupils starting to- 
gether on this half-year’s work, beginning at the left end of 
the figure. If they are all equal in intelligence, previous

They are not equal in these respects, however, and so in a 
few weeks some are ahead of the class, while others are be- 
hind. At the end of the half-year we find about four or five

another small number who have completed only about three

move at these rates year after year we see that some will 
finish the elementary school in a little over six years, and 
others in little short of ten years, but all will have covered 
the same ground. 
Instead of promoting at the end of each month, as is 
suggested by Fig. 4, the so-called Cambridge plan for grad- 
ing and promotion, as shown in Fig. 5, attempts to meet 
these needs by having a six-years course and an eight-years 
course side by side. A bright pupil may thus finish the 
eight-years course in six years, while a slow pupil may use 
the full eight years. It is also possible to switch from the 
fast to the slow course, or vice versa, if such an adjustment is 
thought profitable. This is but one of numerous variations 
of the short-promotion idea. 
The multiple-course plan. In the other plan the correc- 
tion of this unevenness in the class is accomplished only in 
part by redistributing the children, that is by promotions, the 
main plan being to provide the brighter pupils with ad-

of study may be represented by 
grades or years, as in Fig. 6. Let 
the gray portions of bar C repre- 
sent the work by years. The 
middle bar, B, will include the 
work represented by the C divi- 
sions and also a certain amount 
of additional or supplementary 
work, involving application of 
principles in a practical way, 
and more details. Bar A will in- 
clude the work represented by 
the other two bars, with still 
more work added. Upon enter- 
ing school the class begins the 
work of the middle division, but 
very soon must be divided into 
sections A, B, and C, including 
respectively the superior, the 
average, and the slow pupils. 
The teacher will then carry the 
three groups forward, and as oc- 
casion demands she will move a 
child from one of these sections 
to another till the pupil finds the 
proper amount of work necessary 
to occupy his full time. This 
sort of shifting will take care of 
readjustments or promotions for 
some time, continue to keep the 
pupils together as a group, and 
so permit them to remain longer 
with one teacher. For rural

schools it probably represents the best grading and pro- 
moting plan. In time, however, a few of the pupils of 
group A will be able to take up the work of section C in 
the next year above, at which time such pupils may be 
transferred from section A to section C of the next year 
above, as shown in Fig. 6. Similarly a little later group 
B, and at the end of the year group C, will move to the 
next year’s work. 
Results under the multiple-course plan. Where this plan 
was tried, at Santa Barbara, California,’ it was found that 
about 10 per cent of the children could not do more in one 
year than the minimum amount of work, as represented by 
division C; that 23 per cent did the work represented by 
division B; that 44 per cent did that represented by division 
A; and that 8 per cent did that represented by A, plus that 
represented by C in the next year above; and that 14 per 
cent did even more than this. 
The important feature of both these plans of promotion 
is that they are thoroughly elastic. They provide as nearly 
as possible for every child, whatever may be his capacity 
for work, and yet no child works alone. He is always in a 
class, competing and codperating with others, and so dis- 
covering his own strength and weakness. These two plans, 
with numerous variations and combinations, represent the 
best that has been achieved by the movement against the 
old “lockstep” method of yearly promotions, and with the 
rapid development of scientific tests for determining a child’s 
ability there is reason to hope that a system will soon be 
evolved which will unite all the advantages of individual 
instruction with those to be obtained by group work.

6. Promotion by grades and by subjects 
The old annual grade promotion plan. The system of 
promotions, which Dr. Wm. T. Harris attacked in 1869 to 
1874 in his annual reports as superintendent of schools in 
St. Louis, provided but one chance a year for promotion, 
and if a child failed in one subject, especially if that subject 
happened to be arithmetic, he was forced to repeat the 
entire work of the year, regardless of the need for such repe- 
tition in other than the one subject in which he failed. 
Our recent studies of school costs and of individual differ- 
ences show how ridiculous this is, yet in many schools we 
are still making promotions upon exactly this basis. In 
the high school and in the college we have outgrown this 
practice. If a student in these schools who carries five 
studies happens to fail in one of the five, he must repeat that 
one subject but not the other four. The result is that in 
four of his subjects the student retains his interest, and also 
his prestige with his fellow students, whereas under the old 
plan he would have been compelled to drop back with an- 
other class younger than himself and waste his time for a 
year going over work already familiar to him. 
How to overcome these evils. The elementary school is 
beginning to realize what such a system means to the child 
in lost opportunity, and efforts are being made to meet the 
issue by various forms of reorganization.1 With our more 
elastic plans of promotion the loss from failure is corre- 
spondingly less in quantity, but remains identical in other 
respects. The fact that children pass in four studies and fail 
in one or two may be due to wrong emphasis in teaching 
method, or in the organization of subject-matter, or in time 
distribution; or it may be due to the child’s lack of interest 
in certain of his studies. Certainly we need standards in all

tion. (Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston. 1916.)

these matters, but this lack should not interfere, and has not 
interfered, with other attempts at solution. 
In addition to the types of flexibility in grading outlined 
above, three plans have been devised for overcoming this 
weakness. 
First, to each room is added an extra teacher whose busi- 
ness it is to supervise the children’s study, giving special 
help to the slow pupils, and to any who are behind in a given 
subject. This plan, as worked out at Batavia, New York 
— known as the “Batavia System” — is a combination of 
class and individual instruction which is designed to keep 
the backward pupils up with their classes by means of special 
individual help.! 
Second, the ungraded room has been provided, when the 
school is large enough. Under this plan a room is set apart 
as a sort of teaching hospital, to which any teacher may 
send a child for special work in any subject. As soon as he 
has caught up with his class he may resume his work with 
his regular teacher. Such rooms are used to receive either 
slow or bright children. If a pupil is almost ready to skip 
a grade he is sent here for special work which will lead up to 
the work in the grade above. 
The third plan is that of promotion by subjects. In the 
elementary school this plan is yet in its infancy, but where 
it has been tried out there is every evidence that it can be 
accomplished exactly as it is accomplished in the high school 
and college.2 More experiments are needed, however, in 
order to guarantee its practicability. ”

7. Keeping the children adjusted 
Readjustment a continuous need. Even though we may 
work out plans for keeping the children moving, each at 
his own best rate, we find that many children are not where 
they belong. Over and over we find, too, that it is more often 
the bright child who is behind where he belongs. In other 
words, even with a thoroughly sensitive grading system we 
do not keep the children properly graded. The reason is 
that it requires work to operate even a good machine. We 
naturally cling to things as they are, and we do not disturb 
a child’s position in his grade until it is so unsatisfactory as 
to cause disturbance. If a child fails, we notice it; if he 
gets very far ahead of his class, he usually falls into mis- 
chief, and then we look for the reason. Our grading system 
may have been sufficiently elastic to have forestalled such 
crises, with their attendant waste and sadness, had we de- 
tected the misadjustments and reclassified the children. 
This means that along with a grasp of the principles and 
plans of grading, a teacher must understand how to detect 
a need for using the system to keep her pupils moving at 
their own best rates. 
Knowing her pupils. At the outset of the year a teacher 
should make a thorough study of all her pupils. For this 
every record should be followed back to the time each 
child entered school. The nature of this record is very 
important as a basis for judging how to instruct the child. 
Such facts as the following are important: 
study of the data of two years’ experience with the individual system in the 
training school. In this connection the reader will do well to read of the 
various experimental efforts to rid instruction of the influence of rigid 
machine control. For instance: Dewey, Schools of Tomorrow; Hamaide, 
Amelie, The Decrole Class: A Contributor to Elementary Education. See 
especially the many brief descriptions of experimental schools presented in 
The Twenty-Sixth Yearbook of the National Society for the Study of Educa- 
tion. (1926.)

If at the beginning of the year the teacher would prepare 
a form, with the children’s names on the left and these four- 
teen items across the top, and fill it out from the records, she 
would have an excellent introduction to her class. She 
might want to add to these fourteen items others about the 
child’s home life, nationality, play interests, travel experi- 
ences, home duties, and interest in books, people, machin- 
ery, animals, and plants. The more the teacher knows at 
the outset the more likely she will be to detect any misad. 
justment in the child’s grading, and the better basis shc 
will have for forming a judgment as to how to reclassify 
him. 
Detecting and measuring misadjustments. In most 
schools the teacher will find some children who are retarded, 
or have fallen behind their grade, and others who have 
skipped some work and so are accelerated, or ahead of their 
grade. There are standard ways of measuring and de- 
scribing these misadjustments, and with these the teacher 
should be familiar. 
The standards that are commonly accepted are as 
follows:

Normally a child will enter grade I B somewhere between 
the ages of 5 years and 9 months and 6 years and 3 months, 
and complete the grade between the ages of 6 years and 3 
months and 6 years and 9 months, and so on for the other 
grades. 
These are the norms against which we judge whether a 
child is where he should be for his age. 
Age-grade position. This proposal to check a pupil’s 
position against his mental age suggests that we are much 
interested in knowing whether a child is progressing at the 
proper rate. Methods for obtaining both these facts — age- 
grade position, and rate of progress — may be suggested by 
the illustration given in Table IV, which shows where a child 
from any one of the various age-groups is located. By this 
table we see that of the 24 pupils who are between 5 years 
and 9 months and 6 years and 8 months of age, 21 are just 
entering a school, 2 are in the upper half of grade I, and 1 is 
entering grade II B. So we may read for any age group.

Rate of progress. At the bottom of Table IV, we find 
that of the 35 pupils in grade I B, 21 are normal (in position) 
and 14 are retarded. Of the 35 in grade I A, 2 are acceler- 
ated, 19 are normal, and 14 are retarded. These figures are 
expressed in percentages in the lower lines of the table.

This table gives us a picture of where the children are but 
gives us no notion of how they came to be there. Those in 
the squares are where they belong, for their ages, but many 
are obviously older than they should be for their positions. 
In order to do something about this we need to know why 
these pupils are ahead of and behind where they belong. 
A useful step will have been taken if we prepare a second 
table similar to this one except: 
For column one change the heading to read “Years in school,” 
_ _ instead of “Age in years and months.” 
In place of the figures 5-9 to 6-3 insert “less than 14.” In 
place of 6-3 to 6-9 insert “14,” and so for the following figures, 
advancing 14 year at a time. 
In place of ‘‘accelerated” write “rapid progress.” 
In place of “normal”? write “normal progress.” 
In place of “retarded” write “slow progress.” 
Make corresponding changes in the per cent tables following. 
With our table revised we would then read that of the 24 
children in line 1: none have made “slow progress,” 21 have 
made “normal progress,” and 3 have made “rapid progress.” 
A study of this table as thus revised would show which of 
the children have traveled slowly, which normally, and 
which rapidly in their school work. 
While these two tables would show us where each child 
of any given age is located and the rate at which he has 
progressed, it would not tell us why he has moved at this 
rate. To find this out we shall have to inquire as to his 
health, attendance record, application or effort, mental age, 
IQ, and previous scholastic record, since all of these are 
possible sources to which we may look for an explanation. 
The teacher’s interest in these measures. To the super- 
intendent such mass figures as are suggested by these tables 
have definite value. He must see his school system as a 
whole. For the teacher, however, the mass picture must
-P-A-G-E-177
GRADING AND PROMOTING 165 
be studied in detail. For her the question is: Where in this 
table is John, or Mary? Why is John here, and should he 
be elsewhere in the table? If he is not where he ought to be 
as judged by all the facts suggested above, then she has 
found her real problem, the problem of reclassification. 
The procedure is not simple. Classifying children is not 
a mere matter of watching the calendar. It is much more 
than this. The task is to receive a child at the begin- 
ning of his school career, put him where his natural talent 
seems to warrant, and then keep him in a position in the 
grades where he will best use his talents. However we may 
choose to do it we must not let him get out of adjustment. 
This must apply not merely to his study courses combined, 
but to each of his courses in particular. It will very often 
bring up the question of subject promotion, and of irregular 
promotion; and these needs will provide the teacher’s real 
opportunity for rendering professional rather than routine 
service. 
For this, however, the teacher must master the technique 
that has been suggested in this chapter. She will not have 
the opportunity, probably, to develop a new type of grading 
scheme, but she will have ample use for a thorough under- 
standing of the principles upon which such systems are 
devised. She must know how to study her pupils individ- 
ually as well as a class, how to assemble and record proper 
facts about them, how to read and interpret past records, 
how to give tests, how to study progress, and how to reach 
a decision as to what to do when reclassification is needed. 
8. Chapter summary 
The object here has been to examine the principles involved in 
the classification and promotion of children, on the assumption 
that group instruction is not only necessary for economic reasons 
but is profitable for educational reasons. 
A perfect system of grading and promotion must combine the 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
beneficial features of group instruction with those of individual 
instruction and as far as possible avoid the evils of each. This can 
only be done by making the organization flexible enough to meet 
the individual demands of human nature, which we know to be 
extremely varied. 
Investigations of individual differences, and of the results of 
school work, tend to show that sex, age, length of time in school, 
examinations, and the teacher’s judgment do not form satisfactory 
bases upon which to determine promotion, but that general intelli- 
gence and previous training are fundamental. 
To meet the demands of individual differences two types of 
flexibility in grading have been devised. One has a single course 
of study with frequent promotion periods, the other has a variable 
course of study which cares for most of the necessary adjustments, 
frequent promotions playing only a secondary part. Numerous 
combinations and variations of these two plans have been used to 
good effect. 
Even with such flexible plans it is found that children are fre- 
quently held back by the fact that they fail in one subject. To 
remedy this, three plans have been devised: first, the Batavia plan, 
of providing each room with a special teacher for backward pupils; 
second, the ungraded room, to which children may be sent for 
special help; and third, promotion by subjects. All these have 
been tried out with excellent results. 
Whatever system may be devised for the organization of children 
into teaching groups it will be the teacher’s business to conduct 
her room on that basis. With the very best system possible to de- 
vise there will be many misadjustments. The technique for the 
study of these every teacher must master and use from day to day. 
The teacher should therefore familiarize herself not only with the 
principles of grading and promotions, and with every detail of the 
particular system under which she is to teach, but also with the 
methods for studying retardation and acceleration. To this equip- 
ment she must add a working knowledge of the best psychological 
and educational tests of intelligence, knowledge, and skill, and 
train herself to detect quickly the degree of effectiveness with 
which her plans are serving each individual child.

QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
. What are the advantages and disadvantages of group instruction? 
Of individual instruction? 
. What are the practical difficulties in the way of each? 
. How is the problem of grading connected with the problem of curricu- 
lum making, and with that of promotions? 
. Enumerate all the possible bases for grading children. Why is sex 
not an important basis? What is the difference between chronologi- 
cal and psychological age? What is meant by physiological age, and 
what connection is it thought to have with intelligence? 
. What evidence have we that the teacher’s judgment is not an ade- 
quate basis for determining promotions? 
. Upon what basis should grading and promotion be determined? 
What is meant by intelligence quotient (I Q)? 
. How can we measure intelligence, and what is the best way to measure 
the amount and kind of knowledge and skill a child possesses? 
. How do children vary with respect to intelligence and how do these 
variations reveal themselves in the results of study? 
. What are some of the practical difficulties in the way of applying these 
tests as bases of promotion? 
What is meant by flexibility in grading children? Describe the two 
plans suggested for providing such flexibility. What improvement 
do these schemes afford over the old method of annual promotions? 
Suppose a child had done passing work in all his classes except arith- 
metic; would you have him repeat all the work of that grade? If so, 
what do you think the actual educational, social, and moral conse- 
quences would be for the child? If not, what usable plans have been 
devised for permitting him to continue in all his studies and still re- 
view his work in arithmetic? 
What difficulties do you see in the way of individual promotions by 
subject? 
How can the rural teacher overcome some of the obstacles to grading 
her pupils according to plans suggested above? 
Why does a teacher need to know something about individual differ- 
ences, methods for measuring general intelligence, educational tests, 
the principles involved in grading and promotion, and the practical 
plans for carrying out those principles? 
Suppose in your class you had one pupil who was fair in all his classes 
except reading, and excellent in that. What would youdo? Suppose 
by the beginning of the last month of school he had brought all his 
studies up except history, what would you do?

PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
. Collect the following facts for a group of fifty pupils now in school, . 
who have failed (at least once) to be promoted. 
a. How much actual time was lost? 
6. Did the pupil do superior, average, or inferior work when re- 
peating? 
c. Was he noticeably disheartened by his failure? 
d. In repeating his studies, was the field different or broader than 
that covered the first time? 
e. In what subjects was repeating really unnecessary? 
f. Sum up the real meaning of these failures: to the child, to the 
school. 
. Make a corresponding study of pupils who have received extra or 
double promotions, securing the facts as to:

1. What a curriculum is 
Curriculum to supplement world experience. The term 
curriculum usually brings to our minds a printed course 
of study or a collection of textbooks, the one being the 
directions by which the content of the other is to be ad- 
ministered to the children. We tend to think of the child 
and of the curriculum as two unrelated objects of concern 
for the teacher, who assumes it to be her function to bring 
the two together. We think of the child as coming to school 
to get knowledge, and of the curriculum as the knowledge 
which he is to get. So it is that we are likely to set the one 
over against the other. 
If, however, we turn to our definition of education ! we 
are reminded that to learn is not merely to master the 
printed page, to get information, but that it is to develop, 
to grow, to experience, to live. It follows then in a broad 
sense that whatever enters to modify the thought or the

  THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 
behavior, that is the learning, of the child, is in so far a 
part of his larger curriculum of life. Forgetting the narrow 
work of the school then, for the moment, and remembering 
that the child is busy learning wherever he is, we see that 
the world, in so far as he can in any way appropriate it, is | 
his curriculum. The world, too, is not merely pouring into | 
his mind — he is also attacking the world, selecting here 
and rejecting there. He almost literally carves out his own 
world, and so his own education. 
The school, historically speaking, came in to supplement 
this larger program and to economize this larger learning 
process. Consequently the school curriculum is scarcely 
more than an incident in the sum total of the child’s edu- 
cation, and it will be an important incident only if it in- 
cludes the same wide variety of information and activities 
that are included in that broader curriculum we call life. All 
this wider knowledge the school must reduce to order, to 
the end that the child may learn more rapidly and effectively. 
Two essential viewpoints. Two points, then, are to be 
observed. First, the curriculum must include both know- 
ledge and activities, and these must be drawn from the 
actual life the child is living, else they cannot supplement his 
ordinary experiences. Second, this knowledge must be so 
organized that it will be approachable for the child in the 
same way that the outside world is approachable. Other- 
wise the child will not actively select and reject, but will re- 
main passive with,respect to it. Similarly, the activities 
included in the curriculum must be the natural activities of 
children, otherwise they will not readily engage in or under- 
stand them. 
A curriculum, then, is not merely a given quantity of in- 
formation to be memorized and reproduced by the child. 
/SIf we think of the printed course of study we may call it a 
| set of directions whereby the child will have an oppor- } i

tunity to give expression to his own best impulses and 
purposes, and to get possession of the kinds of experience 
and. knowledge that will make it possible for him to under- 
stand the past and to enter into the civilization of the 
present and future. If, on the other hand, we think of what 
this outline or printed course stands for, we must think of 
the whole of life — physical, intellectual, social and moral, 
zesthetic, and economic. Not of mere information about 
these aspects of life, but of information plus actual ex- 
perience in them. 
Each study a means to a special end. If we examine the 
different studies with this broader function of the curricu- 
lum in mind, we shall see that each study is essentially a 
means by which the true significance of education and the 
fundamental aims of the school are to be realized. If we 
ask what are reading, writing, spelling, and composition, and 
why are they part of the curriculum, we at once realize that 
life could scarcely go on without them. They are social } 
instruments or tools which the child must have if he is to/ 
have access to the past experiences of the race, or even if he’ 
is to take part in ordinary social and business affairs. Arith=* 
metic is scarcely more than a tool in a similar sense. His- 
tory is taught in order that the child may have some sort of 
temporal perspective for the part he is to play in society; 
while geography and civics orient him with respect to place 
and to present institutional life. If we ask the same 
questions about gardening, cooking, sewing, all kinds of 
construction work in paper, leather, wood, and metal; or 
about singing, dramatization, story-telling, painting, draw- 
ing, modeling in clay, plays, and games, as we find them ir 
the elementary school, we must answer that, while for the 
child these are actual social activities which appeal to his 
natural impulses, yet from the standpoint of adult society 
they are not only important experiences, but are introduc-
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 173 
tory to fundamental occupations without which there could 
be no community life. When we study language from the 
standpoint of literature, and drawing and painting from the 
standpoint of fine art, we are only studying these modes or 
instruments of expression from the point of view of their 
esthetic value, as distinct from that of their technical or 
industrial value in community life, for which they were 
originally developed.!. Thus the curriculum includes be- 
havior quite as much as it includes knowledge, and each 
is pertinent both to child nature and to adult social needs. 
The changing nature of the curriculum. The curriculum 
is thus a medium through which the child may find his place 
in the highly institutionalized life about him, living through 
the various types of experiences which have been and are 
essential to the development of society. By getting these 
experiences he comes into possession of the essential social 
tools, reading, writing, and number; gains a knowledge of 
the past culture which is so essential to an understanding 
of the present; and enters into the life of his own time. 
With such a function the curriculum cannot remain 
static. The past extends into the present, the present into 
the future, and each age has its own tools, customs, know- 
ledge, and ideals, and interprets the past in these terms. 
With new inventions, with the growth of science and of art, 
with the enlargement and increasing complexity of com- 
munity life, the past must be constantly reinterpreted if 
it is to serve the present and anticipate the future. Thus, 
at one time the study of history in our schools was largely 
a study of the military and political past; now, with our 
industrial development, our history looks more to the eco- 
nomic and social past. Similarly, at one time we studied

physiology and anatomy from the standpoint of the domi- 
nant scientific movement. The point of view in these sub- 
jects is now shifting in the direction of personal and social 
hygiene and sanitation. A few years ago there was no need 
for music and drawing in the school because frontier life had 
little time or place for the higher forms of art, but now the 
world demands them. So the curriculum is ever changing 
to meet the changing needs of the time. 
Why “‘ fads ” and “frills ” in the curriculum. We need 
not be surprised, then, that the layman and the antiquated 
teacher, who have been accustomed to think of the child as 
a little man and of the curriculum as a body of knowledge, 
complain of “fads” and “frills” in the curriculum. They 
think of drawing, manual training, basketry, weaving, sew- 
ing, and cooking as superfluous subjects, when in fact they \ 
are designed mainly to furnish important social experiences 
through which the child may grow to a fuller understanding 
of various occupations which have been basic in the evolu- 
tion of society. One can think of numerous facts and ac- 
tivities, really essential to a modern curriculum, which 
would have been entirely meaningless in a monastic school 
of the fifteenth century, or even in a pioneer rural school a 
half century ago. The difference is a difference in civili- 
zations. Change, then, is a fundamental characteristic of | 
las curriculum that fulfills its proper purpose. ¥ 
2. The teacher’s interpretation of the curriculum 
The above has suggested two widely different points of 
view from which the curriculum may be interpreted by the 
teacher. She may think of it purely from the standpoint 
of so much information to be imparted; or she may think 
of it from the standpoint of the experience (involving both 
information and activities) essential to the all-round devel- 
opment of the child.
-P-A-G-E-187
    
THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 175 
The curriculum as a body of knowledge. If the former 
point of view is taken, then the formal side of every study 
will be stressed. Composition will not mean a study of free 
and natural expression, but rather of grammatically- 
correct expression. Each little theme will be written, not 
eagerly and out of a full experience, but ploddingly, to 
demonstrate the correct use of capitals, how to make para- 
graphs, or how to distinguish narration from exposition or 
description. History will become a study of names, dates, 
and places, instead of a study of the life of a people. Physi- 
ology will be a study of how the teeth are constructed, with 
emphasis upon remembering the words mastication, 
enamel, and dentine, rather than upon why the teeth should 
be kept clean and upon actual practice in keeping them 
clean. Discipline will come to mean keeping the children 
quiet, morals and manners will be taught by preaching and 
scolding, and play will have no part in school work. It will 
be the intellectual alone that is stressed, with the greatest 
emphasis upon the memory aspect of intelligence and the 
least upon observation, reason, and imagination. The 
curriculum will become an end instead of a means, and the 
teacher a slave to the printed course of study. 
The curriculum as a body of experience. If, on the other 
hand, the development idea should dominate, then the 
teacher will watch the child more and the printed directions 
about the number of pages to be covered less. Training of 
memory will not exclude training in observation, judg- 
ment, will, imagination, and expression. It will be the 
whole mental life, and not one single part of it, that will be 
trained. Nor will the physical, social, and sesthetic sides of 
the child’s life be neglected. Play will become a funda- 
mental part of social and physical training. Through 
basketry, weaving, sewing, modeling, and gardening, the 
child will gradually be led into the essential processes of 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
176 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
civilized society. He will not merely read about agricul- 
ture, or be told what it means, but through planting and ~ 
tilling and harvesting in the school garden he will discover 
man’s real relationship to the soil. He will not merely read 
of the great cotton and woolen industries, but through 
weaving he will experience something of their meaning. 
Reading will not be correct pronunciation alone; it will be 
thought getting and expression. The curriculum will not 
provide merely for a few lessons on digestion, but through 
cooking and a study of foods and how to care for them, 
through washing dishes and serving meals, it will bring the 
knowledge of digestion to bear upon the practical problems 
of health and development. Civics will not be studied so 
much from books as from streets, offices, industries, and 
public places. The curriculum will not be an end, but only a 
means. It will not be all-inclusive, it will only serve to 
point the way. : 
The two viewpoints contrasted. In the one case the cur- 
riculum is viewed solely from the standpoint of that know- 
ledge which adult society demands that each of its members 
shall possess. In the other case it is viewed from the stand- 
point of the process by which the young, immature, im- 
pulsive child comes into possession of the knowledge and 
experience essential to membership in society. In the for- 
mer the child learns mainly from books, in the latter from 
books plus experience. Thus the teacher’s interpretation of 
the curriculum, whether it be conscious and studied or 
merely inherited as a tradition, becomes her working phi- 
losophy in school. 7 
3. Socializing and motivating the curriculum 
Meaning of socialized subject-matter. To apply this 
second interpretation to the curriculum is to socialize and 
to motivate the work of the school. A subject is socialized 
  ¥
-P-A-G-E-189
    THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 177 
when the knowledge it contains bears intimately upon the 
child’s contacts with the physical and social world about 
him, and when it can be promptly converted into active 
experience with one or another aspect of that world. It is 
motivated when it is selected and organized with respect 
to the child’s real interests and his immediate contacts with 
’ life about him. 
How to socialize the curriculum. How to make such a 
curriculum, or how to reshape a traditional curriculum to 
these ends, is the vital point at which this whole question 
becomes a practical issue with the teacher and principal. 
In order to accomplish either of these things the teacher 
must keep in mind not the textbook alone, but also the 
points at which the materials within the text connect up 
with the outside world and with the natural spontaneous 
activities of children. The child is continually dealing 
with quantitative aspects of his environment, social, 
physical, and economic, and his arithmetic lessons should 
not be left to find their own connection with this ex- 
perience. : 
This does not mean that the course in arithmetic will dis- 
card the necessary memory work involved in mastering the 
number combinations, but it does mean that the course 
will involve the kind of experience with numbers that will 
help the child to a new way of looking at the world about 
him, and to facility in some very essential social processes. 
The child may learn all the tables of measure there are in his 
text, and work the problems, but until he has fairly con- 
verted these standards or units of measure into a language 
they are not socialized, but are held in his memory as so 
much verbiage or so many bare symbols and rules. 
Examples in socialization of studies. On the way to 
school the child sees a snake, a squirrel, and a busy ant hill, 
and the flowers he brings were found at a certain place on 
e  
-P-A-G-E-190
  178 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
the roadside. Here he has an abundance of material for a 
splendid oral or written language lesson. But when he goes 
to write he cannot ‘say how long the snake was, how far 
from the little bridge he found it, how far he watched it 
run before it entered a hole; he cannot tell how high up the 
squirrel was in the tree, the dimensions of the ant hill, or 
how many minutes it took to gather the flowers, though 
these would all be vital points in the story — and all be- 
cause the inches, feet, yards, seconds, and minutes of the 
arithmetic had not been made to do their proper work out- 
side of class. Again, he learns the number of cents, nickels, 
dimes, and quarters in a dollar, but is much embarrassed 
when he attempts to make change at a counter. 
To socialize and motivate arithmetic the teacher must 
force numbers into action in connection with all kinds of 
experiences, not only for the sake of extending the child’s 
knowledge of number, but also for the sake of facilitating 
expression, for the sake of the new mode of appreciation 
one gains from concrete experience, and for the sake of 
more accurate thinking where number is involved. 
The teacher’s responsibility. A printed course of study 
or a text can scarcely be large enough to give specific direc- 
tions for so many details, nor can the maker of texts and 
courses know in advance the thousand particular oppor- 
tunities the teacher is going to have with a given group of 
children in a given community for socializing and moti- 
vating the work in arithmetic. This is very largely the 
teacher’s problem. She must discover the opportunity and 
the material to work with. If necessary, she should note 
down from day to day typical situations in which children 
find a real use for quantitative expression. This practice 
will not only accumulate the richest kind of supplementary 
material for arithmetic, but will train the teacher in a type 
of observation that is highly important in all her teaching.  
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 179 
What is true of arithmetic is equally true of other sub- 
jects. Most homes contain newspapers, magazines, and 
books, and the opportunity for developing interest in read- 
ing is almost unlimited if the teacher is on the alert. How 
much more the lessons in civics would mean if the thou- 
sands of county court-houses, city halls, state capitals, 
police, street, and fire departments were converted into 
laboratories for our schools! These are but a few illustra- 
tions of what it means to socialize and motivate the course 
of study, but these are enough to suggest reasons for put- 
ting the newer studies into the curriculum, and to convince 
the teacher that even after these studies are included, suc- 
cess still depends very largely upon the materials she brings 
in to supplement the text and connect the subject in a vital 
way with life outside the school. 
How to gather these materials. This socialization of the 
child’s work is too important a matter to be left to a casual 
or haphazard handling. It may involve more by far than 
the above illustrations imply if we carry ‘the principle into 
the organization and conduct of the school as well as into 
the selection of the subject-matter of the courses offered. 
Elsewhere (Chapters V, VI, VIII, IX, and XII) we have 
developed the implications of this principle in the matters of 
organization, discipline, and the general social atmosphere 
of the school. Here we are especially concerned with the 
problem of selecting and arranging subject-matter. 
We have previously described (Chapter X) a plan for 
making a study of one’s pupils; here we require the informa- 
tion suggested by that study and other information in ad- 
dition. Let us consider a special type of survey ‘for this 
purpose — a survey that will acquaint the teacher with the 
following facts about the child and the community. Let 
us assume that the teacher will gather these facts by first- 
hand contacts with the children and their homes.
-P-A-G-E-192

1. Child’s name — age — grade — mental age — I Q — health 
index — progress. 
2. Character of the home and family life: Size of house — dis- 
tance from school — size of family — occupation of father — 
nationality of father and mother — reading matter in home 
— musical instruments — connections the family has with 
social, professional, or commercial clubs and fraternities — 
equipment the child has for play at home and with near-by 
children — work done by child at home — source and amount 
of spending money child has and the uses he makes of it — 
what he reads at home — what he likes best to read — what 
he means to be when he is a man.! 
8. The child’s interests and abilities: What he likes best to play 
— what games he is most proficient in — what studies he 
likes best — what studies he is most proficient in — what 
games and studies he likes least and is least proficient in — 
his strong and weak points as a leader and a follower — his 
weak points in: manners, morals, language, dress, cleanliness, 
knowledges, skills, physique. 
This is only suggestive of the types of knowledge which a 
teacher needs in order to know how to socialize and motivate 
the work of a given child. It may seem an endless task to 
make such a survey of thirty or forty pupils. |The answer 
to such objection is that this is the only way to substitute 
- fact for guessing and false assumptions in this matter. 
Zz 4. Types of subject-matter 
curriculum have been divided into two groups, called re- 
spectively form and content studies. Form studies include 
reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, and grammar; while, 
hy, Hstowy, literature, sive and phy siology are 
commonly classed as content subjects. nt 
emphasis is placed upon the mastery of formal rules and

    Form and content studies. In the past the studies of the 
| | 
   
-P-A-G-E-193
  
THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 181 
symbols. The form of the letter or word in spelling, read- 
ing, and writing, the formula or rule or law in mathematics 
and grammar, have to be learned. In the content subjects 
there is little time spent on the mastery of symbols and 
rules as such. The idea is rather to get at the facts for 
which the combined symbols stand. 
Form and content inseparable. Such a division of sub- 
ject-matter may be of use in helping the teacher to think 
more clearly about the specific teaching problems with which 
she is working at a given time, but there is a genuine danger 
in thus separating two things so organically united as are 
form and content in the course of study, or in a given sub- 
ject. We only have to try to imagine what value one would 
have without the other in order to feel the force of their 
intimate relationship. Historically, bare symbols arose 
only as they were needed to convey ideas to others, and 
language came before grammatical rules, yet science and 
mathematics have reached their high stages of develop- 
ment only because symbols, rules, and principles have 
made it possible to think clearly in the midst of vast quan- 
tities of facts. Thus, while experience (content) precedes 
the use of symbols and the formulation of rules (form), yet 
each is essential to the other, and they should not consti- 
tute a dualism in curriculum making. 
When teaching writing, grammar, spelling, and arith- 
metic the teacher should keep this relationship firmly in 
mind as a further reason that her subject-matter should be 
thoroughly socialized and motivated. This will not do 
away with the necessity for drill in writing, spelling, or 
arithmetic, but it will lay emphasis upon the idea of unity 
in the curriculum as a whole. Then spelling lessons will be 
frequently drawn from the composition work and from 
other studies. Language lessons will find their content in 
nature study, history, civics, games, and plays; the reading 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
182 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
    lesson may frequently be drawn from the history, the daily 
paper, or the composition lesson; and the number lessons 
will go into action in manual training, domestic science, 
and composition. 
Poor teaching results from too great separation of the two. 
The abuses that come from an undue separation of form 
and content need only to be suggested. It is often assumed 
that reading, for instance, is entirely a form subject. This 
explains why the selection of subject-matter for beginners 
is often made on the basis of length of words, rather than 
on the basis of the meaning the words may convey to the 
child. It explains, too, why some “systems” of teaching 
reading are wholly phonetic and mechanical, and why, 
until recent years, even pupils in the advanced grades 
studied one single reading text filled with scraps of moral 
philosophy, the virtue of the book depending upon the diffi- 
culty of its words and sentences and upon the formal moral 
teaching it contained. Similarly, the spellers were full of 
rules about the final e of primitive words, etc., followed by 
a list of words illustrating the rule and by other lists il- 
lustrating the numerous exceptions. We are gradually 
learning that such a separation of form and content in 
spelling does not produce good spellers. 
In the older arithmetic textbooks every new subject, 
from notation to cube root, was preceded by a rule covering 
the examples to be worked. This rule was committed to 
memory. That was one task. Then it was applied in a list 
of problems. That was a second task, only a little less mean- 
ingless than the first one. But the trouble had only begun, 
for since the rule and the problem were entirely unrelated 
to the child’s actual experience, he must find some kind of 
artificial method of remembering them. Here is where the

results of an investigation of this subject.

  THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 183 
| old-time schoolmaster flourished his ferrule and insisted 
upon his doctrine of repetition, repetition, repetition. 
Double character of all studies. The attempt to treat 
| these subjects as though they had no content is only slightly 
more ridiculous than to assume that history, nature study, 
geography, manual training, and music have no form. , We 
cannot discard names and dates in history, nor places in 
geography, nor can we study nature without some system 
of ¢lassification for the objects we deal with. The classifica- 
tions of trees, birds, plants, and land forms are based upon 
fundamental principles which have to be mastered as we 
proceed with the study. 
The danger is that we shall try to master the system of 
classification apart from the things it classifies, or else go 
to the other extreme of ignoring dates, names, and princi- 
ples, to the end that the child gets the merest smattering of 
unrelated facts. There is a great deal of the formal in arith- 
metic, and a great deal of content in geography, but arith- 
metic is not without content and geography is not without 
form. And while the teacher should see her problem clearly 
as dealing specifically with the one or the other at a given 
moment, she must always keep that broader perspective 
which sees each as a single aspect of the larger whole in 
which both appear in proper relationship. 
5. The tendency in curriculum-making 
Changing conceptions of education. The curriculum of 
to-day is much richer in content material and far less formal 
than was the curriculum of even a decade ago. The idea 
that because a subject is useful it is therefore not educative 
has about disappeared, with the result that the modern cur- 
riculum provides for a rich and varied experience in almost 
every conceivable line. Through dramatization, plays, 
games, and calisthenics, and through practical work in per-

sonal hygiene, the child’s physical development is being 
provided for; through civics, the study of public sanitation, 
and history, as well as through play and codperative work 
in field and laboratory, the moral and social side is being 
cared for; through music, drawing, painting, and hand- 
work, esthetic training is provided; while through cooking, 
sewing, manual training, designing, agriculture, and garden- 
ing the child receives a useful introduction to home making 
and to numerous basic occupations and economic and social 
processes. 
The subject-matter of the older studies is being sifted 
more and more to meet these broader aims of the school, 
so that one may say that the curriculum of to-morrow 
promises to be very true to real life. Training for the eyes, 
the ears, the hands, the reason, the imagination, as well as 
for the memory, and this as much from real experience as 
from the printed page, characterize the new curriculum. 
Current view of curriculum revision. In the develop- 
ment and reorganization of curricula the older idea of leav- 
ing the task to subject-matter experts is largely past. To- 
day we begin very differently. We start with a general 
philosophy of education, which is much as we have set it 
down in Part I of this book. Education is to help the child 
find his place in a democratic society of children and adults. 
From here we do not go to our classified knowledges direct, 
assuming, for instance, that all arithmetic is the same, or 
that all language study is the same for all children and in all 
communities. Rather we recognize now that the child’s 
world is full of number or quantitative situations which he 
faces every day and will face all his life. These number 
situations are important. They are arithmetic, to be sure, 
but they are chosen not because they fit perfectly into the 
science of arithmetic, but rather because they fit perfectly 
into the actual experience of living. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 185 
Organization of studies. This brings up the important 
question of what are to be our studies. Shall we discard 
the idea of arithmetic as a science, or as a tool subject, in 
favor of arithmetic as it is incident to life situations, and so 
exchange the present type of arithmetic course and text for 
a collection of independent activities in which there are 
number situations to be met? If so, then we will do this 
on the theory that what we learn when we are engaged in a 
real activity will be more worth while and more easily 
learned than what we learn as subjects are now organ~ 
ized. 
Some insist that all our present subjects could be dis- 
carded entirely, and that we could start each child to work, 
alone or in a group, on subjects or activities that are drawn 
from life as the child now sees and will see it, and that in the 
course of his years in school he will have met and solved so 
many of these life problems that he will have gained a 
knowledge of the sciences and arts as we now think of them. 
New experiments. We have schools in which many ex- 
periments of this character are at present under way.! The 
old sharp lines that separate history from geography, arith- 
metic from construction work, and reading from language 
work are being questioned, and in places they are breaking 
down. We hear more and more discussion of “general 
mathematics,” “the social studies,” “health and physical 
training,” and “English,” each of which represents a group 
of studies. We hear much, too, of “activities” and “pro- 
jects,” and much condemnation of the old passive sort 
of learning. More and more the child is given responsibility, 
not merely for remembering something read, but for doing 
something that will involve reading, figuring, expression,

Education for discussion of many of these schools. See also the literature 
on the project method.

observation (in the field, perhaps), investigation, construc- 
tion, and independent effort. Similarly, extra-curricular 
activities and the organization of the school are being 
studied for the contribution they may make to the social, 
moral, and executive training of the child. 
Between the studies as now organized and “activities” as 
here suggested there is a wide gap, and one not easily 
bridged by the curriculum maker. There is no doubt that 
in theory these experiments are in the right direction; the 
real test, however, is the outcome of the change. We have 
now no adequate measure of this outcome. We have much 
general observation and opinion, but little scientific proof of 
superior worth. This does not argue against such experi- 
menting, but it reminds us that we are dealing not only with 
a fundamental change in theory but also with an equally 
fundamental change in subject-matter and in class manage- 
ment. Only those who comprehend the meaning of these 
changes should try to effect them in a large way. 
The grading of subjects. Where shall each study begin 
and where end in the curriculum? There is no satisfactory 
answer to this question unless we refer to a program of a 
given type, and even then there will be wide difference of 
opinion. In this, as in many other curriculum problems, 
our answer would need to apply to the individual child, and 
even then we could not decide the matter in purely ob- 
jective terms. We might omit geography as a formal sub- 
ject until grade six, but teach much of it in our reading, 
language, and history courses in earlier grades. 
In this matter there is wide variety in practice. By an 
extensive examination of the courses of study in the coun- 
ties and cities of California ! it has been shown that there is 
practically no common agreement, and this applies not

Study, University of California Printing Office, Berkeley, California. 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 187 
only to the grade placement of the various subjects, but 
even more to the arrangement of topics within the courses. 
This is probably what a study of the courses in any State 
would show. 
The purpose here is not to offer a recommendation on this 
point, but only to suggest that the problem is one of major 
importance in curriculum organization and administration. 
The possibilities of a combination of subjects, or of correla- 
tion between subjects, is a part of the problem.! 
The teacher and curriculum revision. Naturally the 
individual teacher will have only limited contact with the 
Jarger movement of curriculum revision that may be going 
nin her city or county. The nature of this contact, though, 
is our concern in this book. 
We may set it down as axiomatic that a teacher cannot 
teach well that which she does not fully comprehend and 
that in which she does not have a definite interest. This 
means that the teacher must know and be interested in the 
curriculum which she teaches. This can be the case only if 
she has a hand in its making. These propositions are fully 
accepted by progressive school systems, and are dictating 
the method by which curriculum revisions are being ef- 
fected.2, The work is done by large committees and sub- 
committees, headed by supervision and curriculum experts. 
The teacher will be a member of some group, and have a 
chance to study and be in touch with every step of the work. 
For this responsibility the teacher must be equipped by 
interest and training, or expect to stand aside and let others 
do an important part of her work for her. 
1 See Chapter XII, on “The Daily Program.” 
2 Most progressive cities are bringing their teachers into intimate and 
responsible contact with the work of curriculum revision. Denver, De- 
troit, Berkeley, Oakland, and Los Angeles are cities that have recently 
attracted attention by the systematic way in which they have provided 
for teacher participation in curriculum construction.  
-P-A-G-E-200
  “188 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
To participate in this work the teacher will succeed best 
who: 
1. Masters the general theory upon which the modern curricu- 
lum is based. 
2. Familiarizes herself with the ideas and methods of research in 
this field. 
8. Is willing to experiment with new ideas, and with new mate- 
rials and methods. 
4. Studies her pupils and community for curriculum ideas and 
materials (see sec. 3 above). 
5. Is willing to give time and thought to the problem. 
6. Is willing to codperate and to learn from others. 
The problem as a whole. Making and revising curricula 
involve four major problems, as follows: 
1. What is our general theory as to what constitutes value in 
subject-matter? 
2. How should subject-matter be selected and organized in order 
to meet the requirements of this theory? 
8. Similarly, how should the curriculum be administered? 
4. How may we test the worth of the curriculum materials as 
taught? 
Tn a sense these four problems represent the order of pro- 
cedure in curriculum construction. The first of them we 
have at least tentatively solved, thanks largely to Pro- 
fessor John Dewey. The second we are now working on. 
In theory we have, to a considerable extent, broken with 
the old organization of materials and with the old materials 
themselves. The terms “project,” “socialized subject- 
matter,” “‘motivated materials,” “job analysis,” “ex- 
perimental schools,” “laboratory schools,” “creative edu- 
cation,” “activities,” and “outcomes” suggest how we have 
gone to life, social and physical, for subject-matter, and 
how we are shifting to the child and society and away from 
“studies,” “learning,” and subject-matter itself as our
-P-A-G-E-201
THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM 189 
point of departure for the selection and organization of 
curriculum materials. 
The third question we are also attacking. The idea of 
mass instruction is being studied, and where it violates the 
teaching principles that grow out of the facts about in- 
dividual differences, is being discarded. Experiments, 
such as are under way at Chicago, Missouri, and Columbia 
Universities; and the Dalton Plan, the Winnetka Plan, the 
Fairhope, the Waldon, and the Francis Parker Schools, are a 
few of the outstanding experiments with new types of cur- 
riculum administration. 
The fourth problem is one we need to study most earnestly. 
The teacher should not bring new materials into her sub- 
jects without examining them carefully to see what contri- 
bution is to be, and, once new matter is introduced, serious 
effort should be made to find out what value it has. 
The teacher must realize that while she will not be called 
upon to direct the thought of the country on this subject, 
, she will be able to contribute to the movement only if she 
' sees the great scope of the problem and finds a point in her 
own work at which she may take hold of it in a practical 
way. A study of the field through the accompanying 
bibliography will not be too much to expect of a modern 
teacher. This chapter is only a sketch, and at most it is 
but a brief introduction to the field with which the teacher 
must become familiar. 
6. Chapter summary 
The purpose of this chapter has been to explain the real function 
and character of subject-matter and of the curriculum. Such an 
understanding is necessary if instruction is to be managed to a 
proper end. 
Two opposing viewpoints — one inherited from the past, the 
other a recent development of scientific study — have been strug- 
gling for control in our schools. The one looks upon the course of 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  190 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
study as an end, while the other regards it as only a means. One 
emphasizes the formal, the other the functional aspect of the know- 
ledge and skills to be imparted. The one insists upon learning 
rules and principles as such, the other upon learning these in their 
real applications. These points of view are irreconcilable, and in 
the light of modern thought the former must yield its place to the 
latter. 
This means that the curriculum will come to be defined in terms 
of social and psychological need as opposed to tradition, or the 
logic of subjects, and that it will be organized in terms of psycho- 
logical and pedagogical principles rather than in terms of the bare 
logic of subject-matter itself. It means that the teacher will draw 
upon the social and physical life about her for materials to enrich 
her studies; that she will not interpret form as having no connec- 
tion with content; and that the curriculum will be constantly re- 
made in terms of changing social needs. 
This makes the curriculum a changing body of material, its 
changes corresponding to changes in our civilization. Keeping 
pace with these changes requires continuous study of the subject- 
matter of all our courses. In this study the teacher has important 
responsibility and opportunity. She only is in touch with the re- 
actions of children to new materials and methods, and this know- 
ledge is essential in curriculum revision. Also, since the teacher is 
to be the interpreter of the curriculum she must make the subject- | 
matter her very own. This she can do only by participating in its 
alterations. To do so she must be a student of educational theory, 
of the technique of research, of children, of curricula; and she 
must be a critical experimenter. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Re-read Chapter I, and then try to answer the following questions: 
a. Mention ways in which your own elementary school curriculum 
supplemented your experience outside of school. 
b. Were activities — plays, games, folk dancing, dramatization, 
music, and handwork — such as sewing, gardening, and drawing 
— stressed more or less than study from the printed page? 
ec. Did your curriculum give you any information about, or any 
experience in: — how to meet people in a business way, in a 
social way; how to offer your services to a stranger in need of 
help; public or civic duties in matters of sanitation, public office, 
community library, park, playground, celebrations, the care of

public property; propriety in dress, and propriety in conduct on 
the street and in public places; the value of money, public enter- 
prise, paying taxes, etc.? If so, in connection with what studies? 
d. Classify the studies you took under the school aims discussed in 
chapter one. What studies can properly be placed under more 
than one of these aims? 
. What is meant by a static curriculum? In what sense is change 
essential to the curriculum? 
. Mention some changes that have taken place in the American ele- 
mentary school curriculum which reveal fundamental social change ~ 
in American life. 
. What of the newer studies would a strictly informational type of 
curriculum ignore? What is the objection to such a curriculum? Are 
the different studies in such a curriculum likely to be carefully corre- 
lated? 
. What is meant by socializing and motivating the curriculum? What 
is the teacher's reponsibility in the matter? 
. What is meant by form and content subjects? Distinguish form from 
content in reading, arithmetic, civics, geography. 
. What advantage is there for the teacher in such a division of subject- 
matter? What are the dangers in such a separation? 
. Explain how the course in geography might be taught largely as a 
formal subject. Distinguish form and content in music, drawing, and 
domestic science. 
. Through what studies would you expect a child to obtain training in 
observation, memory, imagination, reasoning, the senses of touch, 
hearing, and sight? 
How would you aim to supplement the ordinary curriculum to obtain 
the ends suggested in question 9? 
In what way would you expect the course in history to supplement 
the course in geography? 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
. Select a group of arithmetics published before 1800, another group 
published about 1860 to 1880, and a group recently published. Ex- 
amine the prefaces and introductions and compare them as to the 
general theory of education and of curriculum materials they contain. 
. Compare also as to the character of the materials presented. To what 
extent do they seem to reflect the interests and activities of children? 
To what extent do they introduce the child to typical activities 
(social and economic) of adult society? 
. Make a survey of a community for the purpose of providing socializing 
materials for the social studies, such as: 
a. Materials from home life
-P-A-G-E-204
    192 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
b, Materials from occupations 
c. Materials from political life 
d. Materials on manner and dress 
e. Materials of a historical nature 
Show how each group of materials (facts and activities) may be 
worked into a typical sixth-grade course of study. 
4. Prepare an up-to-date description of one of the experimental schools 
referred to in this chapter. 
a. Explain (drawing from proper sources) the principles upon which 
this school is organized. 
b. Describe its course of study, and characterize the course in the 
light of the discussion in this chapter. 
c. Compare or contrast the child’s work in the school, using a typi- 
cal day’s work in contrast with a similar day’s work in an old 
type of school. 
5. Work out a plan whereby a county superintendent of schools might 
undertake a program of curriculum revision.

THE DAILY PROGRAM 
Ovriine or CHAPTER 
1. Organizing the day’s work: The problem stated — Principles and problems in program- making —The time available— Number of recitation and study periods — Number of courses offered —The possibility of alternating courses — Other types of combinations — Divisions of daily program. 
2. The problem of time allotment: Difficulties in determining time allotment — How we have decided time allotment in the past — Time allotment in representative rural and city systems — What these figures suggest. 
3. Preparing the program: Purposes to be served —'The order of study — The problems of interest and fatigue — Rules governing work and rest. 4. Typical programs: A proper program—A three-class program — Program for a Bural School. 5. How to use the program, 6, Summary — Questions — Problems — References. 
1. Organizing the day’s work 
The problem stated. The organization of the movements 
of children and of the handling of materials is much simpler 
than is the organization of the day’s work. Once the chil- 
dren are graded and classified, and the course of study out- 
lined, we have then to decide that perplexing question of 
the relative value of studies, and to determine the order in 
which-they shall be dealt with in the study and recitation 
periods of the day. Nor is it merely an academic question 
as to which is the more important, geography or spelling, 
but just how important each is as measured by the amount 
of time it is to consume. 
How to program the day’s work, or the week’s work, is a 
question that must be answered very differently in different 
schools. First of all, schools differ as to the extent and char- 
acter of their curricula. Some have many while others have 
few or none of the more recent studies and activities. Some 
combine civics with history, language with grammar, litera- 
ture with reading, and geography with science and nature
-P-A-G-E-208
    196 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
study, while others treat all these ea separately. 
Again, some schools stress pupil activities, and work out 
their courses in the form of projects. is tendency in the 
early grades is becoming more and more marked. With 
this method of work, subjects are thrown together and the 
subject is made subordinate to the activity. The result is 
that the time schedule of the older type of organization is 
being replaced by a far less formal scheme of time allot- 
ment. 
Again, in the upper grades there is an increasing tend- 
ency to reorganize under the junior-high-school plan. This 
greatly alters the programs of grades seven and eight by 
introducing a richer program of studies, by departmentaliz- 
ing the instruction, and by laying greater stress upon 
laboratory, field work, executive training, and pupil inde- 
pendence. 
Thus, the time schedule suited to the older type of eight- 
grade organization, with its typical academic program, would 
be ill-suited to the school that emphasizes activities or 
project procedure as opposed to book study; or to the school 
that includes laboratory, shop, studio, stage, gymnasium, 
and conservatory; or to the school that has departmental- 
ized its instruction; or to the platoon type of school; or to 
the school that by any method whatever tries to adjust 
instruction to the proper needs of the pupils as individuals. 
Principles and problems in program-making. When we 
deal with the problem of time allotment, therefore, we must 
keep in mind that we are dealing with a complicated sub- 
ject, and that no single prescription can be written that will 
not require careful interpretation for any one of the wide 
variety of purposes, sets of materials, and organizations 
here suggested. 
There are certain facts and principles, however, that will 
assist in the development of a program, and that have wide
-P-A-G-E-209
  
THE DAILY PROGRAM 197 
enough application to warrant our suggesting them as 
points of departure for the teacher or principal or super- 
visor who faces the task of working out a time-schedule. 
These may be stated as follows: 
1. In any course, or in any classroom, there is a given amount of 
subject-matter to be learned or there are a given number of 
activities to be carried out, during the year. By dividing the 
amount to be covered by the number of months, weeks, or 
days we may obtain a fair index of the rate at which the work 
must be done. Either the amount to be done dictates the 
time required, or the time required dictates the amount that 
can be done. 
. The number of recitations to be conducted, or study periods 
to be supervised, or activities to be directed, in the day (or 
week) affords a basis for determining the average time availa- 
ble for each. (Whether or not a study or activity shall be 
pursued each day, or given relatively more time on fewer days 
of the week, is a problem upon which experiment is needed. A 
little writing, or drawing, or singing, or dancing each day is 
undoubtedly better than a much larger amount once a month. 
The same would be true of work on arithmetic or history or 
reading. Just how best to distribute the time for each type of 
work is an important though only partially settled question.) 1 
3. There is the relative value of each recitation or study, to be 
decided upon as a basis for determining which studies shall 
have more and which less than the average time allotment. 
4, There is the order in which each lesson shall be studied and 
recited, to be determined in part by the relative difficulty of 
the studies, as shown by the tendency of each to weary the 
child, in part by plans of building and school organization. 
5. There is the general problem of the distribution of the child’s 
energy throughout the day. 
6. Then there is the division of the day into work and recreation 
periods, to be determined by the influence of recreation upon 
keeping the child’s energy at a high state of efficiency. x9

The time available. The teacher will usually have from 
twenty-eight to forty weeks of time in which to complete 
the work outlined for the year, and each school day is in 
most places five hours in length, beginning at 9 a.m. and 
closing at 3 p.m. A six-hour school day, from 9 a.m. to 4 
P.M., also is frequently found, especially in rural schools. 
The tendency in this country seems to be to lengthen the 
school year, but to shorten the day, the latter particularly 
for the earlier grades. However, with the increasing em- 
phasis upon supervised play, and upon field and laboratory 
and stage work, it is quite likely that the school day will 
tend to grow longer rather than shorter in the future! The 
day is ordinarily divided into four work periods of ap- 
proximately equal length, the forenoon and the afternoon 
each being broken by a fifteen-minute rest period, and with 
an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes’ rest at noon. There 
are numerous variations from this to meet the needs of 
special cases, such as increasing the number of recreation 
periods for the younger and for physically defective children 
and of doing away with the recess periods for the upper 
grades. 
Deducting at least an hour and a half for rest we have 
left in a six-hour day two periods of ninety minutes each, 
and two periods of seventy-five minutes each in which to 
plan for the necessary number of daily recitations. The 
time is very close at hand when we shall cease to speak of 
these rest periods as if they contained nothing. These 
periods are coming to be more and more intelligently used in 
our best managed schools, to the end that all children en- 
gage in some kind of free play that not only rests and re- 
freshes them physically and mentally, but gives them im- 
portant social and executive training as well.   
1 The platoon plan of organization, and other plans for diversified pro- 
grams of instruction involving activities, should make a longer day possible.
-P-A-G-E-211
THE DAILY PROGRAM 199 
Number of recitation and study periods. The number of 
recitations the teacher will have during the day will depend, 
first of all, upon the number of grades in her room. The 
larger city or consolidated rural school will have but one 
grade in a room, while the one-room school will probably 
have eight. The time schedule for a room containing but 
one grade, divided into two sections a half year apart in 
their studies, is not difficult to arrange, but with eight grades 
present the problem is extremely complex. In the one case 
the teacher will have plenty of time to hear the necessary 
recitations, and to supervise much of the study, while in the 
other she will be busy practically the entire time with reci- 
tations alone. The writer has before him two daily pro- 
grams now in use, one by a teacher of a single sixth grade, 
the other by a teacher of all eight grades. The one con- 
ducts nine, the other thirty-six recitations each day. It is 
obvious that these two teachers cannot give equal care and 
attention to the supervision of study. One of these teachers 
has an average of more than thirty-six and the other less 
than ten minutes for each recitation. 
Another point needs to be kept in mind. For good 
reasons a teacher may have more class groups than grade 
groups in her room. In reading, for example, because of 
the wide variation in the abilities of pupils it is often wise 
to have the grade broken up into three groups for pur- 
poses of recitation. This gives greater homogeneity in the 
group, and helps to individualize the instruction as well. 
This may apply to any subject, and the principle should 
be applied as far as time and number of grade groups 
permit. 
Number of courses offered. The number of recitations 
will depend upon the number of separate courses offered. 
English may be one or many separate courses. Reading, 
phonics, language, spelling, grammar, literature, dramatics, 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
and writing may be treated as one subject, or as eight. 
Similarly, science may include geography, nature study, and 
gardening. The program must vary, therefore, in accord- 
ance with the curriculum organization. 
It should be kept in mind that the schools have been in- 
creasing the numbers of courses at a rapid rate, and that we 
have rarely dropped a subject once it has been developed 
into a separate course.' There must be some end to our 
specialization. What is needed now is not more special 
divisions but a reorganization of subject-matter. For 
young children especially there is some advantage in keep- 
ing their work unified. Phonics as a separate subject, dis- 
tinct from reading and spelling and language, represents an 
adult specialization that is practically meaningless in the 
logic of childhood. 
The advantage of organizing primary work into activi- 
ties rather than subjects is in having facts and activities 
presented in unity. Each fact, principle, or skill acquired is 
part of a general undertaking, and much if not most of its 
educational value is thus determined. One of the present 
major problems in education is to work out the proper logic 
of our subject-matter. 
Our interest here is not to develop this point, but to note 
its importance and its bearing on program-making. Every 
teacher will do well to examine her courses of study care- 
fully, and to consider what of the subject-matter of each 
course can be combined with the subject-matter of some 
other course. If spelling can be taught as well incidentally 
1 Adding a new course means that textbooks will be made, courses 
printed, and daily schedules formed to give it place. Once thus entrenched 
in the school structure, and backed by economic considerations, it is not 
easy to get rid of it. Dr. Jesse K. Flanders has pointed out, in his Legis- 
lative Control of the Elementary Curriculum, that during the period from 1903 
to 1923 the number of curriculum prescriptions increased by sixty-five 
per cent.
-P-A-G-E-213
THE DAILY PROGRAM 201 
with other courses, then we should not give it a special 
place and time on the daily schedule. 
For an eight-grade, one-teacher school, every possible 
combination should bemade, to the end that separate courses 
may be reduced to the lowest number consistent with good 
work. It does not seem wise to offer a definite prescription 
for doing this. Schools differ greatly in the number of 
pupils per grade, in what pupils have had in past years, in the 
experience and skill of the teacher, in the supervisory as- 
sistance available, in teaching materials and equipment, in 
the abilities of pupils, and in the educational needs of the 
community. In some schools certain of the work can be 
organized about projects, while in other schools this would 
not be practicable. 
The possibility of alternating courses. Another factor 
may enter to alter the number of separate class periods. We 
have assumed (without sufficient justification) that there is 
a definite unalterable sequence to be observed in many of 
our school courses. That is, the subject-matter of grade VI 
in each subject must not be taught until the child has 
mastered the subject-matter of grade V. The more we have 
looked into the merits of this proposition the more we see 
that it is unsound. In many of our subjects the child could 
begin at the back of his book and work toward the front of 
it almost equally well, should we choose to present the 
chapters or sections in that order. This shocks us only be- 
cause we have but recently begun to realize that our old 
sequence idea was largely without foundation. 
Because of this fact we have found it possible to alternate 
the work of two grades and so to reduce the number of 
separate classes. For example, we can have the fifth and 
sixth or the seventh and eighth grades work together in such 
a subject as geography or history, or some parts of English, 
or civics, or hygiene, and to some extent in other subjects. 
   
-P-A-G-E-214
    202 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
If grades seven and eight work over the subject-matter of 
grade-VII history in 1928, then they may cover the grade- 
VIII history in 1929. This gives the teacher one in place 
of two history recitations to handle. By such alternations 
the 35 or 40 recitations of the rural school may be greatly 
reduced, with no loss to the children and with but little 
increase in the difficulties of teaching. In reality this is 
merely applying the principle suggested above, that our 
class or recitation groups do not need to correspond per- 
fectly with our grade groups.! 
Other types of combinations. Other combinations can be 
worked out without involving the principle of alternation. 
This applies not only to the programming of recitations, but 
to study periods as well. In arithmetic grade V may be at 
the board while grade IV is receiving explanations or as- 
signments. In writing and drawing and hand work, the 
recitation period need pay little attention to grade groups, 
since the work is essentially with individual pupils. Two 
grades may work together in reading, the one doing oral 
while the other is doing silent reading. 
Just what combinations of this sort can be effected is not 
entirely dependent upon the nature of the subject-matter, 
but, as already suggested, upon the character of the classes as 
well. In offering a prescription to illustrate this principle 
we must keep in mind that the purpose is to illustrate 
principles, and not to provide a program that can be applied 
without careful study of individual classes. 
Divisions of daily program. The daily program contains 
three main divisions: study, recitation, and recreation. If 
recreation consumes an hour and a half, then in the six 
hours from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. there are left four and a half 
1 One has only to review the results of the extensive test programs to 
be convinced that grade groups do not mean ability groups. This is 
about as true in one subject as in another.
-P-A-G-E-215
THE DAILY PROGRAM 203 
hours for study and recitation. The question of how to 
divide the time between these two activities will depend 
partly upon the practical difficulties to be overcome in 
working out the program, but as far as possible it should 
depend upon the nature of the work to be done, and the 
need for supervision of the study. 
Aside from the help given in a careful assignment of the 
lesson the child will need very little supervision over his 
study of spelling. The same is not true, however, of nature 
study, theme writing, or geography. If the teacher has any 
time available for the supervision of study therefore she ° 
should plan as far as possible to have it at a time when super~ 
vision is needed. This is also easy to work out in a room 
with but one or two classes, and next to impossible in one 
of many classes. 
2. The problem of time allotment 
Difficulties in determining time allotment. The problem 
of time allotment is made difficult by the fact that in 
organizing our courses of study we have no way of de- 
termining (without experience) just how much of a given 
kind of material can be mastered by a class in a given time. 
In reality we make up our courses with our attention fixed 
not on “time required,” but upon “desirable things to be 
taught.” The result is that there is often too much to be 
done in the time available. This is shown by the fact that 
we have very large numbers of retarded and very small 
numbers of accelerated pupils in our schools. 
How to lay out the work of each course so that the sum 
of the courses in any grade will exactly fill the time of an 
average pupil is difficult. Perhaps there is no scientific 
way of determining just what part of the total time should 
be devoted to each of the studies of any grade. This is, 
after all, the old question of what studies are of most worth, 
   
-P-A-G-E-216
204 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
and we have no way of finding out exactly what any study 
contributes to the child or to society. It is worth more to 
know how to read than it is to know how to paint, yet we 
want artists, and we all want to be able to appreciate art; so 
we finally face the problem of dividing the time between 
reading and art work. Thus it is with all the studies, and 
also with the many topics within any given study. 
How we have decided time allotment in the past. In 
the past we have judged roughly, and we shall continue to 
judge roughly what per cent of the school time ought to be 
devoted to each of the studies. As time goes on, however, 
and as we refine our subject-matter by excluding more and 
more of the materials that seem to us to be of little value, 
and bring into the courses more and more materials that 
have a definable value, we shall be able to put a sharper 
test on the worth of our studies and so have a better judg- 
ment of the proper apportionment of time. By study and 
experiment, too, we shall learn better methods of instruc- 
tion and thus obtain more accurate knowledge of how long 
it takes to cover a given body of material. 
Time allotment in representative rural and city systems. 
Some studies will properly require more time both for study 
and for recitation than others, first, because some are more 
important than others, and second, because some are 
broader and more difficult to master than others. While 
there is no way of saying exactly how much more time 
should be spent on English than on mathematics in a second- 
grade class, we know roughly that the English training at 
that age is relatively more important, and that it should 
have a relatively larger share of the time. 
The rather serious study of time allotment as an educa- 
tional problem began some thirty years ago.! Since then 
1 See the Sixtieth Annual Report of the Massachusetts Board of Education, 
pp. 437-80, 1895; also, Payne, Bruce R., Public Elementary School Curricu- 
lum.
-P-A-G-E-217
THE DAILY PROGRAM 205 
the curriculum has been greatly changed, and it is now in 
process of more fundamental change than ever before. We 
are experimenting more and more intelligently than hereto- 
fore not only with materials, but also with method, organiza- 
tion, management, and all that affects the teaching situa- 
tion. Ten years ago we would have done well to follow the 
consensus of opinion in the matter of time allotment.! To- 
day such a standard is very useful as a check on practice, 
but before following it we have to take account of the way 
and extent to which we vary from the traditional forms and 
practice in our aims, materials, organization, and methods. 
It will be of some value in this connection, however, to 
review present-day practice. For this purpose two sets of 
figures are presented. The first table shows the average 
time allotted to each of the subjects, by grades, in a large 
sample of the one-teacher schools of California; the second 
table shows similar data for a group of 49 cities. 
What these figures suggest. These figures are offered 
not as recommended distributions (for those, see sample 
programs following), but as pictures of typical current 
procedures. A comparison of the two sets of figures is 
interesting.2 In both the old three R’s hold a strong posi- 
tion. This is much more true, however, of the one-teacher 
schools than of the city schools. In contrast we see that the 
one-teacher school has been more reluctant to give time to 
the social studies and to all the newer courses. 
While these figures are averages, still one wonders at the 
wide differences between rural and city schools. It must 
be kept in mind that we do not expect all programs to be 
alike, yet it would be impossible to justify the differences 
1See Holmes, Henry W. “Time Distribution in Subjects and Grades 
in Representative Cities”; in Fourteenth Yearbook of the National Society 
for the Study of Education, part 1, 1915. 
2 Such comparison is only roughly fair because of differences in methods 
used in assembling the data.

figures are averages for 49 cities, but that in many instances the figure is an average of fewer 
than this number of cities. This applies especially to supervised play, civics, and hygiene.

between these two tables. If we examine school survey 
literature we will find that even within a single city there 
are similar evidences of chaos in this matter.! It is interest- 
ing to note that an earlier investigation of time allotment 
in the subject of arithmetic alone, covering six hundred 
and thirty cities, tends to show that the systems included 
in the above tables average high in the proportion of time 
devoted to arithmetic.” 
3. Preparing the program 
Purposes to be served. So far we have analyzed the 
problem of organizing the daily or weekly schoolroom pro- 
cedure, pointed out the various factors involved, and set 
down certain guiding principles. In addition we have 
presented extensive samples of actual time-distributions as 
the schools of the country now operate. With these 
principles and figures before us we come now to the pro- 
blem of drawing up a sample work program. 
In drawing up such a schedule our first concern is: What 
purpose is to be served? This will determine the form and 
the character of the program. The ends to be served are 
obvious enough. The schedule is to guide our procedure 
from hour to hour through the day and the week. This 
applies to pupils, to teacher, and to visitors or other school 
officers alike. It will stand as a guide or directory, and so 
must be available to all. 
The order of studies. After we have settled the question 
1 See: Sears, Jesse B., The School Survey, chap. x1; also his “Time Allot- 
ment in the Schools of Salt Lake City”; in Educational Administration and 
Supervision, March, 1916. (Contains bibliography of early studies and in- 
vestigations.) See also: United States Bureau of Education, Bulletin no. 
42, 1922, and City School Leaflets, no. 41, 1926, and no. 19, 1925.

-P-A-G-E-220
  208 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
of time allotment, we have still to decide upon the proper 
order of studies. This must be determined with due regard 
for the best possible economy in learning. Some points to 
observe are obvious. We have several different types of 
work to schedule. In some types the child sits very quietly; 
in other types he moves about. Much of the work is merely 
reading. Geography, history, civics, reading, literature, 
and physiology are mostly of this type. Other studies have 
but little reading but involve careful reasoning. Arithmetic 
and algebra are of this type. Then there are shop work, 
laboratory work, gardening, field trips, dramatics, and to 
some extent drawing, writing, painting, modeling, and 
singing, all of which involve more or less physical action. 
There are certain other differences, too, that have a bear- 
ing upon program-making. Some of our action studies, 
such as drawing, painting, writing, and some kinds of con- 
struction work require a careful codrdination of arm, hand, 
and finger muscles. Other studies, such as dancing, dramat- 
ics, shop, laboratory, and field work require the use of the 
large muscles of the body, and little in the way of refined 
codrdinations of smaller muscles. 
The problems of interest and fatigue. That these 
characteristics of school activities are significant in de- 
termining what a child can do through the day, or at least 
what he will be interested in doing, is obvious. Children 
do not apply themselves readily for a very long time to any 
one kind of mental or physical exertion. Change is very 
important, and without frequent change we see a flagging of 
interest and a corresponding flagging of effort. Whether or 
not this is evidence of fatigue in a true sense, either mental 
or physical, it is desirable that we learn all we can about the 
meaning of interest, effort, and fatigue. No exhaustive 
study of these phenomena is necessary, however, to prove 
that it is desirable to introduce variety, both mental and
-P-A-G-E-221
THE DAILY PROGRAM 209 
physical, into a child’s work schedule. The character of 
our school studies makes this possible. 
It is not meant to suggest that the teacher should assume 
that the question of fatigue among children is to be dismissed 
lightly. One or two things we know. Children vary greatly 
in their ability to endure continuous mental or physical 
effort. This no doubt applies, whether by fatigue we have 
in mind the general feeling of weariness or ennui, or the 
feeling of being bored, on the one hand, or on the other de- 
pleted strength or the actual decrease in ability to do work. 
Experiments seem to show that what teachers have generally 
described as fatigue is very largely slackened interest or a 
general feeling of weariness, and not actual fatigue in the 
latter sense.1_ There is such a thing as fatigue, however, 
and in some children it is no doubt easily induced because of 
ill health, undernourishment, loss of sleep, sorrow, or over- 
work, and teachers should be on the alert for the symptoms. 
On the other hand, mere sluggishness or lack of interest is 
a thing we must not be too ready to yield to. The world i 
full of hard work, and some tasks are unpleasant. The only 
way to fortify against the tendency to follow the line of 
least resistance, which leads to mental as well as physical 
flabbiness, is to learn to stand up against tasks that are not 
especially interesting. In other words, we must train 
children to maintain a conscious command of their own 
energy.” 
Rules governing work and rest. Having in mind that 
there is such a thing as true fatigue, which can be induced 
by overexertion, and that what will call for normal exertion

experimental data on this subject. For an earlier treatise see: Offner and 
Whipple, Mental Fatigue. 
2 The young teacher is warned here against adopting a puritanical atti- 
tude, or overstressing discipline, or trying to “harden” the children, or 
assuming too much in the way of transfer of training. 
 
-P-A-G-E-222
210 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
  in one child may call for overexertion in another; but having 
in mind also that effort varies with interest, and that children 
are sensitive to strain, distractions, and continuous effort, 
and that in general children do not hesitate to follow the 
line of least resistance in doing tasks, let us now consider 
what is the bearing of this on program-making. 
Recalling the picture we have drawn above as to the na- 
ture of our studies, and how working at these studies affects 
the child, and knowing that a child becomes weary when he 
is kept in one position or has followed one line of mental 
activity for more than a few minutes, and that with this 
weariness comes a disposition to quit attending, we see that 
change is to be an essential characteristic of any good school 
program. 
Change can be produced in more ways than one. We 
may shift from work to free play and back again, producing 
change in a large way, or we may shift from one type of 
work to another, or from one set of materials or problems 
to another, or from one method to another. We may shift 
from one posture to another, or from individual to group 
work, and so on almost indefinitely. In the room the eyes 
are focused on objects near by and on small objects. There 
is little chance for a free shift in attention from work to 
possible distractions. On the playground all this is reversed; 
even a change from indoor to outdoor work reverses most of 
this. Within the room we may shift from reading to writ- 
ing, or arithmetic, or dramatics and get a sharp change in 
mental and physical activity. Even within the limits of 
one study we may often turn from one to another part of 
the lesson assignment and get change. For example, a 
silent-reading lesson may call for the main features or ideas, 
and then for the details of some one section, or for the spelling 
of a selected group of words, or for a written description of a 
picture ora character. In a recitation the teacher may shift
-P-A-G-E-223
THE DAILY PROGRAM 211 
from oral to written work, in most studies, or from question 
and answer to reading and telling, and in endless ways 
introduce change that will relieve the strains that in time 
would produce weariness and ultimately true fatigue, and 
in any case inattention and flagging effort, and so poor 
results. 
It is easy to introduce these ideas into program-making 
and into teaching. Our next question is: Is there a best 
order in which to effect these changes? The answer is: in 
part, yes. We should make extensive or complete change 
from work to play, and from indoor to outdoor activity, at 
intervals of less than an hour for little children and of not 
over an hour and a half for upper-grade pupils. We should 
shift from one to another type of studies and not put all 
hand work together, or all reasoning, or all laboratory, or all 
reading work in one place. Beyond this, owing to the 
shortness of our recitation and study periods, there is 
probably little danger of provoking fatigue or even weariness 
by the order of studies. It seems obvious, also, that too 
great a shift should be avoided, such as from free play to 
drawing or writing. 
4. Typical programs 
A proper program. Sample programs are presented below 
to illustrate the principle here set forth. It is clear that a 
program cannot easily indicate all that goes on in a room, 
or the details of the method of procedure, or the purposes 
that are to be attained. These must be regarded, however, 
as essential parts of the teacher’s working schedule. They 
will not remain perfectly constant from day to day, or from 
subject to subject, but they are important features of the 
schedule. The order of studies or activities for each work- 
ing group will be made clear for each day in the accompany- 
ing sample programs, as will the time to be spent on each.
-P-A-G-E-224
  212 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
It may be that in large schools the principal will have a 
program prepared, but it is also true that he will usually 
welcome suggestions from the teacher regarding many of 
the details; and the teacher should by all means master the 
essential principles of program-making. 
A three-class program. A careful study of the program 
on page 213 will doubtless show a few slight violations 
of some of our principles. In the main, however, it 
represents a fairly good distribution of time and a fairly 
good order of subjects. Spelling might with propriety 
precede the arithmetic work early in the morning, ending 
the day with science. 
In some cases certain alternations of subjects would be 
necessary. Perhaps the Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 
drawing periods might be devoted to domestic science and 
manual training. Physiology and nature study, if treated 
as separate subjects, might alternate in a similar way; and 
likewise history and geography in grade V B; and history 
and civics in grade VI A. 
Taking the program as it is, it shows exactly what a given 
pupil is supposed to be doing at every moment of the day. 
Adequate study time is arranged for each lesson, and in 
nearly every case study immediately precedes recitation. 
There is, however, nowhere set apart any time for the super- 
vision of study periods. This can only be made possible by 
a system of alternating some of the courses. For instance, 
the course of study could be so arranged that the fifth grade 
work in history could be taken by the two sections of the 
grade together, and, similarly, other combinations could 
be worked out which would make it possible to save time 
by having two classes recite together. There is no reason 
why grades V A and V B should not work together in physi- 
ology and geography. After the introductory work in these 
subjects one topic is no more difficult than another, and the

THE DAILY PROGRAM 215 
1 This program is meant to be suggestive to one making a schedule for a one-teacher eight- 
grade school. It divides the day into twenty-four separate work periods. It shows what 
each grade is doing during each of these periods. It divides the pupils into four work groups, 
each group containing two grades. It provides each of these groups with from five to eight 
recitations daily. 
‘The program is not intended to show all the resources of the curriculum in any grade, nor does it show the details of the correlations, combinations, and alternations that are possible 
and desirable in the school of this type. Through the following notes, however, some of these 
are suggested, and the resourceful teacher will find this program a suitable starting point for 
their introduction. 
It is suggested that the number of recitations can be still further reduced in many schools 
where some of the grades are not represented or where certain grades contain very few pupils. 
Also, it will be feasible in most schools to conduct certain of the recitations on less than 
five days per week. 
2 Opening exercises will furnish opportunities for talks by the teacher, for group singing, for 
radio or vietrola programs, for special programs given by groups of pupils, for forums con- 
ducted by pupils, and for talks by visitors. The aim here will be to develop a group spirit 
and a group consciousness of acceptable standards of conduct in the school. It will aim to 
stimulate interest in good music, in good books, in neighborhood affairs, in health and 
sanitation, and in games and dramas and stories and politics. 
8 Reading will mean many things in Group A. The beginners will at first work on phonics 
and word-and-sentence study, while Grade II will read many books. In all the reading work 
one grade may work at oral, while the other grade works at silent, reading. Often the 
division will not be on grade lines (see text above). In all the reading classes there should be 
a very wide selection of books besides the basic reader. This extra reading should some- 
times be done in a way to supplement the hygiene, geography, civics, history, or even arith- 
metic. At times the reading lesson may make it wise therefore to omit the hygiene, or civics 
or history lesson on a given day. 
4 Where the children are drilling on tables it is possible to permit them to hear one another 
recite. Grade IV can direct the reciting of Grade ILI, giving the teacher opportunity to 
supervise other work in the room, retaining only a general oversight over the recitation. 
5 Geography and hygiene and history are subjects in which the work can alternate by years 
with good effect and little if any loss. 
6 The library period, and for Group B one reading period, may well be given over to pro- 
ject work. Let the project be in line with the child’s interest regardless of the school subject 
it touches, only see that it is worth while and that the school has facilities for the child’s work 
on that project. It may be solely a library type of work, such as a study of the customs of 
the Chinese people. If a shop or an extra room is available, the interest may be in making 
something. 
7 In writing all grades may work together, the teacher giving different groups the most of 
her time on different days. Correlation with English and all other subjects must be effected, 
if results are to be expected. It would be possible, and in some cases desirable, to introduce 
music or drawing in place of writing on one or two days per week. 
8 The sand table could be used to good advantage, the teacher supervising the work while 
conducting other recitations. Similarly she could handle construction and drill work and 
word study. By this means fewer recitations are effectively offset by more supervision. 
   
-P-A-G-E-228
  "216 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
same is true of upper grade work in arithmetic and history. 
Program for a rural school. In a one-teacher school 
certain combinations and alternations are practicable be- 
cause of the very small numbers of pupils in each of the 
grade groups. The instruction in reading could not be 
alternated for grades I and II, but the groups being small 
the recitation work can be handled almost individually. 
The accompanying footnotes for the program presented on 
page 215 will make clear some of the details of correlation, 
combination, and alternation that can be applied in pro- 
gramming the work for such a school. 
5. How to use the program 
The program should be printed on a large stiff sheet of 
paper that can be hung in an appropriate place in the room. 
If the Tuesday—Thursday program differs seriously from 
that of the other days of the week, then have the Tuesday- 
Thursday program on one side of the card, and that for 
the other days on the other side of the card, and appoint a 
monitor (some one who shows that he knows how to live up 
to a program) to turn the card each evening just before 
school closes. At the outset, when the program is explained, 
it may be well to have each child make a copy of his own 
schedule and keep it on his desk for a few days until he be- 
comes accustomed to it. 
The beginning teacher will find it desirable to adhere 
strictly to the schedule, for the following reasons: First of 
all, it will be a constant check on her success at making her 
daily lesson plans; second, it will prevent her giving an un- 
due amount of time to the subject she happens to be most 
interested in, and so robbing other studies of their proper 
amount of time; third, it will teach the children to make 
systematic preparation for all their work, and so establish 
useful work habits.
-P-A-G-E-229
THE DAILY PROGRAM 217 
6. Chapter summary 
Here we have set forth: the problems essential to the planning of 
the day’s work; the fundamental principles involved in its organi- 
zation; the practical application of these principles in typical 
situations; and the need for adhering to a specific program of 
work. 
We have seen the definite arrangement of subject-matter, of 
recreation, and of recitations; the reasonable distribution of time 
for the various studies; the order in which studies shall appear on 
the program; — all as practical issues which every teacher must 
meet. We have seen, too, that underlying the solution of these are 
the fundamental questions of the relative value of studies; the 
proper distribution of work and play with respect to the child’s 
energy; and the influence of some systematic distribution of time 
and strength upon the development of sound work habits. 
The object in program-making, then, as illustrated in the typical 
programs here presented, is to establish order in the day’s work 
and to economize in time and energy. To do this, the more formal 
studies are placed at the hours when the child’s energy is at its 
maximum, and the content studies at the hours when less interest- 
ing work would cause interest to flag. If these practices are ad- 
hered to it is believed there will be little occasion for worry about the 
dangers from overwork at school. What is most essential is that 
the teacher have a clear idea of the aims to be set up and of the im- 
portance of homogeneity in any working group of children, that 
children should have much change in mental and physical activity 
to prevent weariness and loss of interest, and that when properly 
arranged the nature of our school studies makes such change possi- 
ble and easy. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. What does the making of a daily time schedule have to do with the 
determination of the relative values of studies? 
2. Make a list of the factors to be dealt with in making out a daily 
program. 
8. How does the time allotment in your own school compare with that 
for the group of cities represented in Tables V and VI? 
4. In Tables V and VI, notice the relative amount of time given to recess. 
Does it seem unreasonable that we should expect some educational 
return for that time? What might be the nature of that return? 
5. Explain the difference between form and content studies, and state

which, in general, should receive most time in the day’s program. 
Why? 
. In your own school how many minutes per week do you devote to 
form studies, to content studies? Figure out the division in Table VI, 
and compare with your own allotment. 
. What has the study of fatigue to do with the order of the studies on 
the program, with the length of recitation period, and with the fre- 
quency of recreation periods? 
. In the above three-class program (Page 213), figure out the total 
amount of time devoted to arithmetic. Compare this with the amount 
devoted to English (reading, writing, spelling, grammar, and language) 
and with the amount devoted to science. 
. In this program suggest the changes necessary to place spelling im- 
mediately after opening exercises. What advantages if any would 
come from such changes? 
Are music and physical culture placed to best advantage on the pro- 
gram? Why? What percentage of a child’s time is devoted to spell- 
ing? 
What advantage is there in a plan of alternating subjects? 
In the above program for a rural school (Page 214), figure out the 
amount of time in hours a child would spend on arithmetic from the 
time he would enter grade one until he would finish grade eight, sup- 
posing the year to be nine months long. What percentage is this 
amount of the entire number of working hours the child would have 
been in school during the eight years? 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
. It has been suggested in this chapter that grade groups need not de- 
termine grouping for recitation purposes. From any of the recent 
books on tests, or from recent survey literature, or better still from 
tests you have given, examine the results of tests in a selected room 
and suggest a classification of the children for study and recitation 
purposes. A room containing two or more grades would be desirable. 
If possible, check the results of a test in reading with test scores in 
other studies. Would suitable classification in one study correspond 
to suitable classification in other studies? Compare with the pro- 
gram of studies now in use in the school studied. 
. Select a program of a rural school in which there is a large number of 
grades and in which the number of recitation groups is very large, and 
try to work out a grouping such as is suggested in the sample programs 
presented in this chapter. Apply the principles of alternation, com- 
bination, and correlation suggested above. If this could be an actual 
project for a class it would be worth while to the class and to the 
school as well. 
 
-P-A-G-E-231
THE DAILY PROGRAM 219 
8. Make a comparative study of time allotment in a group of selected 
schools. Check results with figures presented in Tables V and VI. In 
selecting schools for study, take account of type of school, type of 
community and pupils,*curricula, organization of materials, methods 
of instruction, size of classes, and types of buildings. Does such an 
intensive study show that variation in time allotment from school to 
school is desirable? Determine what factors call for variation from 
typical distributions.

Summary — Questions — Problems — References. 
1. The problem 
In our discussion of what is to be taught in the school, 
special emphasis was laid, first, upon the wide variety of 
knowledge and activities to be included; and second, upon 
the importance of so organizing these materials that their 
connections with one another and with the common affairs 
of life outside the school would be felt by the child. How 
to study is a question of how to work intelligently at each 
of the numerous and widely different tasks which the mod- 
ern curriculum presents. 
The importance of right methods. That the problem 
of how to study is important is almost too obvious to war- 
rant any reference to it here, were it not for the fact that 
its significance is so commonly overlooked in practice. The 
fact that until very recently the school did not teach chil- 
dren how to study, but merely heard them recite what they 
had learned in their own way, does not mean that there was 
no need for such teaching. It is true that a few boys have 
Jearned to swim by being thrown into the water and then 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  THE CLASS STUDYING 221 
left to get out alone, and possibly a few have learned to 
study and to think clearly by being assigned a lesson and 
then left to get it or remain after school. But just as the 
boy who learns to swim under such pressure does not use 
a single scientific stroke, so investigation has shown that 
children who have not been taught how to study intelli- 
gently do not use proper methods of study.! If this be true, 
and it unquestionably is, then teaching a child how to work 
at a task is a question of very first importance, and should 
be accepted by the school as one of its chief problems. 
Outside problems very real. The extent of this impor- 
tance is not confined to the schoolroom. ‘The study of 
problems outside of school is as real as is the study of books, 
and not only should the two not be separated in the teacher’s 
mind, but it should be her particular duty to lead her pupils 
to realize that applying good methods to sweeping, running 
errands, setting the table, doing chores, making a garden, 
buying and selling goods, caring for one’s earnings, being 
kind and courteous, and running the affairs of the commu- 
nity, is precisely the same thing as applying good methods 
to school lessons. This is one of the things that is meant 
when we speak of tying the school up to community life. 
The tying should have to do with methods of work as well 
as with subject-matter. 
The meaning of study. If we are to undertake the man- 
agement of the study process, we must first of all have a 
clear notion of what we mean by study, or in other words 
we must have a clear teaching aim.2, We commonly think 
of study as work, but too often make no further analysis of 
the term than that. If we do we think of memorizing as 
being almost synonymous with the word study. But if

    222 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
we recall the various aims of education,! and the large num- 
ber and wide variety of studies offered in the curriculum, 
we at once see that study is by no means a matter of merely 
memorizing facts. 
Intelligent study. Let us enumerate some of the things 
the child must do when he studies intelligently : 
1. He must observe accurately, otherwise he could not read his 
music, or his geography, or write an accurate descriptive 
theme, or dance, or write, or become acquainted with birds 
and flowers. Here we are concerned with the use of the senses 
of sight, hearing, touch, and in a limited way with those of 
smell and taste. 
2. He must attend quickly, and be able to concentrate attention 
upon the question in hand, otherwise he is not studying, but 
merely dawdling, he is only passive when he should be active 
and aggressive. 
8. He must of course remember the things he observes and at- 
tends to. 
4, He must compare and differentiate objects and facts, that is, 
he must see relationships, and that not only between objects 
of the senses, but also between ideas, and between things 
absent as well as things present. It is a matter of bringing 
the imagination to bear upon the things experienced. 
5. He must be able to state clearly what he has thought or ob- 
served, that is, distinguish the main from the subordinate 
facts and ideas, and put his thoughts in good form. 
The function of these methods in practical affairs. These 
are a few of the most important processes involved in study, 
and it is scarcely necessary to show the extent to which 
each of these is essential to real success in life. The touch 
of the surgeon must not fail him when he is cutting human 
tissues, and the physician must know what he hears when 
listening to the breathing or heartbeat of the patient. Musi- 
cal instruments would remain silent, and the landscape un- 
painted, were it not for the trained senses of touch, sight, 
1 See Summary to Chapter I.

vA ss A iv f 
THE CLASS STUDYING 223 
and hearing. How much the work of the sculptor and the 
artisan is dependent upon the senses of touch and sight! 
Imagine the engineer who could not detect a defect in his 
machinery by its sound, and who could not single out and 
concentrate his whole attention upon the faintest irregu- 
larity in the steady hum of his engines. Imagine the in- 
ventor, the musician, the painter, the sculptor, the scien- 
tist, or the man of affairs, without imagination, and with- 
out memory that retains and reproduces the right things 
at the right time. The purchaser of stock, of cloth or pa- 
per, who could not detect slight differences in quality would 
be a failure. The lawyer, the statesman, the journalist, 
the administrative officer in any line would be helpless in 
the midst of the greatest abundance of facts if he had not 
the faculty of organizing those facts and stating them 
clearly. 
Teaching a child how to use his senses, how to reason, 
how to memorize, how to distinguish fact from fiction, is 
quite as important as teaching him facts, and indeed should 
never be separated from it; for after all, how we get facts, 
how we develop skills, determines very largely what we 
shall be able to do with facts and skills when we get them. 
The problem of managing the study of children in school, 
then, is the problem of training them in these processes, to 
the end that they may be able to use their knowledge and 
skill in the further accumulation of that greater knowledge 
and skill which makes for leadership and marks the edu- 
cated man. 
Diagnosing study practices: Symptoms. With this con- 
ception of study, and of the importance of teaching children 
right methods of study the teacher may wisely ask: How 
may I learn to recognize right and wrong practices in my 
room? Like a physician she must learn to detect the symp- 
toms of wrong procedure. These symptoms are numerous,

either as we observe pupils at study or as we examine the , 
results of their study as these appear in the recitation. 
1. Symptoms of wasteful procedure. As we observe pupils 
at study or when they are beginning the study period we 
note such matters as the following: 
1. Many pupils do not begin work at once. Some look about, 
and others daydream or dawdle and finally move reluctantly 
to the task. 
2. Some study by spurts, working a bit and then looking about 
and sighing in a restless fashion, as if anxious lest they may 
not be able to remember or understand what they have read. 
They show a lack of poise and self-possession. 
8. Some are at work on the wrong materials and do not know it, 
or they are taking up the parts of the assignment in the wrong 
order. 
4, Some are obviously discouraged, and seem to realize that they 
cannot do the work and that failure is certain. 
5. Some clearly do not know what to do and appear anxious to 
ask questions. 
6. Some seem to be struggling with some detail, such as a new 
word, or a long sentence, or a new idea. 
7. Some are constantly distracted by noises, or by sunlight on 
their desks or by some one trying to communicate with them. 
2. Symptoms of wrong procedure. As we watch a recita- 
tion we are able to see symptoms of other disturbances 
which we might have forestalled had we understood better 
in advance. This is looking backward, perhaps, but it 
should help the teacher to anticipate the pupil’s study diffi- 
culties. We get many such reactions as the following: 
1. The pupil says: “I didn’t know we were to have that to-day.” 
2. He gives an answer that is based upon an entirely erroneous 
understanding of a word or phrase in the lesson. 
8. He makes an effort to give precisely what the book says and, 
i not being able to quote, cannot give a summary. 
4. He attempts to “bluff through” by talking or asking ques- 
tions. 
5. The pupil has evidently not been able to use intelligently, or  
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE CLASS STUDYING 225 
has neglected to use the index or table of contents of his book, 
and so is lost in his search for certain facts. 
6. He fails to bring to class books or other matter needed in the 
recitation period, or brings them in such a muddle as to re- 
quire undue time to make proper use of them. 
'7. When asked how the facts brought out in the lesson could be 
used in some situation at home, or in life outside the school, he 
seems never to have thought of such an application. 
The experienced teacher will be able to add to both these 
lists, and to place the name of some pupil after each of the 
above cases as a good illustration. 
Diagnosing study practices: Causes. We may think of 
the above as symptoms. Those in the first list indicate that 
the child is not proceeding wisely in his study, those in the 
second show that he has proceeded unwisely. As a physi- 
cian studies symptoms with a view to getting at causes, so 
the teacher must remember that the true causé of poor 
results or of wrong procedure lies back of both. The child 
does not know how to recite because he did not know how to 
study. 
Behind these symptoms are causes that ought to be re- 
moved as soon as possible. Many of the above cases would 
be as typical in one kind of work as in another. If a child 
can learn to overcome them for one study we may reason- 
ably hope that he will have overcome them for many 
studies, and in a wide variety of study situations as 
well. 
1. Ignorance and wrong motive. There are thousands of 
adults, as well as children, who do not appreciate the value 
of time. They are late to their work, they stop work at the 
slightest excuse, and they seem never to charge themselves 
1 This depends, of course, upon the way in which a child is taught to 
overcome them. It is easy to teach a child how to use a dictionary, but not 
so easy to train him so that he will always think to use it when it would be 
the best thing to do. 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
  226 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
up with the loss of this time which, rightly used, might have 
produced knowledge, skill, work completed, money, and, 
best of all, self-respect and satisfaction with success at- 
tained or effort made. This is a form of leakage all through 
our school work, and children are entirely unconscious of its 
presence or its significance. The cause back of the symp- 
tom is this unconsciousness of the loss and of the meaning of 
it, and of the pleasure and success that would accompany 
the opposite practice. 
Similarly, we could find the cause that lies behind each 
of the other thirteen symptoms listed above. Taking them 
in their order, we would readily see that in number two of 
the first list the pupil is moved by fear, which is a wrong 
motive. He must be helped to independence and to self- 
assertion. In number three the child takes up the wrong 
work because he does not have a real grasp of the task. He 
is after something in general but nothing in particular. His 
assignment failed to give real guidance. The fourth case is 
discouraged because he is failing. There may be many 
reasons why he is failing. These reasons must be found; 
they are causes, and they must be cleared away by good 
teaching. The fifth case lacks orientation, and will lose much 
time. He does not know how to direct the fine energy he is 
displaying in his aimless movements and questions. The 
sixth case is one who does not know how to get over a word 
difficulty. In five minutes he could be taught what to do 
in all such cases. He doesn’t know where to go, or how to 
use available helps. The seventh case is one that needs 
different surroundings. 
2. Poor teaching. In our second group of symptoms we 
can see back of the first case a lesson assignment that was 
not definite, or at least that was not mastered. In the 
second case the child guessed rather than go to the dic- 
tionary. In the third case we have a child who is trying to
-P-A-G-E-239
  
THE CLASS STUDYING 227 
become a successful parrot. It is surely the teacher’s re- 
sponsibility to train this child to think, as well as to re- 
member. The fourth case probably represents laziness and 
indifference mixed with love of show. It is an example of 
lack of understanding or of interest in systematic effort. 
The child is acquiring habits of slovenliness that will be very 
harmful. In the fifth case the child did not know how to 
use the simple tools of research. In the sixth case the child 
had no sense of order and system in his work, Probably 
his dress and speech are much like this. The seventh case 
is a small bookworm who hasn’t learned what knowledge is 
for. 
Where these steps lead us. Such an examination of 
symptoms is step number one in a search after the true 
causes for poor study. We might take still further steps. 
The teacher must take further steps, and they will lead 
her back into the native traits of the child, into his habits 
and attitudes, into his home life, and into his previous 
training. These are the causes. Wrong education or no 
education has made gaps, or has produced wrong attitudes, 
habits, beliefs, and knowledge. It is in these habits and 
attitudes as well as knowledge that we must effect a change 
in the right direction. Since a child will have so much need 
for a real mastery of the best methods of study the teacher 
should not stop until she has found out and, as far as pos- 
sible, removed the causes of study weaknesses. 
2. The teacher’s attitude toward the problem 
The teacher’s problem. The teacher looks at the many 
sides of this problem, and then at the coming examinations 
which her pupils must pass for promotion, and, knowing 
that she will be judged very largely by the results of those 
examinations, raises the question as to whether children 
can be taught how to study more intelligently than they do,  
-P-A-G-E-240
  
228 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
and if so, whether it will pay to take the time to do it. And 
so she hesitates. 
A poor teacher may wisely hesitate, for in accepting 
such a program she is to a large extent laying aside the use 
of fear as an incentive to study. She can no longer say: 
“Take to page 16, and remain after school if you fail to get 
the lesson.” 
A really professional teacher looks for more permanent 
results of her work. She aims at successful examinations as 
incidental to the intellectual development of her pupils and 
not as the final end of her teaching. Consequently she is 
not only willing but anxious to face her real problem, the 
first step in which is teaching the child how to study his 
lessons. 
Three problems in the learning process. In the manage- 
ment of the learning process there are three fairly distinct 
problems to be dealt with. First, the assignment of lessons; 
second, the study of lessons; and third, the recitation of 
lessons. This division of the teaching problem into three 
parts does not mean that the time is to be divided equally 
among the three, or that it is not sometimes necessary to° 
shift from one to the other and back again during a recita- 
tion period, but it does mean that there are three distinct 
functions which the teacher must recognize and learn to 
direct. As the master carpenter must lay out with care 
the work that is to be done by his apprentices, so the teacher 
must learn to give specific directions for study that is to be 
done by the class in her absence. 
In this chapter we are concerned with the management 
of study, which includes two of these problems, viz., how 
to make assignments, and how to direct children in eco- 
nomical methods of study. 
The first step, a clear aim. In teaching the child how to 
study the first step is to make clear to him the problem he
-P-A-G-E-241
  
THE CLASS STUDYING 229 
has to solve. This is the function of the lesson assignment, 
a function more often badly performed than almost any 
other function in teaching. To know specifically what you 
are going to do is of first importance. If you are looking for 
an answer to a question, then information that does not 
answer that question is quickly discarded, and that which 
does answer it is quickly recognized. To read a page merely 
because the teacher assigned that page is not to look for 
anything in particular, and at best puts the child in a recep- 
tive rather than a critical attitude of mind. He takes what 
the page says as final authority, and asks no question. A 
proper assignment is not merely quantitative; it must set 
up a specific problem for the child to solve — something 
definite to observe, to discover, to describe, to relate, to 
make, to imitate, to explain, to compare, or to remem- 
ber. 
Making the assignment. How to make such an assign- 
ment, that is, how to make each lesson stand out in the 
child’s mind as a problem to be solved or as something defi- 
nite to be done, is by no means a simple matter. To make 
the aim of the assignment clear the teacher must keep in 
mind two things: first, the fact of individual differences; 
and second, the wide variety of problems which the modern 
school program presents to the child. What has been said 
of individual differences! applies in a very important way 
here. In the study of Evangeline, for instance, no two pupils 
will have the same interest in the poem. Some will be inter- 
ested in the chief characters, some in the old legends upon 
which the story is based, some in the scenes described, some 
in the literary form. Ifa study of Evangeline as a character 
is the lesson, no two pupils will have the same equipment 
for the study. Some will be familiar with a wide range of 
characters in fiction with whom Evangeline may be com- 
1 See Chapter ILI, section 6.  
-P-A-G-E-242
    230 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
pared or contrasted, and some will know but few. And so 
on, in numberless ways, both in native interests and in 
previous training and experience, the pupils will differ from 
one another. 
The complexity of the teacher’s problem seems almost 
limitless when to this we add the wide variety of lessons 
she is called upon to assign. Nature study, writing, spelling, 
shop work, singing, and arithmetic are not much alike. Na- 
ture study is likely to involve careful observation, writing 
aims at particular muscular codrdinations, spelling is largely 
memorizing, arithmetic may emphasize either memory or 
reason, or both, while shop work and singing are still differ- 
ent. Psychologically, almost every possible variety of pro- 
blem presents itself where the teacher is in charge of several 
grades, or studies. 
Considerations in assignments. A full understanding of 
these two facts (individual differences and variety in learn- 
ing problems) will help the teacher to realize that assign- 
ments must be made, first, in terms of the nature and train- 
ing of the individual, and second, in terms of the particular 
mental or physical activity involved. She cannot talk to 
the “class,” or to the “average pupil”; she must talk to 
each pupil, and that in terms of his interests and knowledge 
of the subject in hand. This means that her own grasp of 
the subject must be very broad. If it is a case of memorizing 
a poem she will have to answer two questions for herself: 
First, what do the various pupils know about the poem, and 
what kinds of interests are they likely to have in studying 
it; and second, what is the best way for them to memorize 
it. She can answer the first question only if she is intimately 
acquainted with each pupil, and the second only if she 
knows something about the psychology of memorizing. The 
influence of maturity, of repetition and. its frequency, of 
rhythm, of committing part by part or by wholes, are ques-
-P-A-G-E-243
THE CLASS STUDYING 231 
tions she must be able to answer before she can really make 
the aim of the child’s study specific. 
Again, if the particular activity is some form of muscular 
codrdination, such as writing, drawing, painting, or muscular 
work, the aim is not clear when the teacher hands the child 
a copy or model to work by. How to hold the instrument, 
position of the body, repetition of movement, speed, 
amount and periods of practice, and other detailed questions 
must be determined before the child can know exactly what 
he is to do. The aim will usually be a combination of two 
or more of these processes, as memory and observation and 
reason, or observation and muscular coérdination. It is 
not clear to the child just what he is to do until he knows 
exactly how it is to be done. The how and the what in 
teaching are practically inseparable.! 
The second step, to provide a motive. The second large 
problem in teaching children how to study is that of pro- 
viding them with a motive for study. Before assigning 
a lesson the teacher should ask herself why John or Mary 
should want to study that lesson. The question of motives 
has been discussed at length in Chapter IX, and some of the 
principles set forth there have a direct bearing upon the 
management of study. Certainly fear of punishment would 
be ruled out here; and our approach would be from the 
standpoint of trying to create in the child’s experience a real 
need for the new information or skill to be got from the 
lesson assigned. People think only when something per- 
plexes them, when their knowledge or understanding of a 
situation is incomplete; and they work aggressively at the 
gathering of facts or the acquiring of skill only when the 
facts or skill somehow fit into their partially understood or 
half-mastered situation. 
That means, then, that the child must not only see clearly 
1See Chapter II, section 2. 
   
-P-A-G-E-244
  232 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
the aim of his study, but he must feel that the achievement 
of that aim will help him to a fuller explanation of things 
now but partially understood. To do this an endless variety 
of little devices will be brought into play. Questions should 
be raised by the teacher, and the pupils should be stimu- 
lated to raise others. Special assignments to individuals or 
to separate groups, each covering a definite subordinate 
problem, can often be made. Pupils may frequently be 
asked to suggest where to find materials, how best to study 
the lesson, or the best form of report to make, the object 
being to put the child on his own initiative as far as possible, 
and to stimulate an aggressive attitude of mind. Only 
if questions are raised in the child’s mind will he be able to 
discover what the new information or skill will do for him, 
and only when that discovery is made will he feel the neces- 
sity of working to get it. 
The third step, how to find and to organize materials. 
Once a child knows exactly what he is to do, and has a 
motive for doing it, the next question is where are the mate- 
rials to work with. In the elementary school it will often be 
true that all the child needs will be the page or two in his 
text. Because this is so often true for the immediate pur- 
pose in hand, the teacher frequently neglects to teach the 
child how to find and use other materials which bear 
directly or indirectly upon the lesson in hand. The next 
thing to knowing a fact is knowing how to find it and how to 
reinforce it with other related facts. 
One of the school’s greatest sources of waste is, and always 
has been, the teaching of facts in isolation. The fact learned 
from the geography is more or less isolated, so far as its real 
meaning for the child is concerned, until it has been found 
in some other relations. The bare fact that St. Louis is a 
large city at the confluence of two great rivers is of no sig- 
nificance, and will be forgotten unless the child learns more  
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE CLASS STUDYING 233 
than that. Now, the question is, how to prevent him from 
being satisfied with merely memorizing the fact from the 
printed page, and how to equip him with facilities for so 
vitalizing that fact that it will have more than a verbal 
significance in his memory. There are numerous pictures, 
guidebooks, maps, and gazetteers, as well as cyclopedias, 
railroad time-tables, and the United States Census Reports, 
from which the child could learn how large St. Louis is in 
terms of its railroads, its industries, its population, its area, 
the number of churches, schools, parks and playgrounds, 
public libraries, and museums. If the lesson has to do with 
the location and size of St. Louis, it is not only worth while 
to study its size in all these terms — since at every turn the 
question of why so many railroads, parks, industries, is 
raised — but even more important that the children become 
familiar with these sources of materials and how to use 
them. 
Teaching how to study. College librarians constantly 
complain that the entering freshman does not know how to 
find anything outside of his textbook lesson. Not only 
should the elementary school teach the use of the common 
reference materials, but it should send the pupil to the high 
school with firmly fixed habits of using them. This will in- 
volve a knowledge of how to use an index and a table of 
contents, two simple tools which will save an almost endless 
amount of time and conduce to clear thinking. Nor is all 
the reference material to be found in books, maps, and pic- 
tures. The museum is often available, with the very richest 
materials for proving and illustrating things learned from 
books, and best of all there is the physical and social world 
outside which becomes an open book to those who learn to 
read it. Why study directions, rivers, islands, lakes, drain- 
age systems, animal and plant life, and industries from books 
alone, when the real things may often be investigated at 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
  234 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
first hand only a stone’s throw from the classroom win- 
dow? 
How to find materials brings the child up against the 
question of how to select and organize them. If, in connec- 
tion with a given lesson, the child is asked to read another 
book or article, he must be taught to read with definite 
questions in mind, and to write down the ideas or facts 
which answer his questions. Some definite training in this 
is necessary. How to take notes, how to pick out the gist 
of an article or to make an abstract of it, are things that 
should be taught, for they are essential to systematic meth- 
ods of study. 
Purposes of such instruction illustrated. One could 
readily make a list of points or aims to be kept in mind as 
a means of developing the child’s facility in study. For 
example: 
1. The right use of time. Train the child to make every moment 
of time count, and count for something done in accordance 
with a plan. 
2. Applying system. Orderly procedure in study is most ef- 
fective; as a result of it, effort is not squandered. Let a child 
form the habit of listing the steps by which he expects to do his 
studying of a given lesson. Having done this, let him con- 
sider in what order those steps may best be taken. 
8. Mastery of tools. Drill on the use of catalogue, dictionary, 
indexes, tables of contents, reading maps and charts, ency- 
clopedia; with emphasis on using them every day, is im- 
portant. 
4. Setting a definite aim. Children too seldom study with a clear 
idea of just what they are to get from a lesson. 
5. Applying what is learned. Children must learn that they 
really do not know a thing or possess a skill unless they can 
turn it to account in a new situation. 
These points supplement what was said above on intel- 
ligent study. If we keep these ideas constantly in mind as we 
deal with children, and keep these points before the chil-
-P-A-G-E-247
THE CLASS STUDYING 235 
dren as goals, it seems reasonable that in time habits of 
intelligent study will be fixed and that the result of their 
application will be a broader understanding of how to 
study. 
The fourth step, development of a critical attitude of 
mind. Whatever skill a child may develop in collecting facts 
under the teacher’s directions, he will ultimately be called 
upon to do his own selecting, and to act in terms of the 
values he places upon the facts he finds. Ability to discrim- 
inate the false from the true is of first importance, and will 
only grow with practice in making such discriminations. 
School children frequently cite their book as proof of a 
statement. The reason they have learned to rely on the 
book is because they have been permitted to do so. The 
teacher has called upon them merely to recite the facts con- 
tained in the book, and not to test those facts for their true 
worth. This is not only not teaching the child one of the 
most important elements in the study process, but, by 
neglect, it is fastening upon the child an attitude of mind 
that is positively harmful. It makes him a worshiper of the 
printed page, and trains him not only to trust every author 
he reads but to be content with the ideas of others. 
The critical habit illustrated. The opposite habits are 
what should be aimed at. The child must take a positive, 
instead of a passive, attitude toward what he reads, or hears, 
or otherwise senses. To establish these habits children 
should not be held to one single book in any subject. Many 
readers, histories, geographies, arithmetics, will be better 
than one. If there is not time for each child to read two or 
three books, then assign lessons in three books and divide 
the class into as many groups, assigning a different book to 
each group from which reports will be made as to what is 
said on the subject in question. Again, after the geography 
class has studied what a couple of texts have to say on drain- 
   
-P-A-G-E-248
  236 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
age, take the class to a near-by field, where they may verify 
the statements read. Occasionally books will differ on a 
question. That is an opportunity to teach the class how to 
find out which, if either, is right. Children study history 
and civics, and leave school supposing that our form of 
government is the best yet evolved. The constitution, the 
state laws, the city ordinances, are held in awe, and the 
officers are looked upon as different from other people, 
largely because the textbook facts about these matters have 
never been questioned. Children should be permitted to 
see how the laws and officers they read about play a part 
in their own community life, and this they will not do unless 
they are trained to go to other books and to things them- 
selves as other sources of knowledge, and to note carefully 
the points of agreement and of difference which the various 
sources reveal. 
The fifth step, to provide right conditions of work. Fin- 
ally, in addition to giving specific directions for work, right 
conditions for carrying on the work must be looked after. 
Needless distracting noises inside and outside should be 
guarded against; the seats or tables should be made com- 
fortable with respect to position, temperature, and light; 
a regular study program must be worked out, and easy access 
to sources such as have been mentioned above must be pro- 
vided for. These are all a part of training in systematic 
orderly methods of work. When the time comes to study 
spelling, children should be taught to clear their desks of 
all other material and to place before themselves just the 
things they expect to use in the study of the spelling lesson. 
This is really the first step in fixing attention upon the 
spelling lesson, and the first step in clear and undisturbed 
thinking. 
The ultimate aim good work habits. The ultimate aim 
of the teacher is to fix these various steps in the form of good
-P-A-G-E-249
  
THE CLASS STUDYING 237 
work habits. Children must develop a respect for accuracy 
in gerieral. They must learn how to begin new tasks with 
care, and to apply system in their procedure. They must 
accustom themselves to the use of the dictionary and other 
common reference materials. Not only must the child be 
taught how to study, but he must be watched constantly to 
see that he uses correct methods at all times. The laws of 
habit formation apply here as elsewhere, and the teacher 
must be constantly on the alert for lapses from the best 
methods. 
Most certainly all this cannot be accomplished in the 
lesson assignment. The assignment must be followed up by 
careful supervision during the study period. It is im- 
possible to do this in an ideal way in a one-room school, yet 
much can be done if the teacher trains herself to see a pupil’s 
needs when he is studying. The common mistake made in 
supervision is that of telling the child too much. It is far 
better to raise questions in his mind that will provoke think- 
ing in the right direction. He must be kept on the initiative 
always, for otherwise he is not really studying. We must 
not train children\to go groping through the woods with a 
vague notion that\something will stick to them; we must 
train them to go in'search of something, and that something 
must be as definite in their minds as it is possible to make it. 
It is not only facts, and clever recitations, but also how to 
find, to verify, to evaluate, and to use these facts that is 
ultimately important in the child’s education. 
3, Chapter summary 
Teaching the pupil how to study has been treated here as a 
problem in management because that is mainly what it is. The 
importance of right methods of study, when they are extended to 
all kinds and aspects of school work, and correlated as far as may 
be with outside activities, been pointed out, as have the actual 
steps in the study process. 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  238 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
The proper attitude for the teacher to assume toward the three 
phases of the teaching process — assignment, study, and recitation 
— has been explained, and concrete suggestions offered for man- 
aging the individual and the class with respect to each. 
As everywhere in management, the emphasis here is first upon 
aclearaim. The child must know exactly what he is todo. Sec- 
ond in importance to a clear aim is a real motive for study. The as- 
signment must create actual problems if we expect an aggressive 
attitude on the part of the pupil. Third, how to find and organize 
materials that will solve these problems must be made clear. But 
this is not all, for proper management of study must result finally in 
critical attitudes toward facts, and in sound habits of work. These 
can only result from actual practice in comparing sources and in 
verifying the facts of the book by checking them against facts 
found outside the book. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. In what important particulars were you taught how to study while 
in the elementary school? Explain any important ideas that you 
regularly apply in your own present methods of study. Where did 
you get those ideas? Could they have been explained to you in the 
elementary school? 
2, What do you mean by study, and why is it important that we learn 
how to study systematically? 
3. What are some practical difficulties in the way of teaching children 
how to study? 
4, Before you can teach how to study you must of course know how 
yourself. Suppose you have assigned a spelling lesson of three new 
words in grade three. How would you explain to the class how to 
study that lesson? Do you know any books or articles that explain 
the best method of studying spelling? Are the directions they give 
based upon the results of scientific study or merely upon opinion? 
5. If the lesson being assigned is a lesson in number combinations, as 
the multiplication table of three’s, state specifically the aim you would 
try to set up in the minds of the pupils as the thing to be accomplished 
in their study. Can you mention any literature on the question of 
how to memorize? 
6. What are some of the practical difficulties in the way of making the 
aim of a lesson clear to all pupils in a class? 
7. What is meant by providing a motive for study? How would you 
provide a motive for the study of a spelling lesson? 
8. How soon should a child learn to use the dictionary? How would 
you teach the use of the dictionary?
-P-A-G-E-251
  
THE CLASS STUDYING 239 
9. Explain how you would assign a lesson on the landing of the Pilgrims. 
What questions would you raise for the class to answer, what materials 
would you have them use to supplement the text? Would your 
assignment provide a real motive for study? 
10. Explain how you would train children to be critical of what they read? 
How would you expect to teach them respect for accuracy? 
11. What advantage is there for teaching how to study in: 
(a) the use of field trips; 
(0) special assignments and reports; 
(c) abstracting articles; 
(d) reporting on things seen or heard; 
(e) verifying statements by comparing authors. 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
1. Prepare copies of the following questions, submit them to classes of 
pupils in grades 3, 6, and 8, and tabulate and study the results. On 
the basis of the replies write a prescription for teaching how to study. 
a. How do you study? 
b. Explain fully how you studied your reading lesson. 
c. Explain fully how you studied your spelling lesson. 
d. Explain how you studied your nature study or geography or 
science lesson. 
e. Do you have a regular time for studying each of your lessons? 
f. Does your arithmetic work help you in your play, or in the 
things you make or do at home? If so, give illustrations. 
g. How can you tell when you have studied your lesson enough? 
2. Write out an explanation and illustrate how the prescription for in- 
telligent study presented above would apply in specific studies. 
8. Visit classrooms and observe study groups, and write down what you 
see that seems to indicate that the study procedure is good or that it is 
poor. Prescribe briefly what you think should be done in each case to 
correct wrong procedure, and show how the right procedures might be 
applied in other studies, or in play or work life outside of school. 
4, Visit classes that are reciting, and list all the evidences you can detect 
that show that any particular pupil did not use good study proce- 
dure. Prescribe as in 3 above.

1. Nature and purpose of the recitation 
Conducting recitation the real test of teaching skill. The 
management of the recitation is after all the final test of 
professional skill in teaching. Here the teacher is con- 
fronted with the problem of individual differences as at no 
other point in her work, and that, too, in a continually 
widening variety of lessons and exercises. 
The time was, only a few decades ago, when the term 
recitation had reference to the pupil’s saying over to his 
teacher what he had previously learned by himself. The 
exercise was narrowly intellectual, since preparation for it 
involved little more than verbal memory work. Such a 
meaning grew less and less applicable as the aim of the 
school broadened to include the esthetic, the physical, the 
social and moral, and the economic elements, and the cur- 
riculum to include nature study, hygiene, civics, organized 
play, domestic science, drawing, music, and manual work. 
It is not that the process has become less intellectual than 
before, but that it has become more physical, social, and 
   
-P-A-G-E-254
    242 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
esthetic. Under the old régime the child sat in his seat with 
a book only. To-day he has not a book but many books, 
and is as often engaged in doing as in saying things. Conse- 
quently the recitation is no longer a mere re-citing, or say- 
ing over, but includes all the wide variety of mental and 
bodily activities essential to the accomplishment of this 
newer aim of education. 
The broader meaning of recitation. Under these new con- 
ditions the nature of the learning, and consequently of the 
teaching, process has broadened so that “‘recitation” means 
widely different things under different circumstances. So 
wide are these differences, in fact, that we have come to 
think of “recitation” as “recitation period”’ and to differ- 
entiate these periods by referring to one as the geography 
recitation and to another as the domestic-science recitation 
and so forth. This is merely the way in which we have 
recognized the fact that the learning process, and con- 
sequently the teaching process, is widely different in differ- 
ent cases. 
From the child’s standpoint, that is from the standpoint 
of learning, the modern recitation differs in the fact that in 
one case the child merely sits or stands, and relates what he 
has previously studied, as in spelling; in another he moves 
about, working with his hands and using tools and materials 
instead of books and words, as in manual training and do- 
mestic science; in another he uses his whole body, along with 
words and materials, to impersonate some character, as in 
dramatizing; in another he exercises his imagination, as by 
drawing or painting; in another he attempts to perfect some 
mental or physical process, as in memorizing verses or in 
developing skill in writing; in another he is moving about in 
response to social stimuli, interpreting the acts of his fel- 
lows and responding to them in codperation or in competi- 
tion, as in organized play; and so on, in almost endless
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE CLASS RECITING 243 
variety, we find the mental, social, and bodily activities 
combined in different recitations. 
From the standpoint of managing the recitation, these 
periods vary greatly, because the teacher must control the 
attention and direct the energy and activities of her pupils 
under these widely different circumstances and to these 
widely different ends. 
Rule-of-thumb method inadequate. With such a variety 
of processes it is clear that there can be no simple rule-of- 
thumb method for their proper management. The broad 
general purpose of all recitations is to direct this learning 
process to the end that the greatest economy in time and 
energy shall be effected. How to organize the many differ- 
ent kinds of subject-matter and to plan the varied exercises 
so that they may be most quickly mastered by the pupils; 
how to organize the class and to arrange the different ma- 
terials to this same end; and how to keep each individual 
working with purpose and enthusiasm is the teacher’s task. 
2. The aim of the recitation 
Necessity for a clear aim. A recitation cannot be suc- 
cessfully managed except with respect to some definite 
end which is clear to both teacher and pupil. It is one 
thing for the teacher to say, “The aim of this geography les- 
son is to impart knowledge”’; it is a different thing for her to 
say specifically what knowledge, how it is related to know- 
ledge the child now possesses, and what she expects the child 
to do with it now, and five or ten years from now. For pur- 
poses of instruction the teacher has not a clear aim for such 
recitations until she has considered the nature and or- 
ganization of the facts and exercises involved, and considered 
them from these points of view. 
The child will seldom have so broad a perspective for 
what he is to study. He cannot see that what he is now
-P-A-G-E-256
244 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
learning will be indispensable to him in later years. Yet this 
does not mean that he is not to have an aim with respect to 
every part of his school work. It only means that to him 
the aim must be very concrete. The geography lesson will 
answer for him some question which, in the previous as- 
signment, the teacher was careful to provoke. What causes 
the seasons; how St. Louis came to be a large city; or why 
Chicago is a great railroad center. Or, in physiology, Why 
should we keep our teeth clean? In such lessons his aim is 
to try to answer these questions. In writing his aim is to 
imitate a copy or to increase his speed. In language it is to 
tell a story or to write a description of a familiar scene. Thus 
while all lessons will have these general and future values 
which the teacher wiff hold in mind, for the pupil they must 
stand as concrete tasks or problems, so specific in nature 
that he sees just where to begin, and so related to what he 
knows and wants to know that he will be moved to action. 
That is, before the recitation can have a clear aim for the 
pupil, he must have had an aim in its preparation. 
The teacher’s problem. ‘The teacher’s problem is the 
double one, therefore, first of determining what she desires 
to accomplish in the recitation, and second of seeing to it 
that the pupils have a clear notion of what they are to do. 
In the schematic presentation given on page 245 the in- 
tention is not to set forth any final analysis of this problem, 
but merely to offer a plan by which, it is believed, the reader 
may be helped to differentiate the aim of the teacher from 
that of the pupil in the conduct of the recitation, and to see 
the points at which the teaching aim must issue in some- 
thing accomplished by the pupil. 
Recitation tests. First of all we need to think of the aim 
of the recitation from two standpoints: first, that of the 
process through which teacher and pupils are to pass; and 
second, that of the product which is to result from the

procedure. A teacher may, by her clever ways with chil- 
dren, conduct a lively recitation and yet fail to accomplish 
a proper end. Recitations are not successful when they 
end in mere excitement or entertainment alone. 
This recitation process we must learn to watch from the 
standpoint of both teacher (instruction) and pupil (learn- 
ing). While the teacher’s aims may be roughly classified 
as testing, teaching, listening or observing, and drilling, we 
must remember that a measure of their effectiveness is not 
how much the teacher talks or questions or observes, but 
how much she finds out from the child and helps him to 
accomplish. To him it is not a mere matter of observ- 
ing what the teacher has to offer. He is active, not passive, 
and is to be busy with answering, studying, reciting, per- 
forming, or practicing. Her concern is quite as much with 
the learning as with the teaching end. The nature of the 
child’s answers, how he studies, recites, or practices — these 
are the points at which her own aims and processes must 
have their final issue. The rather trite statement that 
there is no teaching except when there is learning is not less 
true because it is commonplace. 
Recitation products. The product to be obtained, that 
is, the knowledge or experience to be acquired by the pupil, 
must be understood by both teacher and pupil. The spell- 
ing recitation aims at correct pronunciation, use, and spell- 
ing of a given number of new words, with review of cer- 
tain words previously learned; the writing lesson aims at 
observable improvement in position, movement, form of 
words, and speed; the arithmetic recitation at a full and 
clear explanation of certain assigned problems, or drill on 
certain number combinations; and the reading recitation at 
correct pronunciation, clear enunciation, accurate expres- 
sion and interpretation of a given piece of reading matter. 
Beyond these immediate products, however, the teacher
-P-A-G-E-259
eee ee ee 
THE CLASS RECITING 2AT | 
aims at a list of broader, more general, more distant achieve- 
ments, all of which are matters of slow growth. While 
correct spelling, reading, and writing may be her immediate 
aim, it is through these that she seeks the development of 
her pupils in the knowledge, skill, and appreciation of their 
mother tongue. Nor is it knowledge of language only, 
but knowledge of history, number, institutions, and people 
past and present, and of essential processes, that the teacher 
must keep in mind. 
How to bring the narrow and concrete purposes of each 
individual recitation to bear upon the accomplishment of 
these ultimate aims of appreciation, knowledge, skill, phys- 
ical development, moral growth, executive power, and in- 
dividual initiative is the real problem involved in the for- 
mulation of the recitation aim, and it is in the task of fitting 
the immediate and concrete teaching act into the ultimate 
purpose of the work that the teacher comes to realize fully 
that her aim in teaching can never be separated from the 
methods by means of which she may hope to attain it. 
Testing as anaim. In testing a class it is easy to work on 
the assumption that the main responsibility lies with the 
pupils. Such an attitude breaks down the proper relation- 
ship between teacher and pupils, by placing the class on the 
defensive. This need not happen if the teacher has pre- 
viously determined upon just what she will test for, and 
upon a plan of procedure. It is not the teacher alone, but 
the child also who must discover errors and deficiencies in 
the work done. It is a codperative undertaking, therefore, in 
which all join in a complete stock-taking, preparatory to 
the next move forward. 
The old-fashioned teacher tested more often than she 
taught, and that mainly for facts. Could the child spell 
the word, diagram the sentence, trace the military cam- 
1 See Chapter II, sections 2 and 3, 
   
-P-A-G-E-260
  248 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
paign — yes or no? She tested for what the child remem- 
bered, and not for how he had learned it or what he could 
do with it. In the modern classroom the function of the 
test has become much broader. Its aim is to get behind 
the mere lack of information to its causes. Hence it tries 
to answer such questions as: What does the pupil know? 
What of the assignment does he not know? Why did he 
learn facts x and not facts y? Did he fully understand the 
assignment? (If not was it my fault?) Just how did he study 
his lesson? Did he try to memorize when he should have 
tried merely to get the essential meaning and facts? Did 
he go to the right sources for materials, or did he use effec- 
tively those at hand? Was his failure merely lack of applic 
tion or lack of interest, and if so, why? These and similar 
detailed inquiries will find out just what the child does and 
does not know, what he can and cannot do, and the reason 
in every case. 
The teacher who can maintain the hearty codperation of 
her class through such an inquiry has accomplished much 
in the art of teaching. That accomplishment, however, is 
possible for all teachers who will work to convert the vague 
aim of “testing” into such concrete and specific aims as are 
here suggested. 
Teaching as an aim. In testing, the teacher is trying to 
find out things for herself, things which she may use not 
only as a basis for judging the pupil’s efficiency, but mainly 
as a basis for her own positive contribution to the recita- 
tion through her instruction. The teaching process is so 
extremely varied in its nature, owing to the ends it must 
meet, that in this brief space little more than a mere enu- 
meration of these ends can be undertaken. First, teaching 
begins at the point where help is needed, and proceeds in 
the general direction of the ends set forth under section II, 
in our outline above. But these ends, while they are fun-
-P-A-G-E-261
THE CLASS RECITING 249 
damental, are distant, can only be attained in noticeable 
degree after many recitations, and cannot be substituted 
for the specific end to be attained in a given exercise. More 
immediate ends are: 
he Self-expression, which must cover more than what is 
found in books or teacher’s directions, more than oral or 
written speech, more than mere fact. There must be room 
for the imagination in writing, drawing, story-telling, hand- 
work, and dramatization, wherein voice, words, gestures, 
bodily movement, facial expression, and even costuming 
are all brought into play to convey to listeners the feelings 
and thoughts of the pupil reciting. Such self-expression 
leads to moral, social, and executive growth. 
2. Coéperation and competition as social and economic 
principles may be thoroughly established in the minds and 
habits of children if group work is turned definitely to such 
account. The principle of division of labor may be effec- 
tively experienced where reports on individual assignments 
all contribute to the development of a central idea, or where 
individual pupils each perform a separate part in making 
something in the shop or laboratory. Similarly the spirit 
of fair play in competition can be taught where groups are 
pitted against one another in the performance of some 
task. 
3. The development of right habits of work is another spe- 
cific point of attack for the teaching process. Very few 
children will discover for themselves that chapter headings, 
with their formal subdivisions, are the key to the chief 
points in the lesson. There is a best procedure in all kinds 
of study from bare memorizing of spelling to writing a 
story, solving a problem in percentage, designing a hat, or 
painting a picture. As has been pointed out,! this best way 
will rarely be hit upon by the child if he is left to his own 
1See Chapter XIII. 
   
-P-A-G-E-262
  250 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
resources. It is an ever-present problem which must be 
cared for in that part of the recitation which is devoted to 
the assignment of the lesson. 
Listening or observing as an aim. In some recitations 
the teacher’s chief function will be that of auditor and 
spectator. It is often a great temptation to do the talking, 
or to add a touch to a drawing when one sees so clearly what 
is needed; and there are times when such help should be 
given. On the other hand there are times when such help 
will destroy the child’s confidence in himself and put an end 
to a type of self-expression that is highly important. When 
a child is telling a story, discussing a topic in history, describ- 
ing a specimen, or arguing a point, he should be heard to the 
end. If he is writing, drawing, dramatizing, or performing 
an experiment, then too much interference by the teacher 
will destroy his initiative, and the final product, though it 
may be better for the teacher’s help, will not be the pupil’s 
work, nor will he feel the satisfaction of having originated or 
completed the task. When a pupil has done well in a recita- 
tion, a quick acknowledgment of the fact by the teacher will 
usually be more effective at the time than too many sug- 
gestions as to how it could have been better. There is a 
proper place for constructive criticism of a child’s work, but 
so there is for quiet sanction of it. 
Drill as an aim. Some recitations will be devoted solely 
to practice or drill on some mental or physical process, such 
as learning number combinations, verses, location of impor- 
tant geographical features, writing, drawing, singing, danc- 
ing, sewing, and carving. Here the end to be achieved is 
mental or physical skill, and the process is that of develop- 
ing a specific habit. The aim will be slightly different for 
every habit, but in all cases concentrated attention, with 
frequent repetition which stops short of serious fatigue, 
will be necessary, and a completely mechanized procedure 
   
-P-A-G-E-263
  THE CLASS RECITING 251 
must finally result, else the practice will have been largely 
wasted. 
When to use these aims. It is not possible to say just 
when and where each of these aims and processes will come 
into play. In almost every recitation there will be testing, 
teaching, listening, and drilling. There will often be rapid 
and frequent movement from one of these processes to 
another, and back again. Similarly the pupils will be an- 
swering, reciting, and practicing, and no one can direct the 
teacher as to just when she may expect one or another of 
these responses. The fact is, however, that these are all 
distinct~and separate functions, and the teacher should 
study them diligently as such. The result of proper care 
in their use by the young teacher will be teaching habits 
which will place upon the class a reasonable portion of the 
responsibility for the success of the recitation, prevent an un- 
due amount of bare testing at the expense of teaching, make 
the teacher an intelligent auditor, give the pupils a chance 
to tell what they feel and know, insist upon a due amount of 
intelligent practice or drill, and teach them how to study. 
Again, there is no way of saying when appreciation, know- 
ledge, or skill, will be the aim sought. Certainly many of 
these aims will play a part in almost every recitation. To 
know just what each one means, and how it may be attained, 
will undoubtedly rationalize the teaching process. There 
is much too little conscious effort in the direction of training 
for intellectual and emotional appreciation; knowledge is 
too often knowledge of what, and too seldom knowledge of 
' how or why, skill is too rarely of the physical type, and too 
narrowly intellectual; physical exercises aim too indefinitely 
at either development or correction; moral growth is too 
often either ignored, or expected as a result of moralizing, 
whereas its problem is that of developing specific habits and 
ideals of right conduct; executive training, training for
-P-A-G-E-264
  252 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
leadership, is grossly neglected; and intellectual and social 
initiative are more often suppressed than stimulated. 
These aims may often overlap each other, but they 
represent definite aspects of personality, definite points 
of contact with the world, definite sources of power over 
ourselves and our fellows, definite angles from which we are 
judged by society, definite lines along which we do or do not 
contribute to human happiness. They must therefore stand 
in the teacher’s mind as the ultimate criteria of the effective- 
ness of her work, and each recitation should be held to one 
or more of these accounts, while no one of these aims 
should be overlooked or long neglected. 
8. The plan of the recitation 
Every recitation has two distinct parts: the handling 
of the lesson that has been prepared for the occasion, and 
the assignment of a new lesson. The function of the assign- 
ment is mainly that of teaching how to study the next group 
of materials, and has therefore been treated in the chapter 
on The Class Studying. Consequently only a few words as 
to its place in the recitation plan are needed here. The as- 
signment will be long or brief, general or detailed, according 
to the nature of the task it has to present. Whether it shall 
come at the beginning or end of the recitation period is a 
question which can scarcely be settled by a general rule. 
There are times when the assignment can properly come at 
the beginning of the period, as when it has no intimate con- 
nection with the lesson in hand. » Under ordinary circum- 
stances spelling lessons, drill on number combinations, and 
theme writing, would constitute such cases. Usually, how- 
ever, the end of the period is the better place for the assign- 
ment, for the reason that the lesson just recited naturally 
leads up to and presents problems which the assignment 
should explain.
-P-A-G-E-265
THE CLASS RECITING 253 
The plans for conducting the recitation part of the period 
will vary with the type of lesson to be dealt with,! but there 
are a number of problems which present themselves with 
sufficient frequency to warrant their brief consideration 
here. Such are the place and importance of interest, a 
proper use of the textbook, the question and answer method, 
the place of the lecture, and the topical method. 
The place and importance of interest. This subject has 
been dealt with elsewhere; it is only necessary to apply here 
what has already been said in another connection on page 
100 ff. 
Common abuses of the textbook. The very excellent 
textbooks which we have in such abundance have been in- 
valuable in systematizing the work of instruction. They 
have made for definiteness in assignment and relieved the 
teacher of the endless task of collecting and organizing 
material for her classes. On the other hand, they have at 
the same time been a source of evil. The lazy, indifferent, 
or ignorant teacher has learned to rely solely upon the text 
as the source of materials for her class, and has therefore 
grossly neglected the important duty of supplementing the 
one small book which was designed as a mere outline. The 
consequence has been much memoriter work on the part 
of the pupils, along with which has developed the assump- 
tion that the facts of the text are all there are on the subject 
Such abuses of the text have stunted the child’s initiative in 
seeking sources outside the book and in applying the know- 
ledge and skill of the schoolroom to problems of life outside. 
These are not imaginary, but rather very real, dangers for 
every teacher who does not hold herself strictly to account 
in these respects.

Course in the Teaching Process, pp. 41-106; McMurry, F., The Method of 
the Recitation; Earhart, LaB., Types of Teaching. 
     
-P-A-G-E-266
    254 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
Textbook use and teacher efficiency. There are proper 
uses of the text, however, which can be learned, and which, 
when applied, make the text an indispensable tool. First, 
the teacher should remember that she is teaching her class, 
and that she is teaching a subject, not a book; that the 
text presents some essential facts, and suggests a plan of 
organization for others which, together with the class, she 
may gather from other sources. Second, the text material 
offers a convenient means of assigning a definite formal task 
for which all pupils should be held responsible. Third, the 
material of the text is likely to present most of the real 
difficulties with which the class will have to cope in their 
study of the subject, such as new words or difficult points in 
an explanation. Finally, one chief function of the textbook 
is to bring out clearly the plan of organization of the matter 
presented. A mastery of this technique is important, since 
in ordinary books, journals, and newspapers such helps are 
much rarer. 
The topical plan of recitation. To be able to stand before 
an audience and think logically while speaking is all too rare 
an accomplishment, and one by which the world sets much 
store. There is no school exercise so well calculated to 
develop this ability as the topical recitation. As a method 
it is applicable from the very beginning to the end of school 
work, scarcely more in proportion at one age than at an- 
other. The six-year-old will speak more briefly and on a 
different topic, but with the same problem of clear, logical, 
forceful presentation before him as has the college student 
in his advanced discussions. 
The teacher’s task in the two cases differs more in degree, 
therefore, than in kind. In both cases she will see to it that 
the child speaks in his own language rather than in that of 
the book; that he tells what he thinks or knows rather than 
what some author thinks (except of course when reporting
-P-A-G-E-267
THE CLASS RECITING 255 
what he has read); that he sticks to his subject; that every 
point made bears proper relationship to the line of thought; 
that his language is clear and grammatically correct; that 
he does not consume more than a reasonable amount of time; 
that he makes it a point to interest those listening; that he 
speaks to his class, and not to the teacher alone or to the 
floor; that he stands or sits erect and speaks in good voice; 
and that he stops when he is through. 
To accomplish these many ends she will not lavish too 
much or too little praise on a good recitation, and nega- 
tive criticism or sharp rebuke will be similarly administered. 
She will rarely stop a pupil except at a natural pause, and 
will often tide him over by putting a question or by per- 
mitting another pupil to carry forward the discussion. At 
the close, however, all types of errors in language, or in fact, 
or in length or brevity of speech, may be brought to light 
by questions, to the end that the child may fully judge the 
success of his presentation. 
The lecture plan of recitation. In the elementary school 
there can be little if any formal lecturing, but there is room 
for much simple telling, which will usually occupy a subor- 
dinate place during the recitation period. Almost every 
lesson needs to be supplemented by the teacher, who keeps 
an ever-changing and growing stock of stories, anecdotes, 
and facts which she introduces as additional material in the 
recitation. The purpose of such kind of lecturing is varied. 
At one point it will add definitely to the number of facts 
brought out by the class, at another it will illustrate a point 
with some familiar incident, at another it will explain and 
demonstrate the working of a principle, at another it will 
deliberately provoke laughter with some pertinent anecdote 
or story which aims partly to drive home a point and partly 
to cause a real relaxation. 
The question-and-answer plan of recitation. In almost
-P-A-G-E-268
  256 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
every kind of recitation the question and answer will play a 
large part.1. Even where a topic has been recited upon, 
questions will usually follow to clear up certain points, or 
to supplement what has been said, and where the discussion 
has been mainly by the teacher the problem cannot wisely 
be left until by questions she has assured herself that what 
she has been saying has been fully comprehended and crit- 
ically evaluated by the class. 
Two types of questions. There are two general types of 
questions, one of which is designed to test memory for 
facts obtained from books or observation, the other to test 
the child’s power to interpret and use facts. Both are es- 
sential in practice. The one, however, is easy to formu- 
late, is likely to lead to an overemphasis of book learning, 
to encourage mere guessing, and to discourage originality. 
The other is more difficult to formulate, but it stimulates 
thought and leads to a testing out of facts remembered by 
applying them in practical situations. The former is too 
frequently overworked in the classroom, because it is an 
easy way to get a lively response from the class. We should 
not have fewer fact questions perhaps, but we should have 
more of the kind that put the pupil on his own initiative. 
where he must exercise judgment as well as memory. 
Forms of questions. The form of the question is of fun- 
damental importance. The direct question, to be answered 
by yes or no, such as: “ Is hail made of frozen raindrops?” is 
poor because it stimulates guessing at the answer. By the 
law of chance a child will answer correctly fifty out of every 
one hundred such questions without knowing a solitary fact 
involved. By a correct guess the pupil often deceives him- 
self into thinking that he really knew the answer. The 
1 For a careful description and critical study of questioning, see Stevens, 
Romiett, The Question as a Measure of Efficiency in Instruction, Teachers 
College Contributions, no. 42 (1912).
-P-A-G-E-269
THE CLASS RECITING 257 
alternative question, such as, “Was Jefferson a strict or a 
loose constructionist?” has all the evils of the direct ques- 
tion, with no added virtues, and neither is improved upon 
by the leading question so often denied an answer in court. 
It is worse than a waste of time to ask “Is the magnetic 
north pole a little different from the most northern point on 
the earth?” for what child would be so stupid as to guess 
“No” in answer? 
The real test of good questioning. Questions formulated 
in these ways do not require the child to think or to reor- 
ganize his previous experience in any way, and yet these are 
the real tests of the value of questions in the recitation. 
There are two aspects of the problem to be studied, the 
question and the answer. ‘There are certain principles 
which the teacher will do well to follow: First, the ques- 
tion must have scope enough to provoke thought, to do 
which, it must (a) be clear and concise; (6) challenge the 
attention of all members of the class; (¢) be properly related 
to previous and succeeding questions, and (d) be not too 
long or too complicated. Furthermore, the question should 
be asked in an ordinary conversational tone, it should not 
be repeated, and it should be fully stated before being ad- 
dressed to any particular pupil. Pupils should be questioned 
in no regular order; and care will be necessary to prevent 
most questions, being answered by those who habitually 
make good replies. 
What to do with answers is little less a problem than how 
to provoke them. Certainly the teacher must be an at- 
tentive listener, taking care not to assist the speaker toc 
much by a look or gesture which seems to say Yes, go on, 
or No, it is the other way. A few common errors are: 
(a) repeating the child’s answer after him; (6) jumping at 
his conclusion without permitting him to finish speaking; 
(c) adding to his answer to avoid formulating a question that 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  258 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
will bring out the information from the class; and (d) permit- 
ting him to answer a different question from the one asked. 
4. Organizing for recitation work 
Homogeneity in group desirable. In our discussion of 
grading and classification (Chapter X), it was suggested that 
grade groups are not necessarily good recitation or work 
groups. It was also suggested that it is not always neces- 
sary to observe grade lines in organizing class groups and, 
further, that it is not always necessary to classify pupils in 
the same way for all subjects. Not infrequently our 
standard tests show a spread in ability of pupils in a given 
grade of as high as five or even seven grades. That is, some 
of the children of grade five are able to read only as well as 
third-grade pupils while others read as well as eighth-grade 
pupils. Even in a single fifth-grade class this wide differ- 
ence is very common.! 
One essential in group work is homogeneity in those traits 
that count in the work. Variation of pupils in height, color 
of hair or eyes, or weight, affects the success of a recitation 
very little. Variation in general intelligence, in experience, 
in general knowledge, and especially in knowledge of the 
subject in question, counts for much. A class may be quite 
heterogeneous in the former but not in the latter group of 
traits. 
It is often argued that slow pupils learn much from bright 
ones, and that classification on the basis of ability is really 
undemocratic, and therefore wrong. The answer to this is: 
Grant that the dull pupils learn from the bright ones, why 
not employ teachers rather than pupils to do the teaching? 
Also, do the dull ones learn independence of thought and 
action, or do they learn to wait for others to lead? And 
1 For abundance of data see recent School Survey Reports and City 
School Reports of testing programs.
-P-A-G-E-271
  
THE CLASS RECITING 259 
again, why not give the bright ones a fair chance, too? It 
is certainly democratic to give equal (not necessarily like) 
opportunity to all, and that is what ability homogeneity 
grouping will do. 
Difficulties in the way of proper classification. It is not 
a question of what we should do; that is very obvious. It is 
rather a question of what we can do to provide homogeneous 
groups. Our room groups are usually determined in part by 
the number of pupils available and in part by grade lines. 
Where the number of pupils is small, any one class will 
include pupils of more than one grade. Where the school is 
very large the room will probably contain pupils of but one 
grade or half grade. 
It is reasonable to assume that the pupils of any one grade 
are somewhat homogeneous, in that they have been simi- 
larly exposed to like materials of instruction. Making up 
homogeneous classes from the single grade group should be 
easier for this reason. In reality, however, most of the 
classrooms of the country contain from two to eight grade 
groups. We have the opportunity ——we may say the 
necessity — therefore, of breaking over grade lines in ar- 
ranging our classes. In aroom with forty pupils the teacher 
is free to classify as she pleases so long as no other room is 
involved, so long as her recreation periods do not conflict 
with the general school program, and so long as work done 
in her room by special teachers or supervisors does not too 
greatly upset the schedules of such outside helpers. 
Arranging the groups. If our forty pupils belong to a 
single grade, say grade IV A, then it will be found that in 
each study there is wide variability among the children. 
Some are very bright and far ahead, while others are very 
slow and well behiud. Instead of teaching the forty 
pupils as a single class the teacher should break them up, in 
some cases into two, and in other cases into as many as 
   
-P-A-G-E-272
  260 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
three, separate work groups. Calling these groups low, 
medium, and high,! we may expect to find a given pupil 
in the low group in one study and in the medium or high 
group in another. Thus we shall have a different classi- 
fication for each study. This may involve some little diffi- 
culty in a crowded room in seating the recitation group 
together, though the difficulty is not insurmountable. 
If our group of forty is a one-teacher, eight-grade school, 
then we have a different situation. We have at best no 
time for additional refinements in classification. There are 
too many classes at best. Our problem, then, is to provide 
the greatest homogeneity possible in our recitation or work 
groups and at the same time keep the number of classes 
reduced as low as possible. 
Under such circumstances, with forty pupils scattered 
through eight grades — that is, with an average of five 
pupils per grade — we may introduce the principles of 
alternation, combination, and correlation and reduce the 
number of groups (see Chapter XII). Then, for recitation 
groups we may in many instances, for the sake of homo- 
geneity, break over these lines. The dullest pupils in 
grade V might profit by working with the brightest pupils 
in grade III in reading or arithmetic, while the brightest 
pupils in grade III would profit by being freed from the re- 
tarding influence of the slower pupils of their own grade. 
Real flexibility needed. The point emphasized here is 
that we can have good classification if we will take the 
problem of classifying seriously. Our purpose is to have 
homogeneity and a reasonable economy in the number of 
classes. This can be accomplished whether we have one or 
many grade groups in the room, but because of individual 
differences, and because pupils move at different rates in their 
1 They need not be so designated in the room if being called low is likely 
to discourage the children.
-P-A-G-E-273
    THE CLASS RECITING 261 
studies, we cannot assume that a right classification at the 
beginning of a term will continue to be right through the 
months following. Almost surely it will not. So our class 
lines must not be rigid. It should be very easy to shift 
from low to medium or vice versa as conditions warrant. In 
one topic in arithmetic John may be in the high group. In 
the next topic he may do better in one of the other groups. 
Accordingly, as we have insisted elsewhere, grade lines 
must be flexible and easily crossed; and here we must insist 
upon applying this idea even more freely in the matter of 
classification. 
§. Right conditions for work 
What has been said on this subject in connection with the 
chapter on The Class Studying applies almost verbatim 
here. The teacher needs all her energy for her class, and 
should suffer as few distractions as possible. Regularity, 
punctuality, strict adherence to assignments, physical con- 
veniences, all materials at hand, careful preparation for the 
recitation on the part of both teacher and pupils, all need to 
be watched; and then as cheerful and as wholesome an at- 
mosphere of earnest, rapid work as is possible should be the 
teacher’s aim. 
6. Chapter summary 
Tn this chapter we have discussed the nature and purpose of the 
recitation, distinguished between the teacher’s and the pupils’ 
aims, clarified these aims by the use of illustrations, and showed 
wHen and where they should be used. We have also suggested 
various general plans for conducting the recitation, and the con- 
ditions under which such work should be carried on. 
In doing this we have seen that managing the recitation is above 
all the real test of teaching skill. The first essential for the teacher 
is to know specifically what it is she expects to accomplish, and to 
see that the pupil knows what he is to do and how to do it. She 
must learn to distinguish the teaching from the testing, drilling,
-P-A-G-E-274
262 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
and observing processes, and know when and where each will best 
apply. She must keep in mind that the chief thing to watch is the 
character of the child’s responses and his ability in applying the 
facts or skills that he gains from study. 
In formulating plans for the recitation, the importance of inter- 
est, that is, real motive, must not be overlooked. The textbook 
serves as a guide, and not as the only source of facts. The use of 
the topical plan of recitation, the use of question and answer, and 
the use of lecture or telling methods are all most serviceable where 
properly managed, though each is capable of abuse. Finally, no © 
plan is successful in the midst of unnecessary distractions. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Explain the changes that have taken place in the meaning of the term 
recitation. 
2. Why is recitation period a better term for present use? 
8. There are obvious differences between a spelling recitation and a 
recitation in domestic science. From the standpoint of managing 
the recitation just what are these differences? 
4, If you were giving an explanation of the aim of education, how would 
it differ from your statement of the aim of the recitation? If the two 
aims are different, why are they so? 
5. What difference is there, if any, between the aim the teacher will 
have for a recitation and that which the pupil will have? Why? 
6. How far does a full statement of one’s teaching aim necessitate a 
clear understanding of the method to be used in carrying out that 
aim? 
7. Under what circumstances in a recitation would it be proper for the 
teacher to: test? teach? listen? observe? drill? 
8. Explain fully how testing is essential in most recitations, and just 
what function such testing should serve. 
9. How does teaching differ from testing in its purpose? In its plan of 
action? 
10. What does it mean for the teacher to be a good auditor? 
11. Just what may be included in the teaching aim “self-expression’’? 
12. Explain the possible uses and abuses of the textbook, the lecture, 
topical, and question-and-answer plans of conducting the recitation. 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
1. By means of tests and of information gathered by visits to classrooms, 
answer the following questions for five recitation groups:
-P-A-G-E-275
  THE CLASS RECITING 263 
a. To what extent do the pupils vary in ability in reading? 
b. To what extent do they vary in age? 
c. To what extent do they vary in rate of progress to date? 
d. To what extent do they vary in I Q, and E Q? 
e. Write a prescription for the reclassification of this group for 
reading work. 
2. Make a study, by the use of tests and other means, including mental 
age, of a selected group of ten pupils. Select the pupils from different 
grades and with reference to general mental ability. Make the se- 
lection so that there will be a variation in I Q from well below to well 
above normal: 
a, Find the pupil’s rank in his class in each of his studies, as shown 
by standard tests. 
6. Obtain the rank as based upon the teacher’s judgment. 
c. To what extent do test results and teacher’s judgment agree? 
d. Are these children properly classified? Answer for each child 
separately. 
e. Does I Q seem significant as an index to proper classification? 
f. Does mental age seem significant? 
8. Make a study of teachers’ judgments as to the relative amount of 
homogeneity desirable for good teaching groups, in each of the follow- 
ing studies: oral reading, geography, civics, spelling, composition, 
arithmetic, manual training, domestic science, hygiene, history, and 
writing, say for upper-grade work. 
Question form to be submitted to teacher: 
. Years’ training above high school Name . .. Years’ experience in teaching     
1. On the basis of z oral reading test ! what, in your judgment, is the widest range in ability that should be allowed in an upper-grade class in reading? You are to state here what you think you yourself could handle successfully; that is, pupils of abilities ranging from what to what in this test. From ...... Posse 2. With this amount of variation or heterogeneity as the limit in oral-reading classes, and assuming that you had similar tests with similar scales or scores for each of the other subjects, please set down here the range for the other subjects, as follows: 
          Geography: from ...... to . Civics: from ....,. to. Spelling: from ...... to. Composition: from to. Arithmetic: from ...... to. Manual Tr.: from to. Dom. Sci: from ...... to Hygiene: from to. History: _ from . to Writing: from . to 8. From these judgments what inferences can you draw as to the problem of classifying 
pupils for work or recitation purposes? 
  
1 For this a given test with which teachers are familiar should be chosen. If the scores 
possible to attain in the test range from zero to 20 or 50 or 100, the test might be a little 
easier to use as a basis for judging other subjects.

1. The need for definite knowledge as to results 
Previous chapters recapitulated. Thus far we have at- 
tempted to set forth, in Part I, the nature of the manage- 
ment problem by a discussion of the meaning and aims of 
education, how the aim functions in practical management, 
and the nature of the different factors with which manage- 
ment has to deal. In Part II these facts and principles were 
brought to bear upon a consideration of the child as the 
central object of management, how he is to be brought into 
contact with school conditions, and the problems of attend- 
ance, order and discipline, punishments, and incentives for 
study. In Part III the machinery and processes by which 
these aims and ideals are to be wrought into concrete changes 
in child life, e.g., how the school is to be organized, the spe- 
cial problems of grading and promotion, the making and 
use of curricula and daily time schedules, and how to direct 
the study and recitation processes, have been treated at
-P-A-G-E-278
  266 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
some length. It remains for us to consider here the ques- 
tion of how we are to know definitely that our machinery 
and processes are turning out actual results. 
Education a process of change. We have been thinking 
so far, to a large extent, in terms of certain biological, 
psychological, sociological, and economic facts and princi- 
ples, and have attempted to lay down fairly definite rules 
of action. Undoubtedly these are the basic sciences upon 
which education must build, but they are not the only sci- 
ences needed. Certainly we are working with phenomena of 
these types, but we are also working with other phenomena 
which are more properly classified as educational. Medicine 
deals with chemical, physiological, anatomical, and hygienic 
phenomena, but when a physician is trying to do a certain 
thing with these phenomena known as doctoring, we refer 
to the facts about this practice as medical phenomena. So 
in education, however much we may know of individual 
nature, and of the social and economic claims upon it, we 
have still to reckon with the phenomena created by the 
attempt of the teacher to direct the growth of the child 
and to prepare him to meet these claims. When we have 
taught a child we have produced a change in him. What is 
the nature and extent of the change? 
Tendency in education away from generalities. For cen- 
turies the world has recognized educational phenomena, and 
has built up splendid philosophies of education, but only 
recently has there been any attempt to speak of the pro- 
ducts of school training in any save the most general terms. 
We say we are training the child with respect to memory, 
reason, morals; that this pupil is doing well, that one better; 
and that this one shows refinement, culture, or polish. Only 
recently, though, have we frankly faced the question — 
What is the nature and extent of these various products 
which we call education?
-P-A-G-E-279
TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 267 
This new attitude has been brought about by the in- 
creasing complexities which have been forced upon the 
school as a result of the vast economic and social changes of 
the past few decades. The cost and the importance of 
education have become too great to be any longer entrusted 
to haphazard methods, and as a consequence the school has 
been compelled to learn how to take stock of its achieve- 
ments, and as far as possible to do so in quantitative 
terms. 
The movement has been slow. The teaching profession 
was extremely slow to appreciate and to respond to this 
need. Scientific method made headway in every phase of 
, commerce, industry, and farming before it was applied to 
education. But as the new studies and new activities and 
aims began to find place in the school, the problem of evalu- 
ating each new item was forced upon us, so that no choice 
was left but to try to say what each was worth. It was in 
the midst of these conditions that a new type of educational 
leadership was developed, which set for itself the task of 
applying scientific method to the measurement of educa- 
tional processes and products. 
2. The things to be measured 
Membership in the group. We say that education means 
physical, social, and moral efficiency, and that to educate 
means to produce changes in the individual to these ends. 
If this is to be accomplished the child must first of all be- 
come a member of the school group. How shall we know 
when this has been accomplished? The fact that John 
causes us no trouble, that he is quiet and studious, that he 
plays with the other children, does not tell us. Let us ask 
rather: Is he polite, gentle, and generous in his relationship 
to others? and then answer by citing specific instances of his 
politeness, gentility, and generosity, or cases where he failed 
   
-P-A-G-E-280
    268 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
in these respects. Does he codperate readily and effectively 
in group work and group play? If so, not only does he know 
how to keep his place in line, to be a good member of a team 
at play, to fill his place in the dramatized recitation, to keep 
his part of the room neat and orderly, to help collect and 
distribute materials, but he does these things promptly and 
accurately. Is he learning to lead as well as to follow the 
group? If so he suggests games to be played, gets him- 
self chosen as a leader, occasionally brings public opinion | 
of the group to bear upon an unruly member, and gives 
directions, not orders. It is the answer to these and a 
thousand other specific questions that definitely defines a 
child’s membership in his group. 
Attendance and discipline. We say the child must attend 
school regularly. What percentage of the full time does that 
mean, not only on the average for the entire class, but for 
each pupil as well? What is the influence of a given degree 
of irregularity in attendance upon work in arithmetic or his- 
tory? Are the retarded children regular or irregular in 
attendance? 
Maintaining good order and punishing offenders have 
always been regarded as essential. Does the “pin-fall” 
type of order produce real freedom for work, or is it repres- 
sive? Cite cases to illustrate. For each case of disorder, 
try to state whether it was due to lack of knowledge, for- 
getfulness, mischief, or malice. What effect has the case 
on the offender and on the class? Exactly how should it be 
dealt with? 
Interestin work. We say the work of the school should be 
interesting, but how often do we try to find out exactly why 
a child is more interested in one subject than in another? 
We often say that this is a more interesting subject than 
that. We should try to find out why it is. Why is the 
multiplication table interesting to one pupil and not to
-P-A-G-E-281
  TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 269 
another? If one pupil can find an incentive for studying 
grammar, then we should study that child to find out what 
the incentive is, and try to use it elsewhere. 
School machinery. We insist upon reducing certain 
school practicestoroutine. Just how much timeis consumed 
in getting the children into and out of the building, in col- 
lecting and distributing wraps and supplies, and with what 
regularity are such standards maintained? To what extent 
are habits of neatness with regard to desks established, when 
judged by the number of daily reminders to delinquents? 
We spend much time and worry over promotions. Just 
how accurately is each pupil classified in each of his sub- 
jects? Whenever he is much ahead of his class he is losing 
time, and when he is too much behind he is working under 
a handicap. 
So we could go on almost indefinitely inquiring about the 
curriculum and the daily program, handling the study and 
recitation processes, and asking specific questions, answers 
to which describe or define in concrete, often in quantitative 
terms, some particular activity which the school aims to 
perfect. The more one tries to bring the customary general 
aims of culture, and moral development, down to where 
they can be thought of in terms of what they do, and of 
what it takes to produce them — that is, in terms of what 
is actually going on in the school — the more one is con- 
vinced that there are very few educational results or pro- 
ducts that cannot be measured rather definitely, for after 
all culture and moral efficiency are more than vague 
qualities of soul. They are practical modes of behavior, 
which rest upon innumerable specific habits and innumer- 
able bits of knowledge, all of which can in most cases be 
singled out and measured. What children have learned 
must show somewhere in their behavior. If it does not, 
then no evidence exists that they have learned it. If a child 
   
-P-A-G-E-282
  
  270 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
has improved in writing he writes better than he did before; 
if he has improved in attendance, figures will show how 
much; if he has improved in leadership he will be seen direct- 
ing others in play, and offering suggestions about how to 
dramatize the lesson or how to find some new facts about 
the habits of the frog that is under discussion in nature 
study. Most of these things that go to make up culture, or 
physical, social, intellectual, and moral efficiency, are not so 
very vague when we come to look for them in these forms. 
A quantitative viewpoint essential. It must not be as- 
sumed that we have suitable instruments, as yet, for 
measuring the progress of pupils in all these things. This 
does not mean, however, that we cannot study the results 
of these types of training in a more or less objective way. 
While at many points it is not yet possible to state how much 
product we have, it is possible in almost every particular to 
find objective evidence that some amount of progress has 
or has not been made. It is this quantitative viewpoint 
that we desire to emphasize as indispensable in modern 
management. Once we arrive at the point where we quit 
assuming that the effects of teaching are mostly spiritual 
and intangible, and therefore vague and unmeasurable, and 
accept the idea that we are trying through instruction 
to make definite changes in the children, we shall be in a 
mood to look for some evidence of the change sought. Once 
we find that change has been effected, we shall have no great 
trouble in distinguishing between little and much of the 
thing we find. 
This is a first important step toward the development of a 
measuring instrument. Our first reminder to the teacher 
is, then: Hold yourself responsible for having an objective 
view of your work; organize and direct your children to some 
end; know exactly what that end is to be; make sure you are 
able to recognize it when it has been achieved; try to dis-
-P-A-G-E-283
  TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 271 
   
         
    
                              
   
      tinguish between much and little achievement; and if 
possible find a means of measuring the amount accomplished 
and of speaking in terms of it. This plan, it must be remem- 
bered, applies not merely to studies alone, but to the whole 
of the child’s life and activities in school, and to the ma- 
chinery, methods, and devices used by the teacher. 
3. The means for measuring these results 
Records and reports. Until recently the supervisor has 
seldom asked the teacher to report on more than two or 
three things that are not directly connected with children’s 
studies. He asked for records of attendance, punishments, 
and progress in studies. The formal examination was used 
for measuring the last named, while the bare figures from 
the daily register told of attendance and punishments. To- 
day, however, we wish to measure all the wide variety of 
processes and results of which those suggested above are 
but typical. For this purpose the examination is still use- 
ful, but, in addition, careful records of many things not 
reached by ordinary examinations are being kept, and from 
these records standards and norms are being worked out by 
means of which the teacher may quickly and effectively 
determine the progress her pupils are making. To these 
two means there is to be added — perhaps most effective of 
all — the standardized tests and scales. To use any one of 
these effectively the teacher must understand it, know where 
and when to use it, and the significance of the results obtained. 
The examination as a means of measurement. Though 
susceptible of many abuses, the old type of examination can 
serve two important functions in teaching. In the first 
place, it can be made to test results of teaching as they ap- 
pear in the forms of habits and knowledge. In the second 
place, it has a rather definite educative value in itself. 
As a test of a child’s skill or knowledge the examination  
-P-A-G-E-284
  272 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
is designed to find out what the child does not know about 
the subject, in order that the question of what next to teach 
may be dealt with. In this the examination is distinguished 
from the informal test, given as a part of the ordinary reci- 
tation, where the aim is to bring to light and to clear up the 
temporary difficulties within a certain narrow field. The 
examination is exhaustive, and its results are a measure quite 
as fully of the final effectiveness of the teacher’s work as of 
the children’s study. 
The educative value of such experience lies in the fact 
that it furnishes a motive (though not the best) for carrying 
important processes to a higher degree of perfection, and for 
making a more careful organization of the essential facts. 
In focusing attention upon these things the child not only 
learns what it is important he should learn, but receives 
training in how to get at the essential points in his studies. 
Criteria as to examinations. The teacher needs to know 
how to conduct examinations that will achieve these results. 
For this there are at least a few criteria which may be uni- 
versally followed. First of all, one should decide exactly 
what the examination is to find out, and then formulate the 
questions to those ends. In most examinations there will 
be two, and in some, three, types of questions. All examina- 
tions will call for facts or information, and for the interpre- 
tation or application of those facts, and in some studies 
there will be questions involving execution. Overemphasis 
on any one type of examination is entirely possible. The 
questions should always be clearly stated, and the test 
should cover the entire field. Examinations should never be 
held over a class as a threat, nor should their results be used 
as the sole basis for deciding the classification of children. 
The examination should not replace the briefer and more 
frequent test. Finally, it should ordinarily be in writing, 
and the class should know that it is coming.
-P-A-G-E-285
TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 273 
Defects in examination tests. There are important diffi- 
culties in the way of using examinations, some of which lie 
in the fact that the questions are too often not formulated 
according to these criteria. 
1. Questions are too often merely factual, and so test the 
child’s memory only, or they ask for too many unimportant 
details. 
2. The examination is often made too long, or too diffi- 
cult, or too easy. If too long or too difficult it tends to dis- 
courage the class, and if too easy it does not really test. 
3. The real point at which the examination falls short is 
in the fact that it furnishes no adequate basis for com- 
parison of results between classes, or from year to year, for 
the reason that there is no common standard to apply in 
reading papers. Teachers usually suppose that they can 
mark a set of papers all on the same basis, but investigation 
has shown that this is not at all true.! 
Variability in marking illustrated. For example, Starch 
and Elliott had a high-school student solve a simple problem 
in plane geometry and gave his answer to forty-nine compe- 
tent geometry teachers to grade on the scale of 0 to 12. 
Their grades were as follows: 
9 gave it 0 6 gave it 6 
1 gave it 2 2 gave it 64 
2 gave it 3 4 gave it 7 
6 gave it 4 1 gave it 8 
2 gave it 44 2 gave it 9 
* 10 gave it 5 1 gave it 10 
2 gave it 54 1 gave it 12% 
The range here — even in the case of an exact problem in 
1 Starch and Elliott, “Reliability of the Grading of High-School Work 
in English”; in School Review, vol. xx, pp. 442-57; “Reliability of Grading 
Work in Mathematics,” cbid., vol. xx1, pp. 254-59; “Reliability of Grading 
Work in History,” ibid., vol. xx1, pp. 676-81. 
 
-P-A-G-E-286

geometry — is from zero to perfect. It is clearly evident 
that these forty-nine teachers were looking at very different 
aspects of that paper. Some looked at the form, some at the 
spelling, some at carelessness, some at the amount of abso- 
lute accuracy, some gave it the advantage of the doubt. 
An examination of these studies by Starch and Elliott must 
fully convince us that the results of ordinary examinations 
cannot serve as an adequate basis for promotion, or for the 
comparison of one school or class with another. With the 
growing complexity of our educational problems such com- 
parisons are absolutely essential, otherwise sixth-grade 
ability in one school cannot mean sixth-grade ability in 
another. Every one who has seen children enter a school 
from some other city or district knows of the frequency with 
which they have to be entirely reclassified, and that because 
grade two or grade five in one school was not the same as 
grade two or grade five in another. Nor can they ever be 
until we find a more definite standard for measuring the re- 
sults of school work. 
The new type of written examination. Recent attempts 
to overcome the generally recognized weaknesses of the old- 
type examination have led to the improvements with which 
the teacher should be familiar. What is needed is a type of 
examination that will give a reliable test and furnish a basis 
for comparing pupils, classes, and schools. To accomplish 
this two general types of examination questions have been 
devised. One requires that the child recall something, or 
express an opinion or attitude or judgment. The other re- 
quires that the child be able to recognize a right or best 
answer when he finds it among a large number of possible 
answers. 
1. The recall type. Several different varieties of questions 
have been developed in conformance with each of these two 
types. For example, under the first type we have the simple 
recall type of question such as:
-P-A-G-E-287
  TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 275 
1. The name of the inventor of the sewing machine was ...... ? 
2. The author of Evangeline was ...... ? 
8. The names of the candidates for the presidency in 1860 
were ...... ? 
4, The normal height and weight of a boy 10 years oldis ...... r. 
A somewhat more definite form for the recall type is the 
completion type of question, such as: 
1. The legislative power of the Federal Government is vested 
Maes ces consisting of ...... houses, the one called 
PES? , the other called ....... 
2. The Constitution of the United States, adopted in ...... ; 
consists ofa ...... » followed by ...... articles and ...... 
amendments, the last three of which concern ...... > and 
aa es BN... Sonses 
2. Selecting-the-right-answer type. Of the second type we 
have the true-false form of answer, such as: 
1. Shakespeare and Longfellow were contemporaries. 
True Faise 
2. Frogs and lizards are reptiles. True False 
8. An adjective is a word that describes or defines. 
True False 
Similar to this is the multiple-response form of question, 
such as: 
1. A falling barometer suggests: clear, rainy, windy, cold, hot 
weather. 
2. When food is suspected of containing dangerous bacteria we 
should keep it warm, keep it cool, freeze it, raise it to a very 
high temperature, dry it out in a dark place, or else not use it. 
Another form of the multiple-response variety, called the 
best-answer type of the question, is also popular, such as: 
1. The planet whose orbit is nearest to the orbit of the earth is: 
Venus 
. .Mars 
Neptune 
   
-P-A-G-E-288
  276 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
2. Which of the following amendments to the Federal Consti- 
tution is most recent? 
the one affecting women’s suffrage 
the one affecting liquor 
the one affecting freedom of speeah and of the press 
  A third form of the multiple-response question is seen in 
the matching-exercise question, where the pupil is asked to 
indicate which of a group of names or events goes with each 
of a group of dates. 
For example: Number the following events so that each 
will correspond to the proper date. 
1. 1492 emancipation of slavery 
2. 1789 . discovery of America by Columbus 
3. 1862 . United States Constitution established 
4, 1898 Abraham Lincoln born 
5. 1845 Louisiana Purchase 
6. 1803 . -Texas became a State 
7. 1809 United States intervention in Cuba 
  Other forms of this type of test are matching men with 
movements or events, genus with species, words of like or 
opposite meaning, and many others. 
The advantages of such examinations. These brief il- 
lustrations of the form in which questions can be prepared 
will serve to show certain advantages of this kind of ex~ 
aminations. First, it will be seen that there is nothing 
vague or indefinite about these questions. They call for 
specific knowledge, and so are more objective than the old- 
type examinations. This means that comparisons of the 
results are much more dependable. This is an advantage of 
great importance. 
Second, while it takes more work to prepare a set of 
questions in these forms, yet very much more can be put 
into an examination of this sort because the time required 
for writing answers is greatly reduced. Incidentally, too, 
the work of scoring is made very simple.
-P-A-G-E-289
  TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 277 
4. The use of standardized scales and tests 
Our need for accurate measures. Even with the added 
eccuracy of measures as made by such examinations, we do 
not have in such tests an instrument that is perfect for all 
purposes. Aside from the fact that education is an indi- 
vidual matter the matter of individual differences is the 
largest consideration with which the teacher has to deal. 
Practically everything depends upon the teacher’s ability, 
first, to understand these differences, and second, to organize 
and direct her work in a way that recognizes their signifi- 
cance. In large amounts many of them are easily recog- 
nized. Differences in height, weight, age, complexion, 
health, agility, physical strength, enthusiasm, mentality, 
knowledge, skill, language, manners, voice, willingness to 
work, moral stability, carriage, and posture are readily 
noticeable in any group of school children, if one will look 
for them. 
The recognition of these differences is not a new thing in 
education. The oldest treatises and comments that we 
have on education recognized such differences, and to some 
extent recognized that they were educationally significant. 
It is only recently, however, that we have faced two very 
important points about them. First, what is the nature 
and extent of these differences; and second, how must the 
school recognize them? 
Studies of their nature and extent have been going on for 
many years, and very intensively in recent years. The re- 
sults of these studies have helped us to realize that some dif- 
ferences are innate and not removable, while others are due 
to differences in environment, care, and training, and can be 
reduced or possibly removed. A second very important 
aspect of these studies has had to do with the development 
of devices for measuring the amounts of these differences. 
We now have the mental tests for measuring amounts of 
   
-P-A-G-E-290
  278 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
native intelligence; achievement tests for measuring amounts 
of acquired knowledge or skills; and physical and physio- 
logical tests for measuring health and physique. 
The object of all these studies of individual differences, 
their nature and amount, is that we may intelligently shape 
our scheme of education. The school should stop trying to 
do things to children which nature has made impossible. 
We should adjust the scheme of training to the limits that 
nature has set. This statement has an even wider implica- 
tion, namely, that for doing the things education can do 
there is a best way, a way that runs least in conflict and 
most in harmony with nature. 
Differences that are readily observed are large differences 
— differences that we are forced to recognize in manage- 
ment. For example, John is so much duller mentally than 
his classmates that he does not understand an assignment. 
The teacher cannot fail to see this. James, however, is 
also dull, though not so dull as John. The teacher does not 
sense this. James vaguely feels it and for a time struggles 
against the odds. As he gradually fails, the teacher thinks 
that he is lazy and, instead of sympathizing with the boy 
who is trying hard with all the mind nature gave him, urges 
him on, or even punishes him for dereliction. All this be- 
cause the teacher had no way of knowing that James was 
working up to his limit. Henry is a bright boy. He learns 
easily and wastes a part of his time. He causes his teacher 
no anxiety, and so she fails to see how ie is wasting energy 
and acquiring the habit of “‘half-trying.” All this, too, 
because she has no means of recognizing the small differ- 
ence between Henry and the average pupil. 
The teacher’s need for accurate measures. These little 
differences in native intelligence are very real, and differ- 
ences in achievement are quite as real. School machinery 
and methods should be sensitive to both kinds, but they can- 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 279 
not be unless the schools make use of the refined instruments 
of measurement known as mental and achievement tests. 
Let us assume that the teacher is familiar with the best 
tests and that she knows how to use them. When should 
she use them? The answer is: 
1. When she first takes a position the teacher should, as soon as 
possible, get intimately acquainted with her pupils — their 
mental, physical, educational, social, moral, and esthetic 
equipment. If test and other records are available she should 
study them. If not, then she should begin a program of 
study, including the use of tests. She should make careful 
observations of the children at work and at play, noting any 
habits, attitudes, weaknesses, or strengths that may affect 
their success. 
The purpose of these initial studies and observations is to 
learn what the class is capable of doing, basing upon mental- 
ability tests; what they have achieved in their studies, basing 
upon educational tests; what physical defects they have, bas- 
ing upon physical measurements and inspection; what interests 
and attitudes they have toward school work and toward social 
standards, basing on careful observations and checking with 
test results. 
As a result of these surveys the teacher will have located 
any pupil whose classification or grade position is in question. 
Such cases she will take up with the principal. Second, she 
will, by comparing mental with educational scores and check- 
ing with her observations, find what pupils are working up to 
or beyond capacity. She will find the Henry and James, as 
well as the John above referred to, and will take note of each 
in her assignments and in her supervision of study. She will 
locate the need for correcting speech defects, poor language 
habits, poor postures, slovenly personal habits and dress, 
laziness, selfishness, and bad manners. 
2. Mental tests should be repeated where earlier results seem to 
be in doubt. They should be used for new pupils. Where 
reclassification of a pupil is under consideration, whether it be 
with a view to extra promotion or to demotion, special care 
should be exercised, either by repeating the test given earlier 
or by using a different test.
-P-A-G-E-292
  
  280 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
8. Achievement tests should be used at intervals to determme 
progress, to check against grade norms, and as a partial basis 
for determining promotion. 
4. Physical measures should be repeated at intervals in all cases 
where there is evidence of illness, under-nourishment, or 
growing physical defect of any sort. 
Possible abuses of tests. The making of tests has re- 
quired many years of careful scientific work. As school- 
room tools they have very great value when rightly used. 
We must remember, however, that a simple and useful tool 
may be dangerous in the hands of one unfamiliar with its 
nature and purpose. This applies also to tests. As a 
measuring device the test is simple, but its misuse is easily 
possible. Certain misuses seriously vitiate the results, and 
certain others do harm to the children themselves. A few 
cautions to the beginning teacher are in place here, since 
this book cannot offer a lengthy discussion of tests. 
1. No teacher should consider herself equipped for service in a 
modern school who has not some knowledge of the theory of 
tests, and a larger knowledge of how to use tests. This will 
call for more than a casual reading of one or two of the books 
listed at the close of this chapter. The teacher should have a 
thorough college course on the subject. In the absence of 
this she should master such a book as Terman’s The Measure- 
ment of Intelligence or Freeman’s Mental Tests, and at least 
two or three of the recent books on educational tests.! 
2. Tests not given exactly according to instructions are mis- 
used and the results are not to be trusted. The talkative 
teacher must restrain herself when giving tests. The meas- 
ures in the test are based upon the instructions set down, and 
not on a nice chatty explanation which the teacher thinks 
would be better. Also the time limit means what it says, not 
fifteen seconds, or a minute more or less. The teacher who 
really knows something about tests will not try to improve   
1 Suitable selections for this purpose may be made from titles listed at 
the close of this chapter. The volume by Monroe, De Voss, and Kelly will 
prove very helpful. 
 
-P-A-G-E-293
TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 281 
on the author’s prescription for giving them. The surest 
evidence of ignorance is the tendency to disregard the exact 
directions. 
3. What is true of giving tests applies also in scoring them. The 
instructions must be followed exactly as set down. 
4. The teacher must not make a fetish of test results. These 
instruments are not perfect, and if they were they probably 
would not give us measures of all the things that count for 
success in school work. Much less do they cover all that 
counts for success in life. After seeing John’s score in a 
mental test the teacher should not become a fatalist, there- 
fore, and feel that John is doomed to a narrow place in life. 
The fact that John’s I Q is a bit below average does not prove 
that he cannot attain average success. That he probably 
cannot become a Plato is of little consequence. Neither can 
his teacher, nor any one of ten thousand other boys or 
teachers. We need to remember that no small part of the 
world’s work will be done by boys of John’s type. 
5. Pupils should not be made fatalists in this matter either. The 
teacher who purposely imposes such a conception of tests on a 
child and tells him that he is below average, has done an in- 
jury for which dismissal would be too mild a punishment. 
The best rule to follow is, not to give the child or his parents 
the mental-test score. It is enough to tell John that he did 
well, or very well, or that he did only fairly well in the test. 
And no reference need be made to its having been a mental 
test. If the parents want the facts, give them of course, but 
only privately, and with some explanation of the limits of 
their significance. 
6. Finally, give tests only when the results of tests are needed as 
a guide to action. 
7. The public has a right to be a bit critical of tests, for when we 
step into schools we find that grade and class groups do not 
seem to show the homogeneity that should be possible if we 
were really to apply our test results. 
Some things we have learned from the use of tests. 
What the teacher may be expected to accomplish by the use 
of tests may be judged to some degree by what their use has 
brought to light. Tests have been used by experimenters,
-P-A-G-E-294
282 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
by teachers, by executives, by supervisors, and by survey 
experts. From the results we have learned several im- 
portant things. For example, we have learned that the 
children in grade V range in abilities in a given subject to as 
low as average third-grade, and as high as average eighth- 
grade pupils; and, worse yet, this applies to individual 
classes. This wide variation is true of any grade, and in 
any subject for which standard tests have been made. We 
have found, too, that there is a rather high correlation 
between mental-test and achievement-test scores. This 
seems to show that high mentality goes with high achieve- 
ment, which suggests that mental scores ought to be made 
a part of the basis for classifying pupils. In spite of this 
we find in most schools the wide variation above noted. 
Our mental tests have shown us that we have a wide 
variety of mental ability in our schools, and that schools and 
communities vary much in this respect. This seems to 
argue that curricula should be adjusted somewhat in accord 
with these differences. In our best school systems we find 
some effort in this direction, yet in many cases the facts are 
totally ignored. 
We have found that there is some correlation between 
mental scores and delinquency.! If this is true, then the 
schools have a means of making an intelligent hunt for po- 
tential delinquents. If we find them we should be able in 
time to determine whether education can forestall de- 
linquency. 
By our diagnostic subject tests we are able to find quite 
specifically any weaknesses our pupils may have in their 
studies. By this means we are able to learn exactly what 
needs emphasis in teaching. A child shows high speed and 
1See: Miner, J. B. Deficiency and Delinquency; Bronner, Augusta F. 
A Comparative Study of Intelligence of Delinquent Girls; Burt, Cyril. The 
Young Delinquent.
-P-A-G-E-295
  
TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 283 
low quality in writing, or high speed and low comprehension 
in reading. The point for emphasis in instruction is then 
clear. Our present wide variety of tests offers numerous 
refinements of this sort of diagnosis. The question is, Does 
the teacher use these findings? 
Our scales and tests provide a means by which the child 
may check his own progress. Plotting this progress curve is 
not only interesting but decidedly stimulating to a child. 
Likewise these scales and tests furnish a basis for com- 
paring classes, schools, grades, and systems. 
These uses all seem obvious and simple, yet they are new, 
and many teachers have not learned how to follow a test 
through to the end — the end being an actual change in 
organization or method or management. There are now 
available several hundred tests. The number is increasing 
yearly. They are easily available and there is an extensive 
literature on their use, a liberal sample of which is listed at 
the close of this chapter. 
5. Other means of measuring results 
Qualities which are hard to measure. There are many 
features of school work that cannot be checked up by 
ordinary examinations, cr even by the best improved scales 
— such for instance as neatness, the movement of pupils, 
blackboard work, light, temperature of room, spoken lan- 
guage, correct posture, and the influence of tardiness, and ill 
health. To get some check on problems of this character 
is extremely desirable. In one school we find a cast-iron 
system of classroom mechanics, while in another there will 
be nearly the opposite. In one place manners, neatness, and 
correct speech and posture are carefully guarded, while in 
another they receive little or no attention. Some kind of 
standards, even though they may not be applied universally, 
ought to be developed by every teacher for her own use. In
-P-A-G-E-296
  284 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
order to do this she must set about studying the mechanism 
of her school, with a view to working out the very best way 
to operate every detail, and when that best way is found, 
try to develop standards of performance and hold herself 
and her pupils responsible for living up to them. 
To do this the teacher will need to study her own and other 
schools, as well as books and reports. Systematic visiting 
or observing of other schools for the purpose of comparing 
her own practice with theirs is most desirable. From such 
trips the teacher should carry home the best ideas that she 
has gained and try them out in her own work. From books 
and reports of investigations she will gather other facts 
which will help her to perfect her work. In one school she 
will get a new idea about handling wraps or collecting 
papers; in another she will discover a better plan for de- 
veloping neatness in board work or for correcting oral speech; 
in a book on school hygiene she will learn the proper stand- 
ards for ventilation, temperature, light, and seating of chil- 
dren. She will perhaps keep a chart illustrating correct 
sitting and standing positions, and watch to see how rapidly 
she can develop habits in her pupils that will bring them up 
to this standard. 
Desirable schoolroom standards. It is only by being 
everlastingly on the alert for the best and most educative 
methods that one can hope to attain a reasonable degree 
of perfection in these features of school work. When a 
teacher has decided on a method, then the next step is to 
discover the least amount of time the performance should 
consume and set that up as a standard to be maintained. 
When certain efficient monitors have been able to collect 
and distribute supplies or wraps in a given time, then set 
that time as a standard. If James has placed his work on 
the board in a neat and orderly manner, leave it on the board 
a few days, calling attention to that as a standard per- 
   
-P-A-G-E-297
TESTING MACHINERY AND PROCESS 285 
formance. When a child has handed in a neat and orderly 
paper, keep it for future reference. Comparing with past 
records is a good practice for both teacher and pupil. The 
standard for attendance and tardiness should always be 
100 per cent perfect, as it should also be for clean hands and 
faces. 
The main idea to be insisted upon here is that in these 
processes, just as in writing, spelling, and arithmetic, we 
need some definite standards by which to gauge our work. 
Each of these processes plays its part in the sum total of the 
child’s training. Some of them are directly, others indirectly 
educative, but all are important, and it is the teacher’s busi- 
ness to maintain each at its very best. This she can never 
do without an earnest study of her ways, means, and re-

In Part II we were thinking from the point of view of the indi- 
vidual child in order to establish the idea that the school is made 
up of and for individual children. In this part we have thought of 
the child in his relationships to the group, and consequently of the 
problems of group organization and control. How to organize and 
to manage the physical aspects of the school, the children, the cur- 
riculum, the day’s work, the study and recitation processes, and 
finally how to measure the effectiveness of our machinery and the 
processes we have directed, have been our problems. 
In our examination of the necessary machinery of organization 
we have insisted that while the chief purpose of all such machinery 
is to serve as a means, yet there is no reason why much if not all of 
it shall not be in itself educative as well. 
This applies throughout our discussion, but in particular to the 
machinery of grading and promotion, where the educative value 
of group as opposed to individual teaching is especially pointed out. 
This does not mean that individual differences are ignored. Quite 
the opposite, in fact, for the most essential of these differences are 
made the basis of the grouping; and flexibility of the plan, in terms 
of these differences, is likewise provided for. 
Tn discussing the organization of the curriculum we have pointed 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  286 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
out the distinction between the traditional and the modern course 
of study, showing that to-day social and pedagogical principles 
determine our selection and organization of materials, and that as 
a consequence the curriculum is not only thoroughly elastic but is 
in a constant process of remaking. 
Our study of the daily program was designed to clarify the 
principles involved in organizing the day’s work, and to illustrate 
their application in typical situations. The problem of evaluating 
subjects, of programming studies in terms of their bearing upon 
the question of fatigue, and the advantages of carefully planned 
work were discussed as they enter into the practical tasks of the 
day. 
In outlining plans for managing the group at study special 
emphasis was laid upon the idea of study outside as well as inside 
the school, the purpose being to establish the largest possible num- 
ber of specific work habits. The problems of assignment, study, 
and recitation were differentiated, and special stress was laid, first, 
upon setting the class to work at specific problems, and seeing to 
it that they had a real motive for study; and second, upon directing 
them in methods of finding, organizing, and verifying facts. 
The management of the recitation is the real test of teaching 
efficiency. The teaching aim and the aim of the learner must be 
clear, and plans must be devised for their attainment. The child’s 
methods of work and the character of his response are to be the 
teacher’s cue for giving directions. Testing is not to replace teach- 
ing, drill is not to be overworked, the teacher is to learn the art of 
listening and to avoid telling when a mere suggestion will suffice, 
and children are not to depend solely upon textbooks. 
Finally, we have discussed the whole question of measuring the 
efficiency of school work. Its importance, the wide variety of pro- 
cesses and products to be measured, and methods and devices for 
measuring them were outlined. Special emphasis was placed upon 
the practical importance of statistical ways of stating values, and 
upon the use of scientific standards and scales. 
If the teacher will supplement what has been so briefly presented 
in these chapters with further reading, and especially with careful 
observation of her own work, it is believed that the machinery of 
school management will take on a new meaning.

1. The Problem of Part IV 
The teacher and the task. It would seem that there is 
no reward too great for society to pay to the man or woman 
who is competent to bring to a practical realization in 
the school the ideas and principles which have been set 
forth above. The teacher who can understand and appre- 
ciate child life, and who can devise a scheme of organiza- 
tion and management such that a natural and normal 
educative process will result, will have rendered to the 
children individually and to the state a service for which 
neither can ever fully compensate. The task which has been 
sketched out here at some length is by no means a simple 
one. From the standpoint of hard work, from the stand- 
point of the technical knowledge and skill demanded, as well 
as from the standpoint of the higher human values involved, 
it is a task worthy of the very best men and women we have. 
The personal question. What kind of man or woman 
must I be if I would enter this field of work? is the ques- 
tion every teacher should ask herself... What kind of man 
1 The practical importance of personality in the teacher’s equipment has 
been brought out by numerous investigations, all of which have shown
-P-A-G-E-306
  294 CLASSROOM ORG. ' ZATION 
or woman would the state have me be? Even if these ques- 
tions could be fully answered, wl ich they cannot be, it is 
doubtful if our ideal teacher would ever be found. Yet it 
is worth while to try to set forth at least some of the essen- 
tial elements without which a reasonable hope of success 
is impossible, for after all it is only by knowing what it is 
we wish to attain that we are able to work intelligently 
toward its attainment. It is merely another case of attempt- 
ing to set up a clear aim and to establish a standard or basis 
for measuring our own efficiency. 
There are at least five of the larger aspects of this pro- 
blem which are worth considering here. First, the teacher’s 
personality, which every one would set down as of the very 
first importance; second, the question of her professional 
qualifications and growth; third, her health and physical 
vigor; fourth, her relationship to the problems of super- 
vision, and fifth, her relationships with all others with whom 
she must work and her ways of handling the details of her 
daily tasks. These we shall treat, in order, in the five 
chapters of this last Part. 
2. The meaning of personality 
The nature of personality. It is not necessary here to 
enter upon a philosophical discussion of personality, or to 
seek for a very exact definition of the term. We all use 
the word constantly, and know roughly and for practical 
purposes what it means. We think of personality as some 
thing we possess. We say of a man that he possesses, or has, 
a good or a poor personality, and commonly include in the 
term all that goes to make up what the man really means 
tous. If his worth is great in our opinion, then we believe 
conclusively that a strong personality is one of the chief elements in suc+ 
cess. For a résumé of such studies see Fourteenth Year Book of the National 
Society for the Study of Education, part 1.

THE TEACHER’S PERSONALITY 295 
him to be thoroughly trustworthy in every way, and, in 
addition, that he is energetic, cheerful, aggressive, and 
above all gentle, manly, and clean. On the other hand, the 
grouch, the chronic complainer, the man without a pro- 
gram or an aspiration, the slouchy and ill-mannered man, 
is repulsive to us, and we say his personality is weak or 
disagreeable. 
Our first concern is with the extent to which this posses- 
sion is inherited or acquired. Such a question cannot be 
examined at any length here, but we should keep in mind 
one thing, viz.: that whatever we may possess by inherit- 
ance must undergo a process of development. Biological 
investigations show that environmental factors furnish 
the conditions in which this development takes place, and 
modify, at least to some extent, the course of development. 
So even if we cannot determine what characteristics we 
shall inherit, we can to a large extent control the environ- 
ment in which our development shall take place, which is 
to say that if we choose to do so we can improve our per- 
sonalities. This is the all important point here for us, for 
if improvement were not possible then any discussion of 
the subject would be superfluous. 
What, then, is our problem? To what specific ends shall 
we exercise this control over our surroundings? What traits 
or qualities of our personal make-up shall we attempt to 
cultivate? These are questions which every teacher should 
seriously put to herself and try seriously to answer in terms 
of well-established habits, attitudes, and ideals. 
Positive and negative types. We are all familiar with 
people belonging to two general types of personalities, the 
positive and the negative. The possessor of the one type 
| is an executive, a director of affairs; that of the other is a 
follower, who merely fits into another man’s program. The 
one knows how to make a decision, while'the other stands 
   
-P-A-G-E-308
  296 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
forever in doubt. In an argument the one goes straight to 
the point, dealing only with essentials, while the other 
qualifies and requalifies every statement until finally he has 
drifted quite clear of the main issue. The one ventures 
something in life; the other is afraid of risk, waits till the 
fight is won before he is quite sure which side he believes in 
then, unconscious of his own weakness, he tries to ride to 
victory. The one believes in something and knows it; if the 
other has any serious convictions he does not seem to kno 
it. When the one reads or travels he gains in power, fou 
with him to know means to act. His knowledge is dynamic. 
With the other knowledge means at best accumulated in- 
formation only. The one possesses self-confidence, and in- 
spires others with a belief in his ability to lead; the opinion 
of the other is rarely offered or asked, and never followed. 
The one lays plans for action, and turns up a chance for 
himself in life; the other follows the beaten path, and waits 
for his chance to turn up. So one might draw an endless 
number of similar illustrations from practical life, and 
everywhere it would be the same picture of energy, courage, 
conviction, and action, versus weakness, indecision, and 
inertia. 
Positive and negative teachers. To be sure this illus- 
trates the extremes of the two types, but they are not un- 
familiar pictures to any of us. We know them both in the 
political world; we know them in business; we know them 
in religion; we know them in social work; we know them in 
law, in medicine, and in teaching. The-positive type in the 
schoolroom rarely sends a case_of discipline to her principal. 
She is not afraid to i know. 
Work is not drifting in her room, it is going per schedule. 
Her classes in civics learn what is going on at the city hall, 
and are familiar with the practical problems of their own 
city, district, or county government. The positive.teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-309
  
THE ce PERSONALITY 297 
is industrious, becomes a pai of her community, at is 
sought after by other communities. On the other hand, the 
negative type of teacher is-constantly consulting her princi- 
pal about trifling details, and expects him to take care of all 
cases of discipline. She dodges the child’s question rather 
than admit that she does not know. The program in her 
room is either ironclad, or the other extreme. Her class in 
civics will know the term “mayor,” but not what their own 
mayor is doing. Such a teacher dreads the visit of the prin- 
cipal or the parent, and seldom makes a serious impress as 
a member of her community. 
Frankness and sincerity. The essential.qualities of a 
good personality. must-include frankness and sincerity. We 
like the man or woman who is frank and honest, and we dis- 
like the poser. The one inspires confidence, the other 
mistrust. The advice of the one will be listened to even by 
his enemies, but not so that of the other. Men such as 
Lincoln and Gladstone, who have been universally loved and 
trusted even by their enemies, were not shammers or palav- 
erers, or namby-pambys or make-believes. They worked, 
and, when necessary, fought, in the open. Sincerity implies 
loyalty. Without loyalty to high purpose and to the policy 
of superior school officers, a teacher is not only personally 
miserable but utterly impossible as a part of the institution. 
Sincerity also implies courage, and the man who has the 
courage ‘of his Convictions is respected, even though his 
convictions may be wrong. The.sincere-teacher_isthe one 
who is impartial in her work with children. She does not 
try. to blufforfrighten. If she disagrees with an order from 
her principal she may protest, but if so it will be openly to 
him and not complainingly to her pupils or fellow teachers. 
In any case she will carry out the order to the best of her 
ability. 
       
-P-A-G-E-310
  298 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
Sympathy. Calm and intelligent sympathy, as opposed 
to mere sentimentalism, is for the teacher, more perhaps 
than for the soldier or business man, a quality of personality 
which is indispensable. The teacher’s business is not merel 
to accumulate information, but to impart it to others. This 
means that she must enter most intimately into the lives 
of others. She cannot do that without the ability to put 
herself in another’s place, to think and feel as her various 
children think and feel. Nothing demands a keener insight 
and imagination, and a greater amount of self-forgetfulness, 
than the claims of a room or playground full of children. 
some of whom are strong and some weak, some happy an 
some sad, some from good homes and some from poor ones, 
some aggressive and some bashful and afraid, and each with 
his own little likes and dislikes, his own little victories an 
defeats. To be able and ever ready to put one’s self in an: 
one of these thousand possible positions is to possess tha’ 
invaluable human quality we call sympathy, which is 
substantial element in leadership. 
Tact. The man who has a ready power for appreciating 
and doing or saying the thing which circumstances require 
has a peculiar power of discernment, a discriminating sense. 
a mental touch, that will tide him over many difficulties 
in life, and smooth for others the social path which their 
own uncouthness has ruffled. Between this power and the 
power to deceive there is a wide gulf. Tact is not hypocrisy: 
or cant, or insincerity; it is not the power to evade, or dis- 
tort, or pretend; it is not craftiness, or cunning, or trickery 
Tact is good sense and keen insight and quick decision at 
work in critical places making needed adjustments. It is diplo- 
macy in a wholesome sense, it is a swift application of the 
principles of mediation, and it forces others to speak or act. 
with discretion. It is quick, accurate, and skillful self- 
direction. It is clean strategy.   
 
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE TEACHER’S PERSONALITY 299 
If such qualities are essential in business and politics they 
are more than important in teaching. The teacher is pri- 
marily an adjuster. She stands between the child and the 
future citizen, between the home and the State. She must 
meet children, parents, school trustees, superintendents, 
principals, and educational meddlers. She cannot do this 
if she is not quick to sense discord and skillful in applying 
the needed adjustment. 
Self-sacrifice. Another element in personality that is 
always admired is a willingness to serve without praise. 
Schiller declared that ingratitude is the world’s pay, and 
that is very often true in the kind of service a teacher must 
render. ‘To be generous without praise is not easy, when so 
many men seem to win by egotism and self-advertising. We 
know of course that a quack wins by the method of blatant 
self-advertising; but we know, too, that few if any of our 
really great men have won their way to fame by such 
methods. It is not the person who seeks martyrdom, either, 
that we have in mind. Franklin once said that after he had 
tried hard to overcome his pride and to discipline himself 
to be humble, he was surprised to discover that he was 
proud of his humility. It is in such ways that people often 
deceive themselves and only feign self-sacrifice. This is the 
cheapest sort of posing. Theemphasis must be upon service. 
If something needs to be done, do it, not to be seen, but in 
order that life somewhere may be better. 
However, as genuine self-sacrifice does not mean humble- 
ness for its own sake, neither does it mean that we shall go 
to the extreme of forgetting self entirely. We are not true 
to society in a large sense when we fail to treat ourselves as 
well as we treat others. While we are giving freely of our 
time and energy to lift others to a higher plane of living, we 
must not forget that the obligation to lift ourselves is quite 
as great. It is sometimes easier to let a child go home disap- 
   
-P-A-G-E-312
300 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
pointed and discouraged than it is to help him over his little 
mountain of trouble. It is sometimes easier to allow our 
minds to go wool-gathering by the open fireside, than to 
force them to spend the evening in solid work. Society 
wants both these needs to be met. The one involves com- 
plete self-forgetfulness, the other forgetfulness of the nar- 
rower self only. In a very real sense they are equally un- 
selfish and important. 
Optimism. However honest and self-sacrificing a man 
may be, if he is not optimistic, if he does not thoroughly be- 
lieve in humanity and in himself, if he has no enthusiasm, 
then he should have no part in directing the training of chil- 
dren. Building air-castles may seem a fruitless enterprise, 
and so it is so far as its influence on the landscape is con- 
cerned, but to the builder it means everything. To him it is 
essentially a process of self-development and self-realization. 
The optimist trusts himself and trusts others. The pessi- 
mist thinks the world “‘has it in for him,” and doubts the 
good intentions even of his friends. The optimist fights for a 
better city government, while the pessimist sits and com- 
plains of the present bad one. Everywhere it is the optimist 
who proposes a plan of action, to which, from his cave 
of despair, the pessimist expresses a doubt as to its feasi- 
bility. 
The schoolroom is no place for the man or woman who is 
forever crossing a Slough of Despond. It is no place for the 
chronic grouch to chant his tales of woe. A pessimist is 
rarely constructive. He is never ready to codperate cheer- 
fully — to him the world is all dark brown. In the school- 
room we need leaders, men and women who are looking up, 
not down, who are glad they are living, who have a sense of 
humor and can smile at difficulties. We need men and 
women who can understand and apply Stevenson’s recipe 
for joyousness, which tells us to “Take the old world by the 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
EC Ee NEE ee ee a a ee 
THE TEACHER’S PERSONALITY 301 
hand and frolic with it.”” Only such people are wholesome 
companions and leaders for children. 
3. Making the personality effective 
Ge reeding. The above elements of personality may 
not be mutually exclusive at every point, and they may 
not be fully comprehensive of all we sometimes mean by 
the term, but without them the teacher would be handi- 
capped in a fundamental way. On the other hand, a teacher 
may possess them all in good degree and still fall short of 
being our ideal teacher for want of skill in their use, for want 
of those simple acquisitions implied in the terms “good 
breeding,” “good manners,” “address,” etc. In his discus- 
sion of the education of a gentleman, Locke states the im- 
portance of these in forceful language when he says: “Breed- 
ing is that which sets a gloss upon all his other good qualities, 
and renders them useful to him, in procuring him the esteem 
and good will of all that he comes near”; and again: “Virtue 
and parts, though they are allowed their due commendation, 
yet are not enough to procure a man a good reception, and 
make him welcome wherever he comes.” ! 
To be a “plain blunt man” does not mean to lack refine- 
ment; nor, on the other hand, do elegance of manner, dress, 
carriage, and conversation imply a lack of force and direct- 
ness in character. To make our solid virtues count, to get 
results with all the good there is in us, we must have an 
open sesame to our social world, to the world of men and 
women; and that open sesame is to a large extent knowledge 
of social standafds in these things, and skill in their use. 
Personal appéarance. Teachers who do not appear well, 
whose clothes’are not in good taste, whose hair, teeth, and 
nails are not well cared for, men who do not shave daily, are 
at a great disadvantage in applying for positions, and also 
1 Locke, John, Some Thoughts Concerning Education. 
 
-P-A-G-E-314

in keeping them.! These are evidences of lack of gentility, 
and they can never pass unnoticed. Cleanliness and good 
taste in dress are fairly good symptoms of clean morals and 
a habit of using clean language, and always mark the genteel, 
the socialized individual. 
ood manners. There is much less of the ceremonial in 
the manners and customs of to-day than there was in the 
age of chivalry. Democracy in government has brought 
with it even greater democracy in social relationships, but 
there is still a social code which has become a fixed mode of 
procedure for all, and to ignore it is to be labeled as ill- 
mannered. For a lady there is no better insurance against 
insult than correct manners, nor for man or woman is there 
a better key to the confidence of those whom they would 
influence. We cannot all be familiar with the etiquette of 
international diplomacy, but we can and must know how to 
meet people, and how to entertain and be entertained. We 
must know the etiquette of the parlor, the dining room, the 
theater, the church, and the street. 
Conversation. To be able to converse pleasantly and in- 
telligently is almost a prerequisite in any position of leader- 
ship, and a little study of the simple principles of conversa- 
tion is not a frivolous occupation for a teacher. There can 
be no pleasure or profit, either, in a conversation which does 
not hinge upon a common interest, and to be able to dis- 
cover that arousing and holding interest is the very begin- 
ning of skill in conversation. The teacher, the business man, 
the insurance man, and the socialist are four people who will 
do well to remember that the line of least resistance for them 
1 By an investigation of the “Characteristics of the Best Teachers 
Recognized by Children,” Kratz found that in every grade except one, more 
than fifty per cent of the children referred to the dress and personal appear- 
ance of the teacher as among the most important characteristics. H. E. 
Kratz, Studies and Observations in the Schoolroom (Boston Educational 
Publishing Company, 1907), chap, v.
-P-A-G-E-315
  THE TEACHER’S PERSONALITY 303 
— which is inevitably “talking shop” — is not always the 
route that leads to that interest. Again, a conversation will 
be unpleasant if dominated entirely by one person. Some 
people try always to lead the conversation. Such a person 
should frequently practice the art of following instead. In 
following one can contribute without being a mere namby- 
pamby. If the conversation is about a matter of business, 
then directness and brevity are the first essentials. Speech- 
making, gossip, and cheap wit are everywhere evidence of 
boorishness. It is far better to be simple and frank, and to 
talk about only such things as we know about, for then we 
rule out the overdramatic, the chatter, and the small talk, 
and leave plenty of room for real brilliancy, genuine wit, 
and true social intercourse. 
[eons English. Correct English is essentially a part of 
ood manners and good conversation, and needs to be men- 
tioned here not only for its importance in these respects, 
but for its business and professional value as well. A very 
large percentage of written applications go into the waste- 
basket because they are poorly worded. That means that 
the world regards skill in written expression as an index to 
character and training in general. This is a plain but sig- 
nificant fact which the teacher cannot ignore. Clear and 
forceful English, either written or spoken, has a force and a 
charm that cannot be denied. President Wilson’s reply to 
the peace proposals of the Pope was a subject of comment the 
world over, not only because he restated clearly the position 
of the United States in the great world war, or because he 
answered an important communication with plain facts, but 
also because he couched his answer in the choicest of Eng- 
lish. As one reads that letter he can fairly feel the heart 
throb of our democracy, so clear is the thought, so forceful 
and direct are the words, so delicate and refined is the 
phraseology. The teacher has constant need for this instru-

ment of good English, and constant opportunity to broaden 
her power to serve as she develops skill in its use. Probably 
no one accomplishment, after good manners, counts for so 
much with a teacher as the ability to express herself in clear 
id forceful English. 
th good voice. The teacher is so constantly engaged in 
talking that it seems almost trite to suggest here the im- 
portance of a good voice.! And it would be if it were not 
true that one general criticism of teachers is that they have 
disagreeable, raspy voices. There is no doubt that children 
as well as adults are distracted and annoyed by nervous, 
throaty tones. Nervous, mental, or bodily fatigue is likely 
to show first of all in one’s voice. The voice will be pitched 
higher, the speech will become louder, and the articulation 
poorer, until finally, in extreme cases, the speaker will seem 
to have lost his poise entirely. On the other hand, we are 
all familiar with the soothing effect of a soft, mellow voice 
under good control, and we recognize what a splendid asset 
it is in a classroom. 
4. Training for personality 
The great question is, after all, how am I to go about it 
developing my personality so that I will possess the charm 
and force that are essential to leadership? Can I will to bea 
positive as opposed to a negative type of person? Can I put 
aside a disposition to be bashful or secretive, and learn to be 
frank and sincere? Can I learn to be sympathetic, tactful, 
and self-sacrificing; and can I put away my gloom and doubt 
and become an enthusiastic believer in life’s possibilities? 
And if I can acquire these excellent qualities, how can I 
make them tell in winning for myself a place of power and

  THE TEACHER’S PERSONALITY 305 
influence in the world’s work? Can I become interested in 
making my personality attractive? How shall I improve 
my appearance, and manners, and conversation, and use of 
English, and how can I develop a good voice? 
Practice decision. Certainly there are no patent recipes 
for doing any of these things, and it should be said at once 
that we cannot make something out of nothing. What we 
have by inheritance is our foundation material, back of 
which we cannot go, and in the possession of this material we 
have not all fared alike. But because we cannot all be New- 
tons or Shakespeares we should not sit and mourn; instead 
we should set about to become all it is in us to become. Ours 
is the task of building the superstructure and not the foun- 
dation, and we can never find the possibilities of that 
foundation until we begin to take its measure in terms of 
life’s problems. Every man has it in him to pull against the 
cross currents of the world, and if he neglects or refuses to 
pull, then he must be content to drift. 
Our task, then, is to exercise this power to choose our 
course. Instead of waiting like Micawber for things to turn 
up, we must go about turning them up for ourselves. We 
must learn to make decisions, and to follow them up with 
action. Scarcely a moment passes in which we are not pre- 
sented with the possibility of making a choice in something. 
From morning until night there is a constant flood of ideas 
coming to our minds in response to the thousand practical 
situations we find ourselves in from hour to hour. The 
negative type of person waits for these ideas to settle them- 
selves, and then acts in terms of the one on top. ‘This is 
lazy and cowardly. We should examine critically every idea 
we have and seek for others, then out of this complex we 
should choose the one which is to guide our action, and have 
the courage to stand for the consequences. 
The best way to begin is to seek every possible oppor-
-P-A-G-E-318
  306 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
tunity for making and carrying out a definite decision. Shall 
I arise now and prepare for the day’s work, or shall I sleep a 
while longer? Why wait for a decision to get itself made? 
Decide, and get up! Why spend a week trying to make up 
one’s mind what dress to wear to a party? Decide, and 
then clear your mind for other things. Don’t go to the 
principal to find out what to do about a simple case of dis- 
cipline, but force yourself to settle it alone. These seem like 
trifling details, and so they are for people with executive 
ability, but they are not trifling when deciding them con- 
sumes a large percentage of a teacher’s time and energy. It 
is by being positive, by deciding matters with dispatch, by 
taking a definite stand in respect to small things, that we 
may hope to overcome the indecision, weakness, and inertia 
of a negative personality. 
Set up right ideals. It is a good practice to try oc- 
casionally to imagine the kind of person you would like to 
be, and the sort of niche you would like to fill in the world. 
If I should like to be a great teacher, then just what does 
that mean, and what is my present self like when measured 
in such terms? Am J as frank and sincere, as sympathetic, 
tactful, unselfish, and optimistic, as I should like to be? Am 
I as charming in my dress, manners, and conversation as I 
make this hero of mine? Such self-examination forces one 
to define his ambitions and aspirations in specific terms, and 
this is precisely what we need. So often our ideas are only a 
vague longing to be great, or good, or clever, and we forget 
that mere dissatisfaction with our present selves — for that 
is about all such longing means — is not enough. It is not 
enough merely to be on the way. We must know where we 
are going if our steps are to count. 
Develop specific habits. Ideals, however well-defined, will 
serve as little more than disturbers of the peace unless we be- 
gin to take steps to attain them. These steps are to be in
-P-A-G-E-319
  THE TEACHER’S PERSONALITY 807 
the form of specific habits of conduct, habits of being 
sincere, sympathetic, tactful; habits of correct dress, man- 
ners, and conversation. Only a few illustrations are neces- 
sary to suggest where and how to begin. The first of these is. 
that we are not to wait and look for something great or 
startling to begin with. To develop habits of sincerity we 
need to do two things: first, stop pretending to be what we 
are not; and second, practice being better in what we are, 
and learn to give good measure in all we do. 
If we will apply these general principles throughout the 
day, and every day, soon we shall have the habit of greeting 
our children with a frank good-morning, and we shall apply 
ourselves more earnestly in the preparation of our lessons, 
and we shall learn to say yes when we mean yes, and no 
when we mean no. We shall cease trying to “bluff,” and 
say frankly, “I do not know, but will try to find out for you” 
(and shall not forget the promise), and we shall be zealous 
for the progress of every child under our care. 
We cannot become sympathetic by waiting to be moved 
to action by some great catastrophe. We must take note 
of small opportunities. They appear on the playground and 
in the classroom every day. Bashful little Mary has come 
to school for the first time, and feels very lonely because no 
one seems to know her or to care to have her join the games. 
She needs a friend to drive away the loneliness, and to help 
her to fit into the new life. James is behind in his work and 
is discouraged. Lend him a hand for five minutes after 
school, and send him home feeling that now he is going to 
win in his fight to keep up with his class. Mrs. Brown calls 
to scold you for punishing her son. Speak kindly to her and 
seek her codperation. 
Observing, learning, growing. Similarly with tact, self- 
sacrifice, and optimism — it is in the lesser incidents of the 
daily work that we should seek opportunity to begin. It is 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
   
   308 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
not necessary constantly to antagonize people. Nagging 
at the children, scolding, getting angry, playing the spy, 
are the opposite of tactful procedure. Tact in teaching 
forbids that we shall always tell John what he wants to 
know, and insists that we merely put him in a position to 
find out for himself. To tell him is the teacher’s fatal line 
of least resistance. Merely to point the way often involves 
effort or self-sacrifice. Practice it and practice it again 
must be our motto. 
“As the teacher so the pupils” is nowhere so true as in 
the matter of cheerfulness. It is so easy to doubt when one 
is tired from a hard day’s work, that often we unconsciously 
become gloomy and not too agreeable when the children 
seem restless. A little introspection at such times will fre- 
quently show that the teacher’s bright, cheerful ways, her 
smile, her energy and enthusiasm have been replaced by a 
general attitude of pessimism. Can one ever overcome this? 
Certainly not without trying. Trying here does not mean 
merely resolving to put away the gloom if it ever comes 
again, it means resolution plus “turning the trick” the 
first chance you have, and then again, and again, till you 
win. 
How can I learn correct dress and manners? Partly by 
reading, but largely by keeping my eyes open. There are 
dozens of magazines that deal with dress, and then there are 
people to look at, and pages of advertising, and shop win- 
dows. All there is to be known on the subject is easily avail- 
able. How do the people of my type and calling dress? 
How do the best dressed people dress? It is all so very 
simple that one wonders why so much poor taste is shown. 
There are books on manners and conversation and correct 
English, and there are examples of all of them everywhere we 
go. Read the best novels, essays, and biographies. Such 
books teem with suggestions and illustrations. One win-

THE TEACHER’S PERSONALITY 309 
ter’s study of these questions along the lines here suggested 
would be of invaluable service to teachers and indirectly 
to the schools. How often the girls dress their hair, or pat- 
tern their blouses after the fashion set by the teacher! How 
often they copy their teacher’s mannerisms and phrases, and 
in the fundamentals as well as in these lesser attributes of 
personality, how often does the teacher set the standard for 
her whole community! We must cease to regard our edu- 
cation as complete when it has dealt with books alone. What 
have these books done to make us different men and women 
personally, is the vital question. These differences must 
exist not only in the form of ideals and aspirations, but also 
in the form of specific habits of conduct. If we are really 
different, then our behavior will be different. Education 
must indeed be for us organized self-direction. 
5. Chapter summary 
In summarizing, let us keep in mind the large importance of 
personality as a part of the teacher’s equipment. To be positive 
rather than negative; to be frank and sincere; to be sympathetic, 
tactful, and self-sacrificing; and withal to be a thorough believer 
in the possibilities of life; these are the demands of the schoolroom, 
and they are the demands of real achievement everywhere. 
As we have seen, these qualities express themselves in good 
breeding; in our personal appearance; in our manners and conver- 
sation; in the quality of our English; and in the character and con- 
trol of our voices. We must remember, too, that these things are 
not all inherited. The responsibility for their attainment is our 
very own. ‘Training and self-discipline in the practice of decision; 
in the development of right ideals and specific habits; in the powers 
of observation and imitation — these are the specific points of at- 
tack for the teacher who would enlarge her own personal power 
and charm, and through these her professional effectiveness.

QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
. Define “personality” as you understand the term. 
. Try to analyze and evaluate the personality of some one whom you 
admire as a man or woman of high character. Try the same plan on 
yourself and on one of your former teachers. 
. Under the headings used in this chapter for analyzing character, try 
to set down the qualities you would regard as necessary for an ideal 
teacher. Set over against each of these a quality or trait of the op- 
posite sort. Where, in respect to these two extremes, do you place 
yourself as a teacher? 
. Classify a dozen of your friends as positive or negative. Try the same 
plan on your pupils and yourself. 
. Mention some decisions you have made in the past in school work that 
put your frankness and sincerity to the test. 
. In what ways have you shown sympathy in your school work? 
. Think of the most tactful person you know. Is he a leader in his work 
and in his community? In what kinds of situations have you seen him 
show tact? Think of the most untactful person you know and apply 
these same inquiries. In what ways do you need to use tact in your 
work? 
. Who is the greatest optimist you know? Has he many friends? Do 
many seem to dislike him? Think of the greatest pessimist you know 
and apply these same questions. Which one seems to get most out of 
life? Which one seems to contribute most to society? Is there danger 
ef being too optimistic? If so, what is the antidote for it? 
. Do you think Locke overstates the importance of good breeding? 
Think among your acquaintances of the best-mannered person, the 
best-dressed person, the best conversationalist, the person who uses 
the best English, and the one who has the best voice. How many 
different people did you have to name? Is any one whom you named. 
specially lacking in respect to one or more of the other points? 
Can you recall the name of any former teacher of yours who was espe- 
cially strong or especially deficient in any one of these respects? Can 
you analyze the significance which that quality had in adding to or de- 
tracting from that teacher’s worth in the classroom and in the com- 
munity? 
In what ways have you tried to perfect your own appearance, man- 
ners, etc.? Suggest methods for further growth. 
What specific habits can you mention that you have consciously 
developed as a result of your desire to make a better appearance, to 
have better manners, to converse more easily and pleasantly, to per- 
fect your written and spoken English, and to increase the effective- 
ness of your voice? What habits along these lines are you now trying 
to perfect?

THE TEACHER’S TRAINING AND GROWTH 
OvuTLINE or CHAPTER 
1. Increased demand for better training: Recent progress — New attitude and demands — Academic training demanded — Professional training demanded — Extent of training required — ‘Training and merit in teaching — Why teachers lose their places — Teacher score cards. 2. The teacher’s growth: Necessity for growth —Opportunities for growth — The teacher’s reading — Professional meetings, visiting, ete. — Self-appraisement worth while — Progress the only basis of sureness. 3. Summary — Questions — Problems — References. 
Somerutne like a definite plan for the training of teachers 
was first instituted in the United States about three quar- 
ters of a century ago. Since that time, through each suc- 
ceeding decade, the problem of teacher training has gradu- 
ally become more clearly defined, and has received increased 
attention and support from the State and from leading edu- 
cational thinkers. Gradually the public has come to realize 
that teaching is a difficult and a technical piece of work, 
requiring special preparation, and the old notion that 
“teachers are born, not made,” has gradually disappeared. 
As this change has come about, the power to examine and 
certificate teachers for the schools has been taken out of 
the hands of local school trustees and placed in the hands 
of State and county school officials, while the issuance of 
certificates has been increasingly guarded by State legisla- 
tion.   
1. Increased demand for better training 
Recent progress. To-day the demand for carefully 
trained teachers is felt on every side. One needs only to 
set down a few facts and figures showing the extent to which 
facilities for training teachers already exist, and the tend-
-P-A-G-E-325
  
THE TEACHER’S TRAINING AND GROWTH 313 
ency toward better certification and minimum wage laws, 
to be convinced that the time is rapidly approaching when 
the education of teachers will be as carefully and fully 
specified as is now the education of nurses, physicians, and 
engineers. Let us consider a few facts. 
1. Development of teacher training. There were in the 
United States, in 1923-24, a total of 382 institutions engaged 
in the training of teachers. This is an increase of more than 
25 per cent since 1900. These institutions were manned by 
13,517 instructors, which represents more than a 200 per 
cent increase since 1900. They enrolled a total of 273,107 
students, an increase of 130 per cent since 1900. In 1923 
teacher-training institutions graduated 40,484 students, 
against a total of 11,359 in 1900. The revenue for these 
schools amounted to $48,948,518 in 1923, as against $5,231,- 
856 in 1900. 
To these figures must be added corresponding figures for 
the more than 300 universities and colleges in which there 
are schools, departments, or courses devoted to professional 
training for teachers. It is clear that the number of people 
making definite professional preparation is increasing far 
more rapidly than is the number of teaching positions. That 
is, the teaching force of the country is rapidly increasing its 
professional preparation.? 
2. Improving certification requirements. Not only are we 
increasing training facilities, but the laws governing certi- 
fication are changing rapidly. In about one third of the 
1U.S, Bureau of Education Bulletin, 1925, no. 28, on Statistics of Teach- 
ers’ Colleges and Normal Schools, 1923-1924.

Elementary and Secondary Public School Teachers in South Carolina, Uni- 
versity of South Carolina Bulletin, no. 184, 1926.

legislatures in session in the year 1915 laws were enacted on 
this subject, and everywhere the tendency was to do away 
with the old examination plan in favor of specific profes- 
sional and academic training requirements.!. This tend- 
ency has not yet stopped, for even where training require- 
ments have supplanted the old method the amounts 
of training required are being increased from year to 
year? 
More than this, the control of certification is shifting 
rapidly from local to state authority. Only a very few States 
are now left in which local control is prominent. In more 
than half the States there is complete state control, and in 
many others the State has assumed large power. This means 
much for the development of a profession of teaching. It 
means that the effort to get training will be rewarded by 
the fact that untrained teachers cannot compete for posi- 
tions. It means more and more that a certificate good in 
one district will be good in another, and that there will 
eventually come a liberal reciprocity as between States. In 
other words, it means that we are building up real standards 
for the profession. 
3. Other evidences. Minimum wage laws and salary sched- 
ules, and rules governing appointment and retirement 
are more and more recognizing training as a basis for deter- 
mining salary and pension status. In 1925, reports from 
215 out of a total of 1871 school systems (city and town) re- 
ported that there were either state or local rules requiring 
that salaries of men and women of equal training and ex- 
perience and performing similar service shall be equal.®

THE TEACHER’S TRAINING AND GROWTH 315 
Various other studies show how firm has become the con- 
viction that training is of first importance. 
One such inquiry, covering the prevailing opinions and 
practices of four hundred and twenty superintendents of 
schools, and one hundred and eighty-three presidents of 
school boards in the United States, shows that of fifteen 
factors or qualities considered in the selection of teachers the 
greatest importance is attached to “scholarship and edu- 
cation.” ! “Discipline (governing skill)” is given second 
place, “teaching skill or method” holds third place, and 
“strength of personality” fourth place on their list of fifteen 
factors. 
Thus, if we look at what is going on before our eyes: the 
almost unheard of expansion of our schools for the profes- 
sional training of teachers, the increased legal insistence 
upon training as a prerequisite for certification, the rela- 
tion of training to the establishment of minimum wage and 
salary schedules for teachers, and the extent to which super- 
intendents and school boards are basing their appointment of 
teachers upon training, we must realize that it is a nation- 
wide movement. Surely no prospective teacher or school 
administrator can face these plain evidences of the trend of 
things in education and hope to make an educational career 
for himself or herself without a careful and extensive pre- 
paration in school. 
Academic training demanded. There are two sides to the 
education of a modern teacher — the academic and the 
professional. The teacher must first of all know something 
to teach, and secondly she must know how to teachit. The 
first in general consists of a broad cultural outlook upon 
1 Anderson, W. N., “The Selection of Teachers”’; in Educational Admin- 
istration and Supervision, vol. m1, p. 88. (February, 1917.) For other in- 
teresting data see: Whitney, F. L., The Growth of Teachers in Service.

-P-A-G-E-328
    316 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
life, an outlook at once intellectual, sesthetic, moral, and 
broadly social. While for the most part good books and 
great teachers will be the chief sources from which such 
training will be derived, yet there will continue to be in- 
creasing value placed upon travel and contact with people 
from all walks of life as the most important means of sup- 
plementing the more systematic training which will be re- 
ceived in the schools. 
Such an outlook upon life cannot be acquired by the stu- 
dent who stresses textbook knowledge alone and seeks to 
cram the memory with isolated facts. The teacher, above 
all people, must feel the force of the larger currents in civili- 
zation, past and present, and be able to see how these are 
to be influenced by the knowledge and the skills she wishes 
to impart to her pupils. Mere names and dates in history; 
mere political forms and formule; mere rules in grammar, 
arithmetic, and spelling, are not enough. ‘These are all 
essential, but only as the bare skeleton of her real training, 
which looks to the larger and deeper significance of such 
facts as they enter into the meaning of the world in which we 
live. 
Professional training demanded. Such a body of know- 
ledge and experience is the only sound basis for the second 
part of a teacher’s education, which is to be professional. 
Such training consists in being able to view this foundation 
knowledge and experience, or such parts of it as appear in 
the course of study to be taught, in their relations to the 
child and to the social and physical world in which the child 
lives. The demand is that we shall teach children rather 
than books, and in order to do this we must know some- 
thing about the processes by means of which knowledge, 
skills, appreciation, and ideals are gained by the child, and 
how they are imparted by the teacher. 
But the professional duties of the teacher, and particularly
-P-A-G-E-329
THE TEACHER'S TRAINING AND GROWTH 317 
of the principal and superintendent, are broader than is im- 
plied by the term teaching alone. There are the problems 
of organization and management, the problems of orienting 
the school with respect to the life of the community, and 
the problem of selecting and organizing the course of study. 
These call for an understanding of the school as an institu- 
tion. What has the school attempted, and what should it 
now be attempting to do for civilization? What are the 
principles upon which such an institution and such courses 
of study may properly be organized? How may these prin- 
ciples be applied to the end that health and physical develop- 
ment will be cared for, and real education of the children 
result? These are fundamental questions. 
First of all we should expect our teacher to possess a gen- 
eral knowledge of the history of education, through which 
she would come to see the school as one of the several great 
social enterprises of past and present civilizations. Sec- 
ondly, we should expect her to know something of the funda- 
mentals of educational psychology and of the principles of 
teaching, in order that she might exercise economy in her 
management of the processes of instruction. Third, she 
should have some knowledge of school organization and 
management, since these pertain to the real technique of 
directing the work of the school. Fourth, we should insist 
further upon some knowledge of school hygiene and health 
conservation, in order that the physical conditions under 
which our children work may be conducive to the attain- 
ment of other aims of the school. Fifth, these four fields of 
knowledge must then be carefully codrdinated in some ac- 
tual practice, under wise direction, in order that to her know- 
ledge she may add skill in execution. 
Extent of training required. It is not so difficult to state 
what should ideally be the extent of this training, and cer- 
tainly every teacher should strive to reach such an ideal
-P-A-G-E-330
    318 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
even though we know that the economic laws of supply and 
demand can be violated here very little more than they can 
be in business. For a practical working basis it is safe, 
however, to suggest that every teacher who is worthy of a 
position should not be content to remain below the average 
in preparation. The present average cannot be stated with 
absolute accuracy, but a number of rather extensive investi- 
gations! furnish us with a fairly safe index. Summarized 
in a few words these studies practically agree in setting the 
average mark at approximately four years of high-school 
training for elementary teachers, and at least the equivalent 
of full high-school and college training for all teachers in 
secondary schools. 
If this is approximately the average of what is now being 
accomplished, then no teacher should be satisfied until this 
point is reached, and even exceeded, for ideally it is too low. 
For elementary teachers the amount of general or academic 
training should certainly be the equivalent of a full four 
years’ course in a good high school, and in addition to this 
at least two years are needed to cover, even in a small way, 
the five general lines of professional training suggested 
above. For the high-school teacher the academic training 
should be increased to include the equivalent of a four years’ 
course in college, and the professional training should in- 
clude substantial university courses in each of the fields 
here suggested. That we are actually approaching these 
standards in practice is evidenced by recent changes in our 
certification laws, and it is clear that the time is approach-

ing when those who are below this standard will be elimi-

Training and merit in teaching. Does training count, and 
if so how, and to what extent? The facts about individual 
differences, which we have discussed above,! remind us that 
no two students are alike, and consequently our common 
observation that teachers of equal training are not equally 
efficient does not surprise us. Yet we know in general that 
training counts, and we are concerned here with just why a 
teacher should spend her time and energy in educating 
herself to teach.? 
The brief answer we can give here must be based on two 
sets of facts which are rapidly accumulating and rapidly 
making themselves felt in school practice. One of these sets 
of facts has been gathered by investigations into the prac- 
tical relationship between training and teaching ability, and 
the other in connection with the formulation of devices for 
teacher measurement. 
One of the investigations above cited shows that city 
teachers are better trained than are rural and village teach- 
ers. We know also that city teachers are better paid, and 
that, generally speaking, it is because they can render better 
service. This does not prove conclusively that the extra 
training is the cause of the greater efficiency, but such a 
relationship is strongly suggested. Another study, includ- 
ing the teachers in all the principal high schools of Indiana, 
states, on the basis of carefully analyzed data, that “the 
best prepared teachers are the ones who receive the highest 
salaries.”

Why teachers lose their places. Statistics in regard toa 
number of teachers dismissed by one hundred and sixteen 
city superintendents in the United States were collected in a 
recent investigation, along with a careful analysis of the 
reasons for dismissal. Among the causes of failures we find 
“deficiency in scholarship” marked as the chief cause of 
forty-two of the two hundred and seventy failures, and as 
the contributory cause of forty more. Other causes, such as 
“poor methods,” “unprofessional attitudes,” “lack of inter- 
est in work of teaching,” and “daily preparation insufficient,” 
all of which pertain to training, stand as the chief cause of 
sixty-five more failures.1 
Still another study of scholarship and teaching efficiency, 
based upon the marks received in teachers’ examinations 
and university and normal-school courses, on the one hand, 
and city superintendents’ estimates of teaching efficiency 
on the other, points conclusively to the fact that there is 
a positive relationship between scholarship and teaching 
efficiency.” 
These are typical of many more inquiries into the influ- 
ence which training has upon actual teaching efficiency. It 
may be true that personal opinion has entered largely into 
these studies, but the answer to any such criticism is that 
the facts which they have made use of are just the facts 
which are actually counting in the appointment, promotion, 
and dismissal of teachers, and are therefore of very great 
practical value.

basis for very similar conclusions. There have been a num-

ber of practical devices made for measuring teaching suc- 
cess, and in every one training, and progressive scholarship, 
as well as personality, occupy a prominent place. In the 
earliest of these scales! such items as “preparation” — 
meaning both academic and professional training — “ pro- 
fessional attitudes and interest,” “ continuing preparation,” 
and “increase of professional equipment” indicate the 
emphasis placed on training. Another similar device makes 
a complete efficiency record under the five headings: per- 
sonal equipment, social and professional equipment, school 
management, technique of teaching, and results.2 A copy 
of this score card is given on the opposite page, showing the 
scoring of one teacher by three judges. Still another some- 
what more complex device gives ten out of its total of 
forty-six points to the various aspects of preparation and 
growth.® 
It must be remembered that these devices have been made 
by careful students of teaching efficiency, and that their aim 
has been to develop a thoroughly practical scheme by means 
of which teachers may estimate their own ability in the 
classroom, as well as have it estimated for them by super- 
vising officers. 
All the facts we have been presenting here are hard and 
practical facts that argue much more forcefully than any 
mere words of advice can do, and they must not be ignored 
by anyone who expects to enter school work, or to remain in 
it long. The time when meager and indifferent preparation 
will suffice is past, and every progressive teacher should wel-

quirements for yee a and retention in place. 
a 2. The teach 
Necessity for growth. It is not enough merely to begin 
with a good education. The constantly changing condi- 
tions and functions of the school make it imperative that 
teachers shall continue to grow! in their work. New school 
aims must be constantly formulating to meet new social, 
industrial, and political needs; new pedagogical principles 
must be evolved; new devices in teaching and management 
must be worked out; and greater skill in executing in these 
new terms must be attained. The teacher has a part in this 
changing program. She is not expected to develop many 
new theories, but she must develop her practice in terms of 
new theories, and she must increase her own personal power 
and charm. ‘To do these things she must be constantly on 
the alert, constantly in training, and constantly progressing. 
In the calling of teaching there is no such thing as standing 
still. To cease to be a student when one takes up the work 
of teaching is to act on the very false assumption that the 
training of to-day will suffice for the issues of to-morrow. 
Opportunities for growth. The teacher’s opportunities 
for growth are almost unlimited in number and variety, and 
are so easily available that even the teacher in the most iso- 
lated rural school has no excuse for failing to keep abreast 
with her position. There is, first, the social life of the com- 
  4 growth 
1A most interesting account of the numerous opportunities for self- 
development which are open to teachers is presented in United States 
Bureau of Education, Bulletin no. 3 (1911), by Wm. Carl Ruediger, en- 
titled Agencies for the Improvement of Teachers in Service. An important 
recent contribution to this problem is: Whitney, F. L., The Growth of Teach- 
ers in Service. New York, The Century Co., 1926. See also Russell, C.,

York Teachers College, Columbia University, Contributions to Education,

munity itself, really to participate in which is always a 
liberal training for the young teacher. ‘There are the public, 
or perhaps traveling, libraries, with all kinds of good books. 
There are magazines and papers at a small cost. There are 
possible extension courses, public lectures, the graphophone, 
the radio, musicals, and theaters. There are teachers’ 
meetings, institutes, associations, summer schools, reading- 
circle work, visiting schools, trips to parks and museums, 
and travel, most of which are available in some degree to all, 
and to a large degree to most teachers. 
Too many teachers act on the assumption that they are 
being paid for the work they do in the schoolroom alone. 
This is a wrong notion. The school is an institution of and 
for all the people, and must function with old as well as with 
young. Leadership in directing the community interests, 
since they naturally center in the school, is in part what the 
teacher is being paid for, and such service cannot be rend- 
ered by standing aloof from the people and their social 
activities. Moreover, even if such a traditional conception 
were acceptable to the people, it is too narrow a life for any 
teacher to live. Merely because one becomes a teacher she 
should not therefore neglect to be a citizen. To be a mem- 
ber of a community is to maintain normal social relation- 
ships, without which one not only ceases to grow but tends 
to become narrow, cynical, and personally unattractive. 
The teacher’s reading. Teachers, as a rule, do not read 
enough, and the reading they do is too often not well bal- 
anced. Let us sketch out a possible school year’s reading to 
illustrate what is meant. First of all, there must be some 
balance between the reading one does for general culture and 
that which is done for professional development. Again, in 
the general reading there should be some balance between 
that which deals with current issues and that covering

One book each month. The teacher’s first impression 
may be that this represents a large undertaking. Aside 
from current literature, it calls for the reading of four books 
for general culture, and six for professional development. 
This is less than two books each month through the school 
year, leaving the vacation period free for attendance at a 
summer school, further light reading, recreation, and travel. 
It is about the minimum amount of reading necessary for 
the all-round development which we have a right to expect 
of all public servants. It does not suggest as much current 
fiction as many people read, but it shows about the proper 
ratio which fiction should hold to other lines of reading, and 
if this proportion is adhered to there would be far less read- 
ing which amounts to dissipation, and far more that fur- 
nishes food for thought. This is not meant to suggest that 
reading purely for recreation should be in the least neglected. 
Professional meetings, visiting, etc. If the teachers of a 
county were to organize a reading circle on this basis, and 
meet at intervals for reports and discussion, the results 
would be invaluable. Such a plan could also be carried out 
in teachers’ meetings with excellent effect. Such reading 
circles, when properly managed, are among the most potent 
forces for the personal and professional development of 
teachers that have yet been devised. Their value lies in the 
fact that it extends throughout the year, furnishes definite 
intellectual activity in solitude, provides a basis for real 
discussion at meetings, and gives the participants a sense of 
membership in a stable organization and calling. 
The teachers’ institute is another organization that offers 
excellent opportunities for solid growth. The tendency 
here, as in other professional organizations, is for lecturers 
to present concrete problems and to show what is to be 
done about them by the teachers. It remains for the teacher 
to go back to her work and put what she has heard to the
-P-A-G-E-341
  
THE TEACHER’S TRAINING AND GROWTH 329 
test. This she is at liberty to do or not; many teachers, 
for lack of energy, do not, and as a consequence tend to lose 
interest and cease to grow. 
There is probably no better way to get concrete sugges- 
tions for one’s work than by visiting other teachers. Many 
city superintendents, seeing the value of this, have made 
visiting a definite part of every teacher’s work. 
Self-appraisement worth while. There is nothing more 
stimulating to growth than a consciousness of progress 
made and of definite things yet to be accomplished. Ina 
practical career one needs at times to look both backward 
and forward: backward, because this gives the conscious- 
ness of having achieved; forward, because the heights ahead 
lure on to greater effort. 
This looking may be casual — in terms of the jobs one 
has held; or critical — in terms of personal and profes- 
sional growth. Some profit should be gained from the 
former; very much more from the latter. Success is not 
always apparent in the nature of the job one holds, and what 
appears to be progress in certain kinds of jobs may not be 
progress that will endure. Solid progress has been made 
only when there is real evidence of personal and professional 
growth. 
There are two ways of gathering evidence on this subject: 
first, to review the actual efforts made; second, to note any 
tangible improvement in one’s habits, attitudes, knowledge, 
skill, and personal qualities. Taking such a personal inven- 
tory is an exercise worth while. In reality, if we expect to 
realize on our efforts to gain culture and professional growth 
we should regard such a check much as business regards its 
inventory and audit. 
1. The cultural budget and audit. At the beginning of the 
year the teacher will do well to examine the above reading 
program and select and arrange her year’s reading. At 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
330 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
intervals through the year, and at the end of the year, a 
careful check should be made of the amount of the work 
actually done. 
Similarly with matters of euteruatetment travel, and 
forms of recreation, all of which look to an expansion of our 
fitness for work and for living — either with ourselves alone 
or with our fellows. What is needed to keep us fit is a wide 
variety of contacts with the current of civilization. Good 
books, companions, travel, the theater, museum, and 
art gallery, the business and industrial world, the great 
out-of-doors, all these are avenues to physical, intellectual, 
and social fitness which the teacher must keep wide open if 
she expects to grow and to enjoy her work. To check up at 
the end of a month or a year will often be a revelation. It 
is so easy to neglect these things, and with neglect to de- 
velop habits of living alone and attitudes of indifference 
toward the world of people and affairs. With this there soon 
comes the careworn expression, the overserious, critical, or 
cynical attitude — and we have the forgotten or disliked 
“schoolmarm” where we might have had a charming social 
and intellectual leader. 
2. Measuring our achievement. It is not enough, how- 
ever, to check these external evidences of growth. Not 
only what have I done to try to grow, but also, what have 
my efforts resulted in, are questions to be asked. What are 
some of the things I have learned during the past month or 
year? What changes have I effected in my dress, language, 
manners, ability to appreciate art, music, literature, and 
drama? Where and how have I gained in social facilities? 
Where have I widened my social contacts and deepened my 
friendships? Where have I improved my physical condi- 
tion? And, not the least, to what extent have I had a really 
delightful time? 
To make a mental inventory of tangible achievements on 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  
THE TEACHER’S TRAINING AND GROWTH 331 
these and like points is a wholesome exercise. At all these 
points we need to take note, too, of what we have lost. 
There have been devised for this purpose what are known 
as self-rating cards.1_ These are simple inventory sheets 
containing many items referring to things a teacher should 
be or do. It is decidedly worth while to score one’s self 
twice a year by such a plan. 
Progress the only basis of sureness. The teacher, as well 
as the business man, must learn to turn things to account. 
She must keep up her stock of culture as the merchant 
keeps up his stock of goods, and, like the merchant, must 
not overlook the staple lines because there appears to be 
large profit in temporary and trivial wares. The teacher 
who reads only sentimental stories and attends only cheap 
vaudeville programs, is neglecting the staples which are 
found in the best class of non-fiction as well as fiction, at 
the opera, the high-class theater, and the lecture hall. Fail- 
ure is as certain for the lopsided teacher as it is for the lop- 
sided business. Progress along sound lines is the only basis 
of success. Look at the failures around you. They are peo- 
ple who were not growing. The unprogressive teacher is 
usually jealous, pessimistic, and in general unhappy, while 
the progressive teacher is alert, happy, and personally at- 
tractive. The one talks about what she is, the other about 
what she is going to become. The one emphasizes her 
rights, the other her privileges and obligations. The one 
works for salary, the other to serve, and the one fails and is 
forgotten, while the other succeeds, and is loved and hon- 
ored by all who knew her.

In this chapter we have pointed out the increasing demand for

better trained teachers and the consequent prospect of failure for 
those who enter the profession with inadequate training, or who 
fail to keep pace with the growing needs of the school. We have 
seen that this training must consist of both academic and pro- 
fessional study, not of books alone, but with the view of getting a 
sound comprehension of, and a broad perspective for, the know- 
ledge the teacher is to impart, and skill in imparting it. 
In order to make clear that this is to be a continuous process for 
the teacher, an outline of a year’s program of study has been sug- 
gested. The plan calls for a reasonable balance between light and 
heavy reading. It suggests the breadth of contact which the 
teacher must keep with affairs and with her profession, and offers 
specific directions for carrying out such a plan of self-development 
—a plan which every teacher should make herself follow if she is 
not able to enter upon it with real pleasure and enthusiasm. 
Finally, emphasis is placed upon the desirability of the teacher’s 
applying an occasional check on her‘achievements by the use of 
one of the personal efficiency rating schemes. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Collect the facts for your own State which tend to show that the 
problem of training teachers is holding a more prominent place 
in the educational policy of the State now than it held a decade 
ago. 
. How do you distinguish between academic and professional training? 
. What are the reasons why a more extensive professional training is 
necessary to-day than was necessary in colonial times? 
4. From the facts cited, what seems to be the practical bearing of train- 
ing on school practice? Does this correspond to your own observa- 
tions? 
5. Have you attempted to evaluate your own teaching or that of another 
teacher in terms of one of the scales or score cards suggested? What 
is the advantage of such plans for use by the teacher herself, by the 
principal, or by the supervisor? 
6. If you could take your education over again, in what ways, if any, 
would you change it, and why? Why is the training of twenty years

7. Why is it necessary to continue to be a student after entering teach- 
ing? Classify your former teachers, and your present acquaintances 
among teachers, with respect to their efforts to grow in their work.

suggested above in eight months. Would it be a reasonable under- 
taking? Where would you shorten or supplement it? 
9. Without using any of the books or magazines above mentioned, make 
out a similar program that you would like to carry out. 
10. Make out a list of books and articles which you would recommend 
to a teacher of a beginning class, another for a teacher of the upper 
grades, another for a teacher of a rural school, another for a teacher of 
reading, and others for teachers of spelling, arithmetic, language, na- 
ture study, civics, and history. 
11. Should advancement in salary be based in part on the teacher’s effort 
at self-development? If so, how could a superintendent determine 
the worth of such effort? 
PROBLEMS FOR STUDY 
1. Make a list of the next ten persons to whom you are introduced. 
Set down in a note-book your best judgment of each. State how your 
judgment was effected by: 
a. The person’s voice (quality, pitch, loudness). 
6. The person’s dress (quality, colors, tailoring, fit). 
c. The person’s manners (modesty, self-possession, leading or fol- 
lowing in conversation, subject of conversation, courtesy). 
d. The person’s ability (knowledge, skill, taste, executive traits). 
2. Prepare a program of reading materials, such as the list given, but 
using different titles. Make an estimate of the number of hours of 
reading per week that would be required to carry the program through. 
3. Take a teacher-rating form, such as the sample given in this chapter, 
and score ten teachers whom you know well. Place their scores side 
by side in detail. Consider how you would justify these scores to an 
inquirer. At what points is the evidence you offer tangible and 
measurable? Place your estimate of your own rating by the side of 
the others. To what extent could you offer tangible evidence that 
your judgment is fair? 
4, Prepare similar scores for the five poorest teachers you know. Try 
to justify your scores. Does your evidence bear upon general train- 
ing, professional training, physical traits, social traits, esthetic 
traits? Prescribe a course of work and activities for the poorest one 
of the group, indicating the specific points at which you would expect 
improvement, and the points at which you believe improvement is im- 
possible even with genuine rational effort.

1. Teaching a strenuous occupation 
Wuatever the teacher’s personality may be, however 
fitly she may be equipped for her work, there is yet the 
question of how effectively her personality and training 
are going to function. Teaching is everywhere recognized 
as a strenuous occupation. The teacher must be forever 
on the alert, exercising patience, discretion, and decision, 
under conditions which are often most trying. None but 
the most rugged in physique is competent to exercise wise 
and sympathetic leadership under such circumstances 
without taking serious thought for her own physical and 
mental well-being. 
Age distribution of teachers. The tendency among city 
superintendents is to insist upon a health certificate, based 
upon a thorough physical examination, as a part of every 
application for a teaching position, and to refuse to consider 
the employment of any candidate who has passed the age 
of forty-five years. Teaching is in the main an occupation 
for strong, young people, and more and more it is being 
insisted that these shall be selected on the basis of physical 
as well as intellectual fitness. Coffman describes the “typi-
-P-A-G-E-348
  336 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
cal American male public school teacher” as being twenty- 
nine years old, and the “typical American female teacher” 
as being twenty-four years old;! of the more than five thou- 
sand teachers dealt with in his study, but twenty-nine had 
reached their sixtieth birthday. In the city of Cleveland, 
with more than four thousand teachers, twenty-eight were 
in this class, and only twenty had taught more than thirty- 
five years.2, The State pension systems now in force in this 
country permit teachers to retire at ages ranging from fifty 
to sixty-five years, after from twenty to thirty-five years’ 
service.? Such facts tend to show that teaching makes a 
heavy demand upon physical energy, and should remind 
the beginning teacher of the importance of keeping herself 
physically up to standard. 
2. Status of the teacher’s health 
Mortality rates. It is not enough, however, merely to 
remind ourselves that teaching is hard work. We must 
go further and find out what specific effects such work has 
upon the health of those who enter it. Is there such a thing 
as occupational disease among teachers? What is the ex- 
pected mortality among teachers as compared with other 
groups of people, and what is the character and extent of 
morbidity? These are questions which cannot be fully 
answered for want of adequate vital statistics. A few facts 
are known, however, and their analysis and interpretation 
by students of school hygiene hold some surprises for those 
who think that teachers are an unusually healthy group,

and that teaching is, from this point of view, an easy occu- 
pation.! 
It does not appear that the mortality rate among teachers 
is in general any higher than among other similar groups,” 
but that teachers are specially subject to certain chest, 
throat, gastric, and nervous complaints seems fairly well 
established? Most prominent among these diseases are 
tuberculosis, influenza, and conditions of neurasthenia. 
In his chapter on “Tuberculosis and the Teacher,” Dr. 
Terman generalizes upon carefully analyzed data for the 
United States, as follows: (1) There is a “higher mortality 
for teachers, both male and female, than for persons of the 
corresponding sex in other occupations. This excess is never 
less than nineteen per cent, and rises as high as twenty-six 
percent. (2) There is a higher mortality for female teachers 
than for male teachers, the difference between the two 
being forty-three per cent for white teachers, and thirty- 
nine per cent for teachers of all races.” 
Nervous diseases. Equally disturbing figures relating to 
nervous diseases could be cited, as when Todd states that 
of the eighty-seven out of three hundred and twenty-seven 
cases receiving breakdown allowances in London, fifty were 
due to neurasthenia, fourteen to nervous prostration, six 
to nervous debility, five to melancholia, five to lunacy, and 
seven to delusions. On the basis of many such facts, Todd 
says: “Briefly reviewing the results, neurasthenia and a 
long train of other nervous diseases seem to stand out as

those which teachers have most to fear throughout the whole 
course of their service.” 
These are but samples of data that are now rapidly ac- 
cumulating and which constantly point to the same con: 
clusion, namely, that while the strain of teaching does not 
seem to affect longevity in its general total, it does lower 
it in respect to certain diseases; and that morbidity among 
teachers along these lines is relatively high. 
3. Causes of such conditions 
Responsibility for the problem. The question of impor- 
tance is, what are the causes of these difficulties, and are 
they remediable. Certainly the teacher who is tired and 
nervous is not one hundred per cent efficient. She is likely 
to be discouraged, to show a lack of self-confidence and a 
lack of initiative, and in the long run to become a burden 
to herself and to the children she means to serve. If the 
teaching corps is selected from the physically unfit, as is 
not infrequently claimed, then laws should enforce restric- 
tions which will prevent weaklings from entering such work. 
The proper time for such restrictions is when the students 
are entering the normal and other teacher-training schools, 
and when they become candidates for positions, and not 
after they have rendered several years of poor service and. 
worn themselves out. 
If the causes of the difficulties are to be found in the un- 
hygienic conditions of work in the classroom, or in an im- 
proper distribution of the burdens of instruction, then we 
must look to boards of education and to administrative and 
supervisory officers for the remedy. If, on the other hand, 
they are due to the ignorance or indifference of teachers 
themselves, then it is the teacher’s own problem. The fact 
seems to be that all these causes are operating. 
Teachers work in bad light. Perhaps there is no one con-
-P-A-G-E-351
  
HEALTH AND RECREATION 339 
dition common to a large percentage of our classrooms that 
is more often the cause of fidgety children and nervous 
headaches among teachers than that of bad light. Of the 
six hundred and sixty classrooms examined in the Salt Lake 
City survey, only ninety-six were found to be properly 
lighted! The Portland,’ Butte,’ and Cleveland‘ surveys, 
without using figures, speak in the same general vein, while 
the Springfield® survey says, “Of every ten classrooms in 
the city, seven have windows at the left and rear, one has 
them at the right and rear, while only two have them at 
the left only,” where they properly belong. As to the 
amount of light, these scientific surveys speak in equally 
condemning words. In Salt Lake City, seventy-seven teach- 
ers stated that ill effects had been experienced, and fifteen 
of these stated that their health had been seriously injured 
in this way. 
Heating and ventilation. From these same reports we 
learn that in Salt Lake City there were between thirty and 
forty teachers who were at work in rooms with the suffo- 
cating temperature of 74° to 80° Fahrenheit. In Springfield 
the temperature, found by tests in one hundred and seventy 
rooms, showed a range of from 58° to 86°, there being 
twenty-eight rooms with a temperature of 74° or higher, 
and in no room tested was the humidity above forty-six 
per cent, though the proper humidity is about fifty per 
cent. In all these investigations it was found that ventila- 
tion is as yet an unsolved problem.

Other factors. Aside from these there are other factors, 
such as chalk dust and innumerable floating particles of 
lint, cast-off cuticle, and filth-laden bits from throat and 
nasal discharges; there are soiled books and papers to be 
handled, and in too many cases the most miserable provi- 
sions for drinking-water and for toilet facilities. In a recent 
study of rural school sanitation in Porter County, Indiana, 
it is stated that the water used in seventy-five per cent of 
the schools was obtained from shallow driven wells, that 
protection from surface drainage was not satisfactory, and 
that sanitary drinking fountains were in use in but four of 
the seventy-five buildings examined.1. The Salt Lake City 
survey reports that no school was without the common 
roller towel, and numerous glaring instances of really dan- 
gerous conditions could be cited. 
We also hear the frequent complaint that there are too 
many children to the room. The Springfield survey reports 
the attendance in forty-two out of one hundred and forty- 
seven rooms to have ranged from forty to fifty-three pupils, 
and every one knows that this is fairly typical for other 
cities. The cold lunch, the frequent burden of night study, 
the long hours of service in the day without real relaxation, 
the inefficient janitor service, are other items which add to 
the dangers and strain of teaching. 
In the newer buildings most of these difficulties are 
being overcome. Artificial lights, new types of window 
shades, thermostatic control of heat, better systems of ven- 
tilation, vacuum cleaning systems, more attention to 
drinking-water and to toilet facilities, provision for hot- 
lunch service, teachers’ rest rooms, and better equipment of 
all sorts are replacing many of the older forms which were

    HEALTH AND RECREATION 341 
sources of eye strain, throat and nose infection, and sanitary 
discomforts. 
These new facilities are not everywhere available, how- 
ever. We still have thousands of school buildings in which 
health conditions are as bad as they were fifty years ago. 
The real gain we have made is in our knowledge of germ 
diseases. We know much about these germs: how they live, 
how they multiply, how they are transmitted; and we know 
the symptoms of their presence. This is a large advantage, 
however, only if we make use of it. Sunlight will not rid 
our room of germs if we do not let it into the room. The 
towels will not be germ-free unless they are properly ster- 
ilized and protected. Fresh air will not give us its benefits 
if we shut it out of the room. Further, we must remember 
that not all of the new facilities now provided work auto- 
matically. They need care and in some cases they must be 
operated carefully. This means that the teacher must 
understand her new responsibilities. 
4. Correction of these evils 
Where modern facilities are lacking, the teacher must 
undertake to correct the resulting evils. First, she can live 
a normal life outside the school, and so increase her resist- 
ance to disease; and secondly, she can, in some measure, 
overcome the difficulties within the school. The former she 
will accomplish by proper exercise, food, and sleep; the 
latter by first learning the standards to be attained in light, 
temperature, and ventilation, and then utilize everything 
available for bringing her room up to these standards. 
Some simple hygienic standards. Teachers should be- 
come familiar with every sort of standard that has been 
developed for the management of school work. Here are 
a few that bear upon the points under discussion: 
1. Temperature. The proper temperature for a schoolroom is 
about 68° Fahrenheit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
342 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
2. Light. The light on every desk should be at least nine foot 
candle-power. Or the window glass space should equal 
twenty to twenty-five per cent of the floor space in the room. 
8. Humidity. The proper humidity is about fifty per cent (one 
hundred per cent is the point at which precipitation begins). 
4. Air Space. The amount of pure air per person in the room 
should be not less than 2000 cubic feet per hour. 
5. Contagious diseases. Any child who is considered in the least 
dangerous to others from the standpoint of contagious or in- 
fectious disease should be sent home promptly.1 
6. Other general rules to be followed are: light from left side only, 
and no glaring sunlight on desks; no roller towels or common 
drinking cup; air in room should be kept in motion; windows 
and floor should be washed frequently, and chalk trays and 
erasers should be cleaned daily. 
What the teacher cando. These are very simple rules to 
learn, and most of them can be followed in some measure 
at least. If the teacher cannot control the temperature of 
her room directly, then she should present the facts in the 
case to her principal, superintendent, or school board, and 
urge that it have prompt attention. In the matter of light, 
most teachers need to be reminded that window shades are 
made to use. Without an instrument only serious errors 
in humidity are likely to be detected, but the right amount 
of breathing-space is easily figured and should be insisted 
upon. ‘The roller towel and other germ-carrying devices 
will likewise disappear from the schoolroom much sooner if 
the teacher will insist upon her right to protect her own 
health and the health of her pupils. 
As to dangers from infected children, books, and papers, 
the teacher must learn such discretion as is commonly ex- 
ercised by all practicing nurses. Some slight knowledge of 
how to detect symptoms of infectious diseases, and prompt 
1 Every teacher should be familiar with such books as The Hygiene of the 
School Child, by Dr. L. M. Terman; The Health Index of Children, by Dr. 
E. B. Hoag; and The Health of the School Child, by W. Leslie Mackenzie.
-P-A-G-E-355
  HEALTH AND RECREATION 343 
handling of suspected cases, will cover most of the dangers 
from such sources, while a simple plan for disinfecting 
books is easily operated. 
5. The teachers’ recreation 
Intelligent living. As a matter of self-protection, to say 
nothing of the wisdom of living a joyous life, the teacher 
must look to the problem of keeping an adequate margin of 
good health. This is largely the problem of proper rest 
and recreation. It is such a simple truth to say that when 
one is tired and half sick almost any sort of work becomes 
barren drudgery, and yet this explanation is rarely thought 
of by the teacher who retires in disgust after a long evening 
spent in the task of correcting papers. 
If every teacher would figure up at frequent intervals the 
approximate amount of her time that has gone into work 
directly and indirectly connected with her profession; into 
reading and study for general information and culture; into 
real recreation; and into eating and sleeping she would be 
able to say whether or not she is maintaining a proper 
balance among these important interests. Upon this bal- 
ance depends her margin of security in health, the extent 
of her efficiency in service, and the fullness of her cup of 
joy in life. 
Systematic living. What is needed by teachers is the ap- 
plication of a bit of system and common sense in their daily 
lives. Teaching cannot be sedulously followed by young 
people unless they will studiously offset its inactivity with 
outside exercise and pleasure. Every teacher should set 
aside a definite time for exercise, and a definite sum of 
money for recreation and pleasure. A regular time for a 
walk, a tennis game, a horseback ride, and a regular monthly 
allowance for theater, opera, travel, or for the entertaining 
of one’s friends, will take one out into the open air where
-P-A-G-E-356
  844 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
acquaintance with nature may be renewed, furnish a host 
of new thrills, and establish new interests and new com- 
panionships which will drive away care, renew the mental 
and physical vigor, and provide a saner perspective for the 
serious tasks of the days to come. 
Kinds of exercise and recreation needed. In the main 
the teacher should take her exercise out of doors, and as 
often as possible the element of play should enter into it 
strongly. It is not only a matter of exercising muscles, 
lungs, and circulatory system, but of driving away fatigue 
of mind as well. Few bright, new ideas are likely to flash 
into the mind while one is pulling weights or swinging dumb- 
bells in a bedroom or a gymnasium. In order to rest, one 
must have mental as well as physical diversion, and this 
does not come except in the presence of new and interesting 
mental problems. Fishing, hunting, ball, tennis, riding, 
swimming, skating, coasting, boating, and walking, are 
sports for people of the quiet life, for such activities re-create 
the mind as well as the body. 
To a goodly amount of such activities, taken frequently 
and regularly, the teacher should add a certain amount of 
light reading and frequent attendance at theater or light 
opera, all for the sake of pure enjoyment and relaxation. 
A hearty laugh is of inestimable value. Perhaps the most 
pathetic-looking person the writer ever saw was a man wha 
had taken no vacation and little or no recreation for ten 
years. In the midst of the most sparkling wit, at a mountain 
resort, where he had reluctantly gone for rest, he sat with a 
drawn face and a far-off look as if he could not understand 
why people were laughing. One rarely faces an audience 
of teachers that does not contain such faces as this. Teach- 
ers need to laugh, they need to see new faces, to hear new 
voices, to converse with new people about new and different 
things, for then they can go back to serious work with a  
-P-A-G-E-357
  HEALTH AND RECREATION 345 
clearer sense of values, which is exactly what rest and re- 
creation bring. 
The teacher’s vacation. How shall I spend my two to 
four months’ vacation is an annual question for every 
teacher. Certainly a part of it must be used for recreation, 
and the remainder for a different kind of work. How it will 
be divided will depend upon how wisely or foolishly the year 
has been spent, but for nine teachers out of every ten the 
following prescription would be a good beginning: First, 
procure a copy of some such book as Woods Hutchinson’s 
Exercise and Health, or Fisher and Fisk’s How to Live, and 
then go to a quiet place out of doors and walk, read, eat, and 
sleep for two or three days, till the books are finished. After 
this, the average teacher will have lost respect for the person 
who abuses his or her health, and the remainder of her vaca- 
tion, so far as rest and exercise are concerned, will take care 
of itself. 
“The only really healthy and natural state of man or 
woman,” says Hutchinson, “is neither sitting, nor standing, 
nor lying down, but on the run.” It is change from too 
. much sitting and standing, from an indoor to an outdoor 
world, and from a narrow to a broad social life, that is 
needed, and some part of the vacation should be devoted 
exclusively to these purposes. Rest comes quite as much, 
however, from change of work as it does from stopping work 
altogether. A certain amount of reading, some travel, and 
attendance at summer school ought easily to find place in 
every teacher’s vacation. These recreations will add va- 
riety and furnish the mind with fresh ideas that will keep 
dull care away throughout the long months later on of shut- 
in life at school. Such a vacation puts one into a new world, 
no less busy than the old one, but fresh and charming as the 
spring — it sends us back to our tasks with new stores of 
energy.

6. Chapter summary 
Summarizing, let us recall first, the facts which show plainly that 
teaching is an occupation which lays a heavy tax upon physical 
strength, and second the natural tendency of teachers to treat 
these facts as if they did not exist. 
This chapter has not only pointed out the causes of these hard 
conditions — such as bad light, poor heating, bad ventilation, lack 
of cleanliness, lack of toilet and other facilities — but has also 
pointed clearly to their possible elimination. The remedy rests 
largely with the teacher. First, she must know the simple hygienic 
standards, and how and where to apply them; and second, she must 
insist upon their constant use in her work. 
To keep physically fit the teacher must have recreation, and we 
have urged the importance of taking this matter seriously and 
upon living a sane and wholesome life in which work and play are 
properly balanced against each other. Real recreation is not to be 
confused with ordinary gymnastics, where only the body is exer- 
cised, since with the teacher the need is quite as much for a new 
set of mental pictures as it is for physical rest. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1, What in your own experience would lead you to consider teaching a 
trying occupation? 
2. How many teachers have you known who are past fifty-five years 
old? Were they rendering as good service as younger teachers? 
Were they showing their age more than people in other callings? 
8. Have you observed that teachers frequently have throat, nose, and 
eye troubles? Are teachers’ voices less soft and pleasing than you are 
accustomed to hearing on the street and in the store? 
4. In schools where you have taught or studied, what conditions do 
you recall that were injurious to the teacher’s health? 
5. Apply to a dozen schoolrooms the set of standards here presented. 
What are the results? 
6. What laws in your State are designed to protect the health of the 
teacher and pupils? Do you know of any State having laws that are 
better in these respects? 
7. Make out a list of books and magazines which you could recommend 
to teachers for vacation reading. What subjects in general do they 
cover? 
8. What percentage of your waking time during the past week have you 
devoted to exercise and recreation? How does this compare with 
other weeks? What kinds of exercise were included?  
-P-A-G-E-359

HEALTH AND RECREATION 347 
9. What have you read in the past month that afforded you real mental 
relaxation? 
10. Make out an ideal plan for your coming vacation. What would it 
cost to carry out the plan? Make out a plan that your salary would 
warrant your carrying out. 
11. What percentage of your salary this year has been spent for recreation 
and self-development, including reading matter, travel, entertain- 
ment? Is that a reasonable allowance?

1. The nature of supervision 
Supervision defined. Supervision is the practice or the art 
of assisting the teacher in the management and instruction 
of children. Although the term is generally applied more 
exclusively to strictly instructional rather than to manage- 
rial service, the distinction here is not of great importance, 
since in this book management is to so large an extent 
treated as instruction. As an art, supervision must be 
based as far as possible upon a science. 
This, however, is but an abstract statement, the true 
meaning of which appears only when we describe the situa- 
tion in which supervision is carried out. To understand 
supervision we must see its purpose, or the need that calls it 
into existence, and we must see the conditions under which 
it operates, and precisely how it operates. 
The need for supervision. The purposes of supervision 
are to be found in the actual need that exists for two im- 
portant types of service: first, helping the teacher with her
-P-A-G-E-361
THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 349 
work; and second, coérdinating the work of the many 
teachers and schools of a system. If it were left to the 
teacher to define her own need, or to state roughly when and 
where such need exists, there would in many instances be no 
supervision at all. This may be due to either of two facts. 
The teacher with little training and less experience often 
does not know that her work is poor, or where or why it is 
poor. Again, some teachers seem to resent supervision as 
an interference with their work. The former is a case where 
the teacher needs help, but is quite unconscious of her need; 
the latter is a case where, however conscious the teacher may 
be of her need, she believes that supervision is interference 
and not intended as genuine help. 
There is, however, a third type of teacher — one who 
studies her work, who finds her own weaknesses, and who 
earnestly seeks help from all sources. For such a teacher, 
supervision is a recognized need. 
To illustrate: Teacher 1, knowing little of the significance 
of individual differences in instruction, may be quite un- 
conscious of the loss that a very bright child is suffering be- 
cause his work is so easy, or she may fail to see that by chang- 
ing a child’s seat she will be able to get independent effort 
from several pupils who are quite behind their class. Teacher 
2 fears to have her work inspected. She is conceited, she is 
willing to hide her mistake, and she is apt to use coercive 
measures where her instructional skill is weak. She re- 
quires John to get his work or stay after hours. She sends 
work home, and with it, a note that John is failing. The 
purpose is to unload her own proper responsibilities on the 
parents. Teacher 3 asks for a conference with the super- . 
visor. She explains her problem, and then asks questions 
until she understands what to do and how to do it. 
The need for codrdination of the work of instruction, as 
between teachers and schools and courses, is equally obvious. 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  350 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
Grade six will mean nothing unless it has reference to a body 
of subject-matter that is the same in general (not neces- 
sarily in detail) for all sixth-grade classes, and unless there 
is a common standard of achievement for all who enter and 
are promoted from this grade. Similarly, the border line 
between grades and between types of schools, as elementary 
and junior high schools, for example, must be kept in order. 
Too often there is a “no-man’s-land,” of both content and 
method, in which a child is lost as he passes into high school. 
These lines must be kept closed, and it is a function of 
supervision to keep them so. 
In these illustrations we have a picture of the need for 
teaching and codrdinating assistance. Somehow the pro- 
fession must rid itself of these types of ignorance and pre- 
judice, and it must stimulate and reward the teacher who 
codperates and strives to improve her work. 
Growing complexity of school work. In a one-room rural 
school the school machinery consists of a board of trustees 
and a teacher. In a large city on the contrary, the school 
machinery consists of a board of education, a superintendent 
of schools, several assistant or deputy superintendents, 
supervisors, research and attendance officers, principals, 
regular teachers, special teachers, and visiting teachers and 
nurses, not to mention a complex staff of officers devoted to 
the development, maintenance, and operation of the school 
plant. The city system is only the little school grown large, 
and the added machinery is designed to maintain the unity of 
purpose and the intimate touch with the child that are so 
easy to maintain in the little school. 
With the development of large schools some specialization 
has been necessary and, in consequence, the teacher’s func- 
tions have been modified. In a sense, much of her old inde- 
pendence is gone, and she is now a part of a complex system. 
She has yielded certain responsibilities to others. In doing
-P-A-G-E-363
  THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 351 
this, however, she has found the opportunity to become a 
specialist in dealing with children. 
While specialization and division of labor are in every way 
desirable, yet we must remember that our labors can never 
be divided without someone’s keeping close watch over the 
line of division. Division must not mean separation in a 
full sense. All the offices in the school machinery exist for 
a purpose — the instruction of children. Accordingly they 
must work together to this end, each performing some part 
of the task, a task that has grown complex not only because 
of the great numbers of children, but also because of the 
wide diversity in their educational needs, and because of the 
new problems created by our modern civilization. 
Where coérdination is needed. Codrdination of the 
efforts of so many cannot be effected by good intentions 
alone. Instead, several kinds of effort will be required. 
First, there is the problem of seeing to it that educational 
facilities are provided for all parts of the city, and that the 
efforts of local neighborhoods do not conflict. It is very 
easy for this to happen if central control and codrdination 
is lacking. This is a direct responsibility of the superin- 
tendent’s office. 
Second, there must be some standardization of instruction, 
so that when a pupil moves from one locality to another he 
will find his place without loss of time. This can be done 
only if there is definite order in curricula, in standards of 
achievement, and in grading and promotional machinery. 
The development of such standards is the joint work of 
several people, but keeping the schools and the classes all 
working in conformity with accepted materials and norms 
is clearly the work of an officer whose duty it is to codrdinate 
the actual work of instruction. This is the function of the 
supervisors. 
Third, within the school there must be order as between 
 
-P-A-G-E-364
  352 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
classes. There is joint use by many classes of corridors, 
library, special rooms, playgrounds, and cafeteria, and so 
administrative as well as instructional adjustments must be 
made. These are the special duties of the principal, who is 
also in part a supervisor. 
There are many other points at which specialized machin- 
ery must be set up to effect cobrdination. The problem of 
the control of attendance; the care of health and of physical 
and social development; and the matter of records and re- 
ports as to attendance, progress in work, and health condi- 
tions all must be centralized in order that the machinery of 
control and management may support the plan of instruc- 
tion. Hence we have attendance departments, health 
clinics, nurses, playground directors, and clerical helpers. 
The machinery of supervision. Here we are especially 
concerned with the teacher’s contacts with those who are 
to supervise her work on instruction. This means the prin- 
cipal, and such general and special supervisors as may be 
placed in charge of her work. 
Fig. 8 gives us a chart of this machinery, and shows the 
lines of cleavage between the several functions. These lines 
are very clear in the chart, but in practice they are often less 
clear, and the result is not merely a conflict in authority, 
but a real lack of codrdinated effort with its consequent 
waste and unhappiness. 
To define the actual locus of authority in this picture we 
would say: 
1. All authority rests with the State. 
2. The board of education stands as the State’s authority to act, 
within limits of constitution and statute. 
8. The superintendent is the executive head of the board. 
The board delegates executive but not legislative authority 
to the superintendent. 
4. The superintendent delegates responsibility for: 
a, Business management to the business manager.

6. Supervision of instruction to an assistant superintendent, 
or to supervisors and principals. 
. Administration of each separate school to its principal. 
. Care of health to the medical supervisor. 
e. Physical education program to the physical training 
supervisor. 
f. Control of attendance to the attendance supervisor. 
g. Research and guidance to the supervisor of those func- 
tions. 
aus 
There must be definite placement of authority in such a 
machine. This is indicated by solid lines. It will be 
noticed that supervision is administered by an assistant 
superintendent of schools. This officer has control over 
curricula and standards of instruction, and in these matters 
he is final authority, though responsible to the superin- 
tendent. 
Other factors involved. In addition to persons, there are 
other features of the school machine with respect to which 
the teacher must carry on her work. The curriculum, the 
grading and promotional scheme, and the marking system 
are three important unifying instruments in a school system 
with reference to which all instruction must be conducted. 
The teacher must understand, at the outset, that she must 
know these instruments perfectly; she must not only know 
them as rules of procedure and as content to be taught, but 
she must understand just how they are to be applied in her 
room. 
These are not machines that destroy the individuality of 
the teacher; on the contrary they leave wide room for a 
selection of ways and means. They have been developed 
out of long experience, and they represent standards that 
are known to be attainable. The curriculum is at most only 
a bare skeleton. The promotional scheme is only a set of 
mileposts along the curriculum road, with rules for the 
direction of the traveler. The marking system is merely an 
 
-P-A-G-E-366
  354 " CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
exact language for defining success and failure. As instru- 
ments of order they are indispensable, and the work of the 
teacher must be kept in line with them.

Fig. 8. Macuinery Necessary TO THE SUPERVISION OF INSTRUCTION 
This is intended to show the machinery of supervision and how this machinery is related 
to other parts of the total school organization. 
Solid lines mean that the one above is in authority over the one below. 
Dotted lines mean that codrdination and codperation are necessary. 
The teacher’s place in supervision. With this brief analy- 
sis let us repeat : Supervision is the very complex function of 
improving instruction and of keeping the instructional work 
of a system codrdinated. It is made necessary in part by 
the development of large systems of schools, in part by the 
desirability of having system in our work, and in part by
-P-A-G-E-367
  
THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 855 
the fact that teachers desire to continue their training while 
in service. 
Since the need for this service comes in part from without 
and in part from within the classroom, and since it must end 
in better instruction, it is clear that the teacher is a central 
figure in the situation. Real help cannot be imposed from 
without; if it were, it would end in a set of standards enforced 
by inspection and penalties. To make it more than this the 
teacher must be an active partner in the performance of the 
function. She must, so far as is possible, find and define her 
own needs and be a responsible learner. She must under- 
stand the standards and norms to which her work is to con- 
form, and she must assist the supervisor in keeping it ad- 
justed to those norms. 
Let us view the function, then, as the conscious and 
united efforts of a group of people, including teacher, general 
and special supervisors, and principal, jointly responsible 
for improving and coérdinating the instructional service of 
the schools. In this view we must remember that super- 
vision is a codperative enterprise for the success of which the 
teacher, as well as the supervisor, is actively responsible. 
The need for the service must be sought out as much, or 
possibly more, by the teacher than by the supervisor. Su- 
pervision will be greatly improved only if teachers seek de- 
finite help in their work, and teachers alone can prevent. 
supervisors from acting as mere inspectors, or as lecturers 
carrying coals to Newcastle. 
Our further interest here will be to examine the chief 
types of supervisory service, and to show how the teacher 
must codperate, sometimes by leading the way, and again 
by following the lead of others, but always with the direct 
or indirect purpose of bettering instruction, always in the 
spirit of codperation, and always in the light of the results 
of scientific study.

2. The problems of supervision 
The main groups of problems. It is the purpose here to 
view supervision from the standpoint of the main problems 
faced by the teacher at work. These problems may be classi- 
fied in several ways, though the following classification will 
be serviceable here: 
. Problems in revising and interpreting courses of study 
. Problems in managing children 
. Problems in giving instruction 
. Problems in codrdinating instruction and management with 
the work of other teachers 
. Problems of an administrative and clerical nature 
He

et o 
These problems overlap somewhat, but each is a point of 
contact between the teacher and her supervisor and ad- 
ministrator. About these points the teacher’s responsibil- 
ities cluster, and it is in respect to these that the teacher 
will need to think of i improving her usefulness by perfecting 
her own knowledge, skill, and personality. Every teacher 
will do well, therefore, to consider carefully what part she is 
to play in the solution of each of these groups of problems. 
The course of study, group 1 above, in most schools is 
made and ready for use when the teacher begins work, yet 
a good course of study is always changing, and here the 
teacher has a responsibility, along with her principal, her 
supervisors, and her fellow teachers. Making and revising 
curricula is a joint enterprise. 
Group 2 is largely the work of the teacher while the pupils 
are in her room, but out of the room this work is a joint re- 
sponsibility shared by principal, teachers, nurse, playground 
supervisor, and to some extent by the janitor. 
Group 3 is the responsibility of the teacher, but always 
with assistance from supervisors. The same is true of group 
4, while for group 5 the teacher is largely responsible to the 
principal. 
 
-P-A-G-E-369
  THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 357 
The meaning of curriculum. Chapter XI of this book is 
devoted to the curriculum. There the meaning of a cur- 
riculum was developed, and an attempt was made to show 
how the word subject-matter is to be interpreted. From that 
discussion it was clear that courses of study and textbooks 
are but starting points from which the teacher leads the pu- 
pil out into the world of people and things. Each study is 
a separate path, as it were, leading outward from the child’s 
narrow world. It matters much where the path leads and 
how, yet single, separate paths do not make the contact with 
the world complete. Each path must be part of a system 
of paths which together so fully cover the territory round 
about that the child knows all the ground. This means that 
these paths are not only to lead to the world outside, but 
must also lead to one another. That is what makes courses 
of study into curricula. 
Making and revising courses of study. If this conception 
of the curriculum is ever realized in any school system it will 
be because it has been developed by those who are to ad- 
minister, supervise, and teach it. Such a curriculum cannot 
be factory-made, or in any sense handed down from above. 
To make and to keep it alive will require the continuous 
effort of the entire educational staff. The superintendent 
must set forth the general purposes of instruction around 
which buildings are erected, teachers employed, supervision 
organized, and curricula constructed. Back of this state- 
ment of purpose is his study of his community and its edu- 
cational needs. 
When the broad policy has been prepared by the super- 
intendent, its interpretation by his subordinates begins. 
The staff of supervisors and teachers must develop courses 
of study that express the general theory and policy. Todo 
this well will call for the joint effort of those who can bring 
to the work the point of view of the broad principles as they
-P-A-G-E-370
  358 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
apply in the system as a whole (city, or county, or township); 
the point of view of those who are to bear the direct re- 
sponsibility for its administration; and the point of view of 
the one who knows the children intimately. This means 
supervisors, principals, and teachers, and it applies equally 
whether the task is to make new courses or to revise old ones. 
Curriculum-making a joint enterprise. The details of 
making and revising courses of study cannot be treated ade- 
quately in less space than a volume. The purpose here is 
to note, first, that this is a continuous task in which the 
teacher has a definite responsibility and as definite an op- 
portunity. As a member of committees in conferences with 
others, the teacher brings her viewpoint to the work of col- 
lecting and organizing or reorganizing the materials of the 
various courses. Here she has her opportunity to get the 
larger community view of the work, to get an explanation of 
the points of contact between her own work and that of her 
colleagues, to make clear the support her own teaching needs 
from other courses, to analyze and clear up her objections 
to the textbooks she must use, to enlarge her own grasp of 
the question of utilizing outside materials through projects, 
and in general to make the courses her very own courses. 
All this work of the teacher must be emphasized both as 
duty owed to the system and as opportunity to serve and 
to enlarge her own interests in her work and her grasp of it. 
Further, if her principal, supervisor, and superintendent are 
of the old-fashioned dictatorial type, then she is entitled to 
~ urge these contributions as her proper professional right as 
well as duty. 
Interpreting the course of study. In the development of 
courses of study the teacher will find opportunity to clear up 
the meaning of many troublesome points in the content and 
the arrangement of both courses and textbooks. Even so, in 
the day’s work there arise many detailed problems of ad-
-P-A-G-E-371
THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 359 
justment. Here she will find need for her supervisor. In 
some cases, and for certain classes, it may be wise to depart 
from the regular outline or the text as arranged. This need 
may be suggested by the supervisor or the principal, or the 
teacher may wish to propose it. In any case she will need 
to determine precisely what the change is for, precisely how 
to make it, precisely what new or different materials will be 
required and how to obtain them, and how the change will 
affect the other parts of the course, the time schedule, and 
the courses to which her own course contributes. These 
matters will be the proper subject of personal and group 
conferences. If it is the teacher’s proposal, then she must 
ask for the conference and be prepared to set forth her sug- 
gestions in concrete terms, and to support them with sound 
theory. If the proposal comes from others she must become 
a responsible follower, sympathetic and codperative but at 
the same time critical, just as she would be critical of any 
proposals she herself would make, or just as she would wish 
others to be critical of them. 
Giving instruction. In the matter of giving instruction 
the teacher finds her most intimate contact with her super- 
visor. In the main this is a question of teaching method, 
and for that reason its fuller treatment does not belong in 
this book. It has been shown, however, that management 
also is essentially a problem of giving instruction, and so not 
widely different in either purpose or method from giving 
instruction in the usual sense. Teaching arithmetic is 
merely managing children’s minds in a given type of ex- 
perience. It requires attention to materials (subject-matter, 
supplies, and equipment); to present and past types of ex- 
perience of the children in which number or quantity was a 
factor; and to the present physical and mental attitudes and 
conditions of the pupils. The teacher teaches by managing 
all these factors in the situation. 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
    360 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
Let us assume that the teacher has a class in which ob- 
servation and tests have brought out the facts that the 
pupils vary widely in ability to comprehend what they read, 
in rate of reading, in interest in reading, and in types of 
reading materials they can handle. The teacher asks her 
supervisor to visit her class. In doing so she explains the 
above facts about the class, and what she knows and does | 
not know in regard to what to do. The plan of the recita- 
tion is explained in advance, and the supervisor knows then 
just what to watch for. After the visit a conference is held 
and the recitation is gone over in detail. The supervisor 
may point out two types of difficulties — one having to do 
with the children, the other with the teacher. The teacher 
supplements wherever she can, and then a program of 
“what to do” is worked out. 
Perhaps the children will be divided into homogeneous 
groups, and assignments fitted to each group. This will bea 
departure from the regular course of study, perhaps, but de- 
signed for a purpose. Aims and materials and methods will 
be gone over carefully, and arrangements will be made for 
the supervisor to demonstrate the class procedure. After 
this demonstration another conference takes up the teacher’s 
own weak points. These are carefully analyzed. Both she 
and the supervisor are frank, kind, and sympathetic. The 
outcome for the teacher is almost sure to be a larger grasp 
of her problem, an increased confidence that she can meet it, 
and genuine happiness over earnest effort and good results. 
Managing the children. If discipline and punishment are 
but types of instruction, as previous chapters have explained 
them to be, then the supervisor and the principal may 
properly concern themselves with problems of controlling 
and directing the children while in and out of class. 
It is in this feature of a teacher’s work that we find op- 
portunity to provide the child with occasion to put precepts
-P-A-G-E-373
THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 361 
into practice in conduct. Self-reliance, dependability, and 
a sense of responsibility to the group call for promptness, 
politeness, honesty, respect for the rights of others, neatness, 
and social and personal qualities that combine to make the 
good citizen. 
Developing a real sense of membership in the school group 
is, as elsewhere explained, one of the very most important 
responsibilities and opportunities that the school has. Ac- 
quiring that sense of membership is also one of the most 
difficult things a child has to learn. During recitation time 
the child is held in a somewhat formal way to a responsible 
place in the group; at best he is under some compulsion to 
act in accord with others. From this he learns much, to be 
sure. But on the playground or in the corridor he is more 
or less free to act as he pleases. He is held to right social 
standards there largely by force of his own preference or by 
public opinion. 
The teacher’s task of building up a body of public opinion, 
and of establishing social standards and norms of behavior 
are more difficult tasks by far than teaching any subject can 
be. The teacher who attacks this problem seriously as a 
teaching problem will have much need for advice and council 
from her principal and supervisor. This is not merely a 
task of building up a set of techniques for controlling the 
movements of children. It isfar more than that. All those 
regular procedures of entering and leaving, of collecting 
papers and supplies, of standing, sitting, and walking, of 
reciting, and of getting permission or excuse, are but the 
external mechanism of this society. The person and the 
motive behind these procedures is what counts. This ma- 
chinery must not run the children; it must provide the sim- 
ple, normal, and comfortable modes of behavior, or manner 
of expression. 
In this type of instruction each child is a special problem.
-P-A-G-E-374
    362 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
Stubbornness, selfishness, bad manners, ignorance, poor 
taste, awkwardness, slovenliness, bashfulness, conceit, and 
timidity, as well as a wide range of opposite qualities and 
traits, will be found in every classroom and in every school 
group. How to make a unified working society of this mix- 
ture of individualism, one where each child is sensitive to 
his group privileges and duties and where children learn to 
prefer to live up to proper social norms, is the problem. 
To accomplish this the teacher will study cases, and with 
the results of these studies will go into conference with the 
staff of the school, headed by the principal, where these 
cases will be examined and plans laid for overcoming her 
difficulties. The teacher here has large responsibility. She 
alone can know her pupils intimately and report the inner 
workings of their minds. Others may see their behavior, 
but she will know what is back of that behavior in the form 
of wrong motive, bad training, or ill health. Together, and 
only together, can the staff of the school set all the right 
forces to work in accord with a plan that is designed to make 
the school a real society of which each pupil is a conscious 
and contented and participating member. 
Administration responsibilities. Many of the problems 
above suggested are in a manner administrative in character. 
There is no sharp line that marks a division between admin- 
istrative and supervisory duties, or between teaching and 
administering in a school system. The administrative ma- 
chine supports all processes — supervisory, managerial, and 
instructional — and the teacher should understand her re- 
sponsible contacts with this machine and in proper measure 
participate in its operation. 
Constructing curricula, devising uniform marking and 
grading systems, classifying and promoting children, making 
out records and reports, managing such school projects as 
require preparation in the way of getting equipment, and
-P-A-G-E-375
  THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 363 
conferring with business or social groups outside the school 
are illustrations of activities in which the teacher has a place 
in the processes of administering the school. In these con- 
tacts she will find opportunity to enlarge the scope of her 
service and to broaden her social as well as her professional 
horizon. 
3. The methods of supervision 
Emphasis on duties rather than rights. As noted above, 
supervision is a function in which the teacher has a positive 
and a responsible part. Even though she may be adminis- 
tratively subordinate to her supervisor and principal, yet 
she must remember that where her supervisors in office 
have rights they also have responsibilities. Also, she must 
remember that subordinates are most useful when they are 
willing to assume responsibilities, when they are willing 
to think, and when they are frank enough to express an 
honest difference of opinion or to offer a suggestion to 
supplement proposals of superiors. In this the teacher 
must learn to stand on her own feet — not in order to de- 
fend her rights (unless they need to be defended), but rather 
in order to do her full duty as a contributing partner in the 
supervision-instruction enterprise. 
Teachers’ Meetings. How can I make my teachers’ 
meetings worth while? This is a question which every live 
principal asks himself. It cannot be done if these meetings 
lack a definite purpose or program; if at them the principal 
lectures his teachers as he would a group of erring children; 
if they are the place where everyone feels called upon to 
offer complaints, or if they are the place where announce- 
ments and cautions and reminders hold the right of way. 
The meetings can be successful if all come with the idea of 
contributing. Teachers destroy the value of meetings, 
almost as often as do principals, by their worried looks, their
-P-A-G-E-376
  364 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
inattention, their tardiness, their seeming indifference, their 
haste to get away, and their too much talk and argument. 
In properly conducted teachers’ meetings alone can some 
of the things which are above suggested be accomplished. 
The teacher must go to learn and to help others to learn. 
The field to be covered by the meetings is as wide as the 
school. 
Section 2 above is a basis for suggestions as to types of 
subjects and purposes. When the purpose of the meeting 
is announced the teacher should at once begin to consider 
how she can contribute, and what she may reasonably expect 
to gain from the meeting. Let us say a meeting is called to 
discuss the results of a series of tests given throughout the 
school. At once the teacher will make a list of the questions 
which she would like answered. Why did John score so 
high? He is no student at all, often absent, and more or 
less indifferent. Why is her class so varied? Why is it on 
the average above or below the norm? These and many 
questions she should think over. Having done so, she will 
go to the meeting with a purpose, with a real interest, and 
with something to offer. 
The teacher should not assume that the principal is the 
only one who is responsible for finding subjects or problems 
for the teachers’ meetings. At least half of the problems 
for such meetings arise in the classroom under the imme- 
diate observation of the teacher. The need for more and 
better-adapted books, maps, and pictures to supplement her 
work, the problem of general lack of neatness in dress and in 
care of school property, the need for concerted effort in 
teaching manners and proper taste in dress, the question of 
promotion in the case of certain types of pupils, the question 
of poor attendance and tardiness — these and similar pro- 
blems often appear to individual teachers first of all. These 
may very properly be brought up as possible subjects to be 
dealt with by the faculty together.
-P-A-G-E-377
  THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 365 
Group conferences. Special groups — primary teachers, 
teachers of mathematics, teachers of science — may wisely 
meet in conference under their supervisor to discuss pro- 
blems of instruction in their special branches or problems that 
pertain to their work in a particular way. Illustrations 
would be the problem of beginning work in silent reading, 
the proper use of phonetics, the technique of teaching a given 
subject, the correlating of one subject with another, ma- 
terials for use in projects, measuring the efficiency of pu- 
pils, revision of curriculum materials, and such allied topics 
as these may suggest. 
Such conferences are the meetings of specialists engaged in 
the solution of special problems; their tasks may be narrow, 
but they may hope to be more technical and to go deeper 
into the details of the work. 
Reading-circle work. If supervision is devoted to the 
tasks of perfecting aid codrdinating the work of instruction, 
then reading circles should provide a useful and a stimulat- 
ing method of work. In another chapter the question of 
self-improvement of teachers has been dealt with, and sug- 
gestions for the teacher’s professional reading were offered 
in some detail. The reading circle, in which meetings are 
held to discuss the books, is an excellent place for bringing 
the fruits of the reading to bear directly upon the work of 
the schools. 
Let us assume, by way of illustration, that a circle of fif- 
teen readers has just completed part of a new book on the 
elementary school curriculum. The problem to be dis- 
cussed at the meeting has to do with the general meaning 
and nature of curricula. At a regular meeting someone will 
be asked to present a brief résumé of the chapters. This is 
completed in five minutes, and is carefully supplemented by 
others in another five. Previously it has been arranged 
that one member will speak for five minutes on “‘what cur-
-P-A-G-E-378
  366 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
ricula are for.” She will have read several books and will 
explain Dewey’s conception. Another will be prepared, in 
a similar way, to discuss “what makes a fact or an activity 
into subject-matter.”” Another will discuss “The city hall 
or the courthouse as a source of curriculum material.” 
These short speeches will in each case lead out from the 
centrai theme of the circle book, so that each represents 
an interpretation and application of the book’s meaning. 
Finally, over a cup of tea perhaps, this thirty minutes of 
formal speaking will be followed by informal discussion of 
the book and its applications in the present work of the 
schools. 
Such work as this is cultural in a real sense. It is highly 
professional, and it is intellectually and socially stimulating 
and recreative in a large way. It will do more to give 
broad perspective to the work of the schools than any single 
kind of professional study, and stands as an excellent in- 
surance against professional shortsightedness. 
ae As a means for extending su- 
pervisory helpfulness;there is nothing that can replace 
the value of demonstration teaching. To see another teach 
a class in accordance with a prearranged aim and method is 
of great value to a teacher. We learn much by imitation 
and carefully directed observation, and teachers should call 
on their supervisors for such assistance. The technique 
of questioning a class in a way that brings out the timid 
and exposes the blatant pupil, and that develops interest in 
real inquiry is an art as well as a science, and the art aspect 
can be grasped most readily by seeing the thing done. 
Visiting other teachers. Visiting other teachers is a 
means of extending the idea of observation and demonstra- 
tion work. Visiting other teachers at work has excellent 
supervision possibilities, if it is well planned. First, there 
must be a purpose and a plan of study, and this should be
-P-A-G-E-379
  THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 367 
determined upon in advance, with the help of the principal 
or supervisor. Second, a place to visit must be chosen with 
this purpose in mind. Third, the teacher must regard the 
visit as work, and prepare to give a good account of it later 
to her supervisor in private conference. Fourth, the visitor 
and the supervisor are paying a compliment to the teacher 
visited and may reasonably expect that questions will be 
answered gladly. 
It is well for both parties#6 know in advance what the 
recitation is to try to demonstrate, and the plan and the 
methods that are to be used. It is quite proper to make such 
special arrangements, even to the extent of setting aside 
regular work for the occasion and providing for a conference 
immediately after the recitation. 
Individual conferences. After a supervisor has observed 
a recitation a private conference should follow. In such a 
conference the teacher should have in mind what she would 
like to ask, and she should not let the conference close until 
she has a clear notion of exactly what was good and what 
was poor about her work. To attempt to explain away the 
weaknesses is to discourage the supervisor from telling the 
whole truth. To show a disposition to be depressed and dis- 
couraged may have a similar effect. To resent honest criti- 
cism is the best proof of unfitness. On the other hand, to 
accept it when it seems unfair or in error is very wrong. 
The teacher must stand on her own feet and not allow her- 
self to be the victim of an inferiority complex. It is possible 
for a teacher to differ with a good supervisor, and, since 
it is the only means of clearing the situation, is often worth 
while for her to do so. 
The use of exhibits. A very excellent means of super- 
Genet Che asa od eabthite. The material can be shown in 
a special place — for example, spare space in the superin- 
tendent’s offices. These exhibits should consist of the a
-P-A-G-E-380
  368 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
actual products of the schools, and should cover all fields and 
types of work. Compositions, maps, paintings, drawings, 
penmanship, wood work, sewing, millinery, pasteboard con- 
struction, and project work of various kinds may be shown, 
all in wide variety and in profusion. { 
Such an exhibit, open at all hours, and with the articles 
fully and clearly labeled, is a mine of information for the 
teacher, and will prove a stimulus to the pupils as well. 
Experiment and investigation. The basis of good teach- 
ing must be sound knowledge. The art of teaching is 
based upon facts. Facts about children — their bodies 
and their minds; facts about curricula — what they are 
made of, and how they are organized; and facts about school 
buildings and equipment — all are of value. Our know- 
ledge of these factors, and of how each is involved in a teach- 
ing situation, is as yet inadequate. Our explorations in 
these fields must be carried forward in the schools them- 
selves if we hope ever to arrive at the full truth. This 
means that researches of all kinds, including experiments, 
must be carried on by both teachers and school officers. 
The teacher’s place in such work is an important one. 
Without her intelligent codperation we can never secure the 
full truth about the laws of learning and of teaching. Ac- 
cordingly the modern teacher must be trained in the ele- 
ments at least of scientific method, and she must be ready 
to assume responsibility in the investigations that must be 
carried on in the schools. 
Such work is indispensable in a modern school or school 
system. The results obtained will be needed in answering 
questions, and so will often be turned to as a means of ex- 
plaining and overcoming difficulties; they will often serve as 
a means, too, for looking ahead into the future. The spirit 
of scientific inquiry must pervade all school procedure, 
and, however much we may rely upon professional super-
-P-A-G-E-381
  
THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 369 
vision, little or no real progress will be made until we begin 
to utilize the methods and the technique of modern research. 
4. Measuring teaching efficiency 
Being judged. The function of supervision cannot be 
sharply separated from certain other functions. Its rela- 
tion to that of giving instruction is intimate and obvious, 
but its relation to the functions of inspection and adminis- 
tration is almost as close. 
Not only in education, however, but in whatever occupa- 
tion we follow, we are certain to be judged as to our effi- 
ciency and to be rather definitely rated as to our capacity 
for useful service. The merchant is judged and rated by 
his customers, and his profits rise or fall with the rating 
he receives. So it is with the barber, the plumber, the 
baker, the lawyer, the minister, and the doctor. The em- 
ployee of the bank, of the store, of the construction en- 
gineer, of the road boss, and of any and all fields where serv- 
ice is purchased and paid for, is rated for worth, and wages 
or salaries are raised or lowered in accordance with that 
rating. It cannot be otherwise in teaching. The teacher is 
in a real world, and must compete for her place in it. 
When this point is fully recognized our immediate thought 
is of how we are to be judged. This is everywhere an im- 
portant matter. The business and the professional man 
and the tradesman complain of being unfairly judged. 
When we look at the ethics of the business world we see that 
there is much misjudging and false rating all along the line. 
This is true to some extent in all the professions, and is 
likely to remain so. Surely the teaching profession should 
not sit by and allow such a condition to continue without an 
effort to remedy the situation. Far from it. A system of 
sound ethics will not build itself up of its own initiative; 
it must be made a matter of conscious study and effort.  
-P-A-G-E-382
  370 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
Who should rate the teacher. There are two things that 
the teacher is concerned about, viz., who shall rate her, and 
how the rating is to be made. We may never fully rule out 
jealousy and influence and malice, but we may reasonably 
hope to rule out a considerable proportion of error. 
We should at least insist that in the teaching profession 
this rating shall be made by one who is competent to judge. 
This may be provided for in either of two ways. We 
may appoint inspectors whose special work it is to judge of 
the fitness of all workers, or we may accept the judgments of 
those in the system whose regular work puts them in a 
position to know the facts. Certainly no teacher would 
choose the former method, even if it were feasible as a mat- 
ter of expense. Where, then, would the duty fall by the 
latter method? Obviously on supervisors and principals, 
who alone have intimate knowledge of the teacher’s work. 
With supervision, then, there must inevitably be asso- 
ciated this function of inspection. This is a fact not to be 
resented but to be recognized. Inspection gives the teacher 
every possible opportunity to market her ability at its true 
value. Much the same things count here as would count 
if the teacher were a clerk, a bookkeeper, a stenographer, 
a cook, a scrub-woman, or a nurse — frankness, honesty, 
sincere effort, industry, knowledge of the task, neatness, ge- 
niality, and the many other traits which these suggest. 
Above all there is the opportunity to demonstrate the abil- 
ity to grow under instruction. 
How may ratings be made. With these favorable chances 
of being fairly rated, how shall the ratings be made? Two 
methods have been used. Rough general estimates have 
been used, and rating scales or score cards. The former 
method was employed exclusively until recent years, and 
its weaknesses are well known; the latter method has been 
undertaken only in recent years, but shows excellent pro- 
mise.
-P-A-G-E-383
  
THE TEACHER AND SUPERVISION 371 
In case of failure, a teacher ought, if possible, to find out 
specifically why she has failed. By so doing she may hope 
to overcome the weakness and remain in the profession. 
The teaching profession must grow and improve. It must 
not lose members who have been trained, and who by intelli- 
gent effort may be able to succeed. From this broader 
standpoint, therefore, the teacher should know why and 
how she has failed. Herein we find reason to say that the 
profession must require the school authorities to state fully 
why the teacher is to be dismissed. 
Jn justice to the teacher, then, and also as a means of 
bettering the profession, we need, and must have, specific 
knowledge as to the nature of teaching failure. This ap- 
plies with equal force in cases of success. Why and how 
teachers fail and succeed being a matter of importance, 
from the standpoint of justice and from the standpoint of 
the development and the stabilization of the profession, we 
must have ratings based upon definite knowledge. These 
can be had only if we rate in definite terms. 
No one is so competent to do this as are those to whom 
the teacher looks for specific and sympathetic help in her 
work. Inasmuch as such a rating device is of great value to 
the teacher as a means of analyzing her strong and weak 
points, and so is of much value as a means for self-improve- 
ment, a discussion of this device has been treated in that 
connection in an earlier chapter. 
5. Chapter summary 
In this chapter we have been concerned with the teacher’s inter- 
ests and responsibilities in the problems of supervision. We have 
thought of supervision from the standpoint of the actual needs the 
teacher has for assistance in her work. These needs are two: help 
in her own work direct, and help in coérdinating her work with that 
of others. The nature of the machinery for accomplishing these 
ends was explained, and emphasis was placed upon the fact that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-384
  372 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
success of supervision depends upon the genuine codperation of the 
whole group of workers, including the teacher, and that each has a 
positive part to perform. 
In section 2 of the chapter the problems of supervision were 
analyzed and classified. It was shown that the teacher reasonably 
may expect assistance in all her work, and the nature of her contact 
with her supervisor in each type of work was suggested. The 
teacher’s duties were grouped under five general heads, 1, making 
and revising curricula; 2, managing her pupils; 3, giving instruction; 
4, codrdinating her work with that of other teachers; and 5, ad- 
ministrative and clerical duties. 
From each of these types of work, cases were presented to show 
the nature of the function of supervision and the nature of the 
teacher’s contact with the supervisor. At every point emphasis 
was laid upon the positive, constructive, and aggressive attitude 
which a teacher should assume, as opposed to the mere receptive 
attitude which so many teachers have. While the teacher should 
be receptive to the ideas of her supervisor, she should also help to 
shape the work of the supervisor by contributing something out of 
her own knowledge and experience. Especially, too, was it pointed 
out that a teacher is responsible for trying to find and define her 
own difficulties, and then for getting these before her supervisor and 
seeing to it that she receives real help on them. 
The methods of supervision through teacher’s meetings, group 
conferences, reading circles, demonstration teaching, individual 
conferences, visiting other teachers, the use of exhibits, and of ex- 
periments and research were discussed, and the ways in which the 
teacher could contribute and how she could obtain help were ex- 
plained. Here emphasis was placed upon a proper attitude and 
effort, where the teacher seeks to learn and to help others rather 
than to guard her rights. 
Finally, the connection between the functions of supervision 
and inspection, and the place and nature of inspection as a neces- 
sary function and one which no one could perform so well as the 
supervisor, were explained, and teacher-rating was shown to be not 
only necessary but a desirable method of inspection as well. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Define the term “supervision.” 
2. Show how supervision is a distinct function and yet is related to the 
functions of instruction, administration, and management.

procedures that may be useful in managing a class in a large school. 
For each item in the list work out an explanation of how it may be 
used as an end and as a means in training. How could this be made 
the subject of a teacher’s meeting? 
. Outline in detail plans for each of the following situations:

1. The teacher’s position 
Origin and place of the school. The teacher stands at the 
immediate point of contact between the school, as an insti- 
tution for the education of the people on the one hand, and 
the home and community life of the people on the other, and 
so must become an important working factor in each. She 
must remember that originally the school was not a sepa- 
rate institution. Children were taught by their parents, 
and only with the growing complexity of life did the home 
call in a teacher from the outside to direct the training of the 
children. The school of to-day is in its origin only a special- 
ization of this simple practice. To restore it to its place as 
a real factor in the home and community life, is to do, then, 
not a new, but rather a very ancient thing. 
Making the school effective. This means that the teacher 
must live among her patrons, enter into their community 
activities, and assume there the normal responsibilities of 
citizenship. How to find her way into the hearts of the
-P-A-G-E-388
  3876 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
people and into their community enterprises, to bring with 
her the real message which the school must have, and to 
carry back from the life of the people the best it can give 
to the school, is a task which should command the best in 
energy, time, and imagination of any man or woman.

forces to-the end that education shall become a lar 
_permanent-interest_ among the people, old and young — an 
interest not separated from, but intimately interwoven 
with, every other interest of worth in maintaining and en- 
riching their lives. 
2. The teacher’s relation to home and community life 
Making school work vital. Just how to develop this phase 
of teaching is what the teacher wants to know. A work that 
is wider than the school hours, wider than books, wider than 
relationship to children alone; that seeks to push the school 
into the home and the shop, and to bring the home and the 
shop into the school; that uses the economic and social life 
of the neighborhood as its laboratory, and the school in turn 
as the common center for the neighborhood’s social life — 
how can this traditional, narrow, schoolmastery task be 
stretched to such proportions? ! 
Those who have recently succeeded in building up their 
schools along these lines are teachers who have not only 
1 More concrete suggestions than can be given in the short space here 
may be got by reading the following books, which are stories of just how 
such work had been built up. While their humor and pathos make them 
interesting in themselves, and excellent portrayals of human nature, yet 
these qualities do not hide the splendid educational messages they are 
meant to convey to teachers and parents. Wray, Angelina, Jean Mitchel’s

insisted that “education is life,” 1 but have turned this 
definition about and tried to realize also that “life is educa- 
tion”; and in their schools have sought to interpret home 
and community life to the children. This means: 
1. That their curricula have gone outside of books for many of 
their materials. 
2. That their methods have benefited by suggestions from the 
normal behavior of children when they were working and 
playing at home or on the street. 
8. That their management has utilized motives and incentives 
that were found to be effective in life outside the school. 
4. That their schoolhouses have not remained sacred to child- 
hood and to book learning alone. 
5. That their schools have been of, by, and for the people, and 
hence the people were permitted to know intimately of their 
purposes, their means, and their results. 
6. Finally, that the teachers were themselves citizens of the com- 
munities they served. 
Elsewhere? have been presented illustrations of what it 
means to supplement the curriculum with materials drawn 
from life outside the school, and to utilize in methods and 
management such motives as are known to be effective 
when the child works and plays unhindered, but it remains 
here to be suggested to the teacher that the tiny drainage 
systems a few steps from her window, the offices and books 
of the city street department, the innumerable family 
grocery bills, the habitat of the friendly toad in the flower 
garden, the daily papers, the work of the city health depart- 
ment, and the ancient landmarks of the community, will 
not marshal themselves unaided into her geography, civics, 
arithmetic, nature study, reading, hygiene, and history ma- 
terials. These things must be found and taken to the class, 
or, better still, where convenient, the class should be taken 
to them.

There are few laymen who are not quick to see the im- 
portance of these things and to help in making them avail- 
able for school use when requested. The health officer in his 
laboratory can do more in a half hour to establish correct 
notions of public sanitation than can be done by textbook 
methods in a week. No prosecuting attorney or police 
judge is too busy to present to the classes in civics some- 
thing of the practical workings of the laws referred to in 
their textbooks. It remains only for the teacher to coér- 
dinate and direct these forces. 
Putting the home to work. In addition to selecting ma- 
terials from outside, and calling upon a few individuals to 
render some specific service, the teacher must also put the 
home to work. The child is at home more than he is any- 
where else, and the home must be kept consciously at work 
with his education if our home-school-community relation- 
ship is to be maintained. That idea has been successfully 
developed in numerous rural and city schools by granting 
school credit for home work.! This is a direct means of 
making normal, healthful home life educative, and that in a 
large and important sense. Each child is assigned some 
definite work to do, such as building fires, caring for stock, 
washing dishes, sweeping, or any other of the hundred tasks 
that too frequently fall to mother to do, or are paid for out 
of the family earnings. 
Making the school a social center. In the last decade 
much has been said and written about the school as a social 
center.2 Before the building of cities and factories, before 
the vast expansion of the corporate method of doing busi- 
ness, people lived mostly in the country, and on the farm 
1See Alderman, L. R., School Industrial Credit and Home Industrial 
Work. In Massachusetts some home-project work is required as a part of 
all courses in agriculture given in the State-aided schools.

all the essential processes of our civilization were carried 
out. Then each community was practically sufficient to 
itself. Life was simple, and, owing to the numerous occu- 
pations present, and to the methods of neighborly exchange 
of labor, it was varied. To-day this is all changed. Occu- 
pations are mechanized and specialized, and the possibility 
and occasion for the old husking bee, barn-raising, and com- 
munity harvesting have disappeared. The home, once on 
most intimate terms with all the homes near by, is now 
isolated, and if any social intercourse is had with neighbors 
some artificial reason for providing the opportunity has first 
to be figured out. The result in rural sections has been 
loneliness and social disintegration, while in the city it is a 
problem of congestion with its inevitable consequence, the 
slum. 
The school has been called upon to meet this need. To 
do this the school must become in fact a “social center.” 
In many places, and in a wide variety of ways, this has been 
accomplished. In some States definite laws governing 
social center activities have been enacted. 
Beginning the work at home. How can this be done? 
First of all, it is the proper business of the teacher to initiate 
such a movement if it is not already started. To do this it 
is wiser to begin with her own immediate needs for the school, 
rather than to attempt to organize forces entirely discon- 
nected with her position. What is our special school need, 
should be her first question to herself. Perhaps it is fresh 
additions to the library, or other teaching equipment. Per- 
haps it is a plot of ground for nature study and gardening; or 
pictures to ornament the schoolroom; or better toilet facili- 
ties; or a jacketed stove with better arrangements for ventila- 
tion; or sanitary drinking-fountains; or flowers and shrub- 
bery for the grounds; or almost any of a hundred things that 
teacher and principal can quickly name.
-P-A-G-E-392
  380 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
Once parents are apprised of these needs it is easy to find 
some one, possibly an organization, to espouse the school’s 
cause. Meetings of those interested are called at the school- 
house, and the situation is fully gone into and discussed. 
Perhaps recommendations will be made to the school board, 
perhaps other organizations are called in, and finally a par- 
ent-teachers’ association or a public welfare club of some 
sort will take form. If so, it will be an organization with its 
work already outlined. 
Extension from school to community. From an open 
neighborhood discussion of school needs may naturally de- 
velop, with little guidance, discussion of other community 
needs, such as good roads; supervision of moving-picture 
programs; joint purchasing or marketing facilities; cleaner 
and more artistic streets; better public health protection; a 
larger schoolhouse, with assembly hall and moving-picture 
facilities; a branch of the public library for the school; an 
extra teacher; a supervisor of play and community recrea- 
tion; and other greater and lesser needs. 
Occasionally the school children will furnish an evening’s 
entertainment, at which time a full display of all kinds of 
school and home-project work may be made. Other enter- 
tainments will be provided by the combined musical talent 
of the neighborhood; or an outside speaker will be brought 
in to discuss some important local issue of a political, social, 
religious, economic, or educational character. Thus the 
people are drawn together along natural lines, the com- 
munity is energized and stabilized, and the school, instead 
of being isolated and neglected, is drawn into natural and 
essential alignment with other local interests, and serves an 
extensive social as well as educational need. In this broader 
educational scheme, the teacher occupies a place of leader- 
ship and responsibility among the people, while the people 
know more intimately than they did formerly what the
-P-A-G-E-393
  THE TEACHER AT WORK 381 
school is doing, and consciously share its burdens as they 
share in all other local enterprises.! 
8. The teacher’s relation to the school system 
The teacher is but a single link in the long chain of officers 
and materials concerned with the training of children. She 
plays a single part in a large program, and must therefore 
understand that program, and the other players in it, if she 
is not to miss her cue and spoil the play. The State, the 
community, and the home are all concerned that this pro- 
gram shall be a success, and, aside from the direct and in- 
direct assistance rendered by each, there has been set up a 
complex educational machine consisting of State and local 
superintendents, principals, supervisors, and teachers for 
carrying on this work. It is only by hearty codperation 
among these officers that any large educational service can 
be rendered. 
Her relation to the superintendent. Aside from realizing 
that every school is a State institution, and that teachers 
are State officers, responsible to State authorities for a 
proper performance of their duties, the teacher’s first con- 
cern is with the city, county, or township superintendent of 
schools. This officer is expected to lay out and direct the 
general school policy for a large number of schools. Just 
what this policy is, and how it affects her interpretation of 
the curriculum, and the organization and management of 
her daily work, it is the teacher’s business to know. To do 
this she should know her superintendent personally, where 
possible; she should know something of his ambitions for 
the school system as a whole; she should learn all she can

school as is here suggested, and for suggestive programs of meetings, see

Education, Madison, Wisconsin, Bulletin no. 18, 1913. 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  382 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
of his methods of work; she should hear his addresses, and 
read his bulletins and reports — and through these means 
try to catch the spirit of his office and to feel the inspiration 
of his leadership. In rural or small communities she will 
often go directly to him with her own problems, receive in- 
structions from him and render reports to his office. 
Her relation to the principal. It is to the principal the 
teacher must look for the intimate and detailed suggestions 
and instructions about her daily work. She is teaching a 
single grade, or perhaps a single subject in several grades. 
She has entire charge of a group of children for one of the 
eight years they spend in the school, or of a number of 
classes in one subject through several years. In either case 
she is dealing with a part of a larger whole. She is carrying 
out a single section of an eight-year curriculum, and is 
directing a single cross section of the child’s development. 
The beginning teacher, in particular, will early need to learn 
that her task is not an isolated one, and that her teaching 
will be effective only when it is intimately codrdinated with 
that of the whole teaching force. This codrdination it is 
the business of the principal to effect. He will do it by sug- 
gestions, and at times by specific directions, to his teachers. 
The teacher, therefore, must understand that the prin- 
cipal is the highest authority in the school, and that it is her 
part to assist him in carrying out his policy of education for 
that community. This teacher-principal relationship, in 
many ways the most important single relationship in our 
whole educational scheme, is very often misinterpreted by 
both principals and teachers. 
The occasional principal. An occasional principal feels 
called upon to exercise his authority at every turn, and is 
satisfied with his accomplishment only when his teachers fear 
him. This principal hews exactly to the line. If his cur- 
viculum calls for compositions of three paragraphs in the
-P-A-G-E-395
  
THE TEACHER AT WORK 383 
sixth grade, then three it must be or the teacher will receive 
4 demerit mark. 
Such principals are rapidly giving place to a new type 
of educational director who rules by virtue of a scientific 
understanding of his work, and by personal qualities of 
leadership, rather than by authority which has been dele- 
gated to him. Such a principal deals with facts and with 
personalities; gives directions, rather than orders; leads, 
rather than drives; and expects his teachers to think for 
themselves. 
Unnecessary misunderstandings between teacher and 
principal. Teachers cannot always select their own princi- 
pals, but no teacher should sacrifice her own individuality, 
to say nothing of depraving the true rights and responsibili- 
ties of the teacher’s office by becoming a mere servant to an 
unreasoning boss. There is danger, however, of errors on 
the teacher’s part also. The efficient principal must conduct 
his business with dispatch. Frequently he cannot stop to 
explain fully his reasons for the directions he gives; fre- 
quently he must decide things in faculty meetings, when 
there is indecision or a pronounced difference of opinion 
among the teachers; frequently he cannot grant all the re- 
quests that come to his office. The teacher of narrow 
vision often mistakes these as personal rebukes to herself. 
What is needed by each is, first, a thorough understanding 
of their respective rights and duties; second, an absolutely 
open and aboveboard method of dealing with each other; 
third, a real desire for, and effort at, codperation; and, finally, 
a high sense of loyalty to each other and to the essential 
purposes of the school. 
The efficient principal. The principal is expected to give 
a clear interpretation of the curriculum as he desires it to be 
executed, but leaves to the teacher the details of carrying 
on the work. He outlines the plan of organization for the
-P-A-G-E-396
  384 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
children, for the materials of the curriculum, for directing 
playground activities, and trusts to the intelligence of his 
teachers to find the best methods of putting the plans into 
effect. He defines the character and amount of the know- 
ledge and skill along given lines which he expects the chil- 
dren to have at a given time, but leaves the teacher quite 
free to say just how she will accomplish those ends. He 
orders supplies and equipment, but does not dictate the de- 
tails of their use. 
In all these things the efficient principal will necessarily 
draw heavily upon the judgment of the teacher. He will 
make promotions, but very much more in terms of the 
teacher’s judgment than in terms of any test he can apply. 
He will determine upon a plan for conducting fire drills, 
and for the entrance and exit of the children, but only with 
the most careful assistance of the teachers, who are to be in 
charge. He will make up the term or annual budget for the 
school, but very largely in terms of estimated needs sup- 
plied by the teachers. He may administer the more severe 
cases of discipline, but it will always be after consultation 
with the teacher in charge. 
The teacher’s relation to the supervisor. Aside from the 
principal there will be in many schools one or more special 
supervisors of defined fields of work, such as a supervisor of 
music, of domestic science, of writing, or of drawing. It is 
the business of this officer to outline and give intimate direc- 
tion to the instruction in the subject in question. This out~ 
line, with more or less detailed specifications, the teacher is 
expected to carry out. In doing this she is working as an 
assistant under the directions of an expert, and her success 
will depend upon her ability to learn from the expert and to 
carry out his directions in conducting her recitations. This 
important relationship is more fully explained in chapter 
XIX.
-P-A-G-E-397
  THE TEACHER AT WORK 385 
4. The teacher’s preparation for work 
Daily routine. Elsewhere we have discussed the general 
preparation and growth of the teacher. Here it is desirable 
to consider the question of her daily preparation for the 
tasks in hand. Each day brings its problems of routine and 
its new problems, and without some definite preparation 
the procedure is likely to become too stereotyped in one case 
and too halting and uncertain in another. The nature and 
extent of preparation will vary slightly from day to day, but 
the following items will appear fairly regularly on every 
teacher’s daily program: Preparation of lesson to be taught; 
preparation of assignments; getting the necessary materials 
and equipment ready; careful consideration of special cases 
of deficiency in discipline or in scholarship, with preparation 
for meeting them; records and reports to be made; and room 
to be put in order. The time for doing most of these things 
is the evening before. 
Lesson plans. What is involved in preparing the lessons 
to be taught? Let us examine as an illustration such prepa- 
ration for a beginning teacher, for it is only necessary to 
remove a few details and shorten the written plans to make 
such a case suitable for experienced teachers as well. First, 
the entire lesson should be gone over in order to see exactly 
what it includes, how it is related to previous lessons, and 
the extent to which it will need to be supplemented by 
other materials. This done, the next step is to find the 
materials to be used, and to determine what things the 
children are to use and how they are to use them. Finally, 
make brief notes in a “daily lesson-plan book” on what is 
to be used, and the steps in the procedure. There will be 
books, or papers, or pictures, or objects of one sort or an- 
other to get together; possibly the class is to be taken out- 
side for a study of the school gardens or of the habitat of 
some wild flowers or insects close by; and all these things
-P-A-G-E-398
  386 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
must be seen and very definite plans made for handling 
them in the classroom, or for handling the class out of doors. — 
Assignment; special cases; records. The preparation of 
assignments must be made in a similar manner, and written 
plans must make clear where the materials are, how they are 
to be got by the children, and how the lesson is related to 
the one just recited. There need be no great amount of 
formality about these plans, except that at first they should 
be made rather full and specific, and so that they can be 
readily understood by the principal, who will look them over 
from time to time in order to help the young teacher to get a 
right start. 
Then there are special cases to prepare for. John is be- 
hind and is rapidly losing interest in language. What he 
needs is a real motive for wanting to use language. Simi- 
larly, cases of discipline may often be foreseen and obviated. 
by the exercise of a little ingenuity on the evening before 
they are to be dealt with. 
Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the wisdom of 
making up school records at the end of each day, before 
leaving school. Such a plan guarantees greater accuracy, 
relieves the teacher’s mind, and facilitates the work of the 
principal or attendance officer in case such records are 
wanted in the teacher’s absence. 
5. Conserving time 
Planning the day. In all these things the teacher must 
learn that most precious of arts, the art of conserving time. 
A keen time sense is an important part of every teacher’s 
equipment. Along with the teacher’s motto, “A place for 
everything and everything in its place,” should go, “A time 
for everything and everything on time,” and “Do it now.” 
No teacher can spare half her evenings for social diversion 
without placing a serious drain upon her time and energy.
-P-A-G-E-399
THE TEACHER AT WORK 387 
There should be set aside a certain portion of the evening of 
each work day for definite preparation for the next day’s 
tasks, and another portion for reading on the program sug- 
gested on page 325. The after-school hours will hold sacred 
an allotted time for making records, correcting papers, hold- 
ing conferences, shaping things in general for the next day, 
and, finally, for some out-of-doors recreation. 
6. Keeping house 
The schoolroom a model. For many children the begin- 
ning lessons in good housekeeping are got at school. For 
this reason, if not for the sake of saving her own time and 
energy, the teacher should learn to be a good housekeeper. 
She should not assume the duties of the janitor, but when 
she sees an accumulation of dust on the picture frames and 
window casings, and ink spots on the floor or desks, and 
chalk trays laden with dust, and broken furniture, she should 
see that the janitor discharges his own duties more fully. 
Neither should the teacher rob the children of their own 
proper responsibilities in keeping the room orderly and 
home-like. Disarranged desks; scraps of paper or an undue 
amount of dirt under a seat; the cloak-room floor strewn 
with wraps, basket-balls, bats, and gloves; children with 
dirty hands, or with disheveled clothing or hair; library 
books in the wrong place; children sitting in slovenly posi- 
tions, or walking awkwardly — these matters it is not the 
teacher’s business to set straight; it is her business to see 
that the particular children who are responsible shall do the 
setting straight for themselves. 
In all these things the teacher is herself the model, exem- 
plifying the practice she enforces among the children by her 
supervision. Her own desk should not be a mixture of stale 
bouquets, marbles, jackknives, papers, erasers, books, and 
wraps, but should always be a model of good order. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
  
388 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
pictures should be kept hanging straight, the window shades 
rendering service, the wastebasket in place, supplies avail- 
able in good order, torn books put aside for mending, dic- 
tionary and other reference books easily available, and over 
all a homelike atmosphere that is created by her own gentle 
manners. 
%. The teacher in her profession 
Professional attitudes. ‘Finally, the teacher is to learn 
and live up to the standards of her profession. There are 
personal, ethical, and professional standards for the teach- 
ing profession, as there are for the legal and medical profes- 
sions. In some ways these standards are not so clearly de- 
fined for the teaching profession as for other professions, 
owing largely to the former’s being a more recent develop- 
ment, to the nomadic tendency among teachers, and to the 
large number of temporary members. Yet some standards 
are well established, and others are rapidly becoming so. 
First, the teacher must respect herself and the work she 
is engaged in. She cannot defend the dignity of her calling 
and be herself undignified. The teacher who sneers at 
teaching, or who tries to hide the fact that she is a teacher, is 
not above her fellows, but is distinctly unworthy of member- 
ship with them. Teaching is not a contemptible calling for 
weaklings, and the teacher must learn to stand on her own 
feet and think and act for herself as a technically trained 
public servant. 
Secondly, she must respect the highest standards that 
are set for scholarship and professional training, and frown 
down the tendency of laymen to pass judgment on educa- 
tional values of which they have no special knowledge. 
This is one of the nuisances in the educational world which 
teachers ought to combat more vigorously than they do. 
For a parent or a member of a lay school committee to try to
-P-A-G-E-401
  THE TEACHER AT WORK 389 
pass judgment on a teacher’s methods, or on the value of 
teaching appliances, is exactly parallel to the case of laymen 
who undertake to diagnose any and every sort of illness that 
may arise. 
Third, the teacher must respect the work of her fellows. 
Blaming some former teacher, or scoffing at or belittling an- 
other teacher’s work in order to shield herself, is equaled 
only by such tricks as seeking a position that is not vacant 
or trying to bring the principal or some fellow teacher into 
disrepute. 
Fourth, the teacher who would live up to the best stand- 
ards of her profession must demand a reasonable salary, 
must emphasize the idea of service, must avoid that over- 
dogmatic attitude of mind so detrimental to wholesome 
growth and pleasant companionship, must refrain from 
seeming superior to other people, and must keep herself 
personally clean and progressive. 
8. Summary of Part IV 
In the chapters of this part we have set forth in brief discussion 
those more or less personal problems which the teacher must mas- 
ter if she is to hold a real place in her chosen profession. We have 
not tried to think of the teacher apart from her work, but quite the 
opposite, for we have made her professional, social, and personal 
responsibilities everywhere the test of the virtues we would have 
her possess. Our standards have been set high for the reason that 
only men and women of worth should be privileged to direct the 
training of our future citizens. 
The first problem is that of personality. Everywhere example is 
stronger than precept, and the full significance of this ancient 
axiom for teachers should be suggested by our brief discussion of 
the teacher’s personality. Such a character as we have demanded 
there is not attained in a day, but it is attainable for those who are 
willing to pay the price. It calls for earnest, intelligent, and con- 
tinuous effort and study. Real leadership calls for action backed 
up by knowledge and love of service. Becoming a leader demands 
right ideals, right principles and attitudes, and right habits and
-P-A-G-E-402
390 CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
thoughts, and these are not to be gained by viewing them from 
afar or by reading about men who possess them. 
The second problem is that of training and growth. Here also 
the standard is set high, because the demands of the future will be 
constantly rising. The teacher must not only know books, she 
must know men and affairs, else the facts she teaches will be with- 
out perspective. In addition to this she must know the school — 
its ideals and purposes, its possibilities, its methods, and the chil- 
dren it serves. This she cannot do unless she grows in knowledge 
and experience. To this end, she must adopt some plan of self- 
education, and keep to it from year to year. 
The third problem is that of the teacher’s health. It is not a pale 
face and a stooped form that we want to set as an example to grow- 
ing children. Only men and women of red blood and sturdy 
physique can do well the work a teacher must do. Exercise and 
wholesome enjoyment go well with hard work. They keep the 
mind open and the body strong, and add force to thought and act. 
It is believed that the extent to which these standards of per- 
sonality, training, and health have been attained are likely to 
show in theteacher’s work. Accordingly, in our two final chapters, 
we have tried to show the bearing of these attainments upon the 
teacher’s conception of her position; upon the relationship which 
she establishes with her patrons, and with her fellow-teachers and 
school officers; upon her own preparation and methods of work; 
upon the way in which she conserves her own time and energy; 
and upon her own professional standards. 
The teacher who lives up to all the possibilities we have sug- 
gested here might perhaps be our ideal teacher. It is believed, not- 
withstanding this, that these standards are practically attainable 
for the vigorous, purposeful teacher of to-day. 
QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION 
1. Explain what you understand to be the distinction between the 
traditional school program and the type suggested on page 377, and 
discuss ways and means for realizing in practice the six numbered 
principles there set forth as characterizing such a school. 
2. What is meant by social center? Enumerate the specific lines of serv- 
ice such an institution might render in a country community, in an 
industrial community, in a mining center, in a small village, in a 
tesidence section of a large city.
-P-A-G-E-403
  
THE TEACHER AT WORK 391 
8. Work out a plan for utilizing and crediting as school work lines of 
home work suited to your own community. 
4. Make out a sample program for a community-center meeting in your 
school, or in some school you know. 
5. Explain just what you would regard as your duty to the superintend- 
ent of schools in a city, and to the principal of your own school. 
6. Try to draw the line of rights and duties that connects the work of the 
principal with that of the teacher. What is the importance of guard- 
ing strictly the rights of the teacher against encroachments from other 
school officers? 
7. Distinguish between the principal who administers the school in 
terms of authority delegated to his office, and the principal who 
administers in terms of his superior knowledge and skill. 
8. Outline a scheme for keeping a daily plan-book. Draw up a plan for 
teaching a lesson on some topic in history. Make the necessary 
notes in preparation for assigning the lesson that is to follow. 
9. Show what you would put into your plan-book for a lesson to in- 
clude a field trip to study polliwogs. 
10. Make a list of the ethical standards which you consider to be well es- 
tablished in the teaching profession. What others should be estab- 
lished?

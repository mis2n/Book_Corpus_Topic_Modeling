EDITOR'S PREFACE. 
HERBART’S educational theories are in important re- 
spects supplementary to those of Pestalozzi. The most 
important idea is that of apperception. He teaches that 
the chief object of instruction is to secure the reaction 
of the mind upon what is offered to sense-perception. 
We must understand what we see. We must explain it 
by what we know already. Herbart would secure the 
assimilation of all our new perceptions by the total amount 
of experience already stored in our minds. Pestalozzi, on 
the other hand, made no account of previous experience 
and of this process of digesting our intellectual food. Pes- 
talozzi wished to have us learn by seeing and hearing and 
the use of our other senses. In his mental physiology the 
process of eating is everything, and the process of diges- 
tion is ignored. This is the chief defect in his method. 
Sense-perception is worthy of much attention on the part 
of the educator, and Pestalozzi’s methods have been fruit- 
ful of much that is good in our schools, but of far more 
importance are the processes of apperception—the con- 
version of sense-impressions into knowledge, and the 
modification of our previous knowledge by the new expe- 
rience gained. 
The present book contains the larger part of Her- 
bart’s writings which deal with Pestalozzi, and will 
vu  
-P-A-G-E-10
viii HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
therefore interest the students of education who desire 
to study the sequence of these two distinguished edu- 
cators. 
Pestalozzi in his later years came to see that spasmodic 
efforts in the direction of cultivating sense-perception 
should give place to a systematic and exhaustive course of 
training. This led him to inquire what are the elements 
of sense-perception, and how can an elemental training 
be given in this activity of the mind. The alphabet leads 
to a knowledge of letters and the ability to gain knowl- 
edge from the printed page—an ability to apperceive 
printed words. What should be the alphabet of sense- 
perception? Hisinquiry into the A B C of Sense-Percep- 
tion resulted in his doctrine of form, number, and sound 
or language. We learn through our senses the forms, 
numbers, and sounds of the objects of the real world. By 
far the most important item of knowledge gained through 
sound comes by means of the spoken word. Hence he 
puts the study of language in school for this item. Arith- 
metic or number work stands for the second item. Third- 
ly, the forms of objects could be mastered best by the 
study of the simple geometric forms and by the art of 
drawing. These are Pestalozzi’s devices. 
Herbart thinks over the results of Pestalozzi, and at- 
tempts to find a more satisfactory and far-reaching alpha- 
bet of sense-perception. Spatial forms and measurements 
may be studied to best advantage through trigonometry. 
He accordingly plans a system of instruction which ana- 
lyzes all forms into triangles and discovers the ratios of 
the sides of the triangle, one to another, as depending 
upon the size of the angles. The pupil having formed 
for himself by measuring a table of natural tangents and 
secants stated in terms of the radius, is exercised variously 
in solving problems and discovering the required terms
-P-A-G-E-11
EDITOR’S PREFACE. ix 
from the terms given. The two sides of a triangle and 
its angle being given, what shall be the third side? Two 
angles and the included side being given, what shall the 
third angle and the other two sides be? 
One can not help admiring the charming manner in 
which Herbart has reduced to a system this inquiry into 
the elemental forms in space. He has in this particular 
made a satisfactory alphabet of sense-perception. 
But, as Herbart himself teaches, this alphabet derived 
from trigonometry does not enable us to. spell all the 
words in sense-perception. There may be an alphabet of 
color, for instance; another alphabet of musical tones 
addressed to the ear; an alphabet of tastes; another of 
odors, and likewise an alphabet for the muscular sense. 
These, however, are not so important for the interpreta- . 
tion of sense objects as a series of forms to be apperceived 
through the knowledge of the triangle. But there is to 
be mentioned still another alphabet which is perhaps of 
equal or greater importance than this one of trigonome- 
try: it is the alphabet of esthetic form. Every one who 
is to live in civilized life should have what is known as 
good taste in regard to shapes and forms that he makes. 
It is the fine finish of a piece of work which brings to the 
labourer an extra price for his production. The knowledge 
of triangles gives no clew to the forms and shapes which 
represent the beautiful. For the beautiful everywhere 
suggests or presents some traits peculiar to mind or the 
soul. Forms that can not be explained except by self-ac- 
tivity are the only forms that present the beautiful. Trig- 
onometry, therefore, gives us the clew to the inorganic 
and what is mechanical, but art teaches us what is beau- 
tiful and reveals to us through it the spiritual. 
Therefore, besides alphabets of touch, taste, smell, 
sound, and sight, as to inorganic forms, the senses should
-P-A-G-E-12
ised 
x HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
have alphabets of beautiful forms of painting and sculp- 
ture, and of beautiful sounds of ‘music: 
One of the most important of all the|writings of Her- 
bart is the treatise translated and =r in Chapter VI 
(pp. 80 to 117) of the present volume, entitled “The Ais- 
thetic Presentation of the Universe.” It represents Her- 
bart’s voyage of discovery to find the most important de- 
termining element in education. He calls this master 
principle “ morality,” but in his rt of it does not 
discriminate it from the science of the beautiful. He in- 
cludes all ideals which ought to be realized, but which do 
not press upon us with external necessity—i. e., not must 
be, but only owght to be—under the can of esthetic per- 
ceptions. Setting aside for the time being art and litera- 
ture as perceptions of this character, he elevates into 
prominence the moral perception. 
Herbart’s insight into the importance of the moral leads 
him to subordinate mathematics and ea science to 
literature and the humanities—to all, in short, that gives a 
knowledge of human nature as an ethical principle for the 
conduct of life. 
It is important, therefore, to consider this A B C of Sense- 
Perception in connection with his Alsthetic Presentation 
of the Universe, inasmuch as the charming work of meas- 
uring triangles may, in the hands of an enthusiastic teacher, 
be made to absorb too much of the youth’s attention, and 
give his mind a too exclusive bent toward |the mechanical 
view of the world, just as number work, if pursued in the 
elementary school to the point of making rapid and accu- 
rate accountants, will cramp the mind and arrest its de- 
velopment, retarding its progress into more humane stud- 
ies. These trigonometric studies may have the same effect ; 
they are, however, very excellent by way of a single device   
 
-P-A-G-E-13
CE EESS~'' 
EDITOR’S PREFACE, xi 
if kept in strict subordination to that doctrine of the 
esthetic presentation of the universe. 
Herbart has given us this series of object lessons in trig- 
onometry, and by the continued occupation in estimating 
and then actually measuring angles and sides of triangles 
the pupil will soon become able to forecast accurately the 
dimensions of the object which he sees. His mind will 
form a habit of unconsciously analyzing all objects which 
come before its perception into triangles. But by so 
much as the mind adopts this unconscious habit it will 
neglect to notice the elements of taste and gracefulness 
and the ethical or moral significance of what it perceives. 
But it is not a matter in which we can adopt one alphabet 
and totally neglect another. We must have all of these 
alphabets and yet have them in their due proportion: we 
should have A B (0’s for drawing, painting, and statuary ; 
for botany and zodlogy ; for literature and morals. 
Herbart deserves the careful study of the teacher be- 
cause of his painstaking investigation of branches of study 
in view of their value as materials of apperception, as 
materials by which to enable the mind to recognize and 
explain the objects of the world of experience.

PREFACE. 
In the days of Horace Mann a wave of Pestalozzian- 
ism swept over the country. The uplifting effect of that 
period has not passed away. Its elevating results con- 
tinue everywhere. The elementary education of the 
country having been placed upon a higher plane, on that 
plane still proceeds. Thousands who do honour to Ameri- 
can elementary school-work are Pestalozzians, including 
under that name the disciples of Pestalozzi’s disciple, 
Froebel. 
We live in the beginnings of another educational re- 
form—the Herbartian. It is not intended to supersede, 
but to enlarge and to fortify, Pestalozzianism. All think- 
ers on our national education feel that, in order to pre- 
serve its strength and to supply its defects, it must be ap- 
perceived, as Herbart would say, under higher points of 
view. The warmest friends and the keenest critics of our 
public schools are at one on this. 
We have outgrown the limits of Petalozzianism just as 
our free-school system will no longer brook the restriction 
to the three R’s. Many who know our public-school sys- 
tem best and love it most are persuaded that Herbartian- 
ism is the proper solution for the difficulties of to-day, as 
Horace Mann was rightly convinced that the doctrines of 
Herbart’s predecessor, Pestalozzi, offered the true remedial 
agent for the difficulties at an earlier stage. It is hardly 
xu  
-P-A-G-E-16
  xiv HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
possible to attend an educational gathering of fair preten- 
sions to magnitude or dignity without hearing Herbart’s 
name at least. It is almost impossible to take up a cata- 
logue of teachers’ books without noticing publications 
based mediately or immediately on his principles. 
Already many teachers are guided by Herbart’s ideas 
who never heard of him. Many subjects, from sympathy 
with the treatment given to others, are treated in a way 
more or less conformable to these ideas by writers not 
consciously belonging to any pedagogical school. Ameri- 
can educators have begun to live, move, and have their 
being in an atmosphere of Herbartiansm. It is coming 
to be the pedagogic spirit of the times. 
There is occasionally misconception so gross as. to 
shake the belief that the person in error can have studied 
Herbart, though he may have studied in a fragmentary 
way Herbartian authors. There are superficialities and 
crudities, but not, relatively to the vastness of the subject, 
at all more than at the beginning of the manual-training 
movement. 
Both the pervasive power and the prevailing defects 
of the movement seem to be due to the way of intro- 
ducing it. Whether by design or accident, the American 
teacher has been made acquainted first with the General 
Pedagogy and the Psychology. 
It was, perhaps, as good a way of beginning as any 
other. Had a commencement been made by introducing 
first the practical details, opposite and possibly greater 
defects would have been developed. There might have 
been—elder educators, at least, remember something of 
the sort in the movement for public kindergartens—local 
adoptions and narrowly practical adaptations. Whether 
this would have resulted in a greater number of well-quali- 
fied teachers is very much open to question. That it
-P-A-G-E-17
PREFACE, XV 
would have failed to bring out the philosophical power of 
Herbartiansm is not so open. 
Yet, after all, we need both a knowledge of principles 
and a knowledge of how to translate them into the prac- 
tice of the class room. ‘The Herbartian movement, it is 
conceivable, will be strengthened by placing in the hands 
of the thousands of teachers who do the actual class-room 
work a book strictly Herbartian and containing ideas ap- 
plicable immediately in the daily work of education. For 
such a book the master has not left us without materials. 
To render these materials accessible to American teachers 
is, as a glance at the title-page and the table of contents 
will show, the aim of the present writer.

  HERBART’S 
A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
INTRODUCTION. 
Historically, what is Herbartianism 2—In the history 
of education a certain portion of mankind may at once be 
set aside as the Occidental fraction. It is loosely coincident 
with Europe and that western extension of Europe which 
we call America. The latter, though separated from the rest 
of Europe by broad seas as England is by “the narrow seas,” 
is in language, jurisprudence, art, science, industries, reli- 
gion, and education—north of Mexico as regards the origin 
of its population, also—EKuropean. In the history of educa- 
tion the United States is a European country like England, 
France, or Germany, and much more of a European coun- 
try than either Russia or Turkey. The history of Occidental 
education commences with the Greeks. 
For the present purpose we exclude from -consideration 
all but intellectual education. This among the Greeks had 
two strands. The objective strand produced Thales, Ar- 
chimedes, Euclid, Ptolemy, Pliny, Democritus ; the literary, 
Sophocles, Demosthenes, Cicero, Quintilian. As above in 
the case of Europe, we here classify solely for educational 
history. Though the withering and narrowing brought 
upon the Greek education by the one-sided instinct of the 
Roman for conquering and governing had lapsed into its 
worst stage during the anarchy of the middle ages, the two 
strands remained nevertheless. Every study in the course 
ik
-P-A-G-E-36
  2 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
retained its Greek name—grammar, dialectics, rhetoric, 
music, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy. 
To get back to the Greek level was the struggle of the 
Renaissance three hundred years ago, when the subsidence 
of medizval anarchy allowed civilization to lift its head 
once more. 
In the first struggle, unfortunately but unavoidably, the 
literary element was overemphasized. The reformers would 
admit nothing but Greek and such Latin as we have in- 
cluded in Greek civilization. Some would not accept any 
Latin word not found in the arch-Grecist, Cicero. 
The reaction against this humanistic one-sidedness is the 
realistic pedagogy of Comenius’s Orbis Pictus. It was the 
only schoolbook Goethe ever had. Goethe died in 1832. This 
shows that both sides held their own, as they did in Greek 
times and as they are doing to-day in the struggle between 
literature and science in our higher schools and colleges, 
The bilaterality of Occidental education extends through 
two and a half millenniums. Nobody need fear or hope 
much. 
Meantime the non-scholastic world was wondering 
whether the battle of the pedagogues was worth disturb- 
ing one’s self about. This scepticism of the non-scholastic 
world produced the most important experiment in all the 
history of education. 
Ancient education ends and modern education begins, 
not where the break is usually made, but with John Locke. 
A great philosopher of the kind opposite to those who, to 
speak with Herbart, become great philosophers by forget- 
ting their logic, he was well qualified for the Conduct of the 
Understanding of his pupil. Being a physician, continually 
compelled to practise the healing art, his attention was 
directed scientifically and sympathetically to the physical 
as well as to the mental nature of the child. Leading the 
life of a practical politician to the point of endangering his 
head, his opinion on the knowledge required for dealing

with men and things was not that of a pedant. Mingling 
on equal terms in the eminent and intelligent society of 
which his pupil’s parents formed a part, and possessing their 
full confidence, he had in his power all that could enable 
him to form the one boy intrusted to his charge. Summing 
up all the conditions, it is impossible to see how they could 
have been more favourable for the success of the great ex- 
periment which was about to be performed. It succeeded 
perfectly. Locke took charge of his pupil, a weakly boy, 
educated him into a man physically well, and intellectually 
and morally fitted for his place in society; and, to crown 
this strangest experiment in human history, felicitously 
mated him in wedlock. 
Locke, as Herbart has well observed, is the easiest phi- 
losopher to underestimate. “His genius as an educator has 
never yet had justice done to it. His writings are almost 
ostentatiously negligent with the true Briton’s contempt for 
fine points and studied self-advertisement. The Conduct of 
the Understanding and the Thoughts Concerning Education 
give scant intimation of his pedagogic genius. The doers 
of great historic deeds rarely possess the gift of telling them 
to advantage. Hence, the view here affirmed that educa- 
tional history should divide into two main periods, and that 
Locke should commence the modern or naturalistic period, 
will seem to many paradoxical. The next paragraph will, 
perhaps, induce a different conviction. 
The great deed of Locke was written up; it revolution- 
ized Europe. Rousseau took up the whole experiment and 
put it into a novel—Don Quixote alone excepted—the most 
perennially fascinating novel ever written. Locke’s pupil 
he called Emile. Instead of Locke he said I. He described 
the course that would make the boy physically robust and 
morally and mentally adequate to his place in society, and, 
to complete performing in print what Locke had performed 
in deed, Rousseau picked out the proper bride for his dis- 
ciple, and in the end married him to Sophie.
-P-A-G-E-38
4 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
The Anglo-Saxon Locke performed the greatest feat in 
educational history, but, with the curious idiosyncrasy of 
the English for belittling everything they do, almost failed 
to describe it. The French-Swiss Rousseau beautifully de- 
scribed what it is positively sure he could not do. To under- 
stand Locke we must read that Rousseauist masterpiece, 
Emile. It alone is worth the trouble of acquiring a reading 
knowledge of French, The question is occasionally asked 
why England and America should go to Germany for so 
much of their pedagogy. The answer is extremely simple. 
Modern pedagogy was started by the Anglo-Saxon Locke 
as modern or, as the French have sometimes called it, 
romantic literature was started by the Anglo-Saxon Shake- 
speare. In both cases the Germans joined in, as they did 
at Waterloo, to help their Saxon kinsmen complete the 
victory. 
Locke, who pleaded stanchly and victoriously the cause 
of Religious Toleration, and who anticipated also Rousseau’s 
political writings in his Two Essays of Civil Government, 
is more than any other one the typical Anglo-Saxon phi- 
losopher. The spirit of religious and political freedom in 
his writings animated the patriots of the American Revolu- 
tion. His Essays of Civil Government were the most wide- 
spread and thoroughly read political literature in the homes 
of the generation that fired the shot which was heard around 
the world. If the French wrote the Rights of Man, Locke 
anticipated them by establishing the rights of the pupil, 
just as the American Revolution, the child inspired by the 
spirit of Locke’s writings, anticipated the French Revolu- 
tion. The strong individualistic spirit of the Saxon race in 
religion and in politics is potent equally in the school. The 
free obedience to law which accompanies that spirit must 
pervade our education. No machine-drilled marionette, 
unthinkingly submissive to authority, is fit for American 
citizenship. On the other hand, no anarchistic tendency 
can be permitted to endanger its foundations. How to train 
to good citizenship in the only way possible—namely, by

INTRODUCTION. 5 
intelligent self-determination to goodness—is the burning 
pedagogical question, for in it lies the future safety of the 
republic. That is conceded at all hands. In our day the 
pupil is once more the core of the question. State and 
Church are battling, or sometimes bargaining or compro- 
mising, over his possession. 
To have placed the individual, the child, instead of the 
branches of instruction, into the forefront of pedagogic con- 
sideration is the great, the saving deed of Locke. He called 
the educators away from the wrong end of the telescope. 
There was at once a glorious view of the possibilities of in- 
struction. That glorious view was ecstatically described by 
Rousseau. 
But one thing remained to complete this naturalistic vic- 
tory. It must be applied to mass education—the absorbing 
problem propounded, and scarcely more than propounded, 
by Comenius. The application was made by a lover of 
mankind, in whom devotion to his fellow-beings, and the 
intuition that arises from such devotion, amounted to genius 
—Pestalozzi. The French-Swiss Rousseau took the Saxon 
idea of education and converted it into a beautiful dream. 
The German-Swiss Pestalozzi converted the dream into a 
beautiful reality. Since Pestalozzi mass education is a fact. 
Occidental humanity has solved the great sphinx riddle 
which history has propounded to every race—how to per- 
petuate its civilization without petrifying it; how to pass it 
on to succeeding generations, not only without limiting it, 
but while positively enhancing it. Those who affirm that 
Occidental civilization must die as other civilizations have 
done are wrong. They were right before the Saxon con- 
quest, which, as it won for Occidental civilization civic lib- 
erty, also won for it this larger hope, put into a dream by 
Rousseau, into reality by Pestalozzi. That is the reason— 
because it is so thoroughly Saxon an idea—that the Pesta- 
lozzian school system is the basis of American primary 
school work. Pestalozzi’s boast, that finding the car of edu- 
cation going the wrong way he turned it and set it going in
-P-A-G-E-40
eee 
6 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
the opposite direction, applies only to his accomplishment of 
the naturalistic idea for public school work. In the large 
aspect of the case the boast is sober truth as applied to the 
Saxon race in the person of Locke. 
To state this truth is not to belittle Pestalozzi any more 
than it is to belittle him to say that he did not go to the 
root of the matter. This was reserved for Froebel, who, in 
the skilful adaptation of his means to his ends and in the 
profundity of his philosophy, possessed qualities to which 
Pestalozzi could not lay much claim. 
‘When both the basis in method and mass education and 
the superstructure of the subject-matter were fully pro- 
vided by the pedagogic toil of Occidental humanity from 
the Greeks to Pestalozzi, the time was ripe for a master 
mind to unify the result of the struggle by harmonizing it 
into a single system. Occidental education was moulded 
into a logical whole by Herbart, who was at once a pro- 
found philosopher and one of the most successful practical 
teachers upon record. That is Herbartianism, speaking his- 
torically. Now— 
What is Herbartianism, philosophically ?—Naturally, 
knowledge—and hence practice, dependent on it—begins 
with isolated facts picked up on occasion and utilized of ne- 
cessity. Such knowledge, and its sometimes quite artful 
applications, are displayed by intelligent animals, savages, 
and the general mass of the population of nations, Even in 
the intellects which have attained the highest degree of 
culture, the discharge of a large number of comparatively 
complex functions is possible only through such knowledge. 
This is the empirical stage of knowledge, and, by implica- 
tion, of the resultant art. 
It is never wholly overcome. The man who should at- 
tempt wholly to overcome it would unfit himself for prac- 
tical life. Empirical knowledge—it would be an improve- 
ment to revive the Baconian term knowledges—and the 
resultant empirical deftnesses retain their importance, in 
many lives comprising almost the whole and even in the
-P-A-G-E-41
INTRODUCTION. a 
highest lives a large, though not necessarily the most im- 
portant, part. 
None the less, in all higher life empiricism is manifestly 
inadequate to lay hold of all the knowledge and to control 
all the functions. By contrast, repeated observations sepa- 
rate into classes, while by similarity they detect the pres- 
ence of causality. This stage, wherein the mind centres on 
classification and causality, we term the inductive stage. 
It is never entirely absent, even in a mind preponderate- 
ly empirical, is especially pronounced in minds new to life, 
or to some phase of it, and is, in fact, the stage beyond 
which most of our scientific knowledge and of the arts de- 
pendent on it have not passed, nor for a long time to come 
are perceptibly likely to pass. 
It is not, however, the highest stage of scientific develop- 
ment. This is attained only when a law, a principle, an ax- 
iom, is ascertained with such absolute accuracy that all the 
details that fall under it can be shown to flow from it of ne- 
cessity. Being the highest stage, it is the latest and the 
most rarely reached. The consequent art partakes, of course, 
of the certainty of the science. When he is sure of his math- 
ematical principles, the art of computation which a person 
bases upon it is in nowise inferior in the accuracy and cer- 
tainty of its results. If there be any error the mistake is 
purely personal. 
Let us illustrate these three steps from the history of as- 
tronomy. It was anciently possible both to Occidental and 
to Chinese civilization to predict eclipses. The art of pre- 
diction worked by rule of thumb. The knowledge was em- 
pirical. Kepler's laws of planetary motion were obtained 
by a combinatory toil of intelligent observation so prodi- 
gious as to be one of the best illustrations for Newton’s defi- 
nition of genius as patient industry. Still these laws re- 
mained inductive. It was only when Newton himself dis- 
covered the law of gravitation that our knowledge of as- 
tronomy became deductive. 
We must again insist that a higher stage does not sweep
-P-A-G-E-42
  8 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
away the results of a lower. On the contrary, it renders 
them more available, both by organizing them and by elim- 
inating mistakes. Our belief in Newtonian gravitation does 
not make us reject the laws of Kepler, but makes us see 
them far more plainly and necessarily as laws of Nature 
than the great discoverer himself did. And, again, belief 
neither in gravitation nor the laws of Kepler requires us to 
disbelieve astronomic facts empirically ascertained. On the 
contrary, by our higher point of view these facts reduce 
from chaos into luminous clearness and consistency. Inci- 
dentally to this clarification, mistakes are corrected. We 
no longer believe that planets have circular orbits, for Kep- 
ler’s induction corrected the mistake of Copernicus by dem- 
onstrating that planetary orbits are elliptical. Kepler's 
correction, however, did not overthrow but fortified the 
Copernican hypothesis. Occasionally great men are incon- 
sistent with themselves. A later stage of development, from 
a higher point of view, can rectify the inconsistency, though 
neither the great man nor his contemporaries could see it. 
And, to repeat it, as our knowledge rises to higher stages 
our practice approaches perfection. We now guide vessels 
around the earth by astronomy. 
To apply these remarks and illustrations to pedagogic 
science and the art of teaching will return the answer to 
our question. Most teaching even to-day is done in an 
empirical fashion. This is decisively and incisively set 
forth by Spencer in discussing What Knowledge is of Most 
Worth? The perusal of that chapter may be recommended 
to any one whom personal observation does not furnish 
with sufficient evidence. 
But as the educational life of the country became ele- 
vated into something better than that in the little red 
schoolhouse on the hill—venerable as that is as an historical 
memory—the crudity of the empirical teacher no longer 
sufficed. The common school teacher of the United States 
does not teach abstruse specialties. His success or failure is 
immediately gauged. By the survival of the fittest in the

struggle for official life a species of men and women is 
evolved who do not ask whether there is a science of 
pedagogy. <A specialist in a higher institution, remote from 
the strong current of public opinion and engaged in a spe- 
cialty which the lay mind can not fathom, may mask his 
comparative inefficiency as a teacher by his comparative 
eminence as a scientist so completely that not even his 
pupils shall know how poor an instructor he is. Conse- 
quently, he can afford to wonder whether there are such 
things as pedagogic laws. But for the common school 
teacher to contravene these laws and thus fail in his work 
is suicidal. He, accordingly, knows that there are peda- 
gogic laws just as surely as there is a law of gravitation. 
He strives to learn them and to use them. 
But the laws so learned are purely inductive laws. The 
great mass of our public school teachers are still in the 
Pestalozzian stage. They have learned to believe in the 
Kepler, so to speak, of pedagogy. And this is well, as far 
as it goes. 
But the country is about to reach the last stage. There 
is an obvious drift toward unity. It is unnecessary to cite 
the Committee of Ten report as one of the indications. 
The result will be to unite into one system our schools 
from university to kindergarten, not with the external unity 
which legislatures and boards of education can decree, but 
with the internal unity of method and aim which can alone 
produce a living organism. The Newton in the case will be 
Herbart. It is not right to say that his system is the best 
system of pedagogy. It is so far the only one. Valuable 
empirical observations are to be found plentifully else- 
where. Many and important inductive laws we owe to 
others. But his is the only system. If it plays us false, as 
the Ptolemaic system did in astronomy, we shall have to 
begin all over again. But if it proves right, it makes peda- 
gogy a systematic science, and our practice measurably cer- 
tain. In addition, it will enhance the value of all previously 
discovered laws and facts by setting them in the right rela-

tions and correcting the errors of previous discoverers. 
Having considered Herbartianism philosophically and his- 
torically, we can be brief in our— 
Description of the System.—In the first place, it makes 
the pupil the centre of education. It affirms the Occidental 
doctrine of individualism as wrought out in education by 
Locke and idealized by his successor Rousseau. But in tak- 
ing this position does not exclude mass education like that 
of Pestalozzi in the primary school, nor mass education like 
that of Froebel for the infant. In the next place, it is for 
the first time in the history of education cogently logical 
in basing this individualism upon its scientific foundation, 
psychology. 
The labours of Herbart in psychology are initiatory. In 
pedagogy they mark a summit. That ultimately this edu- 
cator and psychologist is, like Locke, a philosopher, we have 
already stated. There are thus firm foundations for our 
Occidental pedagogy. It is not only the most congenial to 
Occidental civilization, but it alone rests on science; not, 
like Oriental education or, indeed, like Occidental education 
before it found this true expression of it progressive genius, 
on prejudice or immemorial prescription. Hence, it is not 
destined to perish as prejudices vanish in the progress of 
history, but to unfold -with greater amplitude and lucidity 
as Occidental science and enlightenment progress. Its 
characteristic can be condensed into a watchword—Educa- 
tive Instruction. Its cardinal affirmation is twofold. Edu- 
cation of man by man is impossible except through instruc- 
tion. That instruction is valueless in the acquisition of 
which no education—or, in psychologic language, no ap- 
perception—occurs. 
We start, then, from a basis of realistic—not, let the 
reader be absolutely sure to understand, materialistic— 
philosophy, and from the standpoint of the pupil’s mind 
conceived of as a complex of psychic forces, acting, react- 
ing, combining, and so mutually helping and thwarting 
each other, We find that a process of construction is neces-

INTRODUCTION, 11 
sary, that, in fact, instruction to be educative must be con- 
struction. But in order that the presentations in the pupil’s 
mind may enter into such constructions as will be at once 
clear as to details and systematic in their comprehensive- 
ness, if we look at them in discussing the problem of intel- 
lectual education ; or, expressed in terms of the problem of 
moral education, at;once pure, strong, and definite in moral 
attachment and yet well balanced in justice of moral ac- 
tion; if, in other words, we would educate simultaneously 
the scientist and the man of character, it is necessary for us 
so to present the world as to make the whole of instruction 
—and, remember, we want no instruction that is not educa- 
tive—an edifice constructed out of the sound raw materials 
of outer and inner experience; and we need so to conduct 
the process of construction as to engage the whole intellec- 
tual and moral nature of the student in it joyously. 
This two-sided necessity Herbart has felicitously coupled 
by calling “the esthetic presentation of the universe the 
chief office of education.” If education will attend to this, 
its principal duty, we shall have not narrow specialists in 
science and morality, but right intellects and right charac- 
ters; for, whatever the requirements of later life, the founda- 
tion was laid in the formative period of the student’s own 
soul in “equilibrating interest.” 
But, again, in order to do so, we must take up into the 
student’s mind equally the two great strands which have 
ever been present in Occidental education—the strand of 
knowledge and the strand of sympathy. Hence Herbart’'s 
insistence—so often misunderstood—for higher education in 
mathematics on the one hand and Greek literature on the 
other. That Herbartian mathematics is a very different 
thing from the ordinary dispensation of the text-books, and 
the Greek literature to be read by eight-year-old boys a very 
different thing from the corresponding line of educational 
publications current in our American high schools and col- 
leges, goes without saying. As to the mathematics, the 
reader will see by and by.

stages which the race has travyersed—the empirical, the 
inductive, and the philosophical in knowledge; and the 
empirical, the sociological, and the religio-eesthetic in sym- 
pathy. Enough, perhaps, has been said in these opening 
paragraphs of an outline to hint, at least, the all-compre- 
hensiveness of Herbart’s grand system. At all events, we 
must here break off, not only for lack of space, but lest from 
pedagogy we go off into psychology. 
We wish to conclude by offering, and urgently, too, one 
essential caution. The only way to understand an author 
is to read him, not in an attitude of hostile, destructive 
criticism, but in a spirit of sympathetic, constructive appre- 
ciation. Fairness to the author requires it and the student's 
enlightened self-interest should enforce it upon himself as 
the most profitable method. Of course, no one is obliged to 
retain what in the crucible of experience and reflection he 
has found to be slags. Yet in the case of no thinker more 
than in Herbart’s is it needful for the reader constantly to 
bear in mind the eminently sane advice of Goethe: 
“ Gib dich an einen Meister hin; 
Mit ihm zu irren ist dir Gewinn.” 
We venture to translate it : 
“Unto a master yield thy thought ; 
Erring with him thy gain is wrought.”

PART I. 
INTRODUCTORY WORKS. 
CHAPTER I. 
HeErparr at the beginning of his career as a university 
teacher lectured on pedagogy to students in the University 
of Gottingen, in 1802-03. The manuscript of the first lec- 
ture was not given to the world until after his death in 1841. 
The last four paragraphs here given constitute the beginning 
of a second lecture. 
His reasons for eschewing both a definition and a his- 
tory of pedagogy, as well as the succinct but cogent expo- 
sition of the insufficiency of empiricism as a substitute for 
pedagogic science, are noteworthy. His intimation, that the 
task of educating must not sacrifice the educator any more 
than those who are to be educated is also worth heeding. 
But far the most valuable portions are the discussion of 
tact, and the practically instructive parallel between tact and 
character. Without more introduction we give Herbart’s 
IntTRODUCTORY LECTURE TO STUDENTS IN PEDAGOGY. 
GENTLEMEN: You perhaps expect at the beginning of 
these lectures first of all a definition of my subject and next 
a eulogy, a history, or a synopsis of the science of peda- 
gogy. Only after a first attempt at separating the essential 
from the inessential can a definition be the significant 
18
-P-A-G-E-48
14. HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
expression of the result of this entire inquiry. To one 
not having before him that which is to be separated, 
a definition shows neither what has been excluded nor 
the propriety of the exclusion. It comes as a surprise 
rather than as a support to one’s thinking. Instead of a 
definition I shall from the crude idea of which we are 
reminded by the word education set forth the chief 
properties as far as necessary in order to start the threads 
of further investigation. 
Just as little a eulogy! Such a crown might oppress 
rather than glorify the brow of my modest science. 
It is, perhaps, appropriate to open with eulogies the 
exposition of sciences the propositions of which stand 
forth in ample definiteness, and the beneficent effects of 
which have been indubitably proved in general experi- 
ence—sciences that have already reached the age of man- 
hood. But the art of educating the youth of mankind is 
itself still a youthful art; it experiments, trains its 
powers, and hopes in the future for excellent accomplish- 
ments. But hitherto it is fain to confess that its trials 
have instructed it not so much what to do as -what to 
avoid ; that it still at every step dreads the superior power 
of interfering accident, which it would rather flee than 
combat; and that, as to its general principles, it still 
expects, to be sure, the dicta and objections of philosophy 
without, however, knowing whether, to begin with at 
least, it will by them be more instructed or more un- 
settled. Enulogies in the case of such a science can refer 
less to its actual accomplishments than to the hopes 
which we entertain as to its future. But even the foun- 
dations for these hopes are to be set forth only by the 
whole of these lectures. As I shall gradually develop 
before you the idea of our great art, and demonstrate 
more definitely the feasibility of carrying the idea into
-P-A-G-E-49
  THE HISTORY OF PEDAGOGY. 15 
effect, the respect which, I have no doubt, you have 
brought hither for pedagogy will heighten surely into 
confidence, possibly into reverence. 
Nor shall I give you a history! What does the his- 
tory of a science contain? Attempts, no doubt, made to 
construct that science. Who is able to estimate the value 
of such attempts and to perceive where in them there is 
progress or retrogradation? No doubt he who sees the 
best and shortest way which the attempts might have 
taken. Hence, as a rule, the history of an art does not 
become comprehensible and interesting till one has mas- 
tered the main ideas by which the attempts are to be 
judged. Then, in the case of mistaken measures, one can 
discriminate and esteem correct intentions, assign the 
proper measure to that which was missed by excess or 
weakness, and appropriately separate what is true and 
important from the insignificant, the erroneous, and the 
perilous. 
Instead of a history of pedagogy there is great need, 
however, of your obtaining a distinct view of the existing 
condition of the art of education. To this end I recom- 
mend to you two means. In the first place, please to look 
back, each one into his own youth, and to recall not only 
how you yourself were educated, but also how you have 
seen others educated. In doing so it naturally is likely 
that not many of you will entirely avoid thinking of your 
teachers and educators either with partiality or disesteem. 
Your youth is, as yet, hardly far enough behind you for 
that impartial contemplation by which that portion of 
your history will become instructive experience. Espe- 
cially, when one believes that one detects radical errors by 
which one has suffered, by which to a greater or less extent 
one has been irremediably warped, or at least irretrieva- 
bly cee one has difficulty in not becoming unjust

16 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
and thankless, by forgetting how much the fault lay with 
the prevailing spirit of the time, how much one’s educa- 
tion possibly rose above it, how many obstacles it had to 
contend with, how much worse one should be off with- 
out it. 
But I admit that this does not exactly belong to the 
subject under consideration. Here it must be our aim to 
recognise faults as faults, however well they may be ex- 
plained from circumstances. We must make it our busi- 
ness to free ourselves completely from the influence of 
habit, from force of which a father is inclined to repeat 
in his son the treatment he received from his father; to 
step, if possible, even beyond the limits of the present age 
as far as it might blind reason by authority; to take a 
full view, on the one hand, of the pure ideal, on the 
other of the existing means for realizing it, in order that 
we may at the least not miss the best that is possible in 
our very inception of the plan. Only in order to become 
acquainted with the means at hand, especially with those 
among them which pedagogy has already prepared for its 
use; in order the more surely to avoid the aberrations to 
which the age seduces easily, and against which on that 
account modern pedagogy cautions the loudest; in order 
to orientation by the nearest and for that very reason the 
most obvious experience, in a matter of experience such 
as education is—in order to all these things an attentive 
view of the present is needed. . . . 
Neither shall I present to you a synopsis of my peda- 
gogy. For would you understand me if, at this early 
stage, I were to speak of an instruction which at the same 
time is an education; of a broad division of the method 
of this instruction into synthetic and analytic; of an xs- 
thetic presentation of the universe as the ideal of educa- 
tion? In my theses I have reluctantly declared mathe- 
   
-P-A-G-E-51
PEDAGOGY AS AN ART. AT 
matics and poetry to be the chief forces in education, and 
I barely now risk intimating to you so much of my view 
of the whole of the pedagogic task as is done in saying 
that I hold the culture of the imagination and of the 
character to be the extremes between which it is com- 
prised. Paradoxes are not the best means for preparing 
the mind for a proposed investigation. 
I hope to contribute a little more toward such a prep- 
aration by a preliminary explanation of the way in which 
I intend to treat my subject. ; 
Discriminate, in the first place, between pedagogy as 
a science and the art of education. What is the content 
of a science? An orderly combination of propositions, 
logically constituting a whole and where possible proceed- 
ing one from another—corollaries from fundamental 
principles, and fundamental principles from axioms. What 
isan art? A sum of skilful devices and methods which 
must be combined in order to secure a certain purpose. 
Science, therefore, demands the derivation of propositions 
from their logical grounds—philosophic thinking. Art 
demands a constant activity in conformity with the mere 
results of science. An art while it is being exercised 
must not become lost in speculation. Its aid is invoked 
by the instant moment. Its resistance is called in against 
a thousand hostile accidents. 
Furthermore, discriminate the art of the expert edu- 
cator from an isolated application of educational art. 
Knowing how to deal with all types of mind and all stages 
of growth makes up the former. The latter may be suc- 
cessful by accident, by sympathy, by parental love. 
Which of these three cycles is the cycle that we are 
considering? Obviously, we lack opportunity for actual 
practice, and, still more, we lack the opportunity for those 
manifold exercises and experiments by which alone the
-P-A-G-E-52
  18 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
art can be acquired. Our sphere is that of the science. 
Now I must beg that you will consider the relation be- 
tween theory and practice. 
Theory in its universality stretches over an expanse of 
which any one in his practice touches on but an infinitely 
minute part. On the other hand, in its indefiniteness, 
which is the immediate consequence of its universality, 
it passes by all details, all the individual circumstances 
that surround the practical teacher at every given mo- 
ment, and all the individual measures, reflections, and ex- 
ertions by which he inust respond to those circumstances. 
In the school of science, therefore, we shall learn both too 
much and too little for practice. This is the reason why 
all practical workers have habitually a strong dislike to 
entering, in respect to their arts, into rigid, thoroughly 
investigated theory. They very much prefer throwing 
into the balance against the latter the weight of their ex- 
periences and observations. On the other hand, it has 
often and prolixly to the point of fatigue been proved, 
set forth, and repeated, that mere practice produces strictly 
only routine and extremely limited and wholly indecisive 
experience, the contention being that we must learn from 
theory how to question nature by experiment and obser- 
vation ere we can draw from her definite answers. Of 
pedagogical practice this contention is true in the amplest 
measure. In it the activity of the educator goes on 
without cessation. Even against his will he acts well or 
badly, or at the least neglects to effect that which might 
have been effected. Quite so, without cessation, the reac- 
tion, the result of his activity, returns upon him. But it 
does so without showing him what would have happened 
had the action been different; what the result would have 
been if he had proceeded with greater power and wisdom ; 
if he had been master of pedagogic means, whose very  
-P-A-G-E-53
  PEDAGOGY AS A THEORY. 19 
possibility he perhaps did not dream of. Of all these 
things his experience knows naught. He experiences 
only his own self, only his own relation to men, only the 
miscarriage of his own plans, without discovery of car- 
dinal faults; only the success of his own method, without 
comparison with the possibly much more rapid and ele- 
vating progress by better methods. Thus it may happen 
that a gray-headed schoolmaster to the end of his days, 
yes, that a whole generation or even series of generations 
of teachers, ever proceeding beside and after each other 
on the identical or on scarcely deviating tracks, suspect 
naught of what some young beginner experiences the first 
hour, at once and with absolute decisiveness, by some lucky 
hit or by some correctly calculated experiment. Nay, 
this not only may occur, it does occur. Every nation has 
its national circle, and, with still greater definiteness, 
every age has its time circle within which the peda- 
gogue as well as every other individual, with all his 
ideas, inventions, experiments and resultant experiences, 
is inclosed. Other ages experience something else, be- 
cause they do something else. It is everlastingly true 
that any sphere of experience without an a priori prin- 
ciple not only has no right to speak of absolute com- 
pleteness, but that it can not even approximately state its 
degree of approach to such completeness. It is for this 
reason that a person without philosophy so easily imag- 
ines himself to have made far-reaching reforms in educa- 
tion when he has only improved some trifle as to the way 
of doing things. Nowhere is the philosophic circumspec- 
tion given by general ideas so needful as here, where daily 
action and the multiplicatively impressive experience are 
so powerful to contract the circle of vision. 
But in every theorist, no matter how good a one he 
may be, if he practises his theory, and provided only that
-P-A-G-E-54
  20 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
he do not proceed with the cases occurring in his practice 
with pedantical slowness, like a little boy with a sum in 
arithmetic, there inserts itself quite involuntarily a link 
intermediate between theory and practice. There is, to 
wit, a certain tact, a quick judgment and decision, not 
proceeding like routine, eternally uniform, but, on the 
other hand, unable to boast, as an absolutely thorough- 
going theory should, that while retaining strict consist- 
ency with the rule, it at the same time answers the true 
requirements of the individual case. Exactly because 
such a recollection, such a complete application of scien- 
tific propositions, would require a supernatural being, 
there inevitably originates in man as he is, out of con- 
tinued practice, a mode of action which depends on his 
feeling and only remotely on his conviction—a mode of 
action rather giving vent to his inner movement, express- 
ing how he has been affected from without, and exhibiting 
his emotional state, than the resultant of his thinking. 
“But what sort of an educator is that,” you will say, 
» “who depends on his whims and abandons himself to the 
~ pleasure or displeasure caused in him by his pupils!” 
And what sort of an educator, I ask, is he who would 
praise his pupils heartlessly and censure them by the 
book, ratiocinating and calculating while the boys are 
committing folly after folly, and incapable of opposing 
the energy of a swift and manly will to these often very 
forceful natures? Let the question and counter-question 
balance, in order that we may return to our assertion that 
inevitably tact occupies the place that theory leaves va- 
cant, and so becomes the immediate director of our prac- 
tice. Supposing the theory true, happy he, no doubt, in 
whom this regent is a truly obedient servant of the the- 
ory. For the question on which depends a man’s being 
a good or bad educator is solely this—how tact forms itself
-P-A-G-E-55
EDUCATIONAL TACT. 21 
in him, so as to be faithful or so as to be false to the 
laws enunciated by pedagogic science in its universality ? 
Let us reflect somewhat further as to the effective 
causes, as to the influences, on which depends the manner 
in which that educational tact becomes ingrained in us. 
It is only formed during practice, and by the action of 
our practical experiences upon our feelings. This action 
will result differently as we are differently attuned. On this, 
our mental attuning, we can and should act by reflection. 
It depends upon the correctness and weight of this reflec- 
tion, upon the interest and moral willingness with which 
we give ourselves up to it, whether and how before enter- 
ing upon the office of education and, whether and how, 
consequently, during the exercise of that office, our men- 
tal tone will order our mode of feeling, and finally, to- 
gether with the latter, will guide the employment of that 
tact upon which rests success or failure in pedagogical 
endeavour. In other words, by reflection, reasoning, in- 
quiry, in short, by science, the educator must prepare not 
his future action in individual cases so much as himself, 
his tone of mind, his head as well as his heart, for cor- 
rectly receiving, apperceiving, feeling, and judging the 
phenomena awaiting him and the situation in which he 
may be placed. If he has anticipatingly indulged in ex- 
tensive plans, the practical circumstances will mock him. 
But if he has equipped himself by fundamental theories, 
his experiences will be plain to him and teach him what 
is to be done in every case. If he does not know how to 
distinguish what is significant from the insignificant, he 
will fail to attend to things vitally necessary and wear 
himself out on what is useless. If he confounds a lack 
of education with feebleness of mind, and crudeness with 
malignity, his pupils will startle and bewilder him every 
day. If, on the contrary, he knows the essentials upon
-P-A-G-E-56
22  HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
which his work depends and the fundamental traits of 
good and evil disposition in the youthful mind, he will 
know how to grant to himself and his pupils all the lib- 
erty necessary for cheerfulness, without on that account 
neglecting duties, loosening discipline, and opening a free 
road to vice and folly. 
There is then—this is my conclusion—a preparation 
for the art by means of the study of science, a prepara- 
tion of both the understanding and the heart before en- 
tering upon our duties, by virtue of which the experience 
which we can obtain only in the work itself will become 
instructive to us. Only in action do we learn the art and 
acquire tact, aptness, quickness, dexterity; but even in 
action only he learns the art who has in previous think- 
ing learned the science; has made it his own; by it has 
attuned himself; has predetermined the impressions to 
be made upon him by future experience. 
Therefore one must not at all expect of theoretical 
preparation that out of its hands he will go forth an in- 
fallible master of the educator’s art. One must not even 
demand of it the special instructions as to procedure. 
One must have faith that he will have enough invention 
to hit upon the particular thing needful to be done at 
ary instant. One must expect instruction even from the 
mistakes. he is going to make, and one may do this 
in pedagogy rather than in a thousand other occupations, 
because here, as a rule, every single action of the educa- 
tor. taken by itself alone is trivial, infinitely more im- 
portance attaching to the procedure as a whole. One 
must tax not even one’s memory to carry constantly the 
innumerable details which will require to be observed. 
But, on the other hand, one must fill one’s mind with 
the considerations which concern the dignity, the im- 
portance, and the main auxiliaries of education. Let
-P-A-G-E-57
THE EDUCATIONAL IDEAL. 23 
there ever hover before the educator’s mind the picture 
of a pure youthful soul which under the influence of a 
moderate happiness and tender love, under many a stimu- 
lation of the mind and many an appeal for future action, 
develops uninterruptedly and vigorously, with ever accel- 
erating progress. Let him in the beginning abandon him- 
self to his imagination and adorn the picture with all 
that can charm; but in the next place, let him call to 
aid the strictest critical reflection, to point out to him 
what in his picture is arbitrary poesy,: baseless reverie, 
without connection and consistency—what, on the other 
hand, was the demand of reason, the essential quality 
of the ideal. Having now framed his concept of a 
boy, not such as he should be pleased to educate, but 
such as would be truly worthy of an excellent educa- 
tion, let him frame in thought a teacher fitted for that 
boy, and again, not so much the companion of every step, 
as Rousseau does, not the warden, the slave chained to 
the boy, whom he and who him deprives of liberty, but 
the wise leader from afar, who by profoundly penetrative 
words and strength of conduct at the right time knows 
how to make sure of his pupil, and then dare calmly leave 
him to his own development in the midst of play, and 
contest with his mates; to his own aspiration to the ac- 
tivity and honour of men; to his own revulsion at the 
examples of vice by which the world, according to our 
choice, seduces or cautions. 
Let us seek rather to fathom and divine the words 
and conduct of such a guide from afar. For, if it be 
impossible that as much time as a friend of youth will- 
ingly dedicates to it can suffice for education, then edu- 
cation itself is impossible; since if he is to give up to it 
all his hours, if he is to give to it wholly his best years— 
a claim so often made upon him—or even if he is but to
-P-A-G-E-58
a 
94 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
sacrifice to it their best part, he must neglect himself, 
and the relation between educator and pupil becomes a 
ceaseless, unnatural strain, which consumes the educa- 
tive force itself. This is to give to youth overseers, not 
true educators. Our science must teach us an art which 
above all continues the education of the educator to a high 
degree. This art must act, moreover, with such concen- 
tration and intensity, with such accuracy and sureness, as 
not to be obliged to assist the student every moment, 
being able to despise and: neglect the larger part of acci- 
dents; nay, if need be, even utilizing for its work impor- 
tant interferences of fate. For fate, circumstances, the 
education of the outside world, of which pedagogues are 
wont to complain so loudly, do not always influence the 
student unfavourably, and almost never do they so influ- 
ence him in every respect. Education itself, once it has 
gained a certain degree of power, is able very often to 
turn those influences in the direction of its purposes. 
Even as it is, the world and Nature, take them as a whole, 
do much more for the pupil than education can, upon an 
average, pride itself on doing. 
I have now described sufficiently, I presume, what is 
my intention of the science which I wish to teach. How 
far I fail of my goal, only he who attains it can measure. 
But to lead you nearer to it than you, at any rate, would 
have come, is the merit I should like to acquire. 
It only remains to add something on the peculiar 
nature of this science in order to derive from it my sug- 
gestions for making the best use of this course of lectures. 
You see from the preceding that my attempt will be 
in the direction of developing and of vivifying in youa 
certain pedagogic disposition, which must be the result of 
certain ideas and convictions concerning the nature and 
educability of man. These ideas I shall be obliged to
-P-A-G-E-59
MATHEMATICS AND GREEK LITERATURE. 25 
adduce, to justify, and then to connect, construct, and 
fuse together, so as to have them produce that disposition 
and so as to enable the latter to bring about the pedagogic 
tact which I have described. But to adduce, justify, and 
construct ideas is a philosophic business of the noblest, 
but also the most difficult kind—the more difficult here 
because I can not presuppose the purely philosophical 
basis on which I ought to build, especially not the psy- 
chology and ethics. How I shall go about to render 
comprehensible to you the results of my speculation with- 
out setting forth the speculation itself I can describe only 
approximately thus: I shall appeal to your knowledge of 
human nature, especially to your self-observation, in which 
the results of correct speculation must occur, although as 
yet in a dim, crude, and indefinite condition. But espe- 
cially I beg you to have patience if my main ideas are 
composed but slowly out of their elements, and if I am 
under the necessity of forcing my way through all sorts 
of obstructive bramble. After all, everything will depend 
upon the finally resultant clearness and certainty, upon 
the energy, upon the impressiveness with which results 
infix themselves and prove their effectiveness in your- 
selves. In this respect, to be sure, very much will also 
depend upon how thoroughly you have mastered those 
sciences and exercises in which we shall recognise the 
most important auxiliaries of education. Among them I 
reckon especially Greek literature and mathematics. 
To lead us back to the ideas of the previous lecture, 
take an illustration. Conceive of a man of character—of 
moral character, if you please—only do not think merely 
of what is called a good, honest, law-abiding man, but 
hold present to your minds a man in whom the moral 
element has grown into that decision, steadiness, and
-P-A-G-E-60
Te 
26 HERBART'’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
swiftness of execution which with especial propriety de- 
serves the name of character. What impels the man 
to action? A moral system neatly written up and de- 
posited in his memory, in which he looks up the proper 
rule, as in a lexicon, or, to make a more appropriate com- 
parison, as a judge does in turning to a statute book? Is 
it not rather a tone of mind, simple, strong, and never 
more to be effaced, which has resulted from his assigning, 
by a long, attentive, and impartial contemplation of hu- 
man relations to himself and to all that surrounds him, 
the place appropriate to each, he now, carrying with him 
everywhere the feeling of universal order, being inclined 
to note at once, to measure off inyoluntarily, where and 
how much the established order has been infringed, and 
immediately following out the consequent impulse to toil, 
to be unable to rest, until he has done what in him lies 
toward the recovery of the moral order and its better 
future confirmation? Thus what he does is but the in- 
fallible reaction against the impulses which he receives. 
His actions are determined infallibly by the peculiar and 
especial way in which he, by virtue of his feeling for 
moral order that has resulted from his judgment of human 
relations, is struck and incited to action by the incidents 
which occur about him. 
Here you will recognise again the link intermediate 
between theory and practice, of which I spoke yesterday— | 
tact, that mode of decision and judgment converted 
rather into manner and morals than determined by rules 
distinctly thought of. This tact, which impels the man 
of character to swift and resolute action, is especially 
needed also by the educator, in order that he may know 
on the spot what is to be done and do it rightly and with 
energy. If an educator lack this tact his personality will 
not have weight; never will he prevail by authority;
-P-A-G-E-61
CHARACTER. QT 
never, as he certainly should, enforce by his mere presence 
that discipline by which the impetuosity of boys is broken 
and led back to order so much more advantageously and 
surely than by all coercive measures. But as there are 
not only moral, but very many species of characters, so 
also there are very many species of tact, manners, and 
ways among educators. Not decision, not swiftness 
alone, constitutes excellence. As there is a schooling for 
moral character, so also is there a schooling for pedagogic 
tact. And in these schools there are sciences; there is an 
ethics; there is a pedagogy. Both, provided they know 
their objects, will work by their presentations in such a 
direction as to generate not many isolated rules but some 
main convictions in the minds, and to strengthen, con- 
firm, and exalt them into living enthusiasm ;: to wit, those 
convictions which are capable of securing to the moral 
or the pedagogic tact to be acquired its true direction in 
the future. 
T have, then, myself prescribed the direction which in 
these lectures I should give to my exertions for the good 
cause. Let me have the assistance of your attention. 
Let me have, when I am mistaken, even the assistance of 
your doubt, and the straightforward and emphatic com- 
munication of your objections, in order that co-operating 
we may render to the education of mankind good service. 
Let it be far from-us to bring still more confusion into 
that holy enterprise. 
Taking now in hand the concept of education in order 
step by step to discriminate its principal elements and 
most important presuppositions, as well as the demands it 
makes upon us, let us contemplate, in the first place, the 
subject upon whom all education must be directed. This 
subject is without any doubt not only man in the most 
general sense, but man considered as a variable being; as.
-P-A-G-E-62
  28  HERBART’S ABC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
a being—that is, making transitions from one state into 
another, while yet capable of remaining with a certain 
degree of persistence in his new condition. 
The manuscript ends with the words “Two properties.” 
These words begin a new sentence, This would seem to in- 
dicate that Herbart proceeded next to explain his theory, as 
he does at large in his more elaborate works, that the educa- 
bility, intellectual and moral, of human beings presupposes 
two conditions : First, our representations or mental pictures 
are modifiable; second, our representations determine our 
actions. 
CHAPTER II. 
Tue firmness and breadth with which Herbart treated 
pedagogy was the result of thorough preparation. When 
at the age of seventeen, being head of the incoming senior 
class, he delivered the farewell address to the graduates of 
the gymnasium of his native city of Oldenburg, it proved 
a good enough production to be solicited by Herr von Halem 
for publication in the Oldenburg Miscellany. and the Latin 
valedictory, when he graduated in the spring of the follow- 
ing year, 1794, was not inferior. The former paper treated 
the General Causes of Growth and Decay in National Mo- 
rality. The latter instituted a comparison between the 
thoughts of Cicero and Kant on the Summum Bonum and 
the standard principle in practical—or to use the less desir- 
able, because less practical, English term—in moral, phi- 
losophy. 
It is evident that he had even at that early age special- 
ized on ethical investigations. From the gymnasium he 
went to the university at Jena, where he came into close 
contact with his “great teacher, Fichte,” a contact by no 
means always tamely receptive on Herbart’s part. Being 
especially strong in Greek and mathematics, an interested

experimenter in science, especially in chemistry, and a lover 
and composer of music, the “ many-sided pedagogue,” equally 
removed from the pedant and the sciolist, but prepared by 
the study of ethics and philosophy for his task, found the 
one training needed to complete him. A patrician Swiss 
family engaged him as tutor for its three sons. It was, with 
great modifications, the experience of Locke over again. 
Herbart’s scholastic, philosophic, scientific, and ethical prep- 
arations, the need of adapting them all to the varying re- 
quirements of pupils of three different ages yet simulta- 
neously to be instructed, and the possibility and necessity of 
individualizing in order to meet the expectations of a critic- 
ally sympathetic family, produced the first germs of that 
system of education which we call to-day Herbartianism. 
To the end of his days Herbart bore evidence of the psy- 
chologizing effect of his tutoring period. In his later years, 
and with ample experience in a larger field, he never swerved 
from the conviction that to make a profound pedagogue, 
conditions such as those under which he elaborated the ele- 
ments of his system were ideal. The public school teacher 
dealing with masses is precluded from individualizing, and, 
therefore, from close and accurate psychology ; he can at 
best only psychologize in the rough. On the other hand, it 
is quite conceivable that Herbart’s system might have failed 
of applicability to mass education had he not providentially 
met during this formative period the great educator who 
was at that time reducing the naturalistic system of Locke, 
or of Rousseau, if one prefers, to public school practice. 
The first meeting between Herbart and Pestalozzi, who 
was thirty years his senior, took place in 1797. <A visit to 
Pestalozzi’s school, and an abiding interest in Pestalozzi’s 
subsequent publications, made Herbart a Pestalozzian, but a 
good deal more than a Pestalozzian—to wit, a man who was 
able to assign to the work of “ the noble Swiss” the province 
within the entire realm of education, where it must be of 
permanent value, and at the same time able to define the 
limitations of that value.   
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  80  HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
After his three years’ tutorship in Switzerland he re- 
turned, not indeed to his native grand duchy of Oldenburg, 
but to the neighbouring republic of Bremen, residing at the 
home of his fellow-student, the later eminent burgomaster 
Smidt, to whom Herbart’s main work in education, the Gen- 
eral Pedagogy, is dedicated. 
Here, while preparing for the university tutorship, of 
which we have just presented a specimen, he was privileged 
with the society of three ladies of culture and wealth, re- 
lated with more or less immediacy to his friend, and form- 
ing the nucleus of a group of mothers warmly interested in 
the study of pedagogy. To these ladies the work we are 
about to communicate is dedicated. It made its first appear- 
ance in 1802, in the January number of the Irene, a period- 
ical edited by Herbart’s old fatherly friend, von Halem. In 
transmitting the manuscript Herbart remarked : “In fact, a 
second essay is needed to expound the subject beyond the 
necessary limits of the Pestalozzian view. This counterpart 
should present Aisthetic Perception as the nerve of educa- 
tion. I have dropped a hint concerning it at the end of the 
paper.” The reader will find this “ counterpart” on Alsthetic 
Perception in Chapter VI of this part. 
Now, as to the use to be made of the article about to be 
presented. It is twofold. In the first place, it shows the 
relation between Pestalozzianism and Herbartianism. That 
is an essential advantage to an American reader, the bulk of 
our common schools being still on the Pestalozzian basis, 
while the best are enlarging to that wider scope and assum- 
ing that higher point of view for which Herbartianism—a 
term which includes, not excludes, Pestalozzianism—stands. 
That this enlargement and elevation of our public edu- 
cation to correspond with the ceaseless enlargement and ele- 
vation of our national life will continue, is certain. Now, 
no other work in pedagogic literature gives in so few pages 
so substantially correct an idea of the inner nature of the 
change through which we are passing. But no one can 
grasp the idea who has not really understood our American

public school system. The man who believes it to consist 
of resolutions by school boards and rulings by superintend- 
ents, and devices gotten from articles in school journals, in- 
stead of realizing that all these and kindred agencies are 
but the outward and visible signs of an educational theory 
extending from Russia to Japan, and taking in France and 
America in its course, and that that theory is Pestalozzian- 
ism, has not yet begun to understand the moving spirit of 
our common school work. That man may have Horace 
Mann in effigy over his desk and Barnard’s American Jour- 
nal of Education on his shelves, but he has understood the 
historical connection of neither. 
If the reader of the present pages is consciously in that 
position, the following article may be of a second funda- 
mental use to him. By reading and weighing it—for Her- 
bart writes compactly, and every paragraph contains matter 
for reflection—with especial emphasis on the sections de- 
scriptive of Pestalozzianism, and by comparison with what he 
knows of our public schools, he may be able to see whence 
we get a number of practices that he has perhaps attributed. 
to the ingenuity or the incapacity of school teachers and 
school journals. 
But to supplement this conception to any serviceable de- 
gree he should re-read Spencer’s Education, at least the 
chapters on What Knowledge is of Most Worth? and on 
Intellectual Education. The critics of Spencer are conge- 
ners of the critics of our public schools. The reason is patent 
enough to one familiar with pedagogic history, though ap- 
parently but little recognised by critics and defenders of 
Spencer and our common schools. 
Both Spencer’s Education and our public schools are ema- 
nations from Pestalozzianism. Perhaps the careful reading 
and pondering of the following article will at least suggest 
how the public schools will be improved by taking up the 
Pestalozzian views that animate them into a wider or deeper 
thought resulting from a higher point of view.

On Pxsratozzi’s most Recent Pusiication: How 
GERTRUDE TAUGHT HER CHILDREN. 
A Communication Addressed to Three Ladies. 
The long-expected book has come into our hands, 
Shall you find confirmed or disappointed the beautiful 
faith with which you interpreted what I was able to tell 
you about Pestalozzi and his enterprise? You note al- 
ready one deficiency ; the book does not read easily 
enough. Will you allow me to make the attempt to 
place you at once at the middle of the subject? If I 
succeed, Pestalozzi’s inequalities of presentation will re- 
tard you but little. In any event, I know, you do not 
judge the cause by the style of its expression. You do 
not reproach a man of sixty for desiring to do no more 
than communicate with us hastily. You find it natural 
that he, being full of bitter pain at the sufferings of his 
people, and pushing his way down into the lowermost class 
as though driven by the enthusiasm of joy and the fire of 
youth, in order to teach little children their letters, should 
pour forth words of power, although, to be sure, a cool, 
precise description of his experiments would have been to 
us more welcome and more instructive. 
You know that I saw him in his schoolroom. Permit 
me once more to call up the scene. A dozen children 
from five to eight years of age were called to school at an 
unusual hour in the evening. I feared I should find them 
out of humour, and that the experiment which I had 
come to see would fail. But the children came without a 
trace of repugnance; a vivid activity continued uniformly 
till the end. I listened to the noise of the whole school 
speaking in concert, or rather, not a noise, it was a uni- 
son of words, extremely audible, like a chorus keeping 
time, and as powerful as a chorus, as firmly bound, ad-  
-P-A-G-E-67
  PESTALOZZI IN HIS eS 83 
hering as definitely to that which was being learned, so 
that I had almost to make an effort to prevent myself 
from being changed from an inspector and observer into 
one of the chorus of learning children. I went about be- 
hind them in order to hear whether there might not be 
some speaking either not at all or carelessly. I did not 
find one. The enunciation of those children was pleasing 
to my ear, though their teacher had himself the most in- 
articulate enunciation, and their tongues could not, surely, 
have been educated by their Swiss parents. But this was 
easily explained. Keeping time and speaking in concert 
carries with it a pure articulation. No syllables can be 
slurred over. There is time for every letter. Thus the 
child forms its enunciation by constantly speaking aloud 
with the natural strength of voice. Neither was their 
universal and persistent attention a riddle to me. Every 
child’s mouth and hands were simultaneously occupied. 
On none was the yoke of inactivity and silence imposed. 
The craving for diversion was satisfied. Natural vivacity 
did not require any outlet, and the current of concert 
speaking allowed none. 
I was greatly pleased with the clever use of the trans- 
parent horn leaves with inscribed letters, which, while the 
children were memorizing, moved about in their hands 
continually, and being a mute but dexterous writing- 
teacher, when placed over the tracings made by their slate 
pencils detected the faults instantaneously, and made an 
appeal to them to do better. Even now, whenever in 
my mathematical occupations I place figures upon the 
blackboard, I rebuke my hand for its inability to draw as 
firm straight lines, as correct perpendiculars, as exactly 
round circles, as did these six-year-old children. But far 
Wore than on account of the accomplishment they have 
acquired, I deem them fortunate on account of the steadi-
-P-A-G-E-68
  384 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
ness and energy of mind which they have gained by hold- 
ing on without swerving to the idea of rounding until the 
intently aiming eye and obeying hand have completed the 
circle, quite slowly and surely, in one faultless drawing. 
But why did Pestalozzi cause so much to be memorized ? 
Why did he seem to have chosen the subjects of instruc- 
tion so little in accordance with the natural inclinations 
of children? Why did he make them always study or 
practise? Why never converse with them—never chat, 
never joke, never tell a story? Why were the sentences 
so disconnected? Why did the names stand isolated by 
themselves? Why was the whole range of devices for 
softening the rigidity of school life despised here? In all 
other respects Pestalozzi is at first sight a man full of love 
and friendliness. He greets so humanly everything hu- 
man. His first word seems to say to you, “ Whoever de- 
serves to find a heart, finds one here.” Why did he not 
pour forth more joy among the children who filled his 
whole soul? Why did he not combine more of the agree- 
able with the useful? 
These questions did asa fact not perplex me as much as 
they might, perhaps, have shaken the faith of others. I was 
prepared by my own experience and experiments to esti- 
mate the mental powers of children very much more highly 
than is usual, and to look for the cause of children’s pleas- 
ure or displeasure at instruction elsewhere altogether than 
in superfluous dallying on the one hand, or the supposed 
dryness and difficulty of things demanding seriousness and 
attention on the other. What is deemed by the teacher 
the easier and what is deemed the more difficult, I had 
several times found in children strikingly reversed. I 
had long held their feeling of a clear apperception to be 
the sole and genuine spice of instruction, and a regu- 
larity of sequence perfect and adequate in all respects
-P-A-G-E-69
CR ee ee Ee Ee aT S Seren oe ee 
LACONIC BREVITY IN ANSWERS. 35 
was to me the grand ideal in which I saw the thorough- 
going means for securing to all instruction its rightful 
effect. The main endeavour of Pestalozzi, as I was given 
to understand, was exactly the same; namely, to find this 
sequence, this arrangement and combination of all things 
which must be taught either simultaneously or success- 
ively. On the supposition that he had found it, or at 
least that he was on the right way thither, every inessen- 
tial addition, every adventitious aid would be an injury. 
It would be reprehensible, because it would distract atten- 
tion from the main point. If he has not found that se- 
quence, it still remains to be found, or at least to be 
amended and continued. But even in that case his 
method is correct; at least to the extent of throwing out 
the injurious additions. Its laconic brevity is its essential 
merit. Not a useless word is heard in his school; the 
train of apperception is never interrupted. ‘The teacher 
pronounces for the children constantly. Every faulty 
letter is expunged from the slate immediately. The child 
never dwells on its mistakes. The right track is never 
departed from; hence every moment marks progress. 
But the memorizing of names, of sentences, of defini- 
tions, and the seeming carelessness whether all this was 
understood, made me doubt and caused me to inquire. 
Pestalozzi answered me by a counter-question: “If the 
children did not think in doing it, would they learn so 
swiftly and cheerfully?” I had seen the cheerfulness. 
I had no explanation for it, unless I assumed that it was 
accompanied by inner activity. Continuing the conver'sa- 
tion, however, Pestalozzi led me to the idea that, after all, 
the intrinsic comprehensibleness of the instruction is a 
matter of far greater importance than that the child 
should understand on the instant what'is taught at that 
instant. Most of what was memorized related to subjects
-P-A-G-E-70
36  HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
of the children’s daily sense-perceptions. The child bear- 
ing a description in the mind left the school, met with 
the object, and though it did not comprehend the sense 
of the words until now, did comprehend it more perfectly 
than if the teacher had attempted to explain his words by 
other words. The happy moments of comprehension, and 
especially those of deeper pondering and connection, in 
short, of reflection, do not fall exactly within determinate 
lesson periods. Let the lesson give what is comprehensi- 
ble and set together that which belongs together. Time 
and opportunity will afterward supply the concept and 
will correlate what was set forth together. 
In connection with this, we must not forget that we 
are speaking only of small children. To them, a word, a 
name is not as to us merely the sign of a thing. The 
word itself is a thing. They linger upon the sound. Not 
until the latter has become commonplace to them do they 
learn to forget it in attention to the thing itself. You often 
hear a child for fun pronouncing one and the same word 
with all kinds of modifications. It plays with the sound. 
It is occupied altogether with the difference between two 
similar tones. It is to be presumed that the child is so 
occupied while reading Pestalozzi’s alphabetical register 
of names, where a word changes, but gradually, into 
another. This is the only plea I can make for this alpha- 
betical order. After all, however, I should restrict its 
use to the first, merely preliminary, acquaintance with 
names. 
Thus far I have sought to entertain you with such ex- 
ternals as, perhaps, strike one most immediately. Let us 
now penetrate more profoundly into the core of the subject. 
This core, I must beg you to bear in mind, is not the 
core of your cares as mothers and of your immediate 
wishes. The welfare of the people is Pestalozzi’s aim—
-P-A-G-E-71
es AP a a ae 
BOOKS FOR PARENTS. 387 
the welfare of the common, crude population. He de- 
sired to take care of those of whom fewest do take care. 
He did not seek the wreath of merit in your mansions, 
but in their hovels. Though he be able occasionally to 
bestow upon you a useful piece of advice, that is a second- 
ary matter. } 
I know to whom I am writing. This difference from 
you is not repugnant to you. Your interest extends with 
equal ease and joyousness as far as the furthest limits to 
which the activity of such a man can possibly penetrate 
or strive to penetrate. And it is necessary that this dis- 
position should remain ever present with you while you 
study his work. Otherwise, you would be unable to recog- 
nise the adequacy of his procedure, and you would be just 
as unable to determine correctly the application that you 
have to make of it for yourselves. In the mirror of in- 
dividual oares everything might easily appear distorted. 
You would find the whole too rough and clumsy in design, 
the method too stiff and tasteless. The most important 
part of education, the gentle nurture of the heart, you 
would find lacking absolutely. 
Pestalozzi speaks of the children of beggars. He 
says he understands the ideal education for them as com- 
prehending tillage, manufacture, and commerce. His 
devices are intended to serve them at first instead of their 
common, miserable instruction at school. It is his inten- 
tion to place in the hands of wholly ignorant teachers and 
parents such writings as they need only to cause the 
children to read off and learn by heart, without adding 
anything of their own. What he believed could be car- 
ried into effect most immediately he preferred; he must 
have his levers sturdy enough not to break even in clumsy 
hands. The book in which, under the form of letters to 
a friend, he describes the outlines of such a plan, belongs
-P-A-G-E-72
a 
88 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
really in the hands of such men as have influence on the 
organization of the lowest schools and upon parents of the 
lowest social ranks. Such men would be able to spread 
his actual schoolbooks, which are to be published in the 
future. What is faulty in the whole publication there- 
fore is, perhaps, its title, which brings it immediately into 
the hands of women, of mothers. 
Perhaps it hardly now seems conceivable to you that 
such a method should be invented for your benefit also. 
Let us look into it. Invariably the most pressing needs 
are the most universal needs also. It is therefore certain 
that one who is endeavouring to provide what is most 
urgent for all is also caring for us. 
In instruction, what is the most urgent element? 
Where does it lie in the realm of all that can be taught 
and learned ? 
Should you say it is a little of everything? A little 
natural history, a very little geography, a few anecdotes 
from history, a few little anecdotes of noble characters, 
great men and well-behaved children, now and then an 
Alsopian fable, some lucid exercises in the use of gram- 
matical cases, a few names of stars, ancient gods, and chem- 
ical preparations, now and then a conundrum, a bon mot, 
or an example in arithmetic—excuse me from continuing 
the list. That would be very convenient for Pestalozzi; 
it would enable him to save the great pains of finding out 
the right sequence in instruction. On the contrary, he 
would only need to shake up well so checkered a store in 
order to provide much variety and avoid fatiguing by 
monotony. The sequence of subjects would be a matter 
altogether of indifference. There would be no antecedent 
and no consequent; no one thing to presuppose any 
other. Accepting this arrangement then, in the memory 
as well as in the understanding of the child, each bit of
-P-A-G-E-73
    MOST NEEDFUL KNOWLEDGE. 39 
instruction will easily give place to another. What its 
little imagination finds piquant it will for a few weeks 
tell to its aunts and uncles. It will be applauded for a 
few odd combinations of its own. Upon occasion of the 
first truly interesting occurrence in its own experience it 
will forget the whole worthless mass. On this subject a 
good deal has been said and a good deal more might be, 
which is excluded by considerations of space. 
Would we really find the most urgent business of in- 
struction it is likely that we must search somewhat more 
diligently; it is improbable that mere guesswork will 
disclose it. I therefore beg for a prolongation of your 
patience. I fear almost that Pestalozzi, by betraying it 
too quickly to readers still requiring to be instructed by 
him, failed to make it lucidly convincing to them. 
Without doubt the most necessary instruction must be 
that which teaches man what he most needs to know. 
Now, what is needful to us is needful either to our phys- 
ical or our moral nature. We need it either as sensuous 
beings to enable us to live or we need it as beings in the 
social relations of citizenship, family life, and so forth, in 
order that we may know and do our duty. 
Agriculture, manufacturing, commerce, and all other 
gainful art and science pertain in the first class; religion, 
ethics, notions of civic rights and obligations belong to 
the second. 
Really, everybody not intending to be a sloth and a 
glutton, a being without duty and without right, needs 
instruction in both classes. 
But trades and arts, as well as relations which impose 
duties upon us, are nowadays so composite that instruc- 
tion in them of necessity must be composite also. Thus 
it is complicated in a number of ways, which constitute 
many simpler species of instruction.
-P-A-G-E-74
  40  HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
The school is not the place where it would be possible 
to educate a man wholly, or even mainly, either in the 
arts or in respect to ethics. Every one is obliged to learn 
his trade with a master in that trade, and his moral nature 
man in truth only forms for himself and in the midst of 
life. The school, therefore, can undertake a part only of 
the instruction which a man needs. It subdivides and 
therefore facilitates his learning. It can guide boyhood 
to relieve youth of a part of the toil. 
To a youth all the parts of his business are equally 
necessary; he must learn the whole. In order that this 
whole be not too great the boy should anticipatively com- 
prehend as much as he can comprehend. Now, this much 
should not be many segregated bits of knowledge, isolated 
turns of practical cleverness, disconnected moral acts. In 
order to master a large number of details the boy would 
have to be numerously endowed with powers. On the 
contrary, the most general information, the abilities whose 
influence extends the furthest, the aptitudes that break 
the road to the furthest extent for the whole of education, 
the anticipative training which finds application in the 
greatest number of moments in life, and which in every 
new application bears new fruit—in a word, that which 
afterward makes for the greatest number of possibilities 
is that which merits being first in order, so as to make all 
the rest possible, so as to enable the boy to make the most 
of life. 
Let us rapidly review this! Of what is needful, we 
said the school can furnish something, but not everything. 
The school is to do as much asit cando. For its pur- 
poses, therefore, the first and most important are those 
means of education the efficacy of which extends furthest, 
begins earliest, and is most frequently renewed by oppor- 
tunity. The school prefers what is most general, because
-P-A-G-E-75
WHAT THE SCHOOL SHOULD FURNISH. 41 
it facilitates the greatest number of subsequent proceed- 
ures. 
For he who knows the general already knows some- 
thing of each particular in which the general occurs. He 
is prepared to perfect his learning of the particular. He 
feels impelled to extend the knowledge, the acquisition of 
which he has begun. The difficulties, being already half 
conquered, do not make him hesitate much. Time and 
desire will sooner suffice. His attention is won for every 
object in which he finds bound up together that which is 
known and that which is new to him. An open entrance 
into some mysterious darkness entices to enter and inves- 
tigate. 
Now, what is the most general of all, the most helpful 
of all, and hence for the school the first of all? 
Nature and human beings surround the child continu- 
ally. They constantly carry around it currents bearing 
every species of mental nutriment. Would you prepare 
for it another mental nutriment than this which offers 
itself to the child spontaneously? yen supposing that 
you were able by a strong incitement of the phantasy to 
alienate it from its own experience, would you desire to 
do so? Suppose the child would allow its mind to be 
filled with African animals, Roman emperors, mountains 
in the moon, and angels in heaven, would an intelligent, 
able denizen of this world and would a character con- 
scious of itself be the result? You understand, of course, 
that in the last resort I desire to banish from instruction 
neither the African animals, nor the Roman emperors, 
nor the mountains in the moon, nor the angels in heaven; 
only they and all that is remote and as yet strange to the 
child is to be arranged into connection with what is near 
and of everyday occurrence, so as to cast a light upon the 
latter, expand it, freshen it, complement it; it is not to 
   
-P-A-G-E-76
42  HERBART’S ABC OF SENSH-PERCEPTION, 
thrust itself into the place of the latter so as to erect in- 
stead of the actual world of his occupations and duties a 
fantastical stage in the head of the child for idly hovering 
dreams. In this respect everything depends on the posi- 
tion of instruction; it should occupy such a position as 
ever to leave at the centre that which impresses itself on 
man most profoundly and most certainly; such a position 
as to have these deepest, surest, impressions also the 
truest, sharpest, and most exact, in order that the daily 
experiences of the child, the boy, the youth, and the man 
shall always find open gates and well-made roads to the 
head and the heart, so as to stir tongue and hand as the 
duty of the moment may require. 
It is true, the external world, the daily environment, 
seek of themselves entrance to the mind of the child by 
the eye and by the ear. But they very often bar their 
ingress by their own multiplicity, variety, manifoldness. 
Human beings speak quickly. Into a single syllable they 
compress many sounds, into a few words many thoughts. 
Nature in a single meadow shows many forms, in a single 
flower many colours. Implements in the house are mova- 
ble. They frequently change their position and their use. 
That this confusion is penetrated by the little child be- 
cause it is urged on by a vivid need I admit. It makes 
itself acquainted with the things; it learns to understand 
language and to make itself understood by language; it 
learns to determine by the eye the place whither it must 
reach in order to seize an object. Now, we say, it knows 
how to speak. It never occurs to us even to say it can 
also see now; just as if everybody who is born with his 
eyes open knew by the fact itself how to use his eyes. 
Nor does it occur to us to teach children how to hear, 
though every day we experience the consequences of this 
neglect by being shown that far the smallest number of 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  NEED OF LANGUAGE STUDY. 43 
people have a musical ear, i.e., know how to apperceive 
the differences of tone. 
But, I ask, is the child actually able to see, actually 
able to speak, actually able to understand language, now 
that it knows how to express to some extent its animal 
needs and to guide and direct the hands by the eye, now 
that it has just freed itself from the first and intolerable 
pain of being incomprehensible to us and of being optic- 
ally deceived itself? Are the avenues really opened by 
which Nature may stream in and human society communi- 
cate with the child? And in the course of time do our 
children as a matter of fact by and by spontaneously 
acquire the keen and exact eye of the savage and the ele- 
gant and felicitous expression of the Greek? When the 
child with slipshod manner caused by drowsiness barely 
glances over the surface of things so as to discriminate 
them, should need be, from each other, is not the wealth 
of forms that Nature surrounds us with wholly lost to him ? 
Is it likely that in the future he will be disposed to learn 
how to use an implement with accuracy if he has never 
observed with attention its form, and how this shape suits 
with and fits into other shapes? Do you believe that 
your children will like to impress upon their minds defi- 
nitely the details and magnitudes of the countries on the 
map; that your boys will take an interest in learning 
natural history, technology, mechanics, geometry, physics? 
Do you believe that any boy is well prepared for his trade 
who ceases practising and educating his eyes as soon as 
they may, if need be, help him out in the primary human 
needs ? 
Again, what stands so long and universally in the 
way of human education as lack of language? Who is

knows how to choose the appropriate expression nor how 
to appreciate the force of an expression well invented? 
Does even the educated man ever come to the end of the 
study of language, the creatress of all conversation, all 
society ? 
Exactly at the time when the child is still in motion, 
making language for itself, impressing forms on its mind, 
when need and exertion have not ceased in it, when it still 
asks for names, when it still finds every day new objects 
in its surroundings, inciting it to inspect them accurately, 
to look at them from all sides; now, before this natural 
progress comes to a standstill, now, when it is already 
slowing up, already inclining to immobile inertia, now is 
the time for succour; now must we perfect the opening 
up of the senses to shape and speech, in order that ability 
may be acquired to perceive nature and to understand the 
thoughts of men. 
Above all the other senses it is the eye that must show 
things ere they can be named and discussed. Practise in 
sense-perception, then, is the first of all, the most helpful 
of all, and the most general educational discipline which 
above we were looking for. Such exercises have been 
recommended by many. Pestalozzi, as far as I know, is 
the first to insist that this and no other instruction shall 
even at school, even in the lowest grade of the village 
school, actually occupy what is its due, the first and fore- 
most place in all instruction. 
His ABO of Sense-Perception, a collection of lines 
and figures which can be easily recognized, which can be 
reproduced definitely in drawing, which will recur to the 
child in almost all the objects of Nature and the imple- 
ments in the household, and which, consequently, may serve 
for preliminary exercises in measurement by the eye, he 
places emphatically in the van of all his educational ideas.
-P-A-G-E-79
  GEOMETRIC FORMS. 45 
Highly as I esteem him for so doing, yet I should like, at 
the hint of the science of forms, to withdraw very softly his 
equilateral quadrangle and substitute for it a sequence of 
triangles, which I should think would be a better auxil- 
iary for carrying out his own idea. Of this we shall speak 
further, if you please, on a future occasion. You need 
be afraid of my triangles as little as of his quadrangles, 
even if two or three trigonometrical terms slip in.* Besides 
this A B C of Sense-Perception, and besides a line of sug- 
gestions for exercises in language which he has not made 
known with sufficient definiteness, you will find indicated 
in his book a third very general means of all learning, 
which together with the other two is to constitute the 
foundation of all other instruction. It is practise in the 
use of numbers—the art of reckoning. That the art of 
counting is of very general usefulness, that without nu- 
merical conceptions any considerable number of things 
would overwhelm us mentally, that no division of a whole 
however slightly complicated, would be apperceived by us 
distinctly, and so on, is plain to you without argument. 
And yet you, and with you the greater part of educated 
men, see but little of the vast realm of numbers, of the 
manifold, extremely artful combinations of the same, to 
which the study of Nature, even of common, every day 
nature which lies before the eyes of all, has driven in- 
vestigators. This is the reason why I have said little of 
this elementary means of instruction, though quite essen- 
tial. Pestalozzi, too, is very brief on this point. The 
exercises in mental arithmetic which have been long cus- 
  
* Pestalozzi looks upon his A B C of Sense-Perception especially 
as preliminary exercises for drawing. In the posthumous works of 
Raphael Mengs, Halle, 1786, vol. iii, pp. 200 ff., there is a highly 
emphatic recommendation of such pre-exercises for drawing geo- 
metrical figures, for art-students.
-P-A-G-E-80
  46  HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
tomary in many German burgher schools no doubt carry 
out this idea more completely than he intimates it, but it is 
hard to believe them there placed in correct relation to the 
whole of instruction as they are in the school of Pestalozzi. 
To further the converse of man with his world is, 
then, Pestalozzi’s primary purpose. That by this means 
the external activity of man—every species of gainful 
occupation—is facilitated, is obvious. But is anything 
done by this means for morality? ‘That, perhaps, has 
been done tacitly which is presupposed by the moral les- 
sons, the pathetic stories, and all the various excitations 
to ethical feeling, of which many—and a part of them 
excellent—have been composed for the benefit of chil- 
dren. The soil they are to occupy has been prepared. 
That is to say, the man or the child whose eye and ear 
are given up to Nature and human society is to that extent 
withdrawn from the sensations within himself, in other 
words, from his own pleasure or displeasure; egotism is 
rendered impossible in one that pays attention not to him- 
self but to the relations of things and of other persons. 
Such a one is prepared soon to regard himself as only one 
of these people collectively, as one among many, and thus 
he will soon find his appropriate place. The habit of 
taking a general view of the relations of many, when it 
has become the chief tendency of the mind, of itself carries 
with it a love, never more to be lost, for order in these 
relations and for the maintenance of such order by justice 
and morality. Afterward, when these roots of the moral 
sentiment have grown and spread, comes the time for the 
direction of man’s attention to himself again, in order 
that he may try to gain power over himself, analyze, and 
purify by watchful criticism his sentiments, and enlist his 
powers wholly in the service of the general purposes which 
he has recognised.

  PESTALOZZI’S SHORTCOMINGS. 4T 
You will not carry what has here been said to the ex- 
tent of supposing that in the school exercises which have 
been indicated there is a miraculous force for rectifying 
with certainty the character of every child. In respect 
to morality, perhaps more than in any other respect, every 
human being, independently of education, inclines in his 
own quite peculiar direction. Consequently, there is a 
corresponding need for an especial nurture and care for 
each person. ‘To this, attention may be called, it is true, 
by general rules, and preparations may be made by general 
means. But the exact determination of what is to be 
done in specific cases must be committed to the delicate 
and profoundly reflective judgment of a near observer. 
It is true that a general view of the relations of many 
people is always the true basis for morality; but in order 
to give to childhood this view, the Pestalozzian exercises 
will be insufficient with one child, while with another they 
will hardly be necessary. None the less, by them the di- 
rection is indicated whither the educator should turn his 
first more definite endeavours in the formation of charac- 
ter. But—how far we have passed beyond the sphere of 
the Pestalozzian reform ! 
Let us return to it. What has thus far been developed 
relates only to the very first beginnings of that series 
which we seek. As to the continuation and completion 
of the same, Pestalozzi has as yet left us very much in the 
dark. However, you will find, now and then, in the book 
some remarkable points. To expatiate on them would 
not be to the purpose in this essay, which is intended only 
as an introduction to the book. 
Another matter remains to be considered. We must 
determine by a comparison how the totality of Pestalozzi’s 
branches of instruction is related to the whole scope of 
your own pau n equipment. No doubt the former  
-P-A-G-E-82
  } 
48  HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
is incomparably greater in respect to the number of peo- 
ple whom it is intended to serve, but the latter, on the 
other hand, is incomparably greater in respect to the - 
number of activities, of considerations, and of reflections 
which must be provided for in it. In what has preceded 
we endeavoured with Pestalozzi to meet the most neces- 
sary wants; a.mother desires to do more for her children. 
The most necessary things vanish—often only too much 
so—among the many things which she would like to ac- 
complish, and actually, under the favouring conditions of 
the higher ranks of society, can accomplish. If these 
many things, if the whole of an education equipped with 
every auxiliary, had been the subject of discussion, we, 
seeking for something else, should have found something 
else, and should have found it by an entirely different line 
of reflections. 
In the preceding we found the most general as being 
that which facilitates the most of what is necessary. Start- 
ing from this point, we found exercises in sense-perception, 
speaking, and counting as being the most general prepa- 
rations for the apperception and use of that means of edu- 
cation which every one possesses, which thrusts itself upon 
every one, no matter of what rank and position—to wit, 
his daily experience. Thus we saw the generality of man- 
kind in a state of need. In such a state the lower classes 
of the population actually are. By way of alleviation we 
must bring in all haste simply the largest supplies we can 
lay our hands upon, the most solid, the most substantial. 
To the extent that the actual needs are common to all 
human beings, it was for us also a preliminary care to 
provide against possible sufferings from a deficiency of the 
necessaries. To the extent, however, that a higher cul- 
ture is for us the larger and more difficult problem, you 
have, I am certain, observed ere this that we require a far
-P-A-G-E-83
  “ESTHETIC PERCEPTION. 49 
greater delicacy of feeling with a far larger horizon, a far 
richer imagination. We, in addition, require an apt eye 
for far greater profundities of investigation. All this one 
has not hitherto dared so much as offer to the generality 
of mankind for fear of endangering its work. ‘These re- 
sults can only be gained through education by a proce- 
dure which, to be sure, comprises the preceding, but which 
nevertheless starts from a main point of view that is 
different. You ask, Which is this main point of view? 
Which is this first object giving to the educator the thor- 
oughgoing rules for his whole enterprise, and more es- 
pecially for determining the series. It is easy for me to 
write down a word. Let him care at all points for the 
possibility of a&STHETIC PERCEPTION. But for you this 
word is hardly plain enough; and some men will set 
against it exclamation points. Nor do I write it down to 
any end, except to indicate somewhat more distinctly by 
means of contrast the one-sidedness which Pestalozzi in 
the pursuit of his purpose was neither willing nor able to 
avoid. 
CHAPTER ITI. 
HERBART’S pedagogical activity in the leading families 
of the city republic of Bremen did not, of course, remain 
without influence on the city schools. To enter into details 
lies, however, entirely beyond the scope of this work. Nor 
does it come within its compass even to enumerate the titles 
of Herbart’s lectures, delivered before the Bremen Literary 
Society and at the Bremen Museum. 
One of the latter addresses suffices to state his final judg- 
ment on the sphere and value of Pestalozzianism. The ad- 
dress was delivered after Herbart had gone to Gottingen 
and while passing through Bremen on jmey It was
-P-A-G-E-84
    50 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
published in pamphlet form. The reference to his previous 
addresses to Bremen audiences in the opening sentences is 
obvious. 
That Herbart’s mind is no longer in a tentative state as 
to Pestalozzianism is equally evident. This ripening in Her- 
bart’s opinion is due partly to Pestalozzi’s publishing in the 
preceding year, 1803, three important works on his system ; 
namely, the Mothers’ Manual, the A B C of Sense-Percep- 
tion, and the Objective Teaching of Number Relations. In 
larger part, however, as the reader will feel, though he may 
not be able to analyze the feeling, it is due to reflection on 
the subject. Herbart’s really profound parallel between the 
obscurity of Pestalozzi and that of Fichte contributes to pro- 
duce this feeling or conviction in the reader. It shows that 
his psychology as well as his pedagogy had been brought to 
bear on the problem of Pestalozzianism. In the preceding 
article, as the reader will remember, he had not gone so 
deeply. He dwelt more on the surface. He glossed over 
the Pestalozzian obscurity by attributing it to the haste of 
an old and busy man. Herbart’s rejection of pedagogic ex- 
clusiveness also shows that he had taken a larger range of 
vision than most of his contemporaries, who insisted either 
on championing Basedow’s philanthropinist method, or on 
joining Pestalozzi in his search for the true order of studies. 
If further evidence were needed of the rapid evolution of 
Herbart’s thought, it is furnished by his pronounced opposi- 
tion to the doctrine of transcendental freedom preached by 
Fichte, his great teacher. As we have said, this evolution, 
so important to the history of pedagogy, is mainly psycho- 
logical. Herbart recognised that the German, the English- 
man, the Turk, the Negro, and the Samoyed, are not, psycho- 
logically, the same man. He is ready to begin his greatest 
negative task in psychology, the demolition of those arti- 
ficial pigeonholes, the so-called faculties, into which the 
human mind was then supposed to be divisible. 
For public educators in America, whose attention is viv- 
idly drawn to moral education by criticism on the alleged 
insufficiency of the public schools in this respect, interest in
-P-A-G-E-85
   EDUCATIVE INSTRUCTION. Dili 
this point of Herbartianism centres, of course, on Herbart’s 
showing the connection between re-presentations (or ideas) 
and character-building. Two traits in the treatment we 
would especially emphasize: First, the plain inference that 
of this as of other problems, EDUCATIVE INSTRUCTION is the 
solution ; second, the reminder that success in moral, full as 
much as in intellectual, education depends on the proper 
psychologic grading of the training conferred. This is a 
vital condition under any system of pedagogy. And yet we 
find it daily and hourly forgotten in the schoolroom and 
elsewhere by zealots in ethical training. 
On THE PRopeR Pornt oF VIEW FOR JUDGING THE 
PESTALOZZIAN Mrtruop oF INSTRUCTION. 
A Discourse delivered by invitation at the Bremen Museum. 
A transit like my present one through Bremen does 
not, it must be admitted, afford time for preparing a regu- 
lar public address. Yet I have been given a friendly call, 
to which I have the more pleasure in responding, for the 
reason that several years ago I had an opportunity of per- 
sonally experiencing the indulgence of the honourable 
public which is here assembled. 
The request made upon me has not been simply for a 
discourse, but a subject has also been assigned to me. I 
am to speak of the Pestalozzian method of instruction. 
By this time so much has been spoken and heard on this 
subject, the public by empty trumpeting has been put into 
such a tension of high expectation, while on the other hand 
dry elementary books have disheartened it, and I myself 
have already upon so many occasions spoken my mind by 
tongue and by pen, that for me at least the time has come, 
perhaps, for silence. Since, however, I am reduced to en- 
tertaining you with a rhapsody of thoughts, we may per- 
haps as well start from that which has been often discussed,
-P-A-G-E-86
52 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
whence an unconstrained association of ideas may haply 
drift us on to interesting points, since assuredly a number 
lie in the neighbourhood. 
It is not good for the Pestalozzian cause itself to keep 
any one gazing at it alone. In the inventor’s mind it 
hangs together with all sorts of concepts and endeavours, 
never distinctly given utterance to by him. Men defer- 
ring to advanced age the beginnings of their activity, 
usually meet with the fate of being unable to find their 
way out of the multiplicity of their accumulated ideas 
and intentions. One has just passed away from among 
us—Kant. He would no doubt have avoided the burden- 
some prolixity of his writings if he had come forward at a 
time when his investigations still remained more of a nov- 
elty to him, and he with greater ease thought each one 
separately, and before, in connection with them, he had in- 
vented so much terminology. The need of labelling every- 
thing by names and technical terms does not arise until 
the multiplicity before the mind becomes too large for 
every detail to be known and discriminated distinctly by 
its specific shape. 
In the case of Pestalozzi we have to add: he was 
too deficient in scientific auxiliaries, and perhaps still 
more in the cold-bloodedness needed in handling scien- 
tific tools, in properly heating and mixing the learned 
drugs, and in writing orderly recipes for our imitation 
of his art. True, he had at last to make the conces- 
sion of presenting at least a few parts of his method in 
definite scholastic formule in order to have any hope of 
spreading that method. But he has done it with such 
stiffness as to make one think that he, the once popular 
author of Leonard and Gertrude, praised for his beautiful, 
vivid, attractive style, is metamorphosed into a pedantic 
drillmaster in arithmetic, pleased with himself for having
-P-A-G-E-87
    PESTALOZZI'S OBSCURITY. 53 
filled a thick book with the multiplication table. A com- 
parison with a very famous philosopher again obtrudes 
itself. Fichte, by a few anonymous writings, made a host 
of fiery adherents and equally fiery opponents. Both 
agreed only in finding the force and clearness of his lan- 
guage worthy of amazement. Yet the same Fichte took 
on an exasperating resemblance to the obscurest of the 
Schoolmen the moment he became the author of the Sci- 
ence of Knowledge. Strange, indeed, that men most full 
of life assume the driest tone when they have it at heart 
to expound their very depths of thought. Goethe has 
said: He who has thought that which is profoundest 
loves that which is fullest of life. You see that the ob- 
verse dictum holds good also: Intensity of life has a pe- 
culiar inclination and ability for plunging into the pro- 
foundest depths of thought. Admitting that what comes 
from life leads to life, the dry methods, it is to be pre- 
sumed, are only a dark passage out of light into light. 
If we look upon it that way, if our youths and boys be 
submitted to an exertion similar to that practised by such 
a man in taming his own powers, the constraint which 
he imposed upon his imagination might be of equally 
beneficial effect in their case. For, after all, the whole of 
education does rest upon the early habituation of the sup- 
ple boy, the tender child, to those mental and physical 
movements which, out of all the trials and endeavours of 
man during many centuries, we have selected as the best 
and the most profitable. The best and the most profit- 
able—* Ay, there’s the rub!” That is the very point in 
the dispute. Are the Pestalozzian forms better and do 
_ they profit more for the purposes of instruction than the 
amiable, varied entertainments upon which we were re- 
cently congratulating ourselves at our having been so for- 
tunate as to introduce into our schools? That is exactly 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
54 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
what people call in question—whether to keep the chil- 
dren for months on a description of the human body 
while they carry about with them constantly the reality to 
which the description relates, be better than to give them 
useful and agreeable geographical knowledge by which 
they acquire concepts of the world, its magnitude, beauty, 
and so forth. At this point I must, gentlemen, above all, 
enter a lively protest against that way of stating the prob- 
lem. This “whether” and this “or” is not my way of 
looking at the question by any means. The main propo- 
sition I shall stand upon is, that neither method is to 
exclude the other. However, not to become too serious, 
I shall, being a traveller, with your permission take a brief 
journey into another territory, a territory upon which the — 
art of education has the fortune, or, if you like, misfor- 
tune, of closely bordering—I mean the domain of phi- 
losophy. 
In the first place, let us cast a glance at the variety 
found together in the mind of an adult person. It con- 
sists of knowledge and of imaginings; of decisions and of 
doubts ; of good and bad, stronger and weaker, conscious 
and unconscious sentiments. Its composition in educated 
differs from that in uneducated man. It differs as be- 
tween Germans, Frenchmen, Englishmen, Turks, Negroes, 
and Samoyeds. The manner of its composition will de- 
termine the individuality of the man. Education desires 
to act on it, building and improving, only it does not 
exactly know how to take hold, and to what extent it dare 
have confidence in itself. Let me ask, does the principle 
of a man’s education lie in himself in the sense in which 
the whole shape of a plant lies prepared in its germ, or 
does the construction of his individuality originate in the 
course of his life only? The latter assumption would be 
somewhat like assuming that, under appropriate condi-
-P-A-G-E-89
IS HUMAN CHARACTER INNATE? 55 
tions, a lichen during its growth might become a moss, a 
moss by degrees a grass, the grass a shrub, and the shrub 
a fruit tree, or reversely. This assumption would imply 
that none of these organisms is in itself a finality, but 
that it is open to changes in its internal structure by ex- 
ternal accidents, exactly as the act of the gardener does, 
in fact, change many flowers so that they become double, 
although they were by nature single, and so forth. On 
such an assumption the art of the gardener would be a far 
greater art than it now is. We should demand at its hands 
regularity and beauty in the shapes of plants. Gardeners 
continuing human, after all, they would also, no doubt, 
incur many a guilt of negligence or even of ruination, 
which would not be readily forgiven them, since a thing 
so perceptible as a plant immediately betrays to all eyes 
every malformation which it has assumed. Furthermore, 
according to the different taste of each nation, we should 
find flowers and trees different in Germany, in France, in 
England. Every nation would prescribe the cut of its 
trees as carefully as fathers to-day endeavour to educate 
their sons, and good patriots the rising generation of their 
countrymen, after their idea or even in their own likeness. 
I hope I have made myself understood. 
Let us return to the question. Does a human being 
bring with him into the world his future shape or does 
he not? In respect to his body he doubtless does; but 
that is not our question. We speak of the mind, the 
character, the interest, the entire disposition. Here we 
meet, as you are aware, a host of opinions. A man’s 
temperament is bestowed by nature, say some. Natu- 
rally, man is good, say others. But, by original sin, 
“born evil” is added by a third group. It is educa- 
tion that makes everything of him is the opinion of a 
fourth judge. He makes, posits, and determines him-

self, exclaim the latest systems, forgetting as they do so 
that they themselves in other places have declared all sen- 
suous existence—both of the inner and outer senses—to 
be a pure product of natural necessity, and that they were 
bound so to declare. The last-named party is disposed of 
the most easily. Such philosophers have closed their in- 
telligible world against every influence ; it is to be wished 
that they would also avoid letting any influence emanate 
from it, in order that our sensuous world—i. e., everything 
that we can in any way discover in our consciousness— 
may go quite undisturbed on-its own way. We should then 
impute to the sensuous man what was done by the sen- 
suous man, and what he ought to do would be made the 
the object of education and of the social institutions, 
which, when all is said and done, are in the power of man, 
whereas nobody can do anything with the intelligible 
world. Let us leave aside, then, this mere dream, which 
psychology is bound to declare a delusion, ethics a misun- 
derstanding, and metaphysics an absolute impossibility.* 
Let us turn to experience, for there is not now time for 
a lengthy disquisition. We find in animals instincts. We 
find even in the lower animals art impulses; whence the 
similarity in the lives of all bees, and in the lives of all 
caterpillars of the same species. These animals, it is true, 
have freedom of motion, but the interior irritation or 
promptings everywhere accompanying them give them no 
respite. They must fulfil the work of their nature. They 
have impulses only because they are impelled by irritation. 
They continually act on the same impulse. Their action is 
to the purpose, it is consistent merely because the irritation 
continues always the same, or, at all events, changes in 
* My remarks are strictly applicable only to transcendental free- 
dom, not to the intelligible world in general, nor to freedom in 
general. 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
     WHAT THE WILL Is, 57 
them periodically only according to a natural rule. Much 
more consistent, even, is the internal action of a plant. 
But much more inconsistent is the action of man. He is 
rational in the place of instinctive. He is impelled by the 
mechanism produced by the re-presentations or ideas that 
he has apperceived. These re-presentations themselves are 
forces which check and aid each other. They constitute 
powers which elevate and throw down, oppress and lib- 
erate one another, and which by this very conflict get into 
all those conditions which we call by a name far too gen- 
eral, far too indefinite—will. How much there is implied 
in this expression will! Inclination, desire, fear, courage, 
choice, whim, decision, reflection ; good will not knowing 
what is good, ill will imagining itself good; at another 
time, insight without resolution, a resolve without force ; 
the detestation of a crime which in the same moment is 
knowingly committed; and all the other phenomena in 
which the marvellous mixture and isolation of the first 
named, their incessant and continuous mutation and new 
formation, every instant put to shame and annihilate the 
divisions made by the philosophers between the under- 
’ standing and the will, between the reason and arbitrary 
choice, between the impulses and human freedom. The 
significance of these terms it never has been possible ex- 
actly to explain, to determine, to limit. They are approxi- 
mate designations of vacillating positions in a machine 
which in the course of time is incessantly building itself 
differently, and therefore incessantly changing in action 
and tendency. Only do not let us forget for a moment 
that this machine is exclusively built of re-presentations 
or ideas. Hence it has no tendency but a tendency into 
actual re-presentation, does not attain anything by all its 
internal and external activity and efficacy but new re- 
presentation, and suffers nothing from without but the
-P-A-G-E-92
58 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
checking of old representations. What I am saying this 
moment of man every man would every moment say of 
himself, were it not for the one troublesome little cireum- 
stance that representation does not represent itself but its 
objects, just as the eye sees not itself but the things around 
it. Could the eye see its own seeing, man would be able 
to perceive immediately that he wills only representations 
and knows only representations, or, to speak more exactly, 
that his knowledge is only a perfected and his volition a 
checked resurgent representation. Such seeing and per- 
ceiving will happen when the Weser River flows upward, 
the lions and lambs play together, and the latitude and 
longitude of Liliput and Brobdignag are determined with 
precision. 
I daresay we have philosophized long enough, at least 
for an occasion where we have no opportunity to offer 
proofs, but only to proffer assertions. Let us return to 
education. If the truth of my assertions be granted, edu- 
cation will endeavour to nourish man by representations. 
It would determine upon composing him of them alto- 
gether, had Nature not decided for the most part what 
representations a man is to have, and if Nature, after all 
is said and done, did not have to furnish the objects, as it 
had, in the first place, to furnish the representing being 
himself. Nature, however, is kind. She both gives to 
-man and yields to man. It is this that provides the 
work for a Pestalozzi and a Basedow. As many plants 
and animals are nourished by the sea and earth, so many 
pictures are heaped about the child. All the mischief 
and folly ever perpetrated by arrogance and delusion, 
invented and noted down by industrious scribes, and 
copied by monks doing penance, furnish so many tales 
ready at hand to satisfy the curiosity of children and in- 
cite the impetuosity of boys. The means of education 
«

displayed for our free disposal are plentiful. It is their 
very multiplicity that embarrasses us. The impressions 
from the natural world and the world of culture that 
carry their currents around the child are in such number 
as seems almost to make the art consist more in keeping 
them off than in bringing them on. It is in this regard that 
if accident be allowed full sway it makes of every indi- 
vidual a separate being. Nay, it alternately builds up 
and destroys in the same child. It sets the individual at 
variance with himself. It sets men at variance with one 
another. It could not do so were human nature firmly 
laid out in its plan, like a plant or like every animal body. 
Such a predisposition circumstances, to be sure, might 
favour or check, but they could not mark it with contradic- 
tions such as we find in man and society. But for the 
very reason that human power only elaborates what it 
receives, it is of such great importance what we give to it. 
Therefore, education must regard its office in very essence 
as consisting of giving and withdrawing. Education by 
no means consists merely in supervising and tending, like 
our gardening art that makes only plants its care. In the 
case of the latter the one essential point is to bring about 
favourable and keep off unfavourable circumstances, and 
to have rain and warmth, the soil and the atmosphere 
well suited to each kind of plant. Man, on the contrary, 
requiring no determinate climate but making his way in 
any one, capable of becoming, as you will, a wild animal 
or personified reason, and formed incessantly by circum- 
stances, needs an art which shall build him up and con- 
struct him in order that he may receive the form that is 
right. And the form which is right is that which in the 
future, when he shall comprehend himself, will please 
him; which, when others contemplate him, gains him 
their assent; and which, when with them he is to con-

stitute a social whole, enables him to join them with ac- 
curacy and effect. 
Let us assume that art or accident, no matter which, 
has begun, and is continuing to do what Nature does not 
do. Let us suppose a person in a condition of half-educa- 
tion, and with one-half of his plasticity still open to influ- 
ence. In this intermediate state the human being has 
obviously approached the plant. Already something ex- 
ists which, if unhindered, develops in a definite way, and 
which in an equally definite way helps or resists any new 
accession. Obversely, too, any new accession must now 
so conform to what already exists as to be helpfully pro- 
motive of its further thrift—granting, let us suppose, the 
desirability of thriving. The art of continuing an educa- 
tion already begun grows, therefore, more and more simi- 
lar to the art of gardening. The blessings of education 
change more and more into mere almsgiving. The 
treatment changes more and more into a touch as of a 
breath. True giving and withdrawing diminish. In a 
child’s mind a definite interest may be implanted. The 
interest of a youth can only be fostered. A child believes 
what it is told, thinks what it has heard, does what it has 
seen ; we build a world for it by pictures and tales. Ina 
youth, on the contrary, we can only widen or narrow the 
world in which he lives; in it he builds himself a hut, 
disdaining a palace built elsewhere against his sentiments. 
If these are known truths, then I should like to ask 
why the spirit of the Pestalozzian method is deemed a 
riddle, and why there is still doubt as to its worth and the 
place appropriate for it. I should hope no one is so far 
in error as to think it mainly hinges on the well-known 
descriptions of the human body, the horizontal lines, and 
the paraphrase of the multiplication table. As regards 
the subject-matter of instruction, pedantic limitations

THE PESTALOZZIAN METHOD, 61 
must not be thought of. The whole field of actual and 
possible sense-perception is open to the Pestalozzian 
method; its movements in it will grow constantly freer 
and larger. Its peculiar merit consists in having laid hold 
more boldly and more zealously than any former method 
of the duty of building up the child’s mind, of construct- 
ing in it a definite experience in the light of clear sense- 
perception; not acting as if the child had already an 
experience, but taking care that he gets one; by not chat- 
ting with him as though in him, as in the adult, there 
already were a need for communicating and elaborating 
his acquisitions; but, in the very first place, giving him 
that which later on can be, and is to be, discussed. The 
Pestalozzian method, therefore, is by no means qualified 
to crowd out any other method, but to prepare the way 
for it. It takes care of the earliest age that is at all capa- 
ble of receiving instruction. It treats it with the serious- 
ness and simplicity which are appropriate where the very 
first raw materials are to be procured. But we can be 
no more content with it than we can regard the human 
mind as a dead tablet on which the ee remain as orig- 
inally written down. The entertaining or conversational 
method which in the main dates from Basedow has the 
peculiarity, in its way an excellent one, of seeking to 
adapt itself to the natural movements of the child’s mind. 
It should therefore follow close upon the Pestalozzian 
method when the latter has finished. In practice both 
methods require to be fitted to each other. Here is the 
gap which so far remains unfilled. It will be filled, how- 
ever, if we are patient. Bremen is so happy as to possess 
men of whom it may be hoped that by a pleasant and rare 
co-operation they will give the first example of such a 
many-sidedness as is required by the extremely different 
periods in the age of the human being.

CHAPTER IV. 
AFTER resigning from Gottingen to accept the distin- 
guished chair at Kénigsberg, occupied before him by Kant, 
and after him by Rosenkranz, Herbart, in 1810, founded a 
pedagogical seminary. In addition, he was a co-founder 
and for a while the leader of the Pedagogical Society. 
As we are about to present a specimen of work done at 
the latter, it seems wise first to understand the spirit in 
which its discussions were conducted. To this end we ask 
the perusal of the following paper, which was found among 
Herbart’s manuscripts and posthumously published. 
On PrpaGgoGioaL Discussions AND THE CONDITIONS 
UNDER WHICH THEY MAY BE USEFUL. 
I. 
It is the rule for everybody who is asked for an opin- 
ion to have one; for if he had not, he would invent one. 
As many people as find opportunity to talk on a subject 
not exactly involving Greek or Arabic or the integral cal- 
culus, are incited to set up some view, no matter how 
one-sided it may be, as their view, and to adorn it with 
words. ; 
The endeavour of every one in a disputation to assert 
his proposition rarely results in convincing others, but 
usually in the confirmation of his own mode of thinking. 
Plausible arguments can be found for everything ; as they 
grow in number, so grows one’s partiality for one’s own 
invention. 
These evils increase the more a subject is of the kind for 
which decisive conclusions are difficult and yet for which 
the appearance of reasonableness on all sides very plen- 
teous. Pedagogy stands in this predicament. Everybody  
-P-A-G-E-97
  EMOTIONAL JUDGMENTS, 63 
has seen and experienced something of education, at least 
in his own case. Every one has drawn from social inter- 
course, from history, from would-be philosophical reflec- 
tions and aphorisms, now supplied by every elegant peri- 
odical, some sort of opinions concerning the destiny and 
educability of man. Such opinions are intimately con- 
nected with his feelings, with his way of thinking and 
acting. In his pedagogical opinions he represents him- 
self; in defending them he defends his own personality. 
Whatever has been said and written concerning pedagogy 
is judged by every one according to his feelings; but the 
unsafe character of emotional judgments is well-known. 
What will become of the case when pedagogy gets to 
be the talk of the day, and many are invited to participate 
in the discussion? 1. A multitude raise their voices 
simultaneously, every one full of self-confidence and but 
little inclined to hear. 2. Others listen, but have soon 
made up their mind, and have only been deprived of ap- 
petites for thorough investigation. 3. In practice, the abil- 
ity of each one decides. Each follows his own opinion, 
as far as circumstances permit. The result is mingled with 
a number of adventitious circumstances; they falsify the 
teachings supposed to be derived from experience. Still 
more falsifying is the admixture of one-sided appercep- 
tions of experience and of surreptitious conclusions. 4. 
Finally the whole subject appears as a matter for decision 
by majority vote. 
This natural course of things in respect to pedagogy is 
elucidated by the fate of philosophy, if not of the sciences 
generally. The more the public has chattered about phi- 
losophy, the deeper has this branch fallen. Even that 
there are so many less studious people now than formerly, 
has, I doubt not, its main cause in a certain widespread 
shallowness, the result of sham culture. Granting that 
%

pedagogy is a science, such as must be spread to enable it 
to be useful, it is, nevertheless, endangered by a precursor 
and substitute consisting of a crowd of contending opinions. 
For many people it would be better never to have heard 
anything about pedagogy until they could be reached by 
sound instruction, and many errors are avoided by not in- 
sisting on people’s saying something when they know 
nothing profund to say. In a democracy and during 
revolutions the political opinion of many is asked, and 
arbitrariness and fancyings accordingly arise. instead of 
sound reflection ; but in the state something may always 
be left for arbitrariness to deal with. In science, and 
consequently in pedagogy, there is simply no room for it. 
I 
Under what conditions can pedagogical discussions, 
nevertheless, be of use? 
1. Principles must be assumed from which arguments 
can be developed, and by which they can be tested. 
(a) Principles concerning the ultimate end of educa- 
tion and instruction as well as the purpose for which 
schools are founded. Such principles depend on the pro- 
founder principles concerning the worth of man and the 
business of the citizen. He, for example, who believes 
that schools are founded to stamp officials of various 
grades can never agree with him who insists that edu- 
cated men should impress their stamp upon officialdom. 
(2) Principles as to the educability of man. The dis- 
putation, for example, of one who believes that a northern 
climate will not bear Greek and Roman culture—or, con- 
versely, of one who believes that what the heroes and sages 
of Greece lacked in the way of pedagogic auxiliaries is of 
no use—will not instruct one who holds that the educa- 
bility of man is founded in the universal and principal
-P-A-G-E-99
  
PEDAGOGICAL DISCUSSIONS. 65 
traits of human nature, external circumstances being but 
a coefficient in which the lack of one thing is often com- 
pensated by something else, our business being to arrange 
everything in the most advantageous way possible under 
the circumstances. 
2. No one must demand a vote who has not pedagog- 
ical experience. 
(a) This experience must have been acquired with 
children of different ages, up into the later years of 
youth, and with individuals of different dispositions and 
education ; for no age displays the quality of another. 
(0) The experience must have been gained from sin- 
gle, long, and sufficiently observed individuals. Otherwise, 
it is impossible to see the inner nature. In schools where 
the teacher can enter little upon the training of individ- 
uals, all appear much less educable than, in fact, they are ; 
for only that small amount of educability is revealed which 
obeys the short and rapid touch which the teacher can ex- 
pend upon any individual. In order to observe the recip- 
rocal, very strong influence of fellow-pupils upon one 
another, the teacher must be a thoroughly practiced ob- 
server or it will escape him entirely. Speaking generally, 
a school-teacher is always inclined to look upon his class 
as a historian does upon a nation, namely, as a crowd of 
people which one must seek to gain a total impression of. 
This total impression falsifies the apperception of every 
individual. 
(ec) The interpretation of one’s own experiences must 
not have become a habit of representing to one’s self all 
boys and youth to be like those whom one has seen; all 
results of methods to be like the results one has obtained 
from one’s own method, but the single actual specimen 
must have been contemplated and reflected upon as sur- 
rounded by other possibilities; during experience one

must have noticed all that must have turned out otherwise, 
if this or that circumstance had changed. But for those 
precautions, different people will always have different ex- 
periences, according as they set about it, and each one’s 
vigorous assertion of his own experience will not in the 
least refute another who has an experience too. 
3. The disputants must not be more than can enter into 
sufficient mutual explanation. When the number is so 
large that either one must take the whole time or each one 
may speak only a few words in order that others also may 
have the floor, misunderstandings originate from insuffi- 
cient utterances and annoyance of false interpretations 
which one does not get the time to rectify. Hence the 
number of conferees should grow but gradually. The 
first who come together must have come to an agreement 
among themselves, if the accession of others is to be 
of use. 
4. Rulership should not be accorded to the maxim of 
polite society that no subject should be exhausted, but the 
seriousness of thorough reflection must be adequate to the 
importance of the matter. 
CHAPTER V. 
In June, 1814, Court Preacher Zippel read before the 
Pedagogical Society an essay, the essential contents of 
which may be surmised from the tenor of Herbart’s Obser- 
vations upon them, which we shall next present. They 
show us Herbart actually at work in pedagogical discussion. 
Besides, much of the Observations remains as applicable 
to-day as when first uttered. 
The cry against the multiplicity of studies, as the reader 
will see, isan old one. At first sight Herbart’s insistence 
on many-sidedness seems to make matters worse. But it is, 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
  MANY-SIDEDNESS OF STUDIES. 67 
indeed, the very reverse of a sanction of the existing confu- 
sion. In the first place, Herbart, who more nobly and more 
carefully than any other man has claimed for the school all 
that it can really do, sets forth with equal carefulness its 
limits. This limitation removes at a stroke the pernicious 
tendency to regard the school as a factotum. 
It is worth while pointing out that this very tendency 
stands sponsor with us for two exactly opposite evils. We 
are prone to an overlaudation, which is an invisible barrier 
to a true appreciation of educational needs. But we are 
equally prone to indulge in a vastly diversified multiplicity 
of complaints, which display with equal clearness the lack 
of an exact estimate of the limitations to the efficiency of 
our teachers and schools. 
Till critics perceive the line of delimitation pointed out 
by Herbart, they will inveigh against the schools for condi- 
tions for which the schools are in no way responsible. 
In the second place, Herbart proclaims the doctrine that 
the pupil has as good a right to his free time as the teacher 
has to his or hers, and, consequently, he insists on the ut- 
most possible economy of time; subjectively by intense in- 
trinsic interest; objectively by the organic connection of 
instruction. To-day courses, teachers, and students are still 
more overburdened, and the revolt against mechanical 
teaching and examination crams is gaining ground every- 
where. Hence, every word he says on the subject is worth 
thinking over. We are listening to a scientist who con- 
fesses to twenty years’ toil before gaining an insight into 
even the foundations of a real psychology. 
More than this, we are listening to a thinker io whom 
the negative results of metaphysical endeavour and the very 
positive results of mathematical investigations had taught 
the lesson which no practical teacher can bear in mind too 
persistently—namely, that neither a fanatical insistence on 
unity nor an arbitrary separation of correlated and cognate 
subjects can end in any way but disastrously, while the 
prize of success is for him whose painstaking investigation 
has taught him just how and what to articulate in his in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-102

68 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
struction. In other words, we are listening to a man who 
was highly successful in the direction of education, and thor- 
oughly alive, therefore, to pedagogie experience as a check 
on pedagogic theory ; a man, consequently, entirely unlikely 
to mislead one in favour of pedagogical abstractions. 
This eminent soundness of pedagogic insight is, perhaps, 
most conspicuous in his insistence on equilibrating many- 
sided interest ; the sole position tenable by the well-balanced 
pedagogist against numerously besetting faddists, and the 
position which, in duty to the best among his students, he is 
bound to take. 
The concluding paragraph will be of especial interest to 
teachers who are vacillating on the question of accepting or 
rejecting school-readers composed of excerpts. 
By far the most important section, however, is on reli- 
gious teaching. The reader will perhaps be astonished to 
see how, like pedagogy, political history repeats itself. The 
position of the Rey. Mr. Zippel is, the difference of time and 
country apart, the position of those who attack our public 
schools for neglecting religion. Considering the interval of 
space and time, it is still more surprising that Herbart’s at- 
titude is—and not only in spirit, but in the very amount 
and grade of religious instruction he suggests—almost the 
exact equivalent in substance, though not, of course, in form 
and details, of the condition which exists to-day in Ameri- 
can education, taking that term in the broadest sense so as 
to include both public and Sunday schools. 
The argument, as usually with Herbart, is put very com- 
pactly. _ Whichever way the reader may incline, he will 
probably decide that the few lines containing the simile of 
the jewelry are themselves gems in pedagogic literature.   OBSERVATIONS ON A PupagoGcicaL Essay. 
Read before the Pedagogical Society. 
A very brief report of the contents of the essay before 
me might read as follows: The Rev. Mr. Zippel insists 
upon the simplification of instruction. In order to attain
-P-A-G-E-103
OEE 
THE PURPOSE OF INSTRUCTION. 69 
it he would admit into our schools only one ancient lan- 
guage, no matter which. Much more time than here- 
tofore is to be devoted to it and to religious instruction. 
Most of the other studies are to be carried on by reading, 
under directions from the teacher. Upon this dry an- 
nouncement it might be said that the central idea is per- 
fectly well known. Great, indeed, is the number of those 
who have held forth with zeal against the excessive num- 
ber of studies. The means proposed for carrying into 
effect the demanded simplification might be deemed para- 
doxical and hardly applicable. But it is not so much the 
proposals as the sentiments which have caused me to value 
this essay. For this reason my observations will often 
refer to some striking turns of expression employed by 
the Rey. Mr. Zippel, and I shall have to recur to them in 
order to indicate the points upon which my glosses are 
made. 
All-sided or, rather, many-sided knowledge—for a to- 
tality is constituted not even by human knowledge, much 
less by that part which the schools communicate—is, in- 
deed, the purpose of instruction at school. That is to say, 
it is the nearest, the immediate purpose. The school can 
not be made an institution for the whole of education, 
least of all for the whole of the education of an individual. 
Of the sum of the forces capable of educating a man, it 
controls only a determinate part, a separate class—to wit, 
the sciences. What the world, example, converse, family, 
and, above all, the silent self-efficacy of mind working 
within itself contribute, is not under the control of the 
school. 
It does all that is possible if it puts properly in motion 
the educative force which resides in the sciences. Be- 
sides, the receptiveness of individuals differs as to its 
direction. The school, on the other hand, must prepare
-P-A-G-E-104
70 HERBARI’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
the opportunity for education for many. Therefore its 
instruction must not be interpreted as though all of it 
were intended for all in an equal degree. 
Partly, it is true, the value of a good scholar does 
consist in the many-sidedness of the education he appro- 
priates. But the excellence of a school does not show 
solely in the many-sidedness common to all its pupils. It 
shows quite as much in the diversity of specific excellences 
reciprocally distinguishing above each other the scholars 
that proceeded from it. The school of Socrates educates 
Plato and Xenophon, Aristippus and Antisthenes. 
What is the value of many-sided knowledge? Is’ it 
capable of statement? This value is highly variable. It 
is determined by what each one makes of his knowledge. 
That the soul learn to love the object of knowledge, 
understanding its value, relations, and connection ; that 
readiness and art enter into the knowledge, or better, 
spring of necessity from it—is surely the main point. 
From this point, I admit, school instruction, by the very 
multiplicity it is compelled to comprise, is very apt, if in- 
terest becomes rooted at any time, to tear it away. I con- 
cede that frequently there is danger of robbing the scholar 
of the leisure required for self-elaboration. I not only 
concede, but it has been always the essential content of 
my pedagogical teaching, that this distraction is to be in 
every possible way prevented. But from this conviction 
T have never been able to draw the conclusion—as I look 
at the matter, a hasty one—that the quantity of subject- 
matter should or even might be diminished considerably. 
I reason in this way: Every method which needlessly 
uses up time that should have remained at the disposal 
of the pupil for free and individual occupation must for 
that reason alone be considered faulty. Economy of time 
is pre-eminently attainable by the greatest possible inten-
-P-A-G-E-105

sity of interest being excited, since what we pleasurably 
learn we learn very quickly and apprehend profoundly. 
And, finally, the interconnections of human knowledge 
must be investigated in the most accurate manner, so as 
to enable teachers to set any interest once excited to work 
immediately in all directions, in order to accumulate the 
usury of learning on this interest as well as on the capital 
that has been acquired, and in order to avoid as far as 
possible such intellectual disturbances as might diminish 
the capital. 
Solicitude lest human beings be sold like slaves into 
the service of the sciences is often, I dare say, felt by one 
who reflects on the effect of the severity with which what 
he has learned is required at the hands of the scholar 
when, instead of arousing his interest, the work is done 
for a gaudy examination. I honour this solicitude. I 
find it persists even with the best; nay, it persists even 
with an oversimplified course of study. The reason is 
that, in this regard, everything depends upon the teachers. 
If they are mechanical workmen, their pressure on the 
mind of youth will infallibly be the severer the greater 
their desire to demonstrate their faithfulness to their 
duties as teachers. The teacher must be a man with 
ideas if he is to give free motion to the ideas of his pupils. 
I recall as a single instance in point history. Nothing so 
oppressive as to have counted out a certain number of 
facts to commit to memory; nothing so stimulating to 
the youthful imagination as a story from history well 
told. In my didactic institute I have experiences of the 
sort before my eyes every week. 
The question whether the means for educating learned 
specialists be also the right means psychologically is a 
very important but also a very seductive question. It is 
forgotten by every soulless educator, and answered pre-
-P-A-G-E-106
72 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
cipitately by every arrogant educational reformer after 
his own individuality. Each deems every youthful nature 
to be exactly what he deems himself to be, having like 
spiritual needs, like limitations, ete. Every one without 
ceremony judges others after himself. For this reason so 
many imagine themselves able to teach pedagogy, and to 
need it no longer for instructing themselves. As for me, 
I have for twenty years employed metaphysics and mathe- 
matics, and side by side with them self-observation, ex- 
perience, and experiments, merely to find the foundations 
of true psychological insight. And the motive for these 
not exactly toilless investigations has been and is, in the 
main, my conviction that a large part of the enormous 
gaps in our pedagogical knowledge results from lack of 
psychology, and that we must first have this science—nay, 
that we must first of all remove the mirage which to-day 
goes by the name of psychology—before we shall be able 
to determine with some certainty concerning even a single 
instruction period what in it was done aright and what 
amiss. The mistakes that can be committed in a single 
recitation, if taken by themselves, are, to be sure, trifles. 
But they accumulate enormously if repeated at every new 
recitation. 
These thirty years almost, unity in that which is mani- 
fold, the highest unity of all subordinate unities, has been 
the watchword of all who have ever occupied themselves 
with philosophy. Reinhold looked for the highest unity 
in a single principle of philosophical knowledge. He 
lauded with enthusiasm his principle as the one thing 
needful. The requirement people had faith in, but the 
principle they disdained. Fichte found a far more force- 
ful unity—the Ego. Now, it was opined, the great work 
of Kant was on the verge of being carried to completion, 
as the Kantian philosophy—and_ what a variety of things
-P-A-G-E-107
DANGER OF FIRST PRINCIPLES, "3 
besides !—might be concentrated in the Ego. But physics 
could not be got in conveniently. Schelling accord- 
ingly invented his Nature philosophy, and in connection 
with it the Absolute. And then public confidence in 
philosophy fell by rapid degrees deeper and deeper as the 
artificialities for pressing everything into the new unity 
grew odder and odder. ‘True philosophic thinking has 
on this occasion gone out of fashion altogether. Most of 
those who talk of philosophy have forgotten their logic, 
which amounts to speaking of the genius of a language 
* without knowing its declensions and conjugations any 
too well. And thus it is that we have to-day celebrated 
authors who will have no more of philosophy, but instead 
religion and mathematics and art. But, unfortunately, 
all these things, very valuable in themselves, are not 
philosophy. Will the striving for a highest unity, which 
has been the ruin of philosophy, work any more favoura- 
bly in pedagogy? Will fewer artificialities be employed in 
the latter than in the former for the sake of pressing the 
manifold, which by its nature must remain mutually ex- 
ternal, into one another? On the contrary, we shall see 
that the endeavour to set all ata single apex is bound to 
become as harmful to the educator as, on the other hand, 
the shredding and breaking up into piecemeal of that 
which really belongs together. 
Both philosophy and education require throughout 
that every connection inherent in the nature of the sub- 
jects be recognised, and that it be qualitatively and quan- 
titatively evalued neither at less nor at more than its real 
‘amount. What the amount is must be separately inves- 
tigated for every specific kind of connection, for each spe- 
cial line of teaching, and on every fresh occasion. It is im- 
possible to predetermine universally either the amount or 
the specific details at a given point. I can not help insti- 
   
-P-A-G-E-108
%4 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION,. 
tuting in this connection a comparison with mathematics, 
which has been elaborated with felicitous success above 
all the other sciences. Mathematics strives for the great- 
est generality in its propositions, as philosophy and peda- 
gogy do for the greatest possible unity in the manifold. 
But when has it been necessary to call out to the mathe- 
maticians of a whole age or even of a whole nation in re- 
spect to the entire science: Be careful not to exaggerate 
generalization! True, a few mistakes of the sort have 
happened, but they are receded from at once on accurate 
trial whether the proofs for a proposition are sufficient to 
uphold it with certainty for every case contained under a 
specific formula. The mathematician is aware that if too 
little generality constitutes a lack in our knowledge, ex- 
aggerated generality brings out something far worse, 
namely, false theorems. 
Now, the Rev. Mr. Zippel demands that even a youth 
shall seize upon some subject with especial love. By sub- 
stituting with especial cnterest I shall appear as if only 
putting a feebler word into the place of the stronger and 
more emphatic. But I confess that it seems to me that 
the right measure of expression resides in this instance in 
the weaker word. The child should embrace with the in- 
finite plenitude of love his parents, and the youth his 
country. But for science is appropriate a calmer inclina- 
tion, an inclination remaining ever patient—love is im- 
patient; an inclination impartially estimating the value 
of a given manifold—love is partial; finally, the sciences 
require an inclination which does not allow predilections 
to check its progress, because the value of knowledge in 
very many cases actually consists in the accumulated 
amount, where isolated data would be useless, as in the 
case of isolated philological or historical items, isolated 
mathematical propositions, etc. ‘To conclude, one must

which he is placed ; if to any part of his knowledge he 
takes up the attitude of the lover toward his fair one, he 
becomes a mystic or a pedant. 
But, to continue, what purpose is this especial love to 
serve? Mr. Zippel has answered plainly enough. It is to 
cause a permanent apprehension of the subjects of knowl- 
edge, so as to give a man his bearings among them. 
Multiplicity, says Mr. Zippel, brings about confusion. 
But what if I should retort, And simplicity exhaustion ? 
I need not enter into the depths of speculative psychology ; 
Ineed only appeal to the commonest experience, to re- 
mind you that any, even the most agreeable, object can 
occupy us only for a while, and that everything that lasts 
too long is thereby spoiled for us. A sermon of an hour 
and a half is sure to become oppressive even to the re- 
ligiously inclined, and a drama of five hours to a devotee 
of art. To the ordinary man such a duration will make 
either a sermon or a play a matter of positive repugnance. 
More so in the case of youthful and much more so in the 
case of children’s souls. They demand change. One 
kind of interest, albeit the highest, can not fill their minds. 
There is, then, such a thing as too little, just as there is 
such a thing as too much. Midway lies a point of great- 
est vantage which is to be searched out. 
Add to this that such especial love is apt to become 
determinate the latest in the very best minds. As long as 
I have been a university teacher, during a dozen years, I 
have constantly noticed in the most eminent among the 
students, men twenty or more than twenty years old, the 
painful effort it costs them to let go a number of subjects 
which they still desire to include in their work. On the 
other hand, I have known one-sided savants who, sated 
with the business of their specialty, gave themselves up to
-P-A-G-E-110
HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 6 
trifles or even to trivialities—e. g., bee culture, town news, 
clubs, etc. But the love for the sciences appears in right 
good health where it is many-sided. The view of the in- 
timate connection of all the sciences and of the aid they 
lend each other strengthens the charm of each. 
Hence in the demand I address to pupils and to schools, 
T insist not on especial love but on equilibrating, many- 
sided interest. But I am at one immediately with Mr. 
Zippel the moment that in the place of interest there is 
substituted a mere learning, working, reciting, filling full 
of copy books, making of translations, etc. I unite with 
Mr. Zippel promptly the moment I notice anywhere the 
machinelike diligence of teachers and pupils tormenting 
each other simply that both may be able to say that they 
have done their duty. By this method, the teachers in 
reality do not do their duty ; their occupations are not of 
a sort that can be despatched and done with. Where the 
joyous diligence of the scholars does not proclaim every- 
where that they gre fond of working, that has not been 
done which ought to have been done, even though the ex- 
aminations for promotion and graduation furnish forth the 
most brilliant results. 
But I must add a word concerning the most exquisite, 
the most delicate natures among the scholars. These ever 
have certain secret resting-points for their feeling and 
thought. They have an inner home whence that is likely 
to proceed, in far later years, which they are indeed to be 
and to effect. An instruction which does not at all, not 
even mediately, touch upon this point does violence to 
them. They, under it, are poor students. Now, what is 
to be done in the case? Above all, it is essential to dis- 
cover these points of rest or these centres of gravity, or, if 
you prefer, these axes about which the mind revolves, in 
order to enable us to heed them and to have reference to
-P-A-G-E-111
  RELIGION AS AN INTEREST. qT 
them. But only many-sided instruction can discover them. 
For these points of rest are as various as the genius dwell- 
ing in them. Sometimes they are religious, sometimes 
speculative, sometimes economic, sometimes military, some- 
times—but who can enumerate all? Only amany-sidedly 
educative school can meet the very requirement in whose 
favour the simplified instruction is demanded, namely, that 
the inner home of the mind be sufficiently respected. 
But while the possible resting-points of mind are mani- 
fold, that which ought to be the resting-point of all is 
simple—religion. Upon this point, however, Mr. Zippel, 
it seems to me, has been misled into an erroneous conclu- 
sion. He says that schools assign to religious instruction 
far too inferior a place—which means, I presume, far too 
little time—treating it as a subordinate branch. But it 
does not follow that what one assigns less time to, one 
holds to be a subordinate branch and desires to see treated 
as such. Suppose a man wishes to determine the amount 
of space for the various implements and possessions in his 
house according to value. Fancy what an amount the 
jewellery must occupy! But the precious stones would 
refuse to fill so much space, it being in kind for them to 
concentrate their preciousness into very little space. Not 
otherwise can I judge of religion. I know and acknowl- 
edge that it must constitute the deepest foundation and 
one of the earliest beginnings of human, ay, and of child- 
hood education ; without which all else is vain. I do not 
say this to-day for the first time; I have said it in the first 
of my pedagogical works, and, unless Iam mistaken, plainly 
and emphatically enough. But a religious instruction ex- 
panding into a great number of regular lessons makes me 
afraid ; exactly as I become alarmed at a prolix confession 
of faith, which prescribes in many articles the method 
and ways by which the human heart is to approach the 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  78 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
Most High; and since a considerable period I have been 
uneasy at the recommendations of religion such as are 
fashionable to-day, and which quite obviously have origi- 
nated from the misfortunes and the miseries of recent 
years. These miseries, it seems, cause everything to be 
forgotten that knowledge of human nature, church his- 
tory, and the history of philosophy unitedly teach; to wit, 
that every Jacob’s ladder, whose rounds are exactly counted 
and are methodically to be climbed one after another, is 
unfit to satisfy the universal need for religion; that the 
truly religious people often have extremely few articles of 
faith, and that they who have investigated most keenly 
testify that what we know of religion and consequently 
can, in the strict sense, teach and learn, contracts very nar- 
rowly into a few extremely simple grounds in support of a 
reasonable faith. Such is my result also, although the so- 
called Nature philosophy of to-day teaches differently. 
Hence, it is my opinion that the younger children must 
be aided by moderately extensive instruction in order that 
they may apprehend the right concept of God and learn 
to seek him in Nature ; that to the growing youth—whose 
instruction in Christian doctrine falls, of course, especially 
within the competence of the clergy of each denomination 
—must at school be communicated some knowledge of 
church polity and the different dogmas; but that other- 
wise we ought to have not so much detailed instruction but 
rather devotional exercises conducted in a Christian spirit, 
among which the Sunday sermons, if they are good and 
within the comprehension of youth, will be principal. 
But the intensive excellence of the instruction must in all 
lesson periods devoted to religion correspond to the in- 
tensive importance of the subject ; and hence the question 
how good and how profoundly effective is the religious 
instruction communicated in a school, how perfectly pre-

pared does the teacher appear in every lesson, is not a sec- 
ondary but a main question in evaluing the school. In 
addition, we may choose for the purpose those hours in 
which the students are best disposed for it, use the co-op- 
eration of harmonic song, and reprimand tenfold as se- 
verely as in other hours any, the least, disorder occurring 
during these periods. Thus much on this point, which to 
exhaust in this discussion is an idea which could not enter 
my mind. 
Of the impracticability of the notion of having only 
one of the ancient languages learned, of the absolute im- 
possibility of caring incidentally for all the other studies 
—for mathematics and natural science, especially—through 
philology, we have spoken recently. Mathematics and an- 
cient languages will always necessarily remain the two 
trunk lines of instruction. The natural sciences in the 
main lean upon the former, history and the whole of s- 
thetic culture on the latter. 
The proposal for self-teaching from books we also dis- 
cussed recently at some length. The grounds on which 
Mr. Zippel declares for reading instead of oral instruction 
are the very same—very respectable and weighty in them- 
selves—as those alleged for simplifying instruction. The 
slavery of the attention imposed on students by six periods 
of instruction is to cease; the freedom of taking up and 
laying down a book according to inclination and wish 
recommends reading and self-instruction. The latter we 
have but lately admitted to be valid for certain individ- 
uals, and surely oral instruction for the others will be 
shaped all the better for its purpose, if in the upper classes, 
where alone this measure is applicable, such of the stu- 
dents are segregated as are too advanced for the others, or, 
being pupetcr to them in free self-activity, prefer to read
-P-A-G-E-114
  80  HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
rather than to hear. But setting this aside, two replies 
remain which though, it is true, not abrogating Mr. Zip- 
pel’s proposition, yet limit it. First, the oral instruction 
ought to be of such quality as not painfully to strain the 
attention of the student, save momentarily in exception- 
ally difficult subjects. Especially, it must never be with- 
out immediate interest and natural connection. Neither 
should it, as a rule, consist of a continuous speech, like a 
university lecture, but appeal to the students to enter into 
the discussion. By this means, some freedom is given to 
their accidental associations of ideas. Second, the disci- 
pline of the attention is itself very valuable. Of our uni- 
versity students we, after all, must demand that they, hour 
after hour, shall hear and understand, or we could never 
finish our courses ; and we can be of use only to those who 
are able to follow us for an hour with sufficiently flexible 
attention. As a concluding argument, what sort of read- 
ing would even the books themselves receive from persons 
of such brittle attention as to be obliged to lay even a well- 
written book aside every half hour ? 
CHAPTER VI. 
Ir is time to sum up results. We began by reading Her- 
bart’s Introductory Lecture to Students in Pedagogy. We 
connected his system with Pestalozzi’s by reading his essay 
on Pestalozzi’s Latest Work: How Gertrude taught her 
Children. We then rose to Herbart’s Point of View for 
Judging the Pestalozzian Method of Instruction. We per- 
fected our initiation into his thought by obtaining his views 
on Pedagogical Discussions, and by the perusal of a paper 
containing his observations on an essay which was read be- 
fore a pedagogical society. 
‘We are thus fully prepared for entrance into his concep- 
 
-P-A-G-E-115
PEDAGOGY AS A WHOLE. 81 
tion of pedagogy as a whole. This is laid down in the essay 
On the Alsthetic Presentation of the Universe as the Chief 
Office of Education, the paper which Herbart mentioned in 
connection with the essay on Pestalozzi which we presented 
in Chapter II. It is best at once to define the expression, 
Presentation of the Universe, in Herbart’s own words. “ Ex- 
perience, human converse, and instruction taken all together 
constitute the Presentation of the Universe.” 
The essay appeared in 1804 as an appendix to the second 
edition of Herbart’s A B C of Sense-Perception. On the 
title-page of that edition, where notice is taken of this addi- 
tion, it is defined as a Disquisition in General Pedagogy. 
This describes its character exactly. It is not in definition 
and the time of its appearance only that this essay is a fore- 
runner of Herbart’s chief systematic work, the General 
Pedagogy. It is so in content. It constitutes, so to speak, 
an abstract, brief but compendious, of those main positions 
which are systematically unfolded in the latter work. For 
this reason it not only furnishes, what Herbart originally 
intended that it should, a good means for appreciating the 
value of the A B C of Sense-Perception, but it constitutes 
also the best preparation for reading the General Pedagogy 
in ease the reader should desire to go beyond the writings of 
Herbart immediately applicable to common-school work 
and into the general scope of Herbartian pedagogy. 
But the Alsthetic Presentation must be studied very 
thoroughly. It is one of those writings which in order to 
yield up all that they contain of mental nutriment require, 
to use an expression of Herbart’s, to be read through from be- 
ginning to end and then back again from the end to the be- 
ginning. We may save the reader, perhaps, the latter half 
of the journey by setting forth the system of thought in— 
A Retrogressive Analysis.—Herbart intended, as we have 
said, that this essay should help the A B C of Sense-Percep- 
tion to its proper place of appreciation. Sense-perception 
on the part of the student supplies, of course, the first 
elements of knowledge. But equally, of course, the educa- 
tor, who, in the Baconian phrase should be the minister and

  82 UERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
interpreter of Nature, will arrange the sense-perceptions of 
the child in, for example, object lessons exactly as he will any 
other work—namely, according to his view of the general 
purpose of instruction. 
The question then is, What is the view that he should 
take ? In the first place, it will be conceded that the object 
of learning is doing, and that before we can act properly we 
must haye properly learned. This we can not do except by 
attention, by devotion to the subject in hand. It all comes 
to the accurate apperception of the objective data. In the 
second place, the child seeks for the laws that bind these 
data together. These laws may at first be of extremely crude 
empiricalness ; the child may not even know the term laws ; 
but that is what it seeks. But the data as well as the laws 
are manifested in time and space; in other words, in mathe- 
matics. It would have to depart out of time and space not 
to know them, Accordingly, mathematics is in point of fact 
the mental basis in object teaching, if we must conserve the 
very mischievous term, object teaching; mischievous, be- 
cause, emphasizing the means instead of the end, it has in 
many schools proved either uninteresting or dissipative of 
the most productive element in first year primary work. 
We prefer to employ the appropriate term for emphasizing 
the activity of the child—sense-perception. 
Mathematics, then, is the mental basis for apperceiving 
both data and laws. Such intuition is important not only 
for intellectual but also for moral education. The pedagog- 
ist familiar with the moral results of manual training, as well 
as the scientist who has observed the effect of science study on 
character, will bear Herbart out in the affirmation, “Man 
soon looks on himself as Nature, if but once he have learned 
to know Nature. ... But no one is inclined to think himself 
into the strict lawfulness of Nature to whom the strict dis- 
cipline of mathematics has not been imparted, together with 
her enlightenment.” 
That our unpedagogic text-books prevent imparting such 
mathematics to our children is no argument against Herbart. 
It is an excellent argument for reading his A B C of Sense-
-P-A-G-E-117
   SYMPATHY THE MOTOR POWER. 83 
Perception in order to learn how children can learn trigo- 
nometry as easily as botany or history. Contempt of science 
not only is—as Herbert Spencer stanchly and with eternal 
truth maintains—irreligious ; it is, like all irreligion, radi- 
cally immoral. But the psychological basis of all science for 
human beings who must live in time and space is mathe- 
matics. To return, however, to the moral question. 
Obviously, we must know what is right in order to do 
what is right. But this is not all. There must be the mo- 
tive power of desire, of impulse, of will, which is based on 
the whole range of altruistic feelings, on our love for our 
fellow-men, on that Godlike element in man which, to use 
the beautifully truthful language of Herbart, “seeks to join 
in with the care of Providence for our race.” This strong 
motor power is not knowledge, it is sympathy. 
Thus we take up again the two great strands of Occident- 
al development, the realistic and the humanistic. But under 
the naturalistic change of view it is now the pupil whom we 
contemplate. It is not the branches of instruction that we 
consider as of intrinsic value in themselves. What effect 
have they upon the pupil? It is true that pedagogy must 
become a science. Where, then, do we place the pupil? At 
the node where these two indispensable elements of culture 
converge. We would train him in knowledge, first empiric- 
ally, and next by the inductions of science, until he can 
grasp worldwide laws philosophically deduced, and conceive 
of this universe as a unity ; and we would simultaneously 
train him in sympathy, first empirically as befits his tender 
age, but soon sociologically at the awakening, for instance, 
of such emotions as patriotism, until feeling gathers its 
holiest hue and obtains its most sacred intensity in the con- 
templation of the dependence of the whole universe on Him 
in whom knowledge and love are one. 
This union of the two elements of Occidental education 
exempts him equally from the heathenish concept of a dark, 
lawless fate, peculiar to the ancients though imitated in 
modern literature, and from the intrinsically atheistic no- 
tion of transcendental liberty that resulted from Fichte’s
-P-A-G-E-118
SS oe Se a eae ry ee WTR deere enero yer Ht Teron 
84 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 4 
philosophy of the Ego, iat which Herbart is never tired of 
protesting against as destructive to the very idea of pedagogy, 
which must assume at least that the pupil is modifiable by 
the educator. 
On the contrary, our pupil, while, as we have seen, “ join- 
ing in with the care of Providence for our race,” realizes also 
his limitations. He recognises the world as a “system of 
forces” ordered by Providence, to begin with, for generic 
not individualistic accommodations. This opposition, this 
individuality of position is accountable for the state of need 
in which man finds himself. It fixes not the vague fate of 
the ancients, but a definite destiny. To fit into this place of 
his, man must take the measure of all helpful forces, that 
according to such measure he may use them and regulate 
his own steps. For, to be sure, the ethical idea is the voice 
of God to our race; but for that very reason it marks the 
goal, it does not helpfully measure the steps of the individ- 
ual to that goal. That is left to us. Oversight of this dis- 
tinction is responsible for the discussions on the permission   of evil in this world. “To the actions of man is left the 
theodicy,” is Herbart’s conclusion, a conclusion both severe 
and sublime scientifically and morally. 
Thus, then, we find scientific cognition recognised as the 
indispensable servitor, if not, indeed, as the basis of moral 
ideas. But Herbart is far from substituting the former for the 
latter. We have already said that the pupil must be carried 
beyond the personal ethics that prevail in early childhood, 
Herbart is far too serious a pedagogical scientist to have a 
trace of respect for the negative moral education which 
cowardly shirks its most sacred duty in pretending not to 
know that the child sees the evil which no one with his eyes 
open can help seeing. 
Herbart as resolutely as in intellectual education seeks 
for the right sequence of instruction. He finds it in the 
parallelism of culture epochs of the race with culture epochs 
jn the individual. The Homeric poems for childhood, his- 
torie writers for the growing boy, modern history for the 
youth approaching maturity, Platonic exclusiveness of aught,
-P-A-G-E-119

OPPOSIION TO KANT. 85 
however artistic, that might injure the moral picture of the 
world which is to be unrolled step by step like the natural 
picture—such is Herbart’s plan put into one sentence and 
crumpled somewhat in the packing. But understanding 
that Homer occupies the same position as the initial point 
in the education of the sympathetic nature that the A BC 
of Sense-Perception, whose mathematical nature will be- 
come perfectly plain as the reader studies it, occupies as the 
initial point in the cognitive education, another approach 
has perhaps been made to understanding Herbart’s insistence 
on Greek literature and mathematics, which, as we have said, 
has so often failed of being exactly apprehended. 
‘We need not again call attention to Herbart’s position 
on religious education, so strikingly illustrated in the pre- 
ceding observations. The reader will not only find it re- 
affirmed here, but put in its proper setting in the Herbartian 
scheme. Herbart does not attempt, it will be seen, to sug- 
gest an ethical novelty. On the contrary, by him are laid 
more firmly and broadly than by any educational thinker 
the base for “the old and genuine morality.” Under this 
aspect both reading choice authors and training the senses 
to apperceive art and Nature are comprehended. Herbart is 
absolutely upright. We have seen him protest against the 
fanatical systematization that strives to reduce everything 
under one principle, that some metaphysicians are possessed 
with. Here he abstains from enunciating any one principle 
in ethics from which all the rest are to be deduced. His pro- 
cedure is thus opposite to the Kantian method of starting 
with a categorical imperative. Such deductiveness is con- 
trary to the realistic metaphysics of Herbart as it is to the 
extremely vital and truly explanatory psychology of Her- 
bart, so very different from the abstract and nonquickening 
psychologies of older date and more metaphysical cast. 
Whatever be the merits of the question metaphysically, no 
educator can do anything with such ethics or such psycholo- 
gies. 
Every practical teacher will agree with Herbart when he 
makes substantially the following argument: Let us admit 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
eee 
86 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
that goodness of will, virtue, moral cognition, the succession 
of subordinate laws, and the subsumption of every indi- 
vidual choice under those laws are all deducible from his 
supreme ethical concept by the moral philosopher, and that 
he can require it all as a manifestation of transcendental 
freedom of the will. Of what possible use is it to the 
teacher to look at the matter that way? We aré not so 
happy as to find those things in our schoolrooms. So far as 
the educator is concerned, morality is a natural phenomenon; 
an occurrence in the mind of his pupil. The latter shows it 
occasionally at certain moments not by any means in its 
whole comprehensive entirety, but in small parts. There 
are isolated acts of the will having a certain strength of 
goodness at this moment; at the next possibly less, or none 
whatever, or more. Ay, and sometimes we find that this 
will element has taken a turn; that it is no longer positive 
for the good ; that it is negative, is evil. 
These observations are perfectly patent to every wide- 
awake teacher if the children display their emotions openly. 
And yet this phenomenon ought not to be partial and eva- 
nescent ; it ought to be comprehensive, it ought to be lasting. 
Morality ought to apperceive all the other happenings, 
thoughts, fancyings, inclinations, desires; it ought to con- 
vert them into parts of itself. Morality ought to act with 
the full mental force of the pupil. All the presentations 
that make up the pupil’s consciousness should be so har- 
monized. 
We repeat a remark previously made: Educative in- 
struction must be construction. What will determine such 
construction into character? Supposing that we have been 
careful, as we have seen Herbart to be, to avoid reducing to 
unity irreducible judgments, which includes being careful 
to admit collisions where they actually exist; supposing, in 
other words, that the pupil has from the first acquired each 
simplest judgment in its clear, precise form and without 
foreign admixture; how will the regulation of life result 
from their harmonious construction ? 
The educator assumes that he can determine that con-
-P-A-G-E-121
  
CHARACTER-BUILDING, 87 
struction. Psychic laws act as surely in his pupil’s soul as 
physical laws in his pupil’s body and in all other bodies. 
The physical scientist asks Nature questions and utilizes her 
answers in the material arts. The psychic scientist frames 
from the answers of Nature the art of education. The 
powers are given. They are necessarily true to their own 
nature. The psychic scientist puts them into such relations 
as will result in moral elevation ; that, at least, he considers 
the master problem in the whole of education. 
To cause the pupil to find his true self as rejecting that 
which is evil—that or nothing is character-building. This 
alone is that moral freedom which the educator seeks to 
bring about and to strengthen. Morality, then, is essentially 
related to an indefinite multiplicity of volitional acts. It is 
for this reason that all the deductive metaphysical systems 
of morality are so unsatisfactory. The analytical part is 
plain enough. The concept of morality, or, to put it psy- 
chologically, the concept of goodness jof will, immediately 
suggests the two correlative concepts of obedience and com- 
mand, and it is conceded on all hands that true morality is 
not something imposed from without, but that the wuly 
moral man is self-commanded. But when we get beyond 
this concept of mere morality, when granting this definition 
of morality as imposed not by bribery or threats of punish- 
ment or any other external means, but by self, and as con- 
sisting in the relation, putting it again psychologically, of 
an obeying will to a commanding will, when we ask for 
something additional that will carry us beyond mere defi- 
nition, when we beg synthetically to be informed what 
it is that is so commanded and accepted as a command, we 
strike vacant space. 
Of course. an attempt is made to fill it. We have men- 
tioned Kant’s Categorical Imperative, which substitutes in 
the place of any real content the mere form of the law, to 
wit, its universality, and Herbart adds to it several other 
illustrations. But the trouble is obvious. As we have con- 
ceded the definition, it is agreed by both sides that the concept 
of morality is known. If that concept contained only one
-P-A-G-E-122
  88  HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
single object, we should, of course, knowing the concept 
know the object. When two people know the concept of a 
horse, they know a horse. But in this instance the only 
thing that corresponds to moral obedience is the general con- 
cept of a volitional state assuming the force of command as 
against all individual desires and accidental longings. 
That general concept, as we have seen, embraces a vast 
multiplicity of presentations. These must enter into such a 
construction as to be comprehended under the one general 
concept of morality, the commanding concept to which 
alone we can vow fealty and which alone can induce that 
concentrated attention, self-criticism, and humility which 
constitutes the surest guarantee of our moral constancy and 
growth. Casting out all foreign elements, this construction 
must progressively differentiate between morality and im- 
morality, constantly increasing the governing will, propor- 
tionately diminishing the volitions still requiring to be sub- 
jugated, until we can well conceive that an indefinite 
continuance of the constructive process would approach us 
infinitely to moral perfection. 
Such construction is not a logical one. It is possible for 
a person to be a logical expert in moral casuistry and yet a 
consummate rascal. Neither is the necessity implied in a 
moral law of the same kind as that which scientific theorists 
set forth in the laws of Nature. Everybody knows the 
difference between ought and must. By these exclusions 
we find that the only remaining necessity is the xsthetic 
necessity, that necessity which judges immediately and 
without any proof. 
Herbart does not, of course, mean to identify artistic 
taste and moral consciousness. The latter originates, as we 
have seen, in the relation of a commanding will to an obey- 
ing will. The former of these two, the conscience, as it is 
summarily called as a sort of collective noun, we have seen 
to be a complex apperception mass aboriginally compounded. 
of innumerable presentations. He is now inquiring by 
what constructive process these presentations are built into 
that apperception mass. In other words, he is inquiring
-P-A-G-E-123
ARTISTIC TASTE AND MORALS, 89 
into conscience-building or character-building. Of course, 
when the conscience as commanding will enters into rela- 
tion with the isolated impulse there is moral necessity. 
But the problem of the teacher lies further back. The moral 
educator constantly asks himself, How can I be a con- 
science-maker? Herbart’s answer is, By availing yourself 
of the inherent esthetic necessity in presentations, arising 
inevitably in the simplest esthetic relations, you will have 
self determined by self and yet no self-will, but an inner 
necessity, neither logical nor material, but causing men to do 
right and visiting them if they do not with compunction. 
To be sure, in art your pupil may escape the necessity. He 
may give up the particular art that plagues him. But no 
one can give up the art of being a man ora woman. The 
use of the word art in this connection is not an attempt at 
cleverness or simile. The cases are psychologically parallel. 
In the great art of right living, as in the little art of rightly 
playing the violin, we are guided, restrained, and admon- 
ished by an overriding apperception mass, and we need 
much detailed knowledge of our position in the external 
world, a subject on which we have already expatiated. 
In both cases the overruling apperception mass is built 
up out of simple wsthetic judgments of repugnance and 
agreement. In neither case does the inherent necessity 
always demand the existence of something. But it peren- 
nially affirms that if something does exist, it should exist in 
harmony with it. In both cases one may, whether wilfully 
or blunderingly, fall short of obedience and take the con- 
sequences in compunction. In neither case is the coercion 
either logical or material. In both cases we judge others 
like ourselves, and, what is more, in both cases we require 
that they shall so judge themselves. 
As the artists’ faulty apperception explains much blun- 
dering in art, the accidental picking up of daily observa- 
tions explains why there is so little solidity and unity of 
character. It is this accident which is not to remain acci- 
dent if education is good for anything. It is morally 
obligatory upon the educator to determine the pupil’s ap-

perception early and strongly by an xsthetic presentation 
of the universe. To be sure, as has been intimated, we pur- 
pose to allow the truth of history and the transfiguration 
light of poetry to clarify by contrast and to vivify by varie- 
gated hues that presentation. But we insist also for the 
purposes of that construction on the correctness of drawing, 
on science, on knowledge, and as the basis of it all on ex- 
act, perfectly truthful sense-perception. 
And now we come to the pedagogical application of all 
this psychology. If the commanding element in the rela- 
tion that we describe as moral necessity is will, so also is 
the obeying element. This latter will is not to be sup- 
pressed. No sound educator will suppress aught of will any 
more than he will suppress aught of intellect. But it is to 
be educated. What does that mean? It is to change its 
direction. Yet we do not withdraw the objects. We do 
not forbid the objects. On the contrary, by making the 
student know and think much and by attending to the 
proper association of his presentations we cause him also to 
desire much and to associate properly his desires. Even 
well-bred children possess so much practical freedom of the 
will as suffices to inhibit desire for the time without any great 
effort. A well-educated man, having more and better asso- 
‘ ciated presentative knowledge, possesses such practical free- 
dom to a greater extent. 
Now, the only remaining question is whether egotism or 
moral sentiment, or, as Herbart calls the latter by a term 
unfamiliar to English ears and yet beautiful and suggestive, 
the Practical Reason, shall obtain mastery of this power of 
self-direction and use it as its instrument. In the former 
case the result is worldly shrewdness, in the latter morality. 
Here, then, is the crisis in educational art; for what shall it 
profit a man to have mastered all the world, including him- 
self, if he lose his own soul, and what shall it profit the 
state to have educated clever rascals? And this crisis is a 
perennial, not a momentary one. On the one hand, many 
desires must be awakened ; on the other, none must be per- 
mitted unbridled to rush for its object. This balance must
-P-A-G-E-125
EQUILIBRATING INTEREST. 91 
be achieved by a training presenting itself as an impersonal 
necessity, sweetened with many a kindness and guided by 
the consummate ability of the educator to expunge in chil- 
dren self-will without any injury to their cheerfulness. 
Thus he will foster a many-sided, equilibrating interest, pre- 
vent a coarse desire from acting itself out, and by thus 
emphasizing its force in consciousness becoming will, while 
yet leaving himself free to put in action any well-thought- 
out group of motives, thus teaching practical reason its 
force. 
To be sure, Alsthetic Presentation of the Universe is a 
wider term than the narrowest definitions of morality might 
seem to require. But it is nowise safe to drawa line. As 
it has been said that there is but one virtue, the only safe 
way is to say that there is but one zsthesis. It is by this 
magnificently psychological conception of education that 
Herbart has rid us of that chaotic condition of educational 
thought which consisted in assuming as many different 
educations as men had different purposes, and which still 
where it prevails renders systematic unity in work and 
theory impossible. That chaos had, of course, among its 
elements one element called moral education. It even ad- 
mitted that it was the most important. But the admission 
remained verbal, because moral education was set off ina 
separate compartment like the rest. That it must comprise 
the whole human being never dawned on these unscientific 
pedagogists. The reason was, that they were shackled by 
the old and inane psychology with its verbal division of the 
mind into equally separate compartments termed faculties. 
The psychology of Herbart conceives of the life of the 
mind as infinitely varying in its presentations. Under the 
latter conception all of mind subserves or conflicts with 
morality. That upon the deficiency of which life is wrecked, 
that upon the perfection of which life is rested, moral char- 
acter and conscience, is to be upbuilded of the whole mental 
nature. Thus considered, all else are but the necessary pre- 
requisites, the presuppositions, the conditions for the actuali- 
zation of morality. Thus considered, pedagogy is a unit, is
-P-A-G-E-126
92  HERBART’S A BO OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
ascience. And it is not its least merit that its existence as 
ascience is rested by the great philosopher upon the bed- 
rock of morality. 
Considering pedagogy as a science, it may truthfully be 
said that earlier pedagogists could have no system of peda- 
gogy, though they might have disjointed pedagogic truths 
of the highest importance. They could have no educative 
instruction as a unit, though they might have very excellent 
didactic systems. Pedagogy as a unit, as a science, became 
possible when Herbart made the discovery which, as we 
have said, corresponds in this branch of human endeavour 
to Newton’s discovery of gravitation in astronomy. This 
single unifying principle he enunciated in the sublime sen- 
tence with which his Alsthetic Presentation of the Universe 
opens. 
THE AlsTHETIC PRESENTATION OF THE UNIVERSE THE 
CHIEF OFFICE OF EDUCATION. 
The one problem, the whole problem, of education 
may be comprised in a single concept—morality. 
It would be equally possible and permissible to assume 
as many problems in education as purposes are allowed to 
human beings. But then there would be as many peda- 
gogical investigations as problems; these investigations 
would. be carried on without correlation, and in the iso- 
lated measures of the educator it would not appear either 
how they must limit one another or how they can pro- 
mote one another. We should find ourselves much too 
poor in means if we tried to attain every individual end 
directly ; and, again, no matter what it might be that we 
intended to produce but singly, it might possibly occur 
tenfold through concurrent and subsequent effects which 
were not intended and not allowed for, so as to put all the 
parts of the work out of their proper relation. This
-P-A-G-E-127
    ESTHETIC PRESENTATION OF THE UNIVERSE. 93 
method of considering the subject is thus unserviceable 
as a starting point for pedagogical investigations. If it is 
to be possible to think out the office of pedagogy as a 
single whole with thoroughgoing correctness, and to exe- 
cute it systematically, it must be possible first to appre- 
hend the problem of education as a single problem. 
As the highest purpose of man, and consequently of 
education, we universally recognise morality. He who 
should deny this could not really know what morality is; 
at least, he would have no right to take part in this dis- 
cussion. But in order to set up morality as the whole 
purpose of man and of education, an enlargement of the 
concept of morality is required, a demonstration of its 
presuppositions considered as needful conditions of its 
actual possibility. : 
Goodness of will—the steady determination to think 
of one’s self as an individual under the law that obligates 
universally —is the commonest and, rightly, the first 
thought suggested by the word morality. When in 
thought we add the force, the resistance, with which a 
human being maintains the goodness of his will against 
those emotions that work against it, morality—at first 
only a quality, a determination of the will—becomes for us 
virtue; it becomes strength, and action, and effectiveness 
of the will that is so determined. Distinct again from 
both is that which pertains to legality, correct knowledge 
of the moral law. And, again, different from the knowl- 
edge of the universal law, and even from the knowledge 
of the rules of duty usual and recognised in common life, 
is the exact judgment of what in special cases, in distinct 
moments, in the immediate touch of man and destiny, is 
to be done, to be chosen, to be avoided, so as to secure the 
best, that which is truly and only good. Philosophy finds 
all this in the concept immediately, and of man it expects
-P-A-G-E-128
94  HERBART’S. A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
it and demands it just as immediately, as a manifestation 
of freedom. 
But, as thus set forth, can an educator make anything 
of this mode of presentation ? 
Even supposing nothing to be under discussion but 
moral culture in the narrowest sense, even divesting it as 
far as ever one thinks possible of all that is scientific, of 
all the exercises, of all the fortifications of spiritual and 
physical energy, laying them aside for further considera- 
tion, is that which now, taking up only the concept of 
morality, offers itself to the philosopher a datum also for 
the educator? Does he, too, find that goodness of will, 
so as to be only obliged to direct it against the inclina- 
tions and to point it to the right objects by his lectures 
on morality? Does there flow for him, also, that intelli- 
gible source? May he also confidently derive from Heaven 
that stream whose wellsprings he knows not? Indeed, 
for him who adheres to our more recent systems nothing 
is more consistent than calmly to expect that the radical 
good, or possibly the radical evil, will perhaps quite spon- 
taneously manifest itself in his pupil. Nothing more con- 
sistent than quietly to respect the freedom which he must, 
of course, presuppose in his pupil as a human being, ab- 
staining simply from interfering with it by any misapplied 
endeavour—which, by the way, tempts one to ask, Then, 
after all, freedom is subject to interference? Thus he 
abandons the most important part of his office, and in the 
last resort confines all his care to the mere presentation of 
items of information. It is a fact that something similar 
has been put forth asa serious assertion by an adherent of 
those systems. 
But we must not be so precise in the application of 
these theories. Under the weight of such consistency 
they themselves would have broken down in the moment
-P-A-G-E-129
  
TRANSCENDENTAL FREEDOM. 95 
of origin. We may hope that the first transcendental 
philosopher interested in education will find means to 
show for education, too, a suitable basis. The postulate— 
education must be possible—will first be endowed with a 
valid title. This granted, there is plenty of room in the 
world of sense, and for any one who has any business in 
it the realistic view holds. As freedom by enunciating 
the moral law may betray its presence, as though it were 
a cause in the realm of phenomena, so the world of sense 
ordered by the educator will be allowed to seem as though 
it influenced the freedom of the pupil. That suffices; we 
now have our field. It is true we have not yet the rules 
of procedure. But let the educator make a beginning. 
Let him invent them. Do not doubt, the transcendental 
philosopher will afterward know how to derive them from 
his system. As far as the educator is concerned, morality 
is an occurrence, something happening in Nature, which, 
as we may assume, has already shown itself in the soul of 
his pupil in occasional moments and in small part acci- 
dentally, but which must occur to its entire extent, which 
must last, and which must take up into itself and convert 
into parts of itself all other occurrences, thoughts, phan- 
tasies, inclinations, and desires. In this completeness this 
natural occurrence ought to happen in the pupil with the 
whole quantity of spiritual energy; in the incomplete form 
in which it does happen, the goodness of will has always 
—or, rather, every single good volition is always—a defi- 
nite quantity of activity, a definite part of the whole, pres- 
ent in this particular determination and magnitude only 
during this determinate moment. But in time the quan- 
tity grows, decreases, vanishes, becomes negative, like a 
curve line, and grows again. All this is open to observa- 
tion to the extent that the pupil frankly manifests him- 
self. 9
-P-A-G-E-130
  96 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
Under all the determinations with which it happens 
it happens necessarily, being the unfailing result of cer- 
tain mental causes. It happens just as necessarily as any 
result in the physical world, though it does not in any 
sense happen according to material laws, as those of gravi- 
tation, impact, etc., which have not the slightest similarity 
to the laws of mental effect. Like the astronomer, the 
educator imposes upon himself the attempt, by a right 
questioning of Nature and by accurate conclusions suffi- 
ciently prolonged, at last to search out from the course of 
the phenomena presenting themselves to him the laws 
which govern them. This implies the discovery of how 
that course can be modified by purpose and design. Now, 
this realistic view does not admit of the slightest admix- 
ture of the idealistic view. Not the faintest breath of 
transcendental freedom may blow through any cranny 
into the domain of the educator. What in the world can 
he do with the lawless miracles of a supernatural essence 
whose help he can not count on and against whose dis- 
turbing influences he can use neither foresight nor pre- 
cautions? Is he to.furnish occasions, to remove hin- 
derances? After all, then, that absolute faculty was hin- 
dered? After all, are there, then, occasions for it outside 
of its own purely original commencing? After all, then, 
the intelligible, again, is immeshed in the mechanism of 
the objects of Nature? Let us hope the philosophers will 
reflect better upon their own concept. Besides, transcen- 
dental freedom neither should nor can be found in con- 
sciousness, as if it were an internal phenomenon. But 
that freedom of choice which we all find within ourselves, 
which we honour as the fairest phenomenon of ourselves, 
and which we would like to emphasize among all the phe- 
nomena of self, is exactly what the educator strives to 
effect and retain.

ASSTHETIC PRESENTATION OF THE UNIVERSE. 97 
Causing the pupil’s discovery of himself as an elector 
of good and rejecter of evil—this or nothing is what we 
mean by forming the character. Doubtless, this elevation 
into self-conscious personality must take place in the mind 
of the pupil himself, and must be accomplished by his 
own activity. It would be nonsense for the educator to 
desire strictly to create the real essence of the force for 
the purpose, and to infuse it into another soul. But to 
set the existent force, which is necessarily constant to its 
own nature, into such a position as will make it work out 
that elevation unfailingly and unerringly is what the edu- 
cator must deem possible. To get at it, to fix upon it, to 
fathom it, to bring it in, and to guide it on, he must re- 
gard as the great object of all his endeavours. 
It becomes necessary now to subject the concept of 
morality, which we are obliged here to consider as known 
and a datum, toa keener philosophical scrutiny. We shall 
begin by mere analysis. As we continue we shall come to 
necessary synthesis by showing up the presupposition to 
which the concept essentially relates, while yet unable to 
consider it comprised in the content of the concept. This 
form of investigation is of very general use, though here, 
we admit, it can not’ be exemplified with absolute sharpness 
and accuracy. 
Obedience is the first predicate of the good will. Over 
against obedience there must be a command, or at least 
something that can appear as a command. A command 
has for its object something commanded. But not every 
obedience to any haphazard command isethical. He who 
obeys must have examined, elected, and valued the com- 
mand—that is, he must himself have elevated it into the 
position of a command to himself. The moral man com- 
mands himself. What does he command himself? Here 
the embarrassment is universal! Kant, than whom none
-P-A-G-E-132
  98 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
was more sensitive to this embarrassment, after much 
hesitation, quite hurriedly ends by slipping the form of 
the command, its universality, which distinguishes it from 
momentary volitions, into the place of the content.* 
Others slip into this place their theoretical concepts—ap- 
proach to the Deity, to the pure Ego, to the Absolute, nay, 
even the customs and laws of the country, or even the 
useful or the agreeable.t| The unprejudiced investigator 
will recognise the empty place to be empty. He argues: 
We all know the concept of morality; if the concept con- 
tained a single definite object of command, we should know 
that, too, together with the concept. Therefore, it does 
not contain a single definite object. Yet it is related to a 
presupposed command—that is, a presupposed willing, for 
command itself is will. This willing must be original and 
primary ; obedience follows after. Now, if this original 
willing is not definite but yet actual, it is obvious that it 
is indefinitely manifold. Herein lies the reason why it is 
not deducible from obedience. To obedience there corre- 
sponds as command only the general concept : There exists 
such a willing as stands in the form of a command over 
against all inclinations and individual, accidental desires. 
Before we seek for the characteristics of those mental 
acts which here, as opposed to the obeying will, appear as 
the commanding will, we have to make two observations. 
In the first place, these acts considered by themselves can 
be nothing ethical in the strict sense. They exist ante- 
cedently and independently before entering into a com- 
  
* See the Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morality, p. 51. 
+ We may here compare a passage in the sixth book of Plato’s 
Republic: “To the crowd, pleasure seems the good; to the more 
educated, good sense.” Plato goes on to censure the circle: ‘ They 
can not tell which sense, but are of necessity driven in the end to 
say, The sense of what is good.”
-P-A-G-E-133
THE COMMANDING WILL, 99 
manding relation as against the inclinations. Only as far 
as they become one member in this relation do they per- 
tain to morality. What is original in the commanding 
will must be looked for in an altogether different sphere. 
In the second place, as far as these indefinitely mani- 
fold acts are motives of obedience, they must be so con- 
strued as to be capable of being comprehended under that 
general concept, to which that general and single pledge 
of fidelity applies, together with single and constant at- 
tention, self-criticism, and humility, which constitute the 
crown of ethicalness. The quality of the construction 
must be such as to expel every foreign element. By it 
severity of opposition must be introduced between the 
worthy and good on the one hand, the unworthy and the 
evil on the other. And by it the loud, incisively forceful 
language of the moral imperatives must originate. For 
anterior to the relation of the reason to the inclination 
this is all inconceivable. Such a construction can not be 
merely logical. It can not be learned from a well-classi- 
fied ethics. The latter cools the will; it does not urge it 
on. On the contrary, there is needed a construction which 
is partly poetical, partly pragmatical. But it is time to 
look for the elements which are to be construed. 
It would be vain to lay upon the desires the injunction 
of obedience were we afterward to transmute reason into 
a desire. Kant’s proposition is eternally true: No ethical 
principle must ask the actuality of an object. But from 
this what follows? Nothing but this, that originally 
reason is not will at all, since will that wills naught would 
be a self-contradiction. The reason apperceives, and after 
completing the apperception it judges. It views and pro- 
nounces the verdict. Then the eye is turned to look 
further. We shall find this confirmed by taking up our 
previous thread. - He who obeys attributes validity to the
-P-A-G-E-134
a 
100 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
command—that is, he originates it, at least, as a command. 
Now, how in the act must he necessarily appear to him- 
self, as establishing an imperative or as finding an obvious 
necessity? Must he needs intend self-assertion as the lord 
and master, the proprietor, so to speak, of his inner store 
of sense and life? Or would it perhaps be, if not truer, 
in any event safer for the correctness of his judgment if 
he only strove to fathom, let us say, the will of a perfect 
reason outside of himself? He must not appear to him- 
self as establishing the imperative, since the primary 
principle of morality, obedience, is annihilated, and one 
arbitrary volition put in the place of another as soon as 
will, under any interpretation of the term, shows itself as 
the ground of command. The ethical man is humble 
through and through; this acquaintance with the concept 
of morality we presupposed. 
He therefore appears to himself as finding a necessity. 
Or perhaps he does not appear to himself at all; it is con- 
ceivable that he might find the necessity without direct- 
ing his gaze upon himself. This question will answer 
itself more accurately a little further on. For the present 
the question is, What necessity is found? Not a theoret- 
ical necessity, for the difference between ought and must 
is well known, and to honour a command does not mean to 
yield to the unalterable. Neither, for the same reason, is 
the necessity logical, for a logical necessity considered by 
itself is also a must; and, again, it relates to a higher 
principle, and therefore only postpones the question how 
and why the latter principle be necessary. Hence, this 
necessity is neither inferred nor learned, nor bestowed by 
experience, nor searched out through natural science. To 
this extent we confirm Kant as altogether in the right in 
setting in sharp opposition empirical details and pure rea- 
son. It is to be hoped we shall not be met by the answer,
-P-A-G-E-135
  
STHETIC NECESSITY. 101 
«“ A moral necessity”! We showed but a moment ago that 
we are here quite without the domain of morality. The 
discussion is upon what is aboriginally necessary. . This 
will perhaps become morally necessary, but only from the 
instant when it governs the obedience in opposition to the 
inclinations. 
Only one of the known necessities is left—esthetic 
necessity. 
Its character is, to speak in none but absolute judg- 
ments, entirely without proof; but without, on the other 
hand, putting violence into its demand.* It has no re- 
spect to the affection, neither favouring nor contesting it. 
It originates at the complete presentation of its object. 
For different objects there are as many original judg- 
ments. There is no mutual reference in order to logical 
derivation. At most, after eliminating all that is acci- 
dental, similar relations are found to recur in different 
objects, thus naturally producing similar judgments. As 
far, accordingly, as the simple zsthetic relations are known 
we have simple judgments upon them. ‘They are the 
axioms of the arts and have absolutely independent au- 
thority. In this respect, music is eminent among the 
arts. It can enumerate definitely all its harmonic rela- 
tions, and as definitely show their correct use. But ifa 
teacher of thorough bass were asked for his proofs, he 
could only laugh at or pity the dull ear that had failed to 
apperceive. It is specially important that esthetic judg- 
ments never demand the actuality of their object. But if 
the latter does exist and continues to exist, the judgment, 
too, persists, which indicates how it ought to be. By this 
persistence it becomes to a human being who can not es- 
  
* The bond of reason is soft because it is golden, for reason is 
beautiful; but gentle, not violent. (Plato, Laws, i, 18.)
-P-A-G-E-136
102 HERBARI’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
cape it at last an equivalent for severest necessitation. To 
the artist an offence against taste is a crime; of course, 
only to the extent that he intends being an artist. He is 
not barred from destroying his unsuccessful painting, from 
locking up the instrument which he can not master, or, in 
the last resort, from quitting art altogether. 
Only from himself man can not part. Should he him- 
self be the object of such judgments they would, by their 
quiet yet ever-audible speech, in time coerce him, exactly 
as they do the amateur who has set his heart upon becom- 
ing anartist. Add that a judgment of taste bursting forth 
from the midst of the sentiments is frequently, by the 
mode of its origination, felt with a degree of force which 
does not strictly lie in what it says. Happy if such an 
outburst conquer on the spot. In time it passes away; 
but the judgment remains. It is its slow pressure which 
man calls his conscience. 
Finding, therefore, an originally practical and hence 
esthetic necessity, the moral man bows his desires in order 
to obey. The desire, then, was one member in an esthetic 
relation. The man who contemplates the latter directs 
his view upon himself to the extent that the desire exists 
in him which occurs in the relation that is judged. Doubt- 
less, however, the wsthetic demand would remain exactly 
the same if the desire were entertained by another stand- 
ing in the same relation. Thus we judge others, only still 
more easily than ourselves. The demand is valid, or should 
be so, at least, for the other person; we expect of him that 
he should himself find it to be so. 
Wishing to become acquainted with those among the 
zsthetic judgments which are directed upon the will— 
that is, wishing to establish a practical philosophy—we 
must, above all, abandon completely the idea of a single 
highest moral law as the one dictum of pure reason, all
-P-A-G-E-137
AISTHETIC JUDGMENT, 103 
other moral rules being but applications. On the con- 
trary, step by step, taking into consideration the simplest 
conceivable volitional relations which can result out of 
the direction of the will upon itself, other wills, and 
things, there would stand forth with immediate evidence 
for each of these relations an original, absolutely inde- 
pendent, esthetic judgment of a quite peculiar quality. 
The judgments thus obtained would have to be construed 
afterward, so as to order life. It would be easy to do so 
if we had gained them at the first in their peculiar clear- 
ness, in their simplest and most precise determinations, 
unmixed with anything foreign, and undisfigured by the 
attempts of a false philosophy at reducing them to one 
another. The opposite procedure easily explains why it 
is difficult to erect out of the judgments caused accident- 
ally and in a scattered fashion by daily life a firm system 
of moral convictions, from which the character might ob- 
tain solidity and unity. But if science had taken care in 
this construction for the correctness of the drawing, then 
the riches of life—partly transfigured through poesy, partly 
enforcing themselves as the truth of history—would help 
to present the picture, now as a whole, now as a part, 
illuminated by changeful colouring, emphasized now by 
this, now by that contrast. 
But this pedagogical thought comes too early, although 
but a little so. For we are drawing near to the applica- 
tion of the general considerations. We only need glance 
back at moral obedience. How is it related to this system 
of practical reason? * What obeys is to be and to remain 
* Let our psychologists not take it amiss that practical reason 
here partly coincides with wsthetic judgment, while, on the other 
hand, it knows absolutely nothing of any relationship with transcen- 
dental freedom. On the plan adopted by us it is, in fact. impossible 
to see how transcendental freedom could enter into practical phi-

    104 HERBARI’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
will. But it is to change in part its direction.* Now, 
originally, all willing, desiring, demanding is directed 
upon objects. 
Do not believe that these objects can, as it were, be 
moved about under the will directed upon them. One 
who wills but little is utterly disgusted when this little is 
denied him. It is only in the abstract that we can sepa- 
rate the will from its direction. 
But he who knows and thinks much has many desires. 
And he whose ideas are well associated also associates his 
desires. To change the direction of desire means, in truth, 
to impede one desire—so, however, as to have another in 
readiness to emerge at once by its side. This is impossible 
except for a mind that is versatile and awakened in many 
directions. This is exactly the reason why it is easier for 
aman than for a child. But well-bred children even have 
been given, and by their very training have acquired, the 
freedom of inhibiting for the moment any desire without 
great difficulty—a freedom, by the way, which, taken by 
itself alone, has as yet nothing in common with morality. 
Nevertheless, it is at once obvious that all that still de- 
pends is, whether egotism or practical reason shall have 
dominion over it. In the former case it becomes worldly 
acuteness, in the latter morality. 
  
losophy. One might as well mix it up with the theory of music or 
sculpture. As for the consequences to be feared, let us for the pres- 
ent console ourselves by education. On the other hand, it must be 
extremely welcome to theoretical philosophy—as Kant, at least, in- 
timated plainly enough—if it be no longer necessary for her, on her 
sister’s account, to suffer that: misconcept whose self-contradiction 
she would otherwise, I am sure, have confessed long ago, and was 
often on the road to confessing.

DESIRES ARE 'TO BE CONTROLLED, 105 
Here, then, we have laid at once before our eyes the 
primary requisite of training. We must awaken much 
desire, but we must permit no single desire, unbridled, 
to rush for its object. It would seem as though an im- 
measurable supply of will were confined in an iron re- 
ceptacle, opened only by Reason, where, when, and how it 
pleased. It will so seem if from the first the object’s 
touch be as multiform as possible, while the bridle felt 
always is, if need be, effective enough to impress firmly 
upon the mind that the attainment of no object is to be 
counted upon unconditionally. It is, of course, well known 
that training best presents itself as impersonal necessity, 
and that it must be compensated by much love, by much 
undeserved obligingness. We make a general presupposi- 
tion of the art of overcoming all that is called stubborn- 
ness in children, without injuring their cheerfulness. 
Exactly as we must prevent crude desire from demon- 
strating its force by its own action, and thus becoming 
determinate will, thoughts rightly weighed must, when- 
ever they emerge, be converted into activity and seconded 
until they attain their purpose. Reason, thus experienc- 
ing her power, takes courage to govern. 
When we see.a boy who, whether the thanks be due to 
art or to Nature and accident, tries many things, but read- 
ily forsakes what he finds foolish, while he firmly and 
vigorously puts through what he has well reflected on—a 
boy who is every way easily awakened, who by improper 
treatment is easily irritated, but who by the right word 
one can easily teach, turn, and shame—we rejoice at the 
sight and augur well of him. We term him free because 
we presume that, being open-eyed, he will readily find and 
apperceive the rational, while there is no lurking opposi- 
tion in him which might silence or overpower judgment. 
But perhaps we forget that it is still a question what 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
  106 HERBARI’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
kind of a world the boy will find before him, will judge, 
and will practise dealing with. 
Let this world be a rich and open cycle, full of mani- 
fold life! If so, he will scrutinize all its parts. What he 
can reach he will touch and moye, in order to investigate 
its entire mobility. The remainder he will contemplate 
and will mentally transport himself thither. He will pro- 
nounce judgment upon men and their conduct, and com- 
pare ways of living and social positions as to their splen- 
dour, their profit, or their freedom from restraint. He 
will—in thought, at least—taste, imitate, choose. Ifa firm 
hold is got upon him by any such charm, he calculates, and 
is lost to genuine morality. 
But, on the contrary, let nothing fetter him. Let his 
boyhood years elapse in the continued whirl of momentary 
joy. Only let him be sure of his physical strength, his 
health, his freedom from wants, and his inner firmness ; 
only let him have gathered together by occasional obser- 
vations a sum of keenly noted phenomena, so as not to 
feel a stranger among the things of the world. In the 
next place, let him become aware of the decorum which is 
required from a grown youth from his first entrance into 
society. Shy of making mistakes, wishing to learn; but 
as to the rest, quiet, without seeking or fearing aught, let 
him enter and look about. Concentrated vigilance will 
grasp all relations. The contrast between the ridiculous 
and the becoming will determine his judgments as eas- 
ily as his conduct. Besides the becoming he will find 
what honours or shames, uprightness and good faith, false- 
hood and treachery. In the next place, if only his mind 
be truly imitative, he will from the first be full of sym- 
pathy, full of an inclination to enter into the sufferings 
and hopes of others. He will thus be predisposed for that 
reflection which recognises and values goodness, which is
-P-A-G-E-141
HOW THE MORAL JUDGMENT ARISES. 107 
the beauty of the soul. Out of these apperceptions he 
will establish for himself a law and a duty to follow that 
law; he can not do otherwise; he would be obliged to de- 
spise himself did he not follow it. Hence, he wills to fol- 
low it, and he has the power to do so; and again, with in- 
creased emphasis, you will term him free. Rightly so, 
and in the noblest sense of the word, no matter though 
you know ever so exactly how he came to be so, and could 
not but become so. 
Whether he did not or did become so, and how far, 
depended on the psychological accident whether he be- 
came first immersed in the calculations of egotism or in 
the wzsthetic apperception of the surrounding world. This 
accident must not remain accident. The educator’s moral 
duty requires of him the courageous presupposition that 
it is in his power, if he set about it in the right way, to de- 
termine the pupil’s apperception early and strongly enough 
by the esthetic presentation of the universe, so that the 
free mental attitude shall receive its law not at the hands 
of worldly prudence, but from pure practical reflection. 
Such a presentation of the universe, of all the world that 
is known and of all the times that are known, in order to 
efface, if need be, the evil impressions of unfavourable 
surroundings, may justly be termed the chief office of 
education, for which that training which awakens and re- 
strains desire would be but a necessary preparation. 
The concept of the esthetic apperception of the world 
is larger than that of the similar apperception of human 
desire. It is therefore larger than the immediate de- 
mands of morality. And it ought to be so. For although 
external objects are to us accidental, and although it is 
very important to reckon as much as possible among the 
accidentals, it is impossible for us to depart altogether out 
of the sphere of external things. Consequently, many and
-P-A-G-E-142
108 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
various demands of taste arise, whose manner of demand- 
ing is fundamentally none other than that of exsthetic 
judgments of the will. Accordingly, their urgency is felt 
the more strongly the more closely the external is con- 
nected with ourselves. This accounts for the power with 
which external honour, decorum, social tone—in short, 
everything which pertains to ridding ourselves of crude- 
ness—presents its claims among people whose culture has 
begun. It is said there is but one virtue. With almost 
equal correctness one might say, There is but one taste. 
He who violates it anywhere with cold reflectiveness is 
upon the road, if not to abandon that which is moral, at 
least rather to found it on alien principles emanating 
either from the striving after self-dependent greatness and 
welfare or from civil and religious prudence. 
As to the arrangement of a general Aisthetic Presen- 
tation of the Universe, just one word, really a repetition 
of the preceding: Avoid reducing the judgments of taste 
one to another. And what comes to the same thing, 
avoid denying the existence of conflicts. A little further 
on we shall demand much and early reading of selected 
classical poets, and a preliminary exercise of the senses 
for apperceiving works of art of every description. The 
causal connections, even where the reasons are passed over, 
are easy of surmise. 
In addition, only a few of the main traits of that 
presentation of the universe as far as it immediately con- 
cerns morality. 
Everybody grants that even a child can not miss the 
simple fundamental judgments on volition,* considered 
* One has occasion at the present time to protect one’s self from 
the suspicion, as though one intended to invent a new ethics, and 
thus to mock the strict demands of the old and genuine morality. 
Therefore, we shall here allow the familiar names of righteousness,
-P-A-G-E-143
FROM MORALITY TO RELIGION. 109 
  not as formulx but as judgments on individual cases, by 
very reason of their simplicity and absolute priority, pro- 
vided only the opportunities are afforded to it by the sur- 
roundings. It is often said, and let us hope universally 
recognised, that a mother’s tender care, the friendly seri- 
ousness of the father, the family ties, the order of the 
house must present themselves to the eye of childhood in 
all their purity and dignity, because the child judges only 
what it has observed; nay, because what it sees is to it 
the only thing possible and the pattern for its imita- 
tion. 
Suppose this first condition to be fulfilled, or suppose 
it to be made up later on by the beneficent humanity of 
a not common teacher, how, from this point, does educa- 
tion proceed? It must leave the narrow circle. It shows 
weakness worthy of the severest censure if from fear of 
what lies outside it attempts any longer to confine to its 
nearest surroundings a child who has ended its apprentice- 
ship and looks and strives further. Education must 
progress upward and downward. Upward there is one 
step and only one; there is nothing higher. Downward 
there are width and depth unlimited. In the former direc- 
tion the supersensuous realm must open, for of all that is 
visible the family circle is itself the fairest and worthiest. 
But in the opposite direction lies reality. It partly with 
the obtrusiveness of sensuous clearness shows its own de- 
fects and its necessitousness. Partly it is the duty of 
education to disclose completely what the pupil does not 
see, and yet must see, in order to be able to lead the higher 
life of man. 
Since contrasts emphasize each other, and the more so   
kindness, self-command, to stand. We reserve a sharper determina- 
tion which will seek its merit not in saying anything new, but in 
saying that which is old more distinctly.
-P-A-G-E-144
110 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
  the further from the middle term, we might readily come 
to the rule always to progress in both directions simul- 
taneously and uniformly in order to bring out against 
increasing depths of shadow the increasingly strong light 
the more shiningly. If only the way were equally open in 
both directions and ran on in a similar manner! 
God, the real centre of all moral ideas and of their 
limitless efficacy, the Father of man, and the head of the 
world, should fill the background of memory as the oldest, 
the first percept, to which all recollection of the mind, 
returning out of the confusion of life, must invariably 
come at last that it may rest as in its very self in the holi- 
day of faith. But precisely because the highest must ob- 
tain a firm position even among the earliest thoughts to 
which the personality growing into a human being clings, 
and because it is, being the highest, incapable of further 
heightening, there is danger lest by a continuous fasten- 
ing of the mind upon that one point and so simple a 
point, it be merely disfigured by being drawn down to what 
is common, nay, to what is tedious; and surely that 
thought which unceasingly blames and shames the human 
weakness of man ought not to become tedious, or it will 
succumb to the first dash of boldness by which the specu- 
lative impulse undertakes to build a world of its own. 
Were there no other alternative, it were better to keep the 
idea less awake in order to have it existing unmarred at 
the time when man needs its support in the tempests of 
life. But there isa means for nurturing it, strengthening 
it, educating it slowly, and for securing for it a constantly 
increasing veneration—a means which at the same time 
to one theoretically acquainted with the idea must be 
esteemed the only means. The means is to determine it 
continually by contrast. 
And it is exactly this which, as a matter of fact, that 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  COGNITION AND SYMPATHY. 111 
other direction of the progressive presentation of the world 
leads to quite of itself. 
It is plain from reasons whose demonstration here 
would carry us too far that it is the duty of instruction to 
guide from below upward two series, separate yet ever 
simultaneously progressing, toward the highest immovable 
point in order therein to connect them ultimately. These 
series may be distinguished by the names Cognition and 
Sympathy. Of course, the series of Cognition begins with 
exercises for sharpening sense-perception, and for the first 
elaboration of it and the nearest experience; in short, 
with the A B C of Sense-Perception. It would be some- 
what more difficult to indicate the point of the beginning 
for the series of progressive Sympathy, and to justify the 
point given. Closer consideration soon discovers that this 
point can not lie in the present actuality. The sphere of 
children is too contracted and is traversed too soon. The 
sphere of adult life in the cultured man is too high and 
too much determined by relations which we would not 
make comprehensible to a little boy even if we could. 
But the time series of history ends in the present, and in 
the beginnings of culture among the Greeks a luminous 
point is fixed for every subsequent generation by the 
classical presentations of an ideal boyhood era in the 
Homeric poems. If one is not afraid to let the noblest 
among languages precede in instruction the accepted 
learned language, there will be avoided, on the one hand, 
innumerable false incidences and displacements in whatso- 
ever pertains to insight into literature, the history of man, 
of opinions, of arts, etc. ;* and, on the other hand, we are 
sure to offer to the interest of the boy events and per-

sonalities he can completely master, and whence he can 
make a transition to infinitely manifold reflections on 
humanity and society and on the dependence of both on a 
higher power. 
The earliest education of the feelings of a child would 
have to be a total failure if the moral impression of those 
ancient tales remaining after the pleasure in the enter- 
tainment has been satisfied could be at all dubious. To 
begin with, the relation of fable to truth and of crudity 
to culture must everywhere stand out saliently for a boy 
who compares that picture with the circle in which he 
lives. And again, the two oppositions between the men 
of the poet and the members of his own family whom he 
loves and honours, and especially between those gods and 
the Providence whom his thought shapes after the image 
of his parents and worships after their example, produce 
in a youthful mind that has been kept pure exactly the 
opposite effect of that produced in people who, in the 
place of the tedium of lengthy discourses on religion, 
seek a refuge in phantasies which they dare boldly play 
with, and a substitute in the exercises of an art in which 
they have hopes of admiring their own mastership. The 
boy plays in the actual world; in play he realizes his 
phantasies. Should there be one so unhappy as to envy 
the Deity his nonsensuous realm and require in it a 
vacuum for his fictions, he must, J am convinced, have 
little outer life. His diet should be improved, and his 
gymnastic exercises increased. 
However, the world as he contemplates it in his hours 
of seriousness ought to expand further and further. 
ence of practicability. It should be mentioned that there are many 
reasons for giving preference to the Odyssey over the Iliad. But 
at the end of the tenth year it would be too late to begin thus. °

  THE POETRY OF HOMER. 113 
Though, to be sure, remaining always situate between the 
same extremes, it should, so to speak, push them to far- 
ther and farther distances, so as to make room for the 
multitude of characters entering along the thread of his- 
tory, a light being cast on each, if possible, from his first 
classical describer ; or, if that be not possible, at least by 
the reflection which from the purest sources of historic 
light diffuses over the darker stretches. Periods which 
no master has described and whose spirit no poet breathes 
are of little value to education. But if languages are 
taught for the sake of the writings in them, it is oddly 
done to deprive these writings of their interest by accounts 
which anticipate the contents in insipid extracts, espe- 
cially in the silly tone pretending to imitate childhood. 
The continuous study of maturing youth should be be- 
stowed on modern history. In the earlier world, especially 
in the ancient world, the boy may leisurely ramble if, as 
he should, he commenced his Homer just as soon as he 
had outgrown the pressing necessitousness of childhood. 
“ Give every one his due!” Let us give its due to this 
adage itself in every presentation, contemplation, and elu- 
cidation of the manifold personalities. .The cleanliness 
and neatness shown in all genuine poetry when setting up 
and grouping individualities, it is the educator’s first duty 
if not to imitate at least to receive at her hands gratefully 
aud to make use of carefully. But the picture that he is 
to setup is not framed in. It is open and wide as the 
world. Hence the peculiarities distinctive of the species 
of poetry all drop away, and every weakness, every wicked- 
ness, otherwise pleading its excuse in the intent of artistic 
work, stands revealed in its nakedness. Conscience ac- 
companies us to the opera, despite the vigorous protests 
of the poet whom the educator, on the strength of Plato’s 
authority, banishes from his sphere, except where the

truth, the distinctness of the et ean and will serve for 
purifying the better, for heightening the good. 
While thus through the reading of poets and histori- 
ans, through the growing knowledge of men, and through 
moral and religious discourses which help to work up the 
materials previously furnished, the moral distinctions be- 
come continuously sharper, the observation of shades of 
character and the estimation of their distances according to 
ethical measure more and more correct, and by this very 
means the elements of the moral idea of God ever stronger 
in clearness and dignity, there becomes prominent on the 
side of cognition with increasing definiteness the concept 
of Nature asa system of forces and motions which, strict- 
ly continuing in the course once begun, design for us the 
pattern of law, and of order, and of sharply determinate 
measure. How defective the presentation of the universe 
would be, how little there would be comprised in it of the 
data of reality, how like a fable it would hover in the airy 
realm of thought, if we were to omit Nature! And how 
little would it answer the spirit of a rationally shaped life ! 
Do you believe that you can by moral ideas alone teach how 
to act? Man stands in the midst of Nature, himself a part 
of it, his innermost soul traversed by currents of her power, 
retorting upon this external might his own might and 
after his own kind, according to his own essence, first 
thinking, then willing, then acting. Through his volition 
runs the chain of Nature. But for any one definite will it 
does so at some one definite place. This fate, originating 
solely from the individuality of the position, which for 
every determinate member of a species is necessarily a 
peculiar one, in contradistinction to the derivation from 
the highest plane of Nature, primarily designed by a uni- 
versally ordering Providence for the species, this fate is 
the necessity which forces itself upon man. It is this   
-P-A-G-E-149
AESTHETIC PRESENTATION OF THE UNIVERSE. 115 
necessity which he must needs see and reflect upon in or- 
der rightly to determine his steps and the measure of his 
steps at every single instant. For the moral idea, though, 
to be sure, it speaks to our species, is silent for the indi- 
vidual so far as he is an individual. It knows nothing of 
his closest limitations. It reproves and shames, but it can 
not help him. It requires him at the goal. He is on the 
way. But it knows nothing about the way, much less can 
it lead him. Man must know himself and his powers, and 
the nearest forces to help him, and he must recognise their 
limitations, if their strength is to be serviceable to him 
according to its measure. 
This fate is not the ancient Moira, that destroyer of 
life, that pure opposite of all minds.* 
It can not harass the ethical man. For he does not 
* The recent reappearance of the Motra is a triumph for the an- 
cient poets. Their poetical omnipotence had power so to shape the 
material which primeval popular belief forced upon them, that modern 
masters have been misled to suppose that art depends upon it. But 
what art, having any definite principles whatever, would count 
among its elements that which is entirely formless and altogether 
unsusceptible of formulation, as a metaphysical analysis of the con- 
cept would show? What art could suffer the introduction of an 
element which is completely heterogeneous to all the remaining ele- 
ments and for that reason completely incapable of all purely ac- 
cordant relations to them—without any intervals—which, being 
nothing but a collision, could only cause insoluble discords? And 
what cultured man has cordial sympathy for a grief resting upon a 
misconception rejected long since? Both, absolute fate and absolute 
freedom, are equally ancient remnants of crudity and equally 
scandalous in the domain of theory and of taste. Even if the best 
use be made of them in a work of art, they only help—perhaps 
against the will of the poet—to frame the picture by indicating the 
scene, the time, and point of view, and consequently the presup- 
posed limitations, within which we may this time expect the repre- 
sentations of the beautiful.

demand that in him as an individual mankind or reason 
should perfect itself. He meets Providence, seeking to 
Jend a hand to it in its care for the race. He hears the 
call to continue that which has been begun. He compre- 
hends that theodicy is left to the action of mankind. 
But what of education? How does the pupil gain the . 
insight into these consequences of his individuality ? "This 
question beckons us to the conclusion of our essay. For 
man soon sees himself as Nature, provided only that he 
has first gained the general idea of Nature. But it can be 
demanded of no one to comprehend the strict conformity 
of Nature to law, if he has not received the strict discipline 
of mathematics together with its solutions. 
And prior to the search for laws, there is need of the 
keen apperception of data. To speak generally, there is 
need of attention, of surrender to what lies before us. 
There is need of an early discipline for the roving thoughts 
of an early habituation to the exact continuation of com- 
menced work. This is the sphere of the considerations 
to which space has been given in the introduction to the 
A B C of Sense-Perception. 
It may be left to the thoughtful reader, if he please, to 
combine and to fill in these sketches. We desire to avoid 
incurring the appearance of having furnished a whole. 
But it was intended to be shown that we may still risk 
ignoring certain systems that can never benefit education, 
at least when we speak of that subject. Be that which has 
here been presented given over for a while to their censure. 
It is neither, let us hope, new nor old enough to make any 
one wish to fit it into foreign theories or to understand it 
better than the author did. In the contrary event, the 
author would be under the obligation to declare that he 
considers it a sad proof, not of strength but of feebleness 
of intellect, when one is inclined to, shuffle together as-

sertions peculiar to different thinkers, and, above all, that 
he will not believe himself understood by any one to whom 
it still remains a riddle how determinism and morality 
can coexist. 
Others, perhaps, dislike to find investigations so ab- 
stract in the company of an A B C of Sense-Perception. 
Such we beg to reflect, that after all it may, perhaps, be 
useful that for once a pedagogical work gives occasion for 
estimating the extent of the sphere of education and the 
magnitude of the problems still before us by the distance 
to be traversed in order to ascend from the lowest to the 
highest. And we must look out into this distance, for the 
last must be prepared by the first. 
CHAPTER VII. 
BETWEEN the appendix on the Alsthetic Presentation of 
the Universe and the A BC of Sense-Perception, Herbart 
inserted a postscript to the second edition. This postscript— 
a modern writer would have made it a preface—is interme- 
diate not only locally but logically also. We learn from it 
that the essay we have just read was really a fragment of an 
older pedagogical essay, originally written to reach a peda- 
gogical understanding with a friend. 
Herbart was conscious that it would be very foolish seri- 
ously to attempt to set forth his idea of pedagogy in an ap- 
pendix to an A B C of Sense-Perception. He was convinced 
that general ideas are bound to suffer in being submitted to 
public judgment without the full complement of systematic 
demonstration, elucidation, and illustration. If the reader 
has gathered a like conviction from the too brief glimpse of 
Herbartianism gained in perusing the preceding essay, we 
can only invite him to give a detailed and close reading to 
the General Pedagogy, the systematic work which Herbart
-P-A-G-E-152
118 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
brought out two years later, in 1806. Being so nearly ready 
with the large systematic work, and realizing all the incon- 
veniences attending the publication of the scant appendix, 
it may be asked why, notwithstanding, did he publish it ? 
He was forced to do so. Herbart was not one of those who 
think they have changed the course of the pedagogic stars 
simply because they have set one of the educational land- 
marks. Being neither a sciolist theoretically nor an inventor 
of so-called devices in practice, he was especially anxious 
that the A B C of Sense-Perception should not be abused in 
either direction. He desired, by indicating the large outlines 
of the system of education, to make sure that the A B C of 
Sense-Perception would be accepted only for what it is— 
namely, the initial point of the knowledge series. 
It was needful to cast this theoretical light upon his posi- 
tion on the question of sense-perception for two reasons. In 
the first place, the Fichtean doctrine of the Ego, as we have 
seen, implied a transcendental freedom of the will of which 
the educator can not only make nothing, but which makes 
education itself impossible. But the Fichtean system also 
implied a “productive imagination.” The latter was ridi- 
culed by Goethe in Faust, where the scholar emanating 
from the Idealistic school tells the devil : 
“Die Welt sie war nicht bis ich sie gebar.” 
(The world did not exist till I gave birth to it.) 
Whatever other value this Fichtean speculation might have, 
it as surely made an end of intellectual as transcendental 
freedom did of moral education. In resisting the Fichtean 
system Herbart was fighting for the possibility of pedagogy. 
To cap the climax, Mr. Johannsen, a Fichtean, not only 
made a number of detailed objections to the A B C of Sense- 
Perception, the worth of which the reader will judge after 
a perusal of Herbart’s reply, but attempted to make out that 
Herbart, the arch-realist—not (shall we repeat it ?) material- 
ist—was, after all, a Fichtean, and, what was especially gall- 
ing, he clinched his pretended identification by attributing 
to Herbart the doctrine he himself held: ‘ The reduction of
-P-A-G-E-153
FICHTE’S PHILOSOPHY. 119 
all knowledge to sense-perception is the highest principle of 
instruction.” 
The false light cast upon his A B C of Sense-Perception 
by a metaphysical system to which Herbart publicly de- 
clared himself in opposition, was the more irritating for set- 
ting out of sight his pedagogical advance upon Pestalozzian- 
ism. It has been again and again shown by pedagogic 
writers that that advance, to put it in psychologic language, 
consisted in including the Pestalozzian perception under the 
pedagogically far more important factor of apperception. 
We have seen in the former papers that Herbart very well 
understood the superiority of his point of view to Pestalozzi’s. 
Still, in the first edition of his A B C of Sense-Perception he 
had hoped only to offer a book which might fall into line 
with the Pestalozzian movement. But when the Pestalozzian 
A BC of Sense-Perception insisted on using the unmathe- 
matical quadrangle instead of the mathematical triangle, 
when it emphasized relations of measurement, neglecting 
angular position, and when it prided itself on being closely 
related to objectification of number work, Herbart could 
not help seeing the lowness of the plane on which Pestalozzi 
was destined to remain. That sort of work would never get 
beyond sense-perception. That, by the way, is the reason 
why in our primary schools we find it so often wasteful of 
time and vacant of intellect. Herbart, accordingly, drew 
aside from the current discussions, and having already, as the 
reader will see in the work itself, given frequent hints of its 
dependence on pedagogical main questions, now waived the 
previous question of Pestalozzianism or non-Pestalozzianism 
altogether, preferring to take a direct appeal to the idea of 
pedagogy itself. This was the second reason why he was 
obliged to set forth that idea in the preliminary platform of 
principles which is furnished in the Aisthetic Presentation, 
the General Pedagogy being as yet unpublished. It is also 
the reason why we were obliged to ask a careful study for 
the Atsthetic Presentation. 
Much clearness will be gained on the difference between 
the mechanique of the Pestalozzian and the Herbartian

latter to be used as location centres. The former is the 
Pestalozzian mechanique, the latter is Herbart’s plan. There 
is far more in that difference than meets the eye. 
In conclusion, let us say that the reader will not find a 
few moments’ reflection on Herbart’s difference between 
analytic and synthetic instruction at all time wasted. 
THE PostscRipT TO THE SECOND EDITION OF THE 
ABC or SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
At its first appearance the present work might hope 
to receive an appropriate position among the new plans 
of study that would be called forth and recommended by 
the enterprise of Pestalozzi. It might the rather seek to 
gain such a recommendation, it would seem, as it removed 
the offence which at least connoisseurs in mathematics 
might take at the quadrangle disfiguring the idea of Pesta- 
lozzi’s A BC of Sense-Perception. It seemed advisable 
to show the facility of this improvement before animad- 
version was heard. That care may have been hasty. The 
critics have not objected. The Pestalozzian A B C of 
Sense-Perception has appeared. It has persisted in the 
quadrangle. It wishes, at least, to bear the title of Ob- 
jective Teaching of Proportions, though it does not abso- 
lutely refuse to include anything else. Finally, it takes 
pride in its close relation to objectified arithmetic, with 
which, in fact, it coincides almost. If this be three faults 
for one, they should be the worse on account of each put- 
ting a fair face on the others. Although the veneration 
of the author for the noble Swiss is in nowise abated, he 
must, accordingly, somewhat withdraw his book out of
-P-A-G-E-155

the external connection in which it stood, if only that he 
may not be obtrusive. The question, To what extent does 
it promote the plan of Pestalozzi? can no longer remain 
an acceptable standard for its appraisement. Being, how- 
ever, too small to stand alone, there remains nothing but 
to connect it the more closely with the pure idea of peda- 
gogy itself, to which, in fact, from the first it appealed in 
a variety of ways. 
Speaking now without regard to this book, it is a gen- 
eral impossibility either rightly to carry out the peda- 
gogical elaboration of any one subject of instruction or 
afterward to judge it rightly except there be before the 
minds both of the workman and the judge a similar con- 
cept of the whole of which the specialty is to be a part. 
Otherwise the elaborator will fall in love with the subject 
which he is immersed in, while the critic, who casts but scat- 
tered glances upon it, will rightly or wrongly suspect the 
former of that recommendatory emphasis in his proposals 
which is the consequence of one-sided preference merely. 
Against any one such preference it would, indeed, be easy 
to pit some other having as good, if not better, claims to 
interpose in education the force of its zeal. If, for ex- 
ample, one man praises mathematics as indispensable in 
education, the praise is read by another as if the indis- 
pensable wheel in the machine were pretended to be the 
only motor force. If the former merely uses the exercises 
in sense-perception so as to make them at the same time pre- 
paratory exercises for the mathematical comprehension of 
that which is perceived, a third man will watch him jeal- 
ously in the interest of mere sense-perception, which, he 
says, must after all in the beginning provide everything, 
the concepts being found later on, perhaps of themselves. 
Among misunderstandings of that kind, small wonder if 
other objectors ask whether any one will say that sense-

perception and theoretical concepts ever change into 
either moral or religious feeling; whether to retain chil- 
dren in the sphere of sense be not obyiously and flatly the 
contrary of directing them to the supersensuous, by which 
may be awakened faith, love, and hope in the tender and 
pure souls of children—an awakening the more needful to 
them the more the times are threatening to bring about 
the conditions by which men who have grown up coarse 
can only become the more hardened. 
If the very idea of pedagogy could enter into the dis- 
cussion, it certainly would know how to make peace be- 
tween the parties by repelling none; by, on the contrary, 
conceding the necessity for the work of each; by then 
showing what and where each contributes to the whole, 
and how one must make preparations for the work of the 
other; and how exactly, because in this respect order and 
agreement have not been the rule, the supervisors of the 
entire business were forced into giving many general pre- 
cepts of moderation solely that none of the workers might 
brush up against and hinder another; but how also, just 
because no one has been allowed to work with all his 
power, because nothing has been carried out to the end 
and executed largely and boldly, the whole has fallen into 
such a condition of feebleness as almost to draw down 
upon it contempt, as it can hardly be denied that hitherto 
the most eminent men have not on an average been ex- 
actly those who have been the most carefully educated. 
Unfortunately, however, it is almost impossible to 
mention the pure idea of pedagogy without awakening 
fresh and more stirring contentions, since—where is this 
idea? Pestalozzi made his attempt without any system. 
Mr. Ith elucidated his plan by a comparison with Kantian 
principles. Mr. Johannsen, on page 202 of his Critique 
of the Pestalozzian Method, calls this the “ most unfortu-
-P-A-G-E-157
REPLY TO JOHANNSEN. 198 
nate idea one could have.” It might easily happen to 
Mr. Johannsen to have some one in turn say to him, 
There is one idea even more unfortunate, to wit, impli- 
cating the Fichtean theories with this matter, that being 
a scheme comparable only to passing the A B C of Pesta- 
lozzi from without into the circle of Fichte’s productive 
intuition, with a suggestion that, by way of useful exer- 
cise, it transfer its images into the squares proffered for 
the sake of rectification.* 
The writer is obliged here to insert some remarks 
against Mr. Johannsen in which the essential point is 
that Mr. Johannsen imagines in the present work “ upon 
the whole” the same point of view which he himself 
chose for his Critique: “The reduction of all knowledge 
to sense-perception is the highest principle of instruction.” 
This language is very natural in an adherent of the sys- 
tem of productive intuition. But it is not the language 
of the determined opponent of that system; and such the 
writer, notwithstanding his veneration for the genius of 
his great teacher Fichte, is forced, it seems, here publicly 
to confess himself, since the utterances on philosophy in 
the Introduction to the A B C of Sense-Perception have 
not sufficed to ward off that most repulsive species of 
officiousness, the substitution of another’s opinion in the 
place of one’s own. As for the rest, that this book is in- 
  
* There is in the system of Fichte a call to spontaneous activity, 
by which is meant what we should describe as spontaneous activity 
in the world of sense. But the call as well as that which calls is 
originally the product of the imagination of him who is called. Will 
Mr. Johannsen undertake to indicate the point in Fichte’s system at 
which the productive intuition itself makes everything that is ex- 
ternal (and which, if there is to be for it a teacher and an educator, 
must also make him), can be touched by a call from without in any 
manner, however mediate?

  124 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
tended, in the first place, and in the main, to be an A B C 
of Sense-Perception, and only secondarily and incidentally 
because in the nature of the case both coincide, as a pro- 
logue to mathematics—not only to higher mathematics— 
it is almost ridiculous to repeat since the whole arrange- 
ment of the work witnesses it. But if the work be in- 
tended to practise the measurement by the eye, why does 
it not measure? Why spurn the square “when in the 
whole of geometry it is more correct to regard the triangle 
as half of a quadrangle of the same base and altitude, and 
thus to measure by means of the square, than to make the 
transition from the triangle to the square?” This is cor- 
rect in “the whole of” geometry in the place where it 
teaches how to determine the superficial content of tri- 
angles—that is to say, in a single proposition of the whole 
science. In this book, accordingly, this proposition occurs 
where it belongs, namely, in the first episode. It does 
not, however, belong to the main business, since surface 
measurement does not at all pertain to sense-perception. 
On the contrary, the pure concept of the content of a sur- 
face is an absolutely nonsensuous concept, destructive of 
all form and, consequently, of all sense-perception. Its 
object is to indicate purely the amount of superficial ex- 
tent, disregarding altogether the fact whether the amount 
appear within curved boundaries or within rectilinear 
boundaries. From this point of view all changes to 
squares or cubes or other rectilinear figures are to be re- 
garded. The object in these operations is not to straighten 
out that which is crooked nor to bend that which is straight, 
but to throw away the straight as well as the crooked al- 
together, so as to have nothing left over but the amount of 
spatial extension, to which afterward, of course, any form 
you please may be given. Asa matter of fact, for the sake 
of in ‘some way fixing for the imagination and the senses 
 
-P-A-G-E-159
  PESTALOZZ'S GEOMETRY. 198 
that which has been measured, we do usually give it the 
form whose contours are most easily determinable from the 
originally assumed linear measure. It is for this reason that 
superficial content is represented in square, physical con- 
tent in cubical form; it is not tied to the form in the 
least. Finally, the reminder that in teaching the sense- 
perception of form care should also have been taken of the 
apperception of curvilinear forms would be very acute if 
it were only possible to do more for this purpose than has 
been done. Comparisons of the terminal points of curved 
lines with reference to the radius of curvature are de- 
manded as early as Number I of the First Section. But 
such comparison presupposes triangles. Drawing circles, 
giving separate arcs in degrees, finding the centre and 
consequently also the radius—all these exercises are de- 
manded on page 186; and they are so important as to 
deserve to be recommended here once more emphatically. 
It would be possible to connect these exercises with what 
would be really the essential work—namely, the estima- 
tion of all, even of continuously varying curvatures at 
every point—by comparison with a circle of determinate 
radius, as an arc of which circle the determined curve could 
be regarded. But how is such estimation to be taught? 
Only empirically? That may be done, but then, it being 
empirical, no further instructions are necessary. Or with 
the same certainty and accuracy which was possible in the 
apperception of triangles—that is to say, by introducing 
the mathematical concepts? No one will entertain this 
idea who is acquainted with the computations for radii of 
curvature and for angles of curvature, together with the 
presupposed equations for possible curves. But further 
talk on the subject is inadvisable. We have to do with an 
author who has found “ profound geometrical and trigo- 
nometrical elements” in a book that plunges into the 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  {96 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
  profundities of mathematical science no further than pro- 
portion. 
Thus much in defence against the assurance of a critic 
attempting to introduce into pedagogy not only the Fich- 
tean system, but also, and without possessing the original- 
ity of Fichte, the Fichtean tone. The first part of the 
attempt, considered as an exercise of speculation, could be 
none other than interesting, though it might be a ques- 
tion which would be the most vulnerable—the existing 
pedagogy, the Fichtean system, or the man who steps be- 
tween the two in order to apply the Seer) The second 
* The system does not admit of two absolute Egos affecting each 
other. Who, then, is to be the Absolute? The pupil? ‘That ex- 
cludes the educator. The educator? At first it should seem that 
this is the only alternative even on other grounds, for I presume it 
is he who should speak of education. Now, will the educator, posit- 
ing the pupil as a rational creature, ascribe to him also a productive 
intuition, among the produets of which occurs, besides other things, 
an image of the educator together with images of his total activity, 
and of altogether the same world of sense in which the educator finds 
himself living and acting? Where is the foundation for this pre- 
established harmony between two originally produced worlds? Here 
one is almost tempted to call in the Absolute of Schelling, certainly 
as it, too, must dissolve into products of the Ego. But let the 
foundation be where and what you please, how is the educator to 
regard his activity? Is he to act in his world of sense by drawing 
and presenting figures, by speaking, admonishing, and punishing 
only for the sake of having a corresponding event occur by virtue of 
the harmony in the sense-world produced by the pupil? Is, then, 
the harmony, in respect to its subject-matter, pre-established so 
little as to await the arbitrary action of the educator? Again, why 
does not the sensuous knowledge, nay, the entire insight and dis- 
position of the pupil, advance far more rapidly, seeing the two pro- 
ductive intuitions are so closely connected that, so it seems, there 
should be need only of production in the teacher of that which is to 
be learned and thought in order to have it actually learned and 
thought by the pupil. These questions will suffice as a preliminary

FICHTE’S IDEA OF FREEDOM, 127 
part of the attempt, let us hope, will not succeed. Many 
are offended and many will oppose it. 
In these days of systems, no matter how much trouble 
one takes to make every thought clear by its own perspicu- 
ity, a wrong light is cast upon it from all sides, and every- 
body sees with dazed eyes. What is one to do but to cast 
a reflection upon it one’s self from general principles, cer- 
tain as may be one’s conviction that in such a process 
these general principles must suffer, needing more than 
anything else to be kept in their rightful position, and to be 
exposed to public judgment only with their complete syste- 
matic environment? ‘To set forth the general idea of edu- 
cation directly after an A B C of Sense-Perception in an 
    
exercise for forward reformers of education. By way of solution, 
compare not only Fichte’s Natural Law, but also his Ethics, pp. 280 
ff., and his Destiny of Man, pp. 283 ff. Then see how far you can 
get with it. It is, however, easy to see why, accepting the Fichtean 
principles, difficulties occur in pedagogy that do not make themselves 
so strongly felt in jurisprudence and ethics. The reason is that in 
the latter cases it is necessary only to explain how we are impelled 
from within to posit rational beings who, according to the realistic 
view, are without us. The philosopher stands alone upon his tran- 
scendental point. Will anybody follow him? Will anybody under- 
stand him? He expects it, perhaps. He does not knowit. He can 
not communicate the intellectual intuition to anybody. But in 
pedagogy he is forced to declare whether the rational beings posited 
by him are so posited as to be able themselves to become occupants 
of his transcendental point. For it would have to be the purpose of 
education to elevate them to that point, since otherwise, as a com- 
mon business, education is obliged to creep in the realistic depths. 
More than this. He is compelled to a definite declaration as to the 
conditions under which one reaches the point of partly pure theory, 
partly pure ethics. If to this he again replies by the word free- 
dom, education is done for; only, we must take care that he does 
not restrict his freedom by all sorts of conditions, but limits it in 
fact to the pure faculty of making throughout an absolute begin- 
ning.

128 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
appendix is an attempt that can not be intended very seri- 
ously, or it would be a great, a blameworthy folly. Buta 
fragment of an older essay, originally written to arrive at 
an understanding with a friend, may well be used by the 
contrast of its large though merely indicated contours to 
make the A BC of Sense-Perception appear the small 
point in the expanse of the educational sphere which it 
really is—a point noticeable for this reason only, that it 
fixes the beginning of a line running far on and into 
manifold branches. Perhaps it will be an incidental ad- 
vantage if on this occasion the possibility is shown for 
philosophizing on education, even independently of the 
most recent systems. 
To return, however, as far as this postscript is con- 
cerned, to the A BC of Sense-Perception itself, whence 
we started this discussion. The confusion resulting from 
two different executions of one and the same idea exists 
and can not now be helped. As no contention either will 
orshould be had on it, nothing remains for persons in- 
terested in the subject but orientation by their own reflec- 
tion. By the following view the author seeks to put him- 
self into the course of such a reflection, natural, entirely 
ingenuous, and not calculated for any predetermined result. 
We do not ordinarily see the objects that hover before 
our eyes as sharply as we wish. If we desire to sharpen 
our vision by an auxiliary more potent than merely 
looking repeatedly, there are offered for our choice two 
ways: we may add something to what we see, or we may 
omit something. We might add to it certain lines of 
more regular, more apperceivable shape; in this case we 
should apperceive the object to the extent that it conforms 
to the lines—catching it, so to speak, in a net. But this 
kind of net would not allow itself to be untangled again ; 
it would remain hung in our imagination. We should no

  HOW TO SEIZE ELEMENTS. 129 
longer be struck immediately by the peculiarity of the 
object. The inclusiveness of its shape would be gone; as 
grown fast to foreign forms it would make one whole with 
them, as a part with other parts. Its hovering freely 
would be gone, since it would stand shored up and pressed 
in as though by a scaffolding, or in a cage. The esthet- 
ical perception would be sacrificed and the impressive 
perception would be accustomed to a wretched mechan- 
ism. This will be the result, let the lines which we add 
be triangles, quadrangles, circles, or what you will. 
The second way, that of omitting something from too 
complicated a subject, is still open. We, similarly, omit 
something from too extensive a historical subject—that 
is to say, not an entire half, not any essential portion, but 
lesser details, sometimes, with beginners, even the shad- 
ings of characterization and the entire evolution of events, 
in order primarily to impress upon the memory surely and 
accurately only a few of the chief chronological moments 
and their distances apart. Similarly, again, from a scien- 
tific presentation, which was not comprehended at the first 
continuous lecture, one for facilitation singles out the 
technical terms, defines the separate concepts to which 
they pertain, and goes on to note which of these concepts 
are comprehended in the principles, which in the demon- 
strations, which in the result. In a similar way, in objects 
of sense-perception, one might consider what we can best 
dispense with in recognising the shape. In viewing the 
object one might determine upon ignoring, so to speak, 
the most dispensable elements, upon withdrawing them 
from the attention. Should the remainder still be too 
complicated, we might again disregard certain elements, 
keeping others within sight. We should thus continue, 
till at length only a few prominent portions or contours 
should remain. But to come to the simplest element, we
-P-A-G-E-164
  
  130 HERBARTS ABC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
should be exclusively restricted to certain prominent points. 
These would seem to have an accidental, unordered posi- 
tion after effacing, so to speak, all that mediated between 
them. Nevertheless, this unordered position would be 
none other than the true one which they had in the object 
* itself. The apperception of this position would be com- 
patible, therefore, with the apperception of the object. 
Nay, it would belong to the same; it could not be dis- 
pensed with either in impressive perception or in esthetic 
perception. Furthermore, it would furnish the founda- 
tion for both, the whole shape now seeming fixed to these 
points. Nevertheless, this fastening imports nothing het- 
erogeneous and disfiguring. The object would lean on 
nothing but itself, and stand as freely as before. But it 
would stand. It would no longer hover before the eye, 
which vacillates itself. 
But this would not remove all the difficulties. The 
position of scattered points was to be apperceived, and to 
be apperceived immediately, just as those points happened 
to be located, without any further auxiliaries. For noth- 
ing, as our reflection above showed, must be mixed up with 
them. But is such an apperception easy? Make trial 
with the stars in the sky. 
_ Now we are coming to the triangles. For in order to 
reduce this problem again to its simplest elements, one 
would be obliged once more to omit some of the points. 
How many? So many as to leave a remnant barely suffi- 
cient for mutual position. In taking, for the purpose, four 
of them instead of three, one would not be far astray. But 
it is a pity that these four points scattered at haphazard 
would be likely to form a very odd, oblique-angled, and 
obliquely located quadrangle. A square, a rectangle, would 
be out of expectation unless the draughtsman inserted it. 
Endeayouring to apperceive this oblique triangle, one

would probably look in turn at all its corners; take -to- 
gether each corner with two other points, and therefore 
immediately hit upon the triangles into which the quad- 
rangle must divide the moment that one draws diagonals. 
The problem would reduce, then, to whether one knows 
how to apperceive these triangles. Until these simple 
thoughts are agreed to it would be useless to send after 
the book what has been held back. The author, however, 
can not here help noting briefly from his General Peda- 
gogy that he deems necessary an analytic and a synthetic 
line in instruction simultaneous, except that the former 
should be afew steps ahead. Obviously the A B © of 
Sense-Perception belongs to synthetic instruction. 
Now let our line of vision, from the A B © of Sense- 
Perception to the general problem of education, be re- 
versed. Let the A BC fall back into distance. It has 
not been seen rightly as long as it has only been viewed . 
near by. We seek the heights of pedagogy. But no one is 
invited who does not know that which is good ; no one who 
thinks he knows something higher. To him who denies 
the principles, we in turn deny the truth of his.

PART II. 
Tue A BC of Sense-Perception is the only work in which 
Herbart has elaborated a given branch of instruction, the 
General Pedagogy and the Outlines of Pedagogic Lectures 
treating, as the titles imply, of the whole science of peda- 
gogy as it is conceived under the Herbartian system. The 
ABC of Sense-Perception is therefore the only work which 
the teacher can take immediately into the schoolroom and 
apply it. After the insight acquired by the perusal of Part I 
into the principles of Herbartianism there should be no 
difficulty. 
As it is essential that the reader should demonstrate to 
himself his own proficiency by handling Herbartian work, 
we place before him a translation of the A BC of Sense- 
Perception, without note or comment.

I. Sense-Perception is capable of Cultivation. 
Tue A B C of Sense-Perception rests upon two pre- 
suppositions—first, that seeing is an art; second, that the 
apprentice in this as in every other art must go through 
a certain series of exercises. 
We do not all see everything alike. The same horizon 
offers much to one eye and little to another. To one man 
132
-P-A-G-E-167
  DIFFERENCE IN POWER OF SEEING. 133 
it reveals the beautiful, to another the useful, to still an- 
other it is a map which he has learned by heart. In one 
and the same landscape a boy seeks the steeples, castles, 
villages, persons known to him, always clinging to single 
points, while a painter groups the different portions, and 
a geometer compares the heights of the mountains. A 
child is pleased with the bright and variegated. The 
Chinese invented the most beautiful colors, the Greeks 
the most beautiful forms. The amateur in silhouettes, 
snatching the profile of the passer-by, cuts it out with the 
scissors. The painter of refined taste often feels a portrait 
to be unsuccessful, despite hours of sitting and frequently 
improved sketches. Some people are born draughtsmen, 
and able to represent any formation of their fancy. Others 
are incapable of reproducing anything—at the first motion 
of the pencil the most beautiful apparition seems cancelled. 
There are occasional moments of inspiration; a painting, 
a view, becomes of a sudden brilliant, transfigured ; only 
now does everything seem to belong together, to nestle 
together, to gain proportion, to fall into its proper posi- 
tions of breadth, height, and depth; to expand and to 
become unified. What is it that having been concealed 
so long -becomes now for the first time visible? What 
causes one man to see beauty and another to have exact- 
ness of visual perception? What is it that makes one 
person cling to colour while revealing to another the 
forms? What is it that helps one man while disturbing 
another, when both endeavour to reproduce a scene or a 
thought? 
Perhaps these differences may be partly explained by 
the accident of special interests or peculiarities of tem- 
perament, which habituate the attention in one way or 
another. But we do not now inquire into remote causes. 
The immediate cause consists, doubtless, in the difference  
-P-A-G-E-168
  1384 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
in the perception itself. How and in what respect is it 
possible for vision to change while the object remains 
identical? The discovery of exercises for cultivating 
sense-perception depends on this point. 
Strictly speaking, what the vision perceives in objects 
is colour. That the object is a solid body, that it is hard 
or soft, dry or damp, is matter of feeling, not of sight. 
But colour oceupies a place. There are boundaries at 
which it terminates, or portions where it shades off into 
other colours. Where an object ceases to show colour it 
ceases to show itself. At such points are the boundaries 
of its visible appearance. These boundaries inclose its 
figure. Sight, then, in addition to colour, shows figure or 
form, but the latter only by means of the former. With- 
out colour the figure would be empty; it would be 
nothing. 
If any point in an object is of striking colour or bril- 
liancy the impression on the eye from that point is 
stronger. At the expense of the unity of apperception, 
the vision is enticed to that one point. The remainder of 
the object escapes our perception, if not wholly, at all 
events partially. The impression made is weak, indistinct, 
and wavering, unless equilibrium of vision is restored by 
an especial attention to the whole. 
Once the vision becomes accustomed to yield to glitter, 
brilliancy, and variegation, it is lost to a great part of the 
objects of Nature, and it is wholly lost to taste. In order 
to confer charms upon anything it will attach to it some- 
thing bright, no matter if by doing so its form is distorted. 
Man, the most beautiful shape in Nature, is without glitter. 
In order to be worth looking at he decks himself in gold 
and purple, the feathers of birds, and opalescent shells. 
Colour at the expense of form is a characteristic of all 
tasteless ornamentation. It is easy to call to mind illus- 
 
-P-A-G-E-169
UNEDUCATED SEEING. 135 
trative instances of savage and semicivilized nations, of 
our own past history, and of much that is not yet past. 
Clearly, therefore, the cardinal fault of uneducated sight 
consists in adherence to colour. More exactly speaking, 
it consists in being immersed in the pre-eminent colour, in 
losing weaker colours at the instance of the stronger. 
Correctness of sense-perception, which is opposed to this 
fault, consists in synthetically connecting everything that 
pertains to the form of a thing. It is attention to form 
to which our vision requires to be especially educated. 
This being gained, the sensations of contrast between light 
and shadow, and between shades of colour, will come of 
themselves almost. It will be said, perhaps, that we should 
mention proportion also ; but the proportions are implied 
in every form actually coming before our eyes. We shall 
speak later on of the analysis of actual forms into pure 
form and measure. 
It seems easy, then, to indicate the direction in which 
we must turn the exertions of our A B C of Sense-Per- 
ception. But it is quite a question how anything can be 
practically taught and learned that escapes almost all ex- 
pression through descriptive language. Not only the eye 
of the artist but even the eye of the curious child is won- 
derfully mobile and pliant. There are quick and mani- 
fold changes from grasp to penetration, and vice versa. 
How are we to follow by words this enjoyable perusal of 
forms, now gliding along wave lines, now gazing fixedly at 
the whole, and again grouping large, small, and the small- 
est portions, while receiving simultaneously both the truth 
and the beauty of forms? And, again, what an amount 
of analysis, of denudation, when the elevated, receding, 
rounded body is made to surrender its naked outline to 
the flat canvas!) And what a rebirth when the object of 
vision, originally a whole, is reproduced by single lines  
-P-A-G-E-170
136 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
  and dots! The imagination had to dissolve it completely 
and to recompose it completely, without the falsification 
of a single trait. To every operation of the hand there is 
a corresponding operation of mind. When these opera- 
tions do not proceed of themselves, what is the use of 
talking about them? Can the artist do more than show 
how? Can the apprentice do more than try? Instruc- 
tion meets defeat so often in the competition with delight 
and genius ! 
Hence it is becoming that instruction should, abstain- 
ing from arrogance, offer simply that which it has to offer. 
This treatise does not relate to esthetic perception. It is 
confined to the common sense-perception which aims to 
perceive a given object accurately and to preserve it faith- 
fully. The idea was presented by the genius of Pestalozzi. 
Our reasons for deviating from him in the execution will 
be developed in Section First. If, especially, The Ground 
Plan of a Theory of Sense-perception should find atten- 
tive readers, it will be unnecessary to discuss minutely the 
alternative value of square and triangle. Pestalozzi calls 
his work “ The Object Teaching of Proportion.” But for 
this neither square nor triangle, but the simple straight 
line, should serve as the foundation. Besides, these exer- 
cises in the perception of mere measure would turn out 
to be so simple, to offer so little connected occupation, as 
to be suitable for forming youthful games rather than 
a branch of instruction. Aside from this, it will ap- 
pear further on that such exercises are intermingled 
unavoidably with instruction in the apperception of 
forms. If the latter be given, those exercises need no 
specific care. 
Whatever the doubts entertained as to the possibility 
of cultivating sense-perception by teaching, the fact itself 
of its susceptibility to cultivation is sufficiently clear simply

from its changeableness, from its transition from crude- 
ness to artistic perfection. 
IT. The Pedagogical Value of Trained Sense- Perception. 
Sense-perception is the most important among the 
educative occupations of childhood and boyhood. 
The more quietly, the more deliberately, the less play- 
fully the child observes things, the more solid the founda- 
tions it is laying for its future knowledge and judgment. 
The child is divided between desiring, observing, and 
fancying. Which of the three should we wish to have the 
preponderance? Neither the first nor the third; out of 
desiring and fancying originates the controlling power 
of whims and delusion. From observation, on the other 
hand, originates a knowledge of the nature of things. 
Such knowledge produces submission to recognised ne- 
cessity, the only compulsion Rousseau approved and re- 
commended, and which in its turn originates well-ad- 
vised activity and a thoughtful choice of means. 
In fancying and play, it is true, the child makes the 
first beginning in the working-up of its apperception 
material by furnishing to itself opportunities, on the one 
hand, for still further observations; on the other, for dis- 
covering the relations and connections of what it has ob- 
served. But to the extent that fancy follows these rela- 
tions and connections, both in the sense of tracing them 
and of yielding to them, to the extent that any guidance 
whatever is accepted by it from the nature of things, 
fancy is making a transition to thought and to xsthetic 
perception; it finds the true and the beautiful. Pure 
fancying, mere mixing of reminiscences, taking no notice 
of the resultant absurdities, is nothing but a crude mani- 
festation of spiritual existence, crude life, material whose 
quantity may be very desirable, but whose excellence and
-P-A-G-E-172
ee eee ee ee ee ee eee PR eS 
138 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
worth depend on a quality which it is still to receive. 
Praising a man’s imaginative power is much like calling 
one happy because he is rich. 
We do not throw away riches, neither should we des- 
potically pluck the wings of fancy, nor poison its atmos- 
phere—namely, natural, healthy cheerfulness—by un- 
necessary coercion and repression. But fantasy needs 
guidance, and the desires need a counterpoise. Both are 
procured by keener attention to the realities of things. 
In the case of children this means, in the first place, a 
keener seeing of things as they actually present them- 
selves. 
No instruction is adapted to boyhood but instruction 
through sense-perception. In our day, fortunately, one 
can not enter into detailed argument on so well known a 
point without becoming tedious. But sense-perception 
instructs in no other way than by actual, definite, undis- 
tracted, keenly apperceiving vision. Accurate observation 
of the differences of shape is the only security against 
confusion and substitution. So it is in natural history, in 
topography, and in every kind of imagination dependent 
on vision, needed by the artist and the artisan in order to 
represent to himself the component parts of an implement, 
a machine, or an edifice. 
In order, however, to draw every advantage that is pos- 
sible from a cultivated sense-perception we should, from 
the first, train not the eye only, but the other senses as 
well, the ear especially ; and further on, as a continuation 
to sensuous practice, we ought to cultivate every species 
of observation. This falls to general pedagogy. The 
A BC of Sense-Perception can only enter into such appli- 
cations as will supplement and convert into practical dex- 
terity its own teachings. These applications will be dis- 
cussed in the last section,
-P-A-G-E-173
  
MATHEMATICS THE KEY TO SENSE-PERCEPTION, 139 
ITI. The Cultivation of Sense-Perception falls within the 
Sphere of Mathematics. 
The contemplation of an object which is placed before 
us proceeds, to be sure, of itself without scientific aid; but 
when curiosity flags, sight becomes negligent and dull. 
Just at this point the embarrassment of the educator be- 
gins. From what direction can he get a hold upon vision ? 
How is he to set about directing it anew and persistently 
to the object until sense-perception has attained its com- 
plete maturity? That commands, incitements, and calls 
for “attention!”—the teacher’s habitual and momentary 
expedients—can never produce pure and genuine attention 
is self-evident. 
How to arouse and hold the attention is an important 
preliminary problem to all education. A little further on 
we shall have occasion to say something more general 
about it. The present inquiry relates to sense-perception 
only—to wit, to the apperception of form—which, as we 
have remarked, is to prevent immersion in individual 
colours. 
Let us consider, in the first place, the difference be- 
tween the crude and the mature sense-perception, in order 
to find what hope there is of changing the one into the 
other. 2 
Crude sense-perception happens involuntarily on the 
presentation of the object to an open eye. The mind can 
not then help seeing, being to that extent subject to Na- 
ture. This perception is perfect from the first. To a 
sound eye, the object at the first glance appears in the 
only way in which it can appear in its present light and 
in its. present position. Unfavourable conditions as to 
light and position are not the fault of the sense-perception. 
Neither is crude sense-perception improved by turning
-P-A-G-E-174

140 HERBART'S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
and twisting the object. We are speaking of improving 
the apperception, considered as an operation of the mind, 
in properly appropriating what is offered to it. As aman 
with his eyes open sees necessarily that which he sees, he 
would as necessarily retain the received picture unaltered 
in his memory if it were not for an influx of other im- 
pressions. 
But is it possible even to look around without perceiv- 
ing a complex mass of most diverse forms? Is it possible 
for a child that has been carried out for an hour’s airing 
to keep in any degree separate and unconfused the mani- 
fold sights it met with? What is similar coalesces, what 
is dissimilar conflicts; it cancels. The chaos that is left 
over gathers and accumulates from day to day, from year 
to year. Every novelty presented to us falls, in the first 
place, into this chaos. Whatever the memory desires to 
preserve clear and definite must be withdrawn from this 
chaos by a prolonged act of attention. Sense-perception 
without attention is crude, then, not because it represents 
the object incorrectly in the moment of vision, but be- 
cause it leaves only a wavering, dissolving image, no longer 
discriminate from other images of similar objects. By 
way of illustration, think of a dog, in general, without 
determining the species. Your presentation will attain 
no concreteness, for:a definite image would belong to some 
definite species. It is true that actual sense-perception is 
seldom erude to the degree of leaving an impression so very 
fluctuating and formless. We probably remember whether 
an actual dog we met was a greyhound or setter; but ney- 
ertheless, if one be unable to identify the particular grey- 
hound among a number of other greyhounds, the sense- 
image of the greyhound has been apperceived imperfectly. 
It has sustained injury within the imagination ; it has lost 
its definiteness, its distinctive marks, its individuality. 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  
MATHEMATICS THE KEY TO SENSE-PERCEPTION. 141 
To mature sense-perception this ought not to happen. 
It should have been prevented by a prolonged attention, 
rendering the first act of vision so vigorous as to make it 
impossible for the image to become disfigured. Attentive 
vision does not, in fact, cease till it has made sure of the 
image. Look at an animal, a person, or, better still, a 
map—for in the case of the latter the difficulties become 
more tangible by reason of the irregularity of the outline. 
Now turn away your glance, attempt to represent to your- 
self what you have seen. Look again—you will find the 
renewed sense-perception correcting the already distorted 
picture of the imagination. If you repeat this a few times, 
further sense-perception at lengtli refuses to correct the 
picture; the perception is now mature. From this process 
the keen vision of excited curiosity differs by nothing but 
greater rapidity. It is not interrupted. It does not re- 
linquish the object. The testing of the image and the 
renewal of sense-perception coincide. The moment dur- 
ing which the image would be distorted, were sight to re- 
linquish its object prior to the maturity of intuition, can 
not gain duration. 
What is seen is confirmed, therefore, inthe mind with- 
out art, provided the involuntary effect of the desire for 
an exact vision is long enough and strong enough. But 
the mere decision or general determination to become 
acquainted with an object is not as successful as the in- 
voluntary desire. He who does not see in the very instant 
that which he wills to see, sees as a rule but half, even 
with the best of intentions. If the object is large, if the 
forms are complicated, if the bulk of the gain did not 
occur in the first pleasurable excitement, exertion strains 
in vain. The shapes become but the more confused, the 
more distorted. A favourable moment must be awaited; 
only, the fitting time is not apt to last long.
-P-A-G-E-176
  142 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
And how much worse all this becomes in instruction! 
Even if one could always count upon the good intentions 
of the boy, the power of voluntary determination—i. e., the 
power of good intention—is incomparably weaker in the 
boy than in the man. Besides, instruction is obliged to 
advance simultaneously along different lines. Supposing 
a good plan of study, there is always manifestly great det- 
riment, when the different lines of progress do not coin- 
cide at the right time. But to complete the case: If the 
teacher is to guide onward simultaneously a whole school, 
must not we abandon the attempt of getting a hold upon 
the mind through the senses; the attempt at producing 
through the presentations of natural objects, instruments, 
plastic works, and pictures, a system of mature sense-per- 
ceptions and images, upon which to erect, as upon an es- 
sential part of its foundation, the edifice of instruction ? 
What if we had it in our power to make a beginning 
by controlling the sense-perceptions through the mind ? 
The thought may seem paradoxical. And yet we all know 
that the eye is nothing without the discipline of the mind ; 
that only through the latter have we learned to estimate 
distances; that the babe, though seeing an object, does 
not know how to grasp it; that we translate unceasingly 
the perspective appearances of things into their actual 
shapes. Perception finds easily, if the mind seeks under- 
standingly. We grasp differences sharply and sponta- 
neously, when we know beforehand what distinction is to 
be made. 
Supposing the possibility of first bringing the mind to 
the point of taking exact note of all the possible differ- 
ences in forms, it is entirely probable that the eye would 
afterward be sufficiently attentive to perceive the differ- 
ences where they exist. If we could only gain a boy’s pa- 
tience for that single thing, his curiosity would do the rest
-P-A-G-E-177
  
PEDAGOGICAL USE OF MATHEMATICS. 143 
as soon as it was even moderately interested in the objects 
presented. 
The question, therefore, is, How can forms, exclusive- 
ly as forms, be studied systematically? It is an almost 
equivalent question to ask, How can we teach sense-per- 
ception? For what we do systematically, we do in ac- 
cordance with concepts. And it is concepts alone that 
can be put with accuracy into words; that can be formu- 
lated into definite precepts, and can as such be trans- 
mitted from the teacher to the pupil. 
All that the greatest minds of all the ages have done 
toward the apperception of form through concepts, we find 
gathered into a single great science—mathematics. Above 
all, then, unless pedagogy is to risk exhausting itself in 
unavailing endeavours, it must first, for the indicated pur- 
pose, search among the treasures of mathematics. 
But pedagogy and mathematics are things often so 
widely separate in practice that we may the rather pre- 
sume, perhaps, upon the reader’s indulgence in detaining 
him upon a few preliminary observations before attempt- 
ing the problem itself. 
IV. On the Pedagogical Use of Mathematics. 
The conceptual field from which education antici- 
pated aid in solving the present problem is the best culti- 
vated among all the regions of human knowledge; doubt- 
less, because it is the most susceptible of culture. No 
other species of knowledge can so readily be raised to the 
rank of scientific demonstration as that which determines 
form by number, because these concepts are the most 
comprehensible of all. Mathematical science, therefore, is 
not only the most complete and the readiest to furnish 
aid, but its help is also pre-eminently welcome as being 
most closely related to the nature of human thought. 
12
-P-A-G-E-178
144 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
In fact, there exists in every mind, which, without a 
thorough knowledge of arithmetic and geometry, has 
familiarized itself with ideas and branches of knowledge 
that in their nature are later productions of human 
thought, a disproportion of development whose magnitude 
can be estimated most easily by a glance into history, 
showing how many preparatory stages had to be traversed 
in order to reach the one and how many to reach the 
other class of ideas. 
Though these observations are of some weight, there 
are reasons of far greater urgency to recommend to peda- 
gogy the use of mathematics. Reflection upon the follow- 
ing, though but briefly indicated, considerations may en- 
able the reader to judge whether it would be an exaggera- 
tion to call mathematics indispensable to the beginning, 
the middle, and the end of such instruction as the duties 
of education require of us. 
As to the beginning. In the first place, let us glance 
back at the preceding. It has been shown that we must 
through concepts gain control of the vision which is to 
fix the forms and which depends but imperfectly upon in- 
tentions and reflection, and for which definite description 
and direct communication and instruction are still less 
possible. These concepts, being concepts of magnitude, 
will belong to mathematics. Now, the educator will not, 
of course, disdain the aid which they perhaps may offer. 
Yet he will prefer to have his pupils become so disposed 
that sense-perception be brought at once by the first in- 
voluntary exactness and tenacity of attention surely and 
strongly to a maturity such as needs no further aids; and 
as the ultimate result of the exercises which we shall pro- 
pose, and which only at first will be somewhat in the na- 
ture of aids, we intend t> produce exactly such a predis- 
position in the case of sense-perception. But does the
-P-A-G-E-179
PEDAGOGICAL USE OF MATHEMATICS. 145 
demand for a predisposition to attention apply only to 
sense-perception? The educator needs it everywhere and 
always. Let him seek to obtain it universally. It will 
benefit sense-perception among other things. The fact is, 
sense-perception does not require attention by any means 
as much nor as absolutely and necessarily as do all matters 
of feeling—history, morals, religion—all that concerns 
mankind. ‘These are subjects where attention admits no 
adventitious aid. Here we lose not time only, not enjoy- 
ment only, but the marrow of education itself, if the 
freshness of first presentation ages without impressive- 
ness; if tasteless repetitions spin out tediously what should 
have seized upon the interest quickly; the very maxims 
and forms of expression in which the fulness of conviction 
loves to express and condense itself, are—misused and 
soulless—buried like corpses in the tombs of memory. 
Do you hope simply by the manner of presentation, by 
your personal conduct, to gain for these subjects that 
swift, toilless attention which is the mother of feeling? 
Much more will be obtained by preparations reaching 
back into the past. But a universal negative condition of 
success, in this as in every pedagogical endeavour, is that 
the pupil never permit himself to be inattentive when the 
teacher speaks. 
Inattention, however, is the natural condition of the 
learning boy. Were you not teaching him, his flow of 
presentations would not on that account rest. His play 
or, if he were denied that, his fancies would occupy him 
with all the vivacity of youthful spirit. They are repressed 
by instruction. Instruction, however, suffers in its turn 
from their importunity. 
In order to obtain power over them let it be the first 
care of instruction, not less than of the instructor’s per- 
sonality, to gain the respect of the pupil. Let the instruc-
-P-A-G-E-180
       
  146 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
tion proclaim itself, not in words, of course, but in deeds, 
as an absolute sovereignty of the understanding, by which 
one is hurried along inevitably, it being impossible to re- 
fuse a single step. Just as the educator must procure 
prompt obedience for every one of his express commands, 
so the instruction itself can not afford to have any of its 
assertions misunderstood, or to leave unnoticed or forgot- 
ten even its smallest qualifications. If such mistakes oc- 
cur, and at first they will happen every moment, they must 
surely and wholly betray themselves. On the other hand, 
they must lie bare to inquiry; it must be impossible to 
cover them up, to cloak them, or to minimize them. Even 
the magnitude of the mistake must be undeniable, must 
manifest itself in measure and number. Inwardly, on the 
other hand, the mistakes must make themselves felt by 
the consciousness of striking embarrassment. Complete 
incomprehensibility must at once darken suddenly the 
brightness of light; everything must fail; no device must 
succeed so long as the mistake remains. Everything must 
at once return to the secure and even tenor of its way as 
soon as the fault has been removed. Every self-deception, 
pretending to understand what it does not understand, to 
be conversant with that with which it is not conversant, 
must thus come to light. The weakness of his logic must 
be plainly evident to the pupil; but not only his weak- 
ness, also his strength, and his capacity for development 
such an instruction must show him. It must lead him to 
demonstrate them to himself by his deeds. That which 
seemed incomprehensible, unattainable, that before which 
his mental powers stood still, must become perfectly clear, 
and clearness must lead to perfect ease of execution. 
All these traits will be recognised at once as belonging 
only to mathematics. Yet we may be permitted first to 
review the remaining subjects of instruction, so as to see 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  PEDAGOGICAL USE OF MATHEMATICS, 147 
whether the other branches are able, each as its own fruit- 
age, to generate the authority which they need, to say the 
least, as much, or whether they require to have this fruit- 
age grown on the stem of mathematics, for transference to 
them. 
The subjects appealing to the feelings are too tender, 
too easily injured, and of too high a dignity to be obliged 
to undergo the rude task of combating boyish inattention. 
Let them peacefully dwell nearest the heart. Like femi- 
nine beauties, they should be carefully fostered. Their 
charms require attention—charms which must not wither. 
Linguistic studies, geography, and natural history are 
matters of memory. They must be made the subjects of 
a variety of quizzes and reviews. They bear the appear- 
ance, therefore, of being well suited for the training of 
the attention. Unfortunately, however, these subjects as 
a rule become interesting and useful only to one equipped 
with a good memory for them, who, experiencing nothing 
of the painfulness of retention, enjoys the ease with which 
he runs through the complex variety, as one enjoys a dis- 
tant and variegated view. But to one to whom this view 
lies plunged in mist, who slowly recalls the details, anx- 
iously counting piece by piece that he may lose nothing, 
the multiplicity of names becomes the more repugnant 
the greater the number of quizzes and reviews. It is true 
the names are gradually fixed in the memory, but the fixa- 
tion is not a sensible gain. Knowledge does not by this 
means grow. It does not push on. It does not reach out 
round about it. It unriddles nothing. It does not en- 
hance the fulness of thought as is done by mathematical 
insight, which increases even by a mere dwelling upon the 
problem. 
Chemistry alone, perhaps, does approach somewhat 
more nearly to this insight. The science of chemistry in

    | 
148 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
its present state is probably as yet altogether too recent 
for its pedagogical powers to haye been noted sufficiently. 
It deals with a number of combinations whose transmuta- 
tions, presupposing a knowledge of affinities, the student 
can find by his own reflection. Partly in this respect and 
partly in respect to the consequences derivable from ex- 
periments, chemistry offers to the pupil riches by self- 
occupation—a charm which is heightened by the uncer- 
tainty, by the semi-darkness in which light in many 
places is rather dawn than day. When one has a pupil 
on whom this charm seizes, and for whom it is needful, 
such a science, happily bringing to its disciple both re- 
ward and labour, should be warmly welcomed. Because 
it rather easily admits of test questions, and because it re- 
yeals any lack of attention by many wrong results, it may 
at times, for the purpose that we are considering, be even 
preferable to mathematics. Nevertheless, there is this in- 
convenience, in schools especially, that one has to show 
too many materials, and that one can not venture to leave 
them to the uncontrolled spontaneity of children, but is 
obliged to withdraw them almost altogether from their 
hands. In the worst case, when the teacher is restricted 
to merely relating all the experiments, this science be- 
comes completely unserviceable. To conclude, chemistry 
is not a science for children, because it does not lie within 
the horizon of common sensuous observation. It presup- 
poses a way of looking at nature which is broadened by a 
variety of information. Therefore what we have said above 
as to its being preferable under certain circumstances to 
mathematics applies only, but in this case with full force, 
to youths whose attention, from lack of earlier correct 
guidance, has as yet attained no steadiness, and hence still 
requires separate measures for making it firm and robust. 
But form and number are at the very centre of our
-P-A-G-E-183
PEDAGOGICAL USE OF MATHEMATICS. 149 
original mental horizon. The elements of measuring and 
reckoning are the most natural—the first, the almost un- 
avoidable pre-exercises, which even the weakest under- 
standing procures for itself spontaneously. Subsequent 
mathematical elaboration connects most closely with these 
elements, and gradually proceeds from them by unbroken 
sequence. On concepts of magnitude, above all, the 
teacher is able to attain himself and to require of the 
pupil perfect verbal expression. In mathematics nothing 
eludes language, nothing need be avoided in the details 
of discussion. There are no emotions to spare, there is no 
tedium to fear, unless the subject be treated beneath its 
dignity. Here, then, in the place where we find the means 
of cultivating sense-perception, we must seek also what is 
to be found nowhere else—namely, the guiding thread for 
an early instruction of children that shall be of such a 
quality as to procure, both for itself and all other teach- 
ing, an authority at whose behest inattention shall flee 
and attention come and persist. 
The considerations so far presented upon the impor- 
tance of mathematics for the beginnings of education are 
strictly appropriate here. They relate immediately to the 
A BC of Sense-Perception—not, it is true, as to its pur- 
pose, the cultivation of sense-perception, but as to the 
material which belongs to mathematics. The subsequent 
remarks, upon the other hand, on the indispensability of 
mathematical science for the middle and the end of edu- 
cation, deserve a place here only to the extent that they 
give occasion for casting a glance from the A B OC of 
Sense-Perception at the whole field of education. For it 
certainly is necessary that in considering even the smallest 
portion the educator should have in mind the whole. If 
he pursue any one idea singly, the gain oozes away because 
it is not taken up, and the other measures of instruction
-P-A-G-E-184

150 HERBART’S A BC OF dled hl cstrion. 
| are unprofitably restricted and confused. The idea of the 
plan must be in perfectly equal bal That is the 
only salvation for the works of an art which is more than 
others exposed to the most untoward accidents. But thus 
also there is hope of controlling the accidents, since fate 
acts by single impacts which often cancel each other, 
while art commands a system of forces which pursue the 
same purpose through a considerable series of years. 
As to the middle portion of education, everything 
might be repeated that has ever been said concerning the 
usefulness of mathematics for the cultivation of the mind. 
Being a gymnastics of the thinking powers, needful even 
in the earlier years of childhood, shall we be able to dis- 
pense with it later on? The mind as well as the body 
must from time to time return to its gymnasia in order to 
test its muscles and to renew their perfect elasticity. Add 
to this, the influence of mathematics on the remaining 
sciences. Without it, what becomes of physics, of knowl- 
edge in the arts and of machinery? But these reasons, 
though they be long since recognised, have little effect 
upon pedagogists. That very field of instruction toward 
which the noble science is directed with the greatest 
effect, interests them the least, namely, the investigation 
of nature; and for purposes of instruction they employ 
any other information concerning nature rather than the 
mathematical. Let those versed in the matter repeat to 
them ever so often that without this means of education 
everything drops apart into miserable fragments, they still 
confide in these fragments as having a power of serving in 
an incomprehensibly useful manner for youthful—let us 
say—diversions. The cardinal fault seems to be that we 
have not yet assigned to the investigation of nature its 
true place and rank among the forces that must co-operate 
in the mind of an educated person, and hence in a mind
-P-A-G-E-185
PEDAGOGICAL USE OF MATHEMATICS. 151 
that is being educated. Whenever this is done, Mathe- 
matics, the indispensable handmaid, will also soon be put 
in possession of her rights; and an external mark of her 
actual possession will be that we shall no longer await the 
last years of instruction in order to scatter a few forlorn 
samples of the long ignored mathematical science, samples 
which, being deprived of all introduction and connection, 
nauseate the student with tedium, and hence are inevitably 
surrendered by him to swift oblivion; but that there will 
be assigned, on the contrary, to geometry and lower alge- 
bra such a place in the middle of instruction as will artic- 
ulate them with proper preparatory exercises and enable 
them to extend a real influence through all the subsequent 
instruction of youth. 
As regards the finishing time of education, among sey- 
eral reflections here, too, urgently calling for the aid of 
mathematics, there arises a principal one, the essence of 
which may be briefly indicated by saying: The true per- 
fecter of education is philosophy; but the office of math- 
ematics is to obviate the dangers of philosophy. 
It is in the nature of Philosophy to isolate general con- 
cepts and to remove them for a time out of the sphere of 
their actual applicability. It is its first and indispensable 
office to separate and purify the concept which she singles 
out for investigation from the adventitious qualities and 
modes connected with it in the mass of data out of which 
she sets it forth. The concept thus stripped gains clear- 
ness and definiteness at the simultaneous expense of the 
disappearance of the limits within which, and of the con- 
ditions upon which, it had reality. True, this lack of limi- 
tation is, in fact, an absence of any idea of magnitude. 
Thus, apart from its conditions, the concept ought to be 
viewed merely as a subject of thought; being and non- 
being are not to be predicated of it.
-P-A-G-E-186
  152 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
But by an extremely frequent co’ Irosion there is sub- 
stituted, for lack of limitation, infinitude, or else univer- 
sality and perfection; making of this disregard of condi- 
tions either unconditioned reality—that is, absolute being 
—or logical impossibility ; the latter when the contradic- 
tions reveal themselves which must inevitably originate 
in aconcept that is torn out of its necessary connection. 
Occasionally we meet with the really ridiculous case of the 
last two mistakes, although cancelling each other, being 
committed by one and the same thinker, who, while ac- 
knowledging contradictions inherent in his concept, nev- 
ertheless ascribes to the concept unconditioned reality. 
It is really these inherent contradictions which ought 
to be motives for the progress of reasoning, for when de- 
termined sharply enough they are bound to teach us how 
to discover the complement which the concept lost when 
abstracted from actuality, or the series of complements, if 
several of them existed. The investigation being abso- 
lutely complete, the contradictions will be removed as com- 
pletely, because, in connection with the complements the 
concept did have reality, and to ascribe inherent contra- 
dictions to a reality would be the acme of self-contradic- 
tory nonsense and the destruction of all thinking. Such 
philosophical integrations would be to the well-known 
mathematical integration as genus to species. It is true 
that in mathematics we never hear about those inherent 
contradictions, but they can be shown immediately in any 
differential, if we will ignore for a moment what the 
mathematician never forgets, namely, that the differential 
is necessarily connected with its integral. 
It is self-evident that the procedure which we have 
indicated would fulfil the main purpose of all theoret- 
ical philosophy. For the necessary connection of all data 
would become manifest by our finding upon investigation  
-P-A-G-E-187
  
PEDAGOGICAL USE OF MATHEMATICS. 453 
that the isolation of concepts is impossible, that each re- 
quires the other in order to fuse with it into a single whole. 
As yet, unfortunately, it is the mathematical species of in- 
tegration almost alone which prevents the whole genus 
from being an empty name. That species already flour- 
ishes and thrives excellently. It is the highest glory of 
speculation. Hence, also, it is naturally the sole prototype 
for any future labours in philosophy, and the sole prelimi- 
nary exercise for youth, even if we intend to do no more 
than make clear to them the defects in philosophical at- 
tempts which have hitherto been made. 
However detrimental the mistakes likely to attach 
themselves to the failure to notice conditions become to 
theoretical philosophy, the forgetfulness of limits is bene- 
ficial in practical philosophy. The heart, oppressed by the 
limitations, expands the unfettered concept into a genu- 
inely Platonic idea. The concept becomes infinite ; it be- 
comes perfect. To think perfection is the happiness of 
the spirit and the origin of the better life. Truth, beauty, 
goodness—these ideas are born so. What is actual, Plato 
says, desires to resemble them, but it can not. But it is 
this that a noble enthusiasm does not quietly suffer; it is 
this that impels and that ought to impel it to help the 
actual by strenuous exertions to approach the ideal. 
It is precisely at this lofty elevation that the great 
dangers of philosophy begin. Does the impulse to act 
need nothing but the idea of the good in order actual- 
ly to attain the good? Does zeal need no bridle? Does 
the weight need no pendulum, preserving rhythm and 
measure ? 
These questions our age answers and comments upon 
plainly enough. But it speaks less plainly concerning the 
remedy of the evils, concerning the complement which 
education, while quickening and firing youth through  
-P-A-G-E-188
  154 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
philosophy, must needs articulate with the latter that it 
may not spur him beyond all bounds. 
This complement can be found nowhere but in the 
field of ideas. The mind elated with ideals despises all 
external constraint. It defies, hurls back the threat with 
its entire strength. What holds back the mind must 
ruin it in order to be secure from it. This type of spirit 
the educator recognises even in the boy, and when he 
meets it he rejoices greatly; for out of this species of 
wildness is formed by education the most beautiful, the 
most willing, the most faithful obedience. It tames itself 
as soon as we teach it that it should, not that it must, do 
so, and how it can do so. 
Do not destroy the noble zeal which causes you anxi- 
ety, but habituate the youth to look upon the things of 
this world as only gradually capable of conformation to 
the good. Habituate him to look upon them as magni- 
tudes and upon their changes as functions of the motor 
forces, or, in other words, as necessary results of efficient 
causes, absolutely accordant to law, despite all apparent 
irregularity, and perfectly definite in every step of their 
progress. Show him that wherever knowledge has pene- 
trated the phantom of irregularity has vanished, and that 
knowledge has progressed successfully wherever it has 
sought for magnitude and measure. Lay bare to him the 
ridiculous conceit of ignorance inclined in the past and 
inclined to-day to deny the existence of law unless it be 
manifestly obvious. Reveal to him the wonders of analy- 
sis. Teach him how the uniform progress of the abscissa 
controls surely and accurately all the bendings, turns, and 
nodes of the manifold curves. Show him how heedfully the 
swift hyperbola shoots along its asymptote so as never to 
touch though eternally approaching it. Show him how 
even the infinitely small angle of curvature which eludes 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
PEDAGOGICAL USE OF MATHEMATICS, 155 
all number, all measure, can not escape comparative com- 
putation and determination. Teach him how to compre- 
hend this marvel. Let him seek and find for himself 
how all these concepts of magnitude connect together and 
are produced by one another. Let him discover them in 
nature, and so let him perceive that all these curious curves 
serve but as symbols for the host of movements and changes 
which in the actual world go on before his eyes. Thus 
he will learn how to observe. Even where law is invisible 
to him, he will seek it nevertheless; at least presuppose 
it. Against this law, whether known or unknown, he will 
surely abstain from flying into passionate fury. He will 
realize that in the actual world the question is not what 
he wishes, but what, by very different rules, follows from 
his act. He will cautiously accommodate himself to these 
rules. The rules themselves he will endeavour to intro- 
duce into the service of that preconceived idea of the 
good, and to retain them in it. He will thus view man 
also as nature, and as a nature amenable to culture, de- 
spite all chimeras of a radical good and evil. In all this fear 
nothing of materialism! The scholar knows his general 
concepts of magnitude too thoroughly to forget that in 
respect to them the concept of matter is as accidental a 
one as that of mind. Moreover, daily experience, which he 
never loses sight of, will guard him sufficiently against 
commingling unlawfully such different applications of the 
same theory. 
Thus much for matters that seem so very distant from 
the A B C of Sense-Perception, though, to be sure, they 
are not; for, to enable us to attain these higher purposes, 
the A B C is necessary. The use of the integral calculus 
by the youth will never amount to anything unless the 
boy was well grounded in his elementary exercises. 
It remains to add something in respect to pedagogical 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  my 
  156 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
economy. Financial objections destroy the finest plans.. For 
the pedagogist, time is the costly possession to be carefully 
husbanded in distribution to the various occupations that 
present claims to it. Suppose that we have proved the 
indispensability of mathematics to a complete education 
as irrefragably as any mathematical theorem itself. Still 
that which is immediately necessary in life, in business 
vocations, enforces claims both older and more impera- 
tive. Moral culture by its very nature is under the espe- 
cial protection of the educator. In its aid we can not 
avoid introducing some things esthetically beautiful, not 
to mention the smuggling routes by which the commodi- 
ties of mental luxury spontaneously introduce themselves. 
Finally, and above all, we can not escape providing for 
that information whose absence would betray a vulgar 
ignorance. When all this, well analyzed into its divisions 
and subdivisions, is, as it were, set forth in a tabulation 
side by side, in order to separate the most necessary from 
the less needful and to assign to each its year and hour, 
the pedagogist can not help being frightened at the fear- 
ful amount. Nor can he help pitying himself and the 
poor brain of his pupil into which so many and such 
heterogeneous things require to be crowded. The pros- 
pect becomes altogether gloomy when we recollect that, 
after all, what is termed science originated in the first 
place in a real and invaluable intellectual pleasure of the 
discoverer, whence to cheer and elevate the mind remains 
the true purpose of science; and now when all these 
benefits are about to impress hourly the brain of the boy, 
not only will the brain be oppressed by them, but the 
heart also, the deeper, delicate, sympathetic sensibility, 
will be strained, pulled, and dragged by them in the most 
opposite directions. For, necessarily, pleasure in any one 
study must cause its opposite in so many others which
-P-A-G-E-191
  
PEDAGOGICAL USE OF MATHEMATICS. 157 
interfere as disturbances. With the bolder mind, unwil- 
ling to submit to this division of his feelings, education 
must be at continual war. On the beautiful and gentle 
soul, which will not pardon to itself any lack of docility, 
education will inflict an uninterrupted series of injuries. 
Instead of helping the rising ideas, education will destroy 
them one by another. Instead of enlivening the feelings 
with a warmth ever new, it will chill and kill them one 
by another. 
If the author were to mention the starting point of a 
pedagogical insight that reaches to the foundations of edu- 
cation, he would say it is profound reflection on this truth. 
It is such a reflection by which Pestalozzi is urged to seek 
for definite series in instruction, and to such a reflection 
we owe his A B CO of Sense-Perception. 
He who really knows the mathematics of which we 
are speaking, he who has not only learned it, but who has 
tasted, as it were, the feeling it is capable of affording, can 
not possibly counsel that it be forced additionally upon 
youths that have already accommodated themselves to the 
usual course of instruction, with such interest as is pos- 
sible for the latter. The state of the feelings in mathe- 
matical thinking differs too widely from the mental tone 
of one seeking with youthful hope philosophic wisdom, or 
lovingly investigating ancient history, or giving himself 
up to the songs of the poets. hese states of feeling are 
not changeable from hour to hour, like clothes. Students, 
whose interest has become fractionally excited for all these 
and for several other branches, would feel only still more 
confused by the priestess of definiteness and clearness— 
Mathematics. They would be completely at a loss which 
side to turn to. Perfectly passive obedience to their teach- 
ers would be their sole refuge. 
But this whole way of thinking on the subjects of in-   
 
-P-A-G-E-192
Pere eer yer ain enn et tt eee eee Me ee 
| 158 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
struction as of a mass with mutually extraneous parts, a 
way of thinking followed by pedagogical theorists—not, to 
be sure, systematically, but very commonly—is radically 
wrong. The opposition is somewhat like that in physics 
between the atomistic and dynamic systems. According 
to the latter, it is far from true that the whole quantity of 
matter in space is mutually excluding. So, likewise, the 
pupil’s mind should not give up as many separate ener- 
gies, as many little pieces of his total capacity to learn as 
acts of apperception are required in instruction. On the 
contrary, his capacity of learning is an intensive magnitude 
to be constantly occupied upon a corresponding solidity of 
instruction in a continual effort. We can not here do what 
is really needful—namely, explicate this with speculative 
precision. But this much will be seen easily: First, that 
there is no more advantageous way of escaping from the — 
embarrassment caused by the lack of time and multifari- 
ousness of instruction than by increasing and strengthen- 
ing the intrinsic content and weightiness of that which is 
taught every hour, for by this means a great many of the 
divisions and subdivisions before made will disappear by 
condensation ; second, that every hour of solid instruction 
bequeaths energy to the pupil’s mind, and that one ought 
to conserve the energies generated by different species of 
instruction, and to this end to guard them from feeling 
and acting against each other; otherwise there will be 
caused that conflict of emotions and that intellectual stu- 
pefaction which exclude all independence of character ; 
third, that, on the contrary, we ought to use energies 
that have been generated unitedly and to the greatest pos- 
sible advantage, in order thus to win more and more en- 
ergy; fourth, that, as a consequence, in distributing in- 
struction by years and hours we should above all consider 
which of these forces are the most serviceable and the
-P-A-G-E-193
  
PEDAGOGICAL USE OF MATHEMATICS, 159 
strongest, in order, in the first place and with the greatest 
care, to procure these. The whole course should be so 
arranged as never to let any energy lie fallow, but, on the 
contrary, so as to cause all previously generated energies 
to act in all succeeding time with their full force at every 
stage. 
If this be the calculation, mathematics is sure to find 
room enough in the programme of studies. 
We shall grudge to it neither its constituting, at 
three different periods, a principal branch of instruc- 
tion, nor its being kept present to the mind and increas- 
ing in familiarity during the intervals by interpolated 
exercises. 
Not counting the earliest exercises in numeration, 
measuring, etc., mathematics will make its first appear- 
ance at the eighth, ninth, or tenth year, in the form of 
the A B C of Sense-Perception, and require a period of 
about three fourths of a year, one lesson daily and a few 
hours’ practice. At the twelfth, the thirteenth, or the 
fourteenth year, a period of a year and a half, and again 
one lesson daily ought to be sufficient to make arithmetic, 
geometry, trigonometry, and lower algebra perfectly plain 
to a student who has been prepared by the ABC. Finally, 
at the end of the eighteenth, the nineteenth, or the twen- 
tieth year, higher analysis, again allowing a period of a 
year and a half and a lesson daily, would complete the 
study as far as any but a professional mathematician would 
care to master it, as a means to further culture and for use 
in the course of life. This approximate estimate considers 
pure mathematics only. As far as pedagogy is concerned, 
applied mathematics always pertains to the realm of its 
subject-matter. 
But the lessons must not be given less frequently than 
once a day if we wish to count upon anything like the 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  160 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
necessary mental concentration being maintained by the 
student. 
As for the exercises to be interspersed in the intervals, 
the other branches of instruction will offer a multiplicity 
of opportunities. 
V. Some Observations on the Exposition of Mathematics 
for Educative Purposes. 
If it intends actually to furnish the previously men- 
tioned advantages to the education of youth, mathematics 
will fall into line with the other co-operative agents as 
sociably, as'amicably, as possible. It certainly will bring 
with it all its real dignity, and it will show it all. But it 
will fain avoid all peculiarities that are accidental. As 
far as possible it will speak and act like the others. Where 
itseeks to improve their conduct it will guide it back to 
Nature. But it will not seek to bring in new fashions, or 
to put new restraints and stiff mannerism in the place of 
the old. Assuredly it will never renounce the preciseness 
of its peculiar diction. But the higher the rank which is 
granted to it on that score, the more carefully it will watch 
that its diction shall ever be real precision. It will take 
heed lest it be proved that mathematics by its technical 
language lulled itself into thoughtlessness, and performed 
its work asleep and mechanically. It would still be great 
Homer sleeping ; but Homer would cease to be a model 
for those reverently listening for the sound of his voice. 
To speak more definitely : In order to furnish prepara- 
tory exercise in thinking, mathematical reasoning must 
not be a peculiar kind of thinking, but it must follow the 
course naturally and universally taken by a sound under- 
standing which is not hindered in its reflections by acci- 
dental disturbances.  
-P-A-G-E-195
MATHEMATICS FOR EDUCATIVE PURPOSES. 161 
Now, it is the way of a sound understanding first to 
look about it from the point whence it desires to progress, 
so as to survey the whole field for the purpose of orienta- 
tion. In the next place, it is its habit to take the shortest 
way to its goal and to remain always conscious of its bear- 
ings. Finally, having reached the goal, it is wont to look 
about once more in order to familiarize itself with the 
new neighbourhood which now surrounds it. 
Conformably to the use of language, we may with espe- 
cial propriety ascribe the survey to the imagination and 
the progressing to the understanding. 
It is obvious at once how thoroughly applicable the 
distinction is to mathematics. That great science gives to 
the imagination at least as much occupation as to the 
faculty for drawing conclusions. Before the latter can 
commence to demonstrate, the former must have sketched 
the figures, it must have pierced the bodies by manifold 
lines and intersected them by planes, it must have 
stretched out the infinite series, it must have interwoven 
them with other series. All the plenitude of combinatory 
presentations pertains to the imagination. The merely 
progressive understanding would creep with sad slowness 
from element to element. It is precisely the general view 
of the series and of the different values of a variable 
magnitude that is most difficult to a beginner in analysis. 
The pupils have conquered roots and logarithms as soon 
as they can present to their minds with ease the accel- 
erated increase of the powers simultaneously with the 
uniform increments of the roots or exponents, and the 
increasing compactness and simplicity of the loga- 
rithms simultaneously with the uniform growth of the 
roots. 
What is the result when, without preparing and accus- 
toming the pupil to a general survey, there is used in a
-P-A-G-E-196
  162 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
computation, say, an isolated root or an isolated logarithm, 
or even, if you like, a few of them, but of whose necessary 
ratio to each other the student forms no conception? Do 
not you feel how timidly, how anxiously your pupil is 
compelled to proceed on the narrow rope of the rule, his 
eyes clinging to his feet exclusively? And what becomes 
of the case when we heap up a multitude of general 
theorems concerning things so unfamiliar? We are com- 
pelled, in order to give some measure of assistance, to 
waste time by numerous examples which, nevertheless, 
being far too isolated in the wide sphere of the concept, 
bring but little gain to insight. 
On the contrary, make it your first law of presentation 
not to neglect the mathematical imagination. arly ha- 
bituate the imagination swiftly to run along the entire 
continuous series contained under a general concept—a 
rule of great influence even in very different kinds of in- 
struction. It follows from this that we should from the 
very beginning, as far as possible, so teach as to cause all 
magnitudes to be considered as fluctional. This will ex- 
cite a desire for the whole of mathematics. 
Neither is it a matter of indifference what material is 
first presented to the imagination. It must be easy to 
work up, and its working up must be of the greatest pos- 
sible advantage to all future study. There is nothing 
that, so to speak, seems to lie so nearly at the centre of 
mathematics as trigonometry. The consideration of tri- 
angles is fundamental to all geometry; and pure analysis, 
which, strictly speaking, has nothing in common with con- 
cepts of space, would frequently not know where to turn 
in integrating if it did not borrow sequences of propor- 
tions from trigonometry. This consideration alone would 
make it desirable, provided always that we found it com- 
patible with the other purposes of the A B C of Sense-
-P-A-G-E-197
MATHEMATICS FOR EDUCATIVE PURPOSES. 163 
Perception, that triangles should become the first subject 
for mathematical exercises. 
As concerns, in the second place, the relation of 
mathematics to the understanding, may the great science 
pardon its admirer if he do not, in this respect, find it 
as perfect for the purpose of mental culture, its noblest 
use, as it must indeed become. It is not that mathe- 
matics lacks extent, or certainty, or conciseness. But it 
does lack systematic elegance and philosophical perspicu- 
ity. Every defect of the sort becomes most disagreeably 
noticeable, most disadvantageously important in pedagog- 
ical use; since for this use not the results are important 
nor their reliability, but the thinking, and its exemplari- 
ness of procedure. 
Close speculative thinking admits no arbitrariness. It 
should contain neither more nor less than just so much 
as is needful to complete an immediate insight into the 
inner necessity of the theorem under discussion. All acts 
of arbitrariness are idiosyncrasies on the part of the in- 
ventors and instructors. They both delay universal com- 
munication and are unworthy of it. 
Mathematical analysis every moment allows itself lib- 
erties in the way of conveniences in which no precise 
method can possibly indulge. To prove a theorem by 
analysis, by resolution of the concepts, means to let one’s 
self be impelled by the given concepts themselves to the 
concepts that contain the inner necessity of the proposi- 
tion. But this necessity does not lie in arbitrary auxil- 
iary lines or in arbitrary computations. In fact, it is not 
discovered at all as long as there are two or several proofs 
making the matter equally plain. It is certain that that 
to which the given concepts impel, that which they can 
require, is only that which necessarily and essentially per- 
tains to the nature of the theorem. But, for this very
-P-A-G-E-198
  164 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, | 
reason, that which brought in the arbitrariness was not 
analysis. 
It is these cases of arbitrariness which render mathe- 
matical study difficult and spoil the pleasure that might 
be taken in it. The mind that wanted to sink into the 
depths of the subject itself is deflected and hurried hither 
and thither through a number of narrow, crooked bypaths. 
It loses the pure, speculative placidness, and when we 
reach the goal what have we gained? To be sure, we 
must believe the proof, for considered step by step there 
has been no logical slip. But not seeing through the whole, 
quite contrariwise, every separate step making a segregate 
thinking act, one would almost as willingly take one’s 
clever teacher’s word for it. It is the very man who is 
capable of admiring and honouring with true feeling the 
majestic course of pure speculation, and of recognising 
with true discrimination the contrast between it and empty, 
loose subtilties, concepts dragged about arbitrarily, and 
tautological or sophistical bawbles, whose attention it 
strikes most disagreeably when analysis, using a not very 
noble expression, speaks of devices by the aid of which 
one tangle of letters is converted into another, which, 
after a certain number of substitutions, of multiplications 
and divisions by entirely foreign magnitudes, and of equa- 
tions shuttled hither and thither, is ready to be cut by a 
sword fetched forth from some corner of the armory. 
Frequently the resulting equation is so simple as to excite 
a suspicion that the whole labyrinth of computations, in 
which one forgets one’s problem in order to solve it, can 
hardly belong essentially to the science. 
An excellent instance of improvement fully answering 
the strict systematic requirements is furnished by the com- 
binatory demonstration of the binomial and polynomial 
theorems, which we owe to Mr. Hindenburg. But if we  
-P-A-G-E-199
MATHEMATICS FOR EDUCATIVE PURPOSES. 165 
were to have an entire change, many a debt of long stand- 
ing would have to be first liquidated on the part of meta- 
physics. Especially there would have to cease by its 
influence the still very strong prejudice against the con- 
cept of Infinitude, by which our mathematicians are in- 
fluenced in their attempts at explaining to their pupils 
without that cardinal concept what to the very inventors 
became accessible only through it. Nevertheless, by bet- 
ter explication and arrangement, instruction may even 
now remedy a multitude of smaller evils. It seemed the 
more necessary to point this out here, as we have strongly 
appealed to pedagogy for a fuller trust in mathematics as 
one of the chief forces in education. 
First Srctron. 
ON THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ABC OF SENSE- 
PERCEPTION. 
Summing up the reflections set forth in the introduc- 
tion, a threefold purpose is shown of the elementary exer- 
cises which are the object of our search. They are to 
train sense-perception, to assist education, and to prepare 
for mathematics. Their arrangement will not be com- 
pletely determined, therefore, until we reach a combination 
that will include all of the considerations which are sug- 
gested by each of those three purposes. As a preliminary, 
each must be weighed separately. But in order to a suit- 
able combination of the results, in order to avoid any ap- 
pearance of a conflict that might seduce us into concluding 
a treaty of limitations in the place of an amicable union, 
we shall have to expend a moment upon the question, Just 
what should each of the three purposes in view decide as 
to the arrangement of preliminary exercises? 
The cultivation of sense-perception is presented of
-P-A-G-E-200
  166 HERBARI’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
itself as a duty of education. But our introduction was 
needed to show the bond connecting sense-perception and 
education with mathematics. As between sense-percep- 
tion and mathematics, this, so far, is a very loose bond. 
Only the very general conclusion, namely, What is done 
according to plan is done according to concepts, pointed, 
from the necessity of systematically caring for the com- 
pleteness of sense-perceptions, to the science which elabo- 
rates the concepts of intuition. If there was to be a teach- 
ing of sense-perception, it was clear that this, like all real 
teaching, would have to consist in a transmission of con- 
cepts. Still it remained obscure whether and to what ex- 
tent it would be possible to place the plasticity of sense- 
perception under the control of instruction. How could 
it help remaining obscure, as long as we had not more 
profoundly investigated the nature of intuition? But it 
was not the business of the introduction to do so. It will 
be the most essential element in the investigations which 
we are now about to enter upon. 
This investigation will, then, in the first place, deter- 
mine the material for our preliminary exercises. To bring 
this material under concepts, and to convert the latter into 
theorems, will, in the second place, be our requirement of 
mathematics. We expect a preliminary reply containing 
a general promise; some information as to the way in 
which we may expect to be aided by mathematics; what 
it will give; what it will withhold; and how much regard 
it will have to itself in doing so. To conclude, pedagogy 
will indicate what external form it wishes for the whole, 
what conveniences it can proffer, and, on the other hand, 
what facilities it expects to be proffered to itself. Mathe- 
matics thus steps in between the sense-perception and 
education. The following considerations are arranged ac- 
cordingly :
-P-A-G-E-201
THE THEORY OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 167 
LI. Outlines of a Theory of Sense-Perception. 
This theory has nothing to do with external vision, its 
organ, light, ete. It is perfectly silent, therefore, on the 
subjects of perspective and optics. Just as little does it 
enter into the subject of xsthetic perception. It may, 
therefore, be very brief; for it only remains to explicate 
the act of sense-perception, the immediate mental percep- 
tion and fixation of what is visible. Only, be it borne in 
mind that the sense-perception here discussed is the per- 
ception of form—in other words, the synthesis of what is 
coloured. (See Introduction, first number.) We do not 
in the least discuss the question through what “ window ” 
things-in-themselves step into the soul. 
That which the eye sees is never simple. It has al- 
ways an extension of breadth and length, though not of 
thickness. We here merely recall these well-known prop- 
ositions. Now, upon a surface which in its extension is 
uniformly visible to the eye, the merely physical eye, con- 
sidered by itself, would receive uniform impression, and for 
that reason discriminate no forms; for a form is limited. 
In order to be seen it must be lifted forth out of that sur- 
face by a special act of attention. But there are some 
things in this plane more prominent than others, which is 
to say that one thing is perceived with greater or less 
strength than another. This inequality of perception may 
and really does vary. Sometimes there is more that is 
strongly perceived, sometimes less. Sometimes there is a 
tendency to concentrate vision on certain points. Again, 
the eye rambles; and then, again, it gathers up a.small 
portion of what it has contemplated in detail, then a larger, 
a still larger, and finally the whole. It is, without doubt, 
by such a synthesis of all the parts of a thing, and omis- 
sion of all other things that are simultaneously visible,

that the shape of a thing is found. But if, in addition, 
the relative positions of different things are to be found, 
the several syntheses which have been made and which 
can not be dissolved again, must be embraced in one new 
comprehension. Units already composite must combine 
in still greater units. The process may continue indefi- 
nitely. The pupil of the eye, the eyebrows, the eyelashes, 
etc., taken together, constitute the eye ; ears, nose, mouth, 
etc., together form the face; the face with the remaining 
members make the body ; and several persons together 
make a group. When we look at this group with a trained 
eye, we do not dwell uniformly upon the whole and ignore 
distinctions and limits. That would produce a chaos of 
colours, but not a well-articulated group of people. On the 
contrary, one synthesis lies for us within another, in the 
way that we have described. While looking, we form the 
eye separately, the nose separately, every person separately, 
finally we shape them all into a single group. 
Perhaps the reader is astonished at so complicated an 
activity, of which we are usually so little conscious. But 
astonishment will diminish upon remembering how imper- 
fectly, how bunglingly the operation is often performed. 
The artist, to be sure, accomplishes the articulation of 
forms completely. But the average beholder misses both 
beginning and end. He attains neither to that which is 
smallest nor to that which is greatest; wanderingly and 
indefinitely his vision hovers about midway, doubts as to 
division, doubts as to how it is to unite the divided. Be- 
cause he is struck with the demands which the object 
makes upon him, he imagines that it has pleased. But 
only the artist who masters his object enjoys it really. In 
some other instances, however, an unpractised eye yields 
itself to the pleasure of gliding up and down the gentle 
curvatures, thus playing over the shape and really in this

way enjoying the charm of the beautiful; «sthetic per- 
ception might, perhaps, better begin in the gliding vision 
rather than the effort to fix the apperception. Only it 
should not let that suffice. But the mistake of the un- 
trained beholder is revealed at once when he sits down to 
reduce his vision to a drawing. If he attempts what is 
natural, namely, reproducing as he has perceived ; if he 
attempts to have his pencil glide as gently and as gradu- 
ally as the eye did, it is impossible for him to avoid falling 
into considerable error at the first curve whose movement 
he desires to reproduce ; for at every point a curved line 
changes its course but infinitely little. Consequently, by 
proceeding from point to point infinitely small mistakes 
accrue in an infinite number, and thus slipping in un- 
noticed put the whole out of position. As a matter of 
fact, the gliding vision is not an apprehension of form. 
To a figure all its parts belong at once; therefore all claim 
a uniform notice. The unpractised draughtsman intended 
to let the terminal point of the curved line become the 
final result of all its windings; but instead of merely con- 
necting the point of beginning with the terminal point 
mediately by a line leading from one to the other, he 
should have apprehended their distance and their position 
with reference to the bend of the curvature at once and 
immediately. Thus, his curved line would have lain be- 
tween them in a fixed position. 
From what has been said, it is clear that the articula- 
tion of forms is very complicated, and therefore very diffi- 
cult work. To make it easy and accessible to all, it must 
be analyzed into its simplest constituents, that the details 
may be mastered first and recombined subsequently. 
Speaking technically, we analyze a combination, a large 
synthesis into lesser syntheses, and each of these into the 
least syntheses. This operation is the reverse of that

shown in the theory of combinations when it progresses 
by degrees from given and entirely simple elements to 
all the more and more composite combinations that can 
be made out of them. 
We need, therefore, here to insert the indispensable 
essentials of the general doctrine of nonrepetitive com- 
bination. Further instruction may be drawn from other 
books, as, for instance, Stahl’s Elements of the Doctrine 
of Combinations, Jena and Leipsic, 1800, pp. 72 ff. 
The given elements, whether actual things or numbers, 
or, as in the present case, coloured points, are customarily 
designated by letters. In order to represent the combina- 
tion in question in a short example, let a series be given 
of not more than five elements. Let them be lettered 
a, b, c,d, e. Of these there are combined first two, then 
three, then four, then all five.* All combinations thus 
possible are shown by the following table :

  PERMUTATIONS. 171 
Consider the table carefully, in order to see whether 
you would know how to set forth similarly all the com- 
binations if only the four elements a, b, c, d were given. 
Dropping e, we drop all combinations in which it occurs. 
But they are all placed vertically in the last column. It 
is therefore necessary only to omit this column. If to the 
four letters a, b,c, d the letter e be once more annexed 
add this column again. It is as easily apparent how the 
table would change if a sixth element, f, were added. 
Another column would have to be annexed, beginning 
above with f running through the paired class by putting 
af, bf, cf, df, ef vertically under each other; through the 
triple combination class by having abf, acf, etc.; and con- 
cluding at the extreme lower end by a newly added sixth 
class, containing for the present nothing but abcdef. It 
is plain that in the same manner a seventh element, g, 
would bring in a seventh column, an eighth element an 
eighth column ; that, in a word, all the possible combina- 
tions of no matter how large a number of things can be 
found on the plan indicated. 
As stated above, sense-perception, intending to appro- 
priate correctly the form of an object, must uniformly ap- 
perceive all the portions of the object—i. e., all the smallest 
places which might be termed apperception points. But 
there are innumerable points, and we intended facili- 
  
ground plan, or some such thing, upon which the objects, or, to 
speak exactly, the terminal points of the objects, are designated by 
letters indicating names written below. Where our table combines 
a couple of letters, take in the engraving the two designated points. 
But they can be combined only by giving attention to their relative 
position, or by drawing in thought the straight line possible between 
them, Similarly, where the following table combines three letters, 
take the three points indicated by them; they are found to inclose 
a definite triangle; four points a quadrangle, ete.

tating the task of apperception by analyzing it into its 
simplest constituent portions. There is, then, to precede 
the uniform apperception of all the points, the synthesis 
of a few points, in order to connect with them gradually 
several others. If we take the first points very close 
together, joining to them again the closely approximate 
points, and so on, till we have slowly gone from one end 
of the object to the other, the result will be the gliding, 
flowing vision, the disadvantages of which we have shown. 
On the contrary, then, the points first to be combined 
should be chosen as distant as possible, so as to fill up the 
intervening space step by step. It is in about this way 
that a draughtsman habitually proceeds, who first sketches 
the outermost contours, then indicates this thing and that 
scattered about in the middle space, and puts off till 
the last completing the connected filling in. Thus is as- 
sured to the picture correctness of position. But only 
the practised draughtsman secures it. The attempts of 
the beginner in sketching outlines are very uncertain, 
very toilsome, often tedious, and sometimes fruitless. 
The causes are readily apprehended. For him, the out- 
line is both too rich and too poor: too poor, because he 
has had no practice in analyzing the total view of the orig- 
inal, so as by stripping it of its charming features to leave 
only the pure contours; too rich, because the contours 
consist of lines—lines which always contain points innu- 
merable, and still furnish an infinitely large instead of a 
simple synthesis. Besides, there is persistence in the in- 
clination to see and to draw the lines of the contour free 
hand, and the faults thus originating are fatiguing to his 
patience. Before making any drawing, sense-perception 
should have been cultured and confirmed on the original, 
not on the scant, unattractive outline which is being 
sketched. In the original, sense-perception should have 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
COMPOSITION OF FORMS. 173 
searched out the truly simple and main constituents of 
the form. After imagination has completely mastered 
the shape of the whole by the aid of some constituent 
forms, it ought to fix within every smaller whole the still 
smaller units which are contained in each in a manner 
similar to that which was at first applied to the large 
unit. Not till now has the time come for recombining 
what was singled out. Let the bodies originate from the 
members, the groups from the bodies. Not till last of 
all is it time for the proof by pencil and chalk that im- 
agination’s grasp is firm enough and sense-perception 
complete. 
What are the simple, main constituents of form that 
are to be sought out in the original? An examination of 
our table of combinations will indicate them. Let us 
begin at the beginning. Unrelated points indicated by the 
single letters a, b, c, d are nothing for the purposes either 
of form or of measure. When related in pairs, as ab, ac, 
etc., they have between them a definite direction, a dis- 
tance, a straight line. This, to be sure, is something in 
the way of measurement, for a line contains a certain 
number of inches, feet, etc. But the form of all lines is 
the same, be they long or short. Or rather, even here 
there is as yet no form. Form is produced for the first 
time, and hence in the simplest manner, by the combina- 
tion of three points. When four or more are combined, 
previous combinations by threes are included. The lat- 
ter may be therefore regarded as the fundamental con- 
stituent parts of all the more composite forms. 
But as that which differs in measure and magnitude 
does not by that difference alone give us any form, let the 
reflection enter at once that, on the other hand, mere 
form determines no magnitude, as form remains the 
same whether it appears larger or smaller. A good por-

trait, even a miniature painting, has the same shape as 
its original. This distinction we shall find important 
later on. 
In order, then, to bring to maturity the apperception 
of a painting, let us say, we should take together in the 
first place, in the main contour, three simple points as 
distant as possible, and prominent as terminal points of 
the figure a, b, c, and then join with ab in the place of ¢ 
a fourth point, d; next, acd; and in the last place, bed, 
so as to exhaust all the triple combinations of the first 
four points—all this for the sake of having the exactest 
notice taken of the mutual positions of the three points in 
every, possible combination. In the next place we should 
add a fifth point, and later a sixth. Of the combina- 
tions possible with the first four points some, though 
for brevity not all, ought to be apperceived. We should 
scarcely need in addition to these a seventh or an eighth 
point. We should proceed only as far as suffices to fix 
the position of the whole main contour thoroughly in the 
imagination. In the case of some students this requires 
more, in the case of others less. In the next place, we 
should proceed to the contours of the parts, doing with 
them as we have done with the general outlines. The 
work should continue into the parts of parts to any extent 
that may seem advisable. Finally, in order to connect 
the smaller contours with the comprising larger contours, 
and all the subordinate contours with the general outline, 
it would only be necessary to combine the respective points 
into triangles in a similar manner. During this operation 
the table of combinations would serve for the prevention 
of confusion. By its means we keep our bearings among 
the multitudes of possibilities open to choice. By aid of 
the same table we might go on to fourfold, fivefold, mani- 
fold combinations. We should thus gradually seek to

guide the eye back again from the details to the uni- 
form apperception of the whole. 
But in order that we may be able thus to proceed, 
the presupposition must be made of an eye possessing 
ready skill in accurately apperceiving all the triangles— 
that is, every simple fundamental form—and of clearly 
discriminating them. For without such skill, obtained 
by previous practice, the many triangles originating in 
the process would not fail to run into fresh confusion 
among themselves. Unless there be previously acquired 
facility in the discrimination of triangular forms, the 
/many analyses of one simple view would only serve to 
render the eye timid and anxious. Besides, if the trian- 
_ gles which occur in sense-perception be not also simulta- 
neously thought under concepts, the teacher can not con- 
verse with the pupil concerning the object under observa- 
tion. By escaping expression in language, the accuracy 
or inaccuracy with which the pupil has seen the triangles 
would be inaccessible to inquiry. 
Hence we must premise to the above-described process 
a series. of preliminary exercises, rendering facile at one 
and the same time the apperception and the concepts of 
all triangular forms. Such is, if we may be permitted 
the expression, the deduction of our A B CO of Sense- 
Perception. It must be understood completely and con- 
nectedly if the reader is to be enabled to enter into the 
meaning of the present work. 
IT. On the Mathematical Determination of Elementary 
Forms. 
If the proof just given that the true elements of all 
form are triangles needed further confirmation, mathe- 
matics would bear witness to it by the procedure it has in- 
14

| 
variably observed. It strives to master all forms by the 
triangles existing or possible in them. 
These triangles mathematics is in the habit of render- 
ing perceptible to the senses by actual straight lines be- 
tween the terminal points. However, it is clear that these 
lines merely express the distances between the points; that 
what constitutes the triangle really is the relative position 
of the terminal points; that a somewhat practised eye can 
dispense with the sensuous objectification; and conse- 
quently that a picture or an outline which is to be apper- 
ceived by the eye would be quite wrongfully disfigured by 
actually drawing the triangles to be taken into contempla- 
tion. But, on the contrary, it is equally clear that ob- 
jectification is all the more needed in the preliminary 
exercises. Here the lines inclosing the triangle must be 
rendered absolutely evident to the eye. 
But the imagination is, by these preliminary exer- 
cises, to become familiar not merely with one or a few but 
with all possible triangles. It is to find an old acquain- 
tance in any position of three points that by any possi- 
bility can be presented to the eye. Still, is not this re- 
quirement infinite? In the expanse of space, can not we 
scatter about three points with unlimited arbitrariness in 
such a multiplicity of differences as immediately to put 
to shame any one who should pretend to know all possi- | 
ble positions ? 
He who in this argument should seriously appeal to 
the infinite expanse of space must have forgotten that size 
has nothing to do with form—an observation which re- 
duces very materially our belief in the manifoldness of 
possible triangular forms. 
They may as well be represented small as large. If 
one side of the triangle be a foot, then this may remain 
the same although the shape of the triangle is altered.
-P-A-G-E-211
TYPES OF TRIANGLES. WG 
On the contrary, if this side were to increase at the same 
ratio as the other sides, we should obtain, to be sure, 
other and still other magnitudes, but not any new shapes. 
Precisely that the shape may change, and precisely inas- 
much as it does so, it is necessary for one side to remain 
constant as the others increase or decrease. This excludes 
all triangles that are mere enlargements or reductions of 
one another. As far as form in them is concerned there 
is only one triangle ; on the other hand, the imagination 
must be practised to identify this one for any size. 
Nevertheless, the multitude of possible triangular forms 
remains infinite, but only in the sense that between two 
triangles already approximate there may always be con- 
structed infinitely many, infinitely proximate ones, mak- 
ing a continuous transition from the one to the other. 
The infinitely approximate triangles, to be sure, are no 
longer discriminated by the eye. But for this very rea- 
son it is possible to establish for sense-perception a cer- 
tain, not excessively large, number of model triangles, of 
which a pair will always offer a narrowly limited place 
between them for any occurring triangle. 
Throughout geometry we compare triangles to see 
whether they are equally determined by some of the an- 
gles and sides, and hence themselves equal. It being 
once determined by this means that they agree as to form 
and magnitude, or both, no further attention is given to 
the question what form they do and on the basis of the 
determining pieces must have. Of course, the eye sees it 
iin the drawing, but takes no notice of it, as the attention 
is not called to it. The real scientific enouncement of 
he form of a triangle does not belong to geometry ; it 
elongs to the later science of trigonometry. But the 
latter, though it certainly gives to the understanding gen- 
ral rules on the subject, does not give any correspond-

ing image to the imagination. The objectification of the 
teachings of trigonometry is left, then, for our exercises. 
Thus we have determined more clearly where in mathe- 
matics the means for cultivating sense-perception are to 
be found, and also the relation in which our preliminary 
exercises stand to the science. 
The triangle, in general, is the fundamental form for 
sense-perception. The right-angled triangle specifically 
furnishes to trigonometry the fundamental concepts for 
determining all the other triangles. This course must 
also be taken by our preliminary exercises in order that 
they may, as far as possible, conform to the science. 
As far as possible. But the true foundation of trigo- 
nometry is higher analysis, while we are constrained to bor- 
row our foundations from experience. We merely detect 
certain relations from empirical measurement, while by the 
science their necessity is demonstrated. We take, on the 
faith of imperfect inductions, certain propositions whose 
universality the science theoretically proves. 
Severity of demonstrations is inappropriate for smal 
boys; but all the more appropriate is the multifarious ob 
jectification of numbers, fractions, computations, constant: 
ly occasioned by the triangles. This occasion to confe 
greater clearness on arithmetic the teacher must utilize t 
his utmost possibility. 
We wish especially to observe that even here we shal 
be able to attain the advantage wished for in the intro: 
duction, of not representing individual magnitudes only 
but the whole multitude of triangles as in a series, in con 
tinuous transition. Even the meaning of the differential 
formule of trigonometry can be here anticipated sensu 
ously. 
We may hope, therefore, that by one and the same oc| 
cupation we shall be able to generate the mathematic

imagination, to give a preliminary training to the under- 
standing, and to excite an interest in the whole science. 
LIT. Pedagogical Considerations. 
After the experiments of Pestalozzi, one may trust a 
degree more readily that education will feel strong enough 
not to relegate well-founded plans with such exceeding 
quickness to the realms of pious wishes. Especially the ob- 
jectification of trigonometrical teaching is secured against 
every doubt which might otherwise be entertained as to 
its feasibility by the excellent effect of the quadrangles, 
circles, and horn-leayes in the Pestalozzian school. ‘The 
voluntary drawing upon slates, which in that school fur- 
nishes so happy an outlet for superfluous manual activity, 
must also render the earliest services to trigonometry. 
Horn-leaves, especially, are indispensable. They should 
receive the first rectangular triangles, and almost exclu- 
sively guide the boy to imitate them in drawing. Chil- 
dren who, like those of Pestalozzi, know how to draw a 
circle freehand, are fully prepared to receive the trigo- 
nometrical instruction by horn-leaves, and to fulfil its 
behests with sufficient accuracy. 
If it be desired, however, to utilize every advantage 
which education can by very early preparation provide, an 
exercise of the attention serviceable for the present pur- 
pose also is at least conceivable even for the earliest years 
of childhood. It can be tried, at least, without danger.* 
The experiment proposed would be about as follows: 
  
*Tt seems that not all readers have been kind enough to read 
exactly what was printed, though from the first edition everything 
appeared exactly as here, even to emphasizing “at least conceiv- 
able.” The following passage is from No, 82 of the Géttingischen 
Gel. Anz. of 1804: “One of Pestalozzi’s adherents forgot himself so 
far as to make the assertion that if only the attention of all babes

180 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
As soon as the child in the cradle shows attention to 
external objects, hang in a convenient place opposite the 
cradle a dark board: only, do not have it perfectly black, 
for this colour is avoided by the eye of the child ; rather 
have it speckled brownish. Underneath, before the board, 
fasten a bracket, likewise of a dark colour. Put upon it 
every day, not by any means variegated objects of many 
harshly contrasting colours, but simply things of merely 
bright colour and having a form agreeable and easily ap- 
prehended—something that is new daily, but with repeti- 
tions of what has preceded—an egg, an orange, a shrub 
having but few leaves, a well-shaped cup, a saucer, a pitch- 
er, glasses, boxes, watches ; later on some flowers, provided 
you do not crowd them; finally, if you please, a bust—a 
whole figure. Be careful not to be too generous with 
bouquets, many-coloured pictures, ete. The eye is to be 
exercised only moderately, receiving instruction in things 
that it can apprehend without confusion. In addition, 
however, to those objects, a few yellow nails may well find 
room on the board. Their metallic lustre will especially 
attract the eye. Three of them driven far apart suffice. 
The triangle which they form can be changed daily. Our 
elementary forms may thus become the child’s earliest ac- 
quaintances. 
The partly systematic, partly esthetic laws which domi- 
  
from the first days of their lives should be directed to bright points 
in order that they might firmly grasp the shape of the triangle, a 
concept upon which was based all the knowledge in the world, an 
improvement of the human species would follow, by which must 
vanish also those moral evils which have produced the French Revo- 
lution.” I wonder what have been the steps of growth in the myth 
of the [bright-headed] nails, enabling it in the brief time from 1802- 
1804 to attain from its first childish crudity to this magnificence of 
adornment !

nate all education must bear some sway even in our A BC 
of Sense-Perception in order to give it arrangement. If 
we should make it a rhapsody of separate exercises strung 
together, it would produce in the disciple no collected 
power upon which one might count. Besides, it is espe- 
cially fitting for occupations relating to mathematics to 
give the first incitement to system in a boy’s mind, to 
accustom him to sequent and complete thought. The 
numbers representing the ratios of rectangular triangles 
serve happily as a principle supporting all subsequent 
computations. Nor is ita slight intellectual conquest for 
a boy to be able by the aid of those numbers to traverse 
completely the whole wide field of possible triangular 
figures at a uniform and measured pace. 
The A BC of Sense-Perception, we grant, is only the 
prologue to mathematics; and it is really mathematics 
which, by guiding, inciting, moving and satisfying the 
speculative interest, should appear under the form of a 
work of art. But even this little prologue should contrib- 
ute its preparations toward the result. Let it be clear 
even by itself. Let it be well rounded. Let it appeal to 
the senses. Above all, however, let it point from the small 
to the great. It should make felt everywhere the near pres- 
ence of the great science. It ought sometimes to bestow a 
little gift in its name. By the invisible hand of the great 
science let it cause a knot to be loosened now and then, 
or a fault to be rectified. Again, by the omniscience of 
mathematics let faults be brought to light so as to com- 
pel their confession by the drawings, the instruments, and 
the imperfectness of computations. Carelessness, and mis- 
apprehension especially, must not be allowed the slightest 
hope of slipping through unreproved. 
It is a chief requisite of a good pedagogical plan that 
it be flexible enough to fit the various capacities. Where 
 
-P-A-G-E-216

several students are to be instructed simultancously, there 
is an especial need of the art of providing freedom of mo- 
tion for the quicker minds without removing them out of 
the common road travelled by the crowd, without allow- 
ing them to gain an advance which would break up the 
class. The usual method of regulating the length of 
lessons by the capacity of the mediocre members of the 
class and forcing all to conform is disadvantageous, it is 
plain, both to a majority and to the best students. This 
measure is at one and the same time too large and too 
small, and too small especially for those whose education 
would reap the richest rewards. To preserve flexibility 
of plan we must sharply separate what belongs to the 
main idea essentially and necessarily from that which con- 
stitutes merely useful applications and enlargements upon 
it, keep ready a sufficient number of these enlargements, 
and know how to direct students into them with ease. 
Being destined for the more capable among the students, 
they must lead to grades somewhat higher scientifically. 
These requirements—admittedly difficult—we have in our 
presentation of the A BC of Sense-Perception made an 
attempt to comply with by the Episodes which we have 
intercalated in various places. It is not necessary to go 
through them completely. The teacher may use them as 
seems best. The first Episode might even be divided, what 
is said of the circle and ellipse being inserted, say, after the 
fifth chapter. To be sure, the teacher will require skill 
in the art of instructing several pupils if he wish to lead 
forward some without disturbing others in their reviews 
and drills, and without even withdrawing from them his 
attention. But then this work counts throughout upon 
pedagogical art and dexterity. It is really intended to 
furnish some little occasion for perfecting and refining 
the art. It by no means hopes to achieve the merits of
-P-A-G-E-217

Pestalozzi’s efforts, by which even the crowd of poor 
school teachers is to be qualified to serve as organs of an 
instruction easy as well as accurately measured off. 
SECOND SECTION, 
EXPOSITION OF THE ABC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
The consideration of reasons and relations was carried 
to a great length in the Introduction and in the First Sec- 
tion, in order to be the briefer in the presentation of the 
plan that we base upon them. ‘Theory is always obliged 
to leave something to trial and experience to alter, to fill 
in, and to expand. Even supposing that success in prac- 
tice should not fulfil our expectation, our reasons might 
remain valuable; only, it would be necessary to draw still 
more cautious conclusions from them. But a large plan 
is justly ridiculed if it suffer shipwreck upon trifling dif- 
ficulties. It is to be hoped, however, that the little plan 
we shall submit will prove sufficiently definite to make 
possible experiments along its lines under the supervision 
of educated men. . 
I. First Beginnings. 
With slate and pencil even a five or six year old child 
may practise drawing straight lines and combining them 
in various ways. In this connection seek to master com- 
pletely the course of Pestalozzi. Above all, the tiresome 
occupation of drawing lines one after another must not 
be the only entertainment. On the contrary, it must be 
byplay only, the child being chiefly instructed by the 
teacher’s talk, and by repeating what is said. Mouth and 
hand must be put in motion simultaneously : while the 
eye is required to master lines, the imagination and the 
ear must be cared for, lest they yield themselves up to 
too interesting impressions. There being, unfortunately,

so many things which must be learned mechanically, they 
mass them together in order that multitude may make 
amends for their lack of content! 
In this manner the drawing of lines must be practised 
daily for weeks. To facilitate it and to avoid the neces- 
sity of oral criticism which would disturb that other in- 
struction, inscribe on the horn-leayes the horizontals, per- 
pendiculars, and right and left ascending and descending 
oblique lines, both intersecting and parallel. It can be 
done with great ease and accurateness with the point of a 
penknife and a ruler. At each lesson have the slate pen- 
cils sharpened to a point, and have the slates cleaned with 
water which is absolutely pure. Thus the child without 
accustoming his hand to disadvantageous pressure will 
easily copy the pattern, distinctly apparent in the horn- 
leaf as a fine white line, by placing the horn-leaf upon 
the black slate. Just as easily, accurately, and gently will 
the leaf when placed on the drawn line indicate to the 
child where and to what extent it has missed the copy. 
Of course, the child will use several such horn-leaves in 
succession. On the first let only a single line be drawn, 
but let all the possible positions of this line be shown, ap- 
propriately named, and imitated on the slate. Then pro- 
ceed quite gradually to more complicated combinations 
and intersections of several lines. Later on, have the 
children draw circles, which in the beginning must not 
be made too small. The diameter should be at least two 
inches. The circle may subsequently be made larger and 
smaller. 
These exercises, always intermingled with other teach- 
ing, may possibly have to be renewed now and then during 
several years before perfect success is attained. Only when 
they have been brought to perfection can we broach our 
subject with absolute certainty.

IT. First Determinations of Measure and Form. 
In order to acquaint the eye with the customary meas- 
ure, and to keep the latter constantly present, let there be 
marked in the wooden frame of the slate the length of a 
foot, divided by larger strokes into halves, by smaller into 
fourths, and by still smaller into inches. Let the child 
practise copying accurately one, two, three inches. Better 
still, let it practise marking them off on straight lines 
which it has drawn, testing them by horn-leaves upon 
which a few inches are marked. We will here make the 
general remark that throughout the remainder of the 
book we presuppose the constant use of horn-leaves hay- 
ing the requisite figures cut in. 
When an object is enlarged or reduced without alter- 
ation of form, we may consider its measure as enlarged or 
reduced correspondingly. All numbers indicating how 
many times the measure or its smaller subdivisions are 
contained in the object remain thus absolutely unaltered. 
In order to accustom children to this mode of viewing an 
object, which is necessary for what is to follow, make them 
copy the foot and its subdivisions on a variety of reduced 
scales ; sometimes just as they please ; sometimes the 
teacher may determine that the copy is to be a half, or 
a third, or two thirds of the true foot, etc. 
The form of a thing is determined partly by the pro- 
portions of the lengths occurring in it and partly by bends 
and angles. We do not need both; either of the deter- 
minations suffices by itself to determine the form in which 
the other determination will then occur of itself and neces- 
sarily.* From this a good deal follows for the A BC of 
  
* In a very valuable critique this passage has been blamed as an 
error of haste, and it is true we need only move one side of a poly- 
gon parallel to itself to have the angles appear as remaining the

  186 HERBART'S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
Sense-Perception. It must teach determining the form 
by either means. It must show in addition how from one 
determination results the other; the latter will constitute 
the principal business of all the following propositions, 
For the present our main object is to raise the primitive 
apperception of forms into distinct consciousness. The 
proportions of the lengths are concepts. They are some- 
times concepts of such difficulty as not to be understood 
at all without mathematical science. But the angles are 
sense-perceptions. Through them we immediately per- 
ceive the form; only, if they are to determine the form 
with accuracy, we must discriminate them very keenly. 
Hence the discrimination of angles will be the exercise 
next following. 
Let the child draw a circle. Through the centre let 
it draw a horizontal and a vertical line. Thus the circle 
is divided into fourths or quadrants. Further lines drawn 
through the centre should cut each quadrant into thirds, 
or the circle into twelfths. Finally, have the thirds of 
these thirds, the ninths of each quadrant, marked by little 
strokes on the circumference. The child, being told that 
the smallest parts of the circumference thus originating 
are usually divided into parts ten times smaller, termed 
degrees, will now be able to count the degrees on the quad- 
rant by tens—10, 20, 30, to 90. 
Out of the figure thus originating we now copy others 
which are simpler: first, the horizontal and the perpen- 
  
same, while, nevertheless, the proportions of the sides change. But 
the polygon, as the term is used technically in mathematics, is un- 
known to the ABC of Sense-Perception. For its purposes every 
distance is a line, and consequently every figure is merely by the 
distances between the vertices divided in every possible way into 
triangles. Upon this rests the meaning of the book, including the 
criticised passage,
-P-A-G-E-221
  RIGHT-ANGLED AND ISOSCELES TRIANGLES. 187 
dicular ; but only to the point where meeting they make 
right angles. Next, we may perhaps have the angle of 60°, 
represented separately once more; then the angle of 40°, 
of 30°, and soon. The lines forming the angles should 
be drawn now greater, now smaller, and again of unequal 
length, so as to show that nothing but the meeting of the 
lines constitutes the angle. 
To obviate the mistake of imagining that all degrees 
have the same length, we may divide, in the manner indi- 
cated, larger and smaller circles, causing the same angles 
to be copied out from them, which will render evident 
that an angle of a definite number of degrees is always the 
same, whether taken from a larger or a smaller circle. 
Again, the child having drawn upon the slate a num- 
ber of circles, large and small, as different as possible, side 
by side, the teacher might erase from one circle one half, 
from another one fourth, from a third seven twelfths, ten 
twelfths, five twelfths, and so on, and let the child state 
in degrees first how large is the remaining arc, then how 
large is the erasure. Next, let the child recover the cen- 
tre. Finally, let it restore each circle. At a later stage 
ares from different circles are connected, that the child 
may make acquaintance with the manifold figures thus 
originated. 
III. Right-angled and Isosceles Triangles. 
The determination of the form was to depend on the 
angle. Consequently, we shall change the latter uniformly, 
describing in so doing a series of rectangular model tri- 
angles. 
Trigonometry leaves to us the choice whether we will 
close the angle by sines or by tangents. The sines are 
measured by the radius—i. e., the smaller by the greater. 
But it is natural to the eye to apply the smaller to the  
-P-A-G-E-222
    188 HERBART’S A BO OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
greater, so as to measure the latter by the former. Be- 
sides, the right-angled triangles formed by sines and co- 
sines are all included in one circle. How large a circle 
this would have to be, if the triangles are to be presented 
clearly to the senses! In the drawing there would be a 
variegated intersection of lines, and into the computation 
fractions would have to be introduced representing sec- 
tions of lines so small as not to be visible to the eye. 
Sense-perceptibility is, for our purposes, the highest 
law; hence the tangents and secants are to be preferred. 
Those under 45° are unnecessary for this purpose. Call- 
ing in every right-angled triangle the smallest side radius 
and the intermediate side tangent, the angles increase 
from 45°. These names, it is true, are a slight infringe- 
ment on mathematical usage. But the child needs un- 
changing, easily applicable expressions; it would become 
confused if now the radius, and again the tangent, were 
greater. When the boy is further advanced, subsequent 
mathematics will, by the many new things it teaches, 
readily change so trifling a habit into conformity to its 
usage. 
Two horn-leaves, into which the drawings represented 
in Figs. 1 and 2 must be cut with absolute accuracy, are 
now and for everything that follows the most indispen- 
sable instruments. Fig. 2 contains only a linear measure, 
a square measure, and a protractor; but Fig. 1 shows the 
rectangular model triangles which must be as perfectly 
impressed upon the eye as the numbers representing their 
ratios upon the understanding.* 
On Fig. 1 give the boy, in the first place, as the name 
* It will be advantageous to have the two figures variously en- 
larged on other horn-leayes in order to facilitate the very important 
exercises in enlarging and reducing.

for the lower short horizontal ac the word radius, which 
designates always the distance of the centre from the cir- 
cumference of a circle. Next give him tangent for the 
perpendicular, which touches the circle below at a, and 
secant as the term for each of the slant lines running out 
from the centre [hypotenuses]. In the next place, note 
the points at which the perpendicular is met by different 
secants. The length from one of these points to the 
nethermost end of the perpendicular where it touches the 
circle is strictly the tangent which belongs to each secant. 
Both secant and tangent depend for their size on the size 
of the angle formed by the secant with the horizontal 
radius. The smallest of these angles occurring in the 
drawing is one half of a right angle. It amounts, there- 
fore, to 45°. Taking the next following secant together 
with the radius, the angle is 5° larger, and amounts, there- 
fore, to 50°. The third secant with the same radius in- 
closes an angle of 55°; and thus the angles increase each 
time by 5° up to 90°. The points a, c, and 1, inclose the 
first triangle ; ac 2 is the second triangle; ac 3 the third; 
ac 4 the fourth, and so on up to ae 8. After this ac 9 
ought to follow as an additional triangle. ' But, as appears 
in the figure, the ninth secant, in order to cut off the tan- 
gent, would have to be prolonged farther than there is 
room on the horn-leaf. Next, the ninth secant, the angle 
below once more progressing as before by 5°, follows the 
perpendicular ad, which therefore should furnish the secant 
for the angle of 90°. But when will this perpendicular 
intersect the tangent? It runs parallel to the latter. It 
hence does not approach, much less reach it. Both tangent 
and secant of 90°, then, continue infinitely, forming no tri- 
angle. If the angle were smaller, by however little, than 
90°, the two lines would approach each other; meeting, 
therefore, somewhere at some time, they would inclose a
-P-A-G-E-225
  
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 191 
triangle. Between 1 and 2 appears the difference of the 
first and second tangents; for subtracting a1, the first, 
from @ 2, the second, the remainder is obviously the space 
between 1 and 2. Similarly, the difference of the second 
and third tangents produces the space between 2 and 3; 
the difference between the third and fourth, the space 
between 3 and 4, etc. These differences are never equal, 
although they originate through the angle at c, opening 
continually by equal differences. It will be seen that the 
larger the angle is already, before it progresses, the more 
will the tangent and the secant increase, though the angle 
enlarge but little. Imagining the angle proceeding not 
by 5° at once, but very slowly, very: gradually, like the 
hand of a watch—and yet even like such a hand, not now 
more swiftly and again more slowly, but with absolutely 
uniform motion—the slightest angular progress would in- 
fallibly cause a small addition to the tangent and the 
secant also. But, however minute this small addition 
might be, nevertheless, each succeeding one must be 
greater than the preceding. Or thus: Tangent and 
secant increase at'an eyer-accelerating rate, when the 
angle increases uniformly. 
Explain these considerations to the children at the 
start with perfect. clearness. Then let them draw the 
first, the second, the third triangle, each separately ; then 
all three side by side, in order that they may accustom 
themselves to discriminate them accurately ; next the sec- 
ond, third, and fourth, side by side; next the third, fourth, 
and fifth, and so on. Do not proceed to the following 
three till the preceding three have been practised thor- 
oughly. During these exercises, the instant that a tri- 
angle happens to be completed, let the child take the 
horn-leaf, Fig. 2, which should be drawn on precisely the 
same scale with Fig. 1; and by means of the five-part 
15
-P-A-G-E-226
  192 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
line, ad, have it measure the tangent and secant of the 
triangle it has drawn. Observe that the radius in Fig. 1 
is exactly equal to one of the five parts of line ad. One 
such part let us call a unit. The scale in Fig. 2 must 
next be applied so as to indicate, by means of line dc, which 
is divided into ten smaller parts, how many units and 
tenths the tangents and secants contain. As the unit, it 
may be best to take the statutory inch, cutting the size 
of the figures on the horn-leaves in proportion. The 
numbers found, each child may write on the blackboard, 
placing a period after the number of units, and the num- 
ber of tenths after the period, writing—for example, a 
unit and two tenths, 1-2. 
Keep the child practising the drawing of the triangles 
till it has at least once succeeded in making each of them 
exactly right, and has discovered the numbers for the tan- 
gents and secants. Thus it will at length get up the fol- 
lowing table :

For 85° we can not avoid the teacher’s giving the 
numbers, as, on our little figures, they can not be meas- 
ured. 
If the numbers so laboriously found have not im- 
pressed themselves spontaneously upon the memory, the 
impression must be completed by memorizing them. In  
-P-A-G-E-227

order to accustom the eye to recognise the triangles in all 
positions, and in order to furnish greater variety, do not 
during the drawing place the horn-leaf always straight, 
but turn it now thus, now otherwise, directing such or 
such a triangle to be imitated in the slanting position in 
which it is shown. 
A few addenda will show in completion the twofold 
definition of the triangular model forms by the angles as 
well as by the proportions of the lengths. 
Each triangle was completely defined, and was dis- 
tinguished from all the other triangles solely by the angle 
at the centre of the circle, or, no circle being drawn, by 
the angle opposite the tangent. But in addition to this, 
and to the right angle common to all the triangles, we 
have a third angle between tangent and secant. We have 
it without more ado, for it is apparent that it can not be 
enlarged or reduced without altering the angle at the 
centre also. Therefore, this one being determined, so is 
that one. It is seen, furthermore, that as one increases 
the other decreases. What will be each time the size of 
the smaller one? ‘To find this we have here no other re- 
source than measurement. This purpose is served by the 
graduated quadrant in Fig. 2. Measurement shows that 
in the first triangle the angle at 1 amounts to 45°; in the 
second, at 2, to 40°; in the third, at 3, to 35°, and so on: 
in a word, we find the proposition that, taken together, 
the two acute angles in a right-angled triangle always 
make 90°. This proposition, which in geometry is demon- 
strated, must be retained in the memory. Hither of the 
two angles resulting invariably from the other, by the 
simple subtraction of one of them from 90°, the shape 
of a right-angled triangle depends on either singly, not on 
both taken together. To be convinced by ocular demon- 
stration, it suffices to draw the tangent and secant, joining
-P-A-G-E-228
194 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
them at any angle, for instance, at the angle of 35°; by 
joining the radius at right angles to the tangent, the angle 
of 55° will originate of itself between radius and secant, 
and the triangle will show exactly the same form as if we 
had first joined the radius and secant at 55°, and then 
closed the angle rectangularly by the tangent. 
It having been made plain to the child by this means 
how the shape is determined by either of the angles, there 
remains to show that the numbers previously found—name- 
ly, the proportions of lengths—also determine the shape of 
the triangle, no matter what its size maybe. To this pur- 
pose the exercises in enlargement and reduction are service- 
able. In the first place, let the child draw for himself the 
standard line ad in Fig. 2, magnifying it at pleasure. Of 
the arbitrary measure so originated let him take, by the 
guidance of the ratios in his self-made table, the appropri- 
ate amounts of units and tenths for the tangent and the 
secants of each triangle. In this operation the child will 
find himself compelled to join these two lines at exactly 
the same angle as when using the original measure, if his 
radius, being the enlarged unit, is to close his triangle 
without being too long or too short. Repeat this species 
of drawings on changing and arbitrary standards till it is 
thoroughly understood by the child that his measure de- 
termines nothing but magnitude, while the numbers ex- 
pressing the ratios decide the form, and therefore deter- 
mine also the angles of the triangle. Despite all diligence, 
some slight difference of shape between the original and 
the enlarged triangles will, nevertheless, become noticeable 
occasionally. These are occasions for reminding the pupil 
that the numbers in the table leave almost everywhere 
undetermined small remainders, which, though always 
less than a tenth, and hence of no great, are yet of some, 
influence upon the form. By seeking one of the numbers
-P-A-G-E-229
  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY, 195 
once more, as at first, by measurement, and by giving close 
attention to the linear remainder over and above the al- 
ready known number of tenths, estimating it with all pos- 
sible accuracy as a half, even a quarter of a tenth, the 
drawing ‘on the enlarged scale can be correspondingly rec- 
tified and brought nearer to the form indicated in the 
horn-leaf. Thus a desire will spring up for the more ac- 
curate determination of the numbers that the following 
work will gratify to some extent. 
Here, too, are to be interwoven exercises in arithmetic. 
Let the new arbitrary measure be measured by the old, 
or by the actual inch measure. Let us suppose that the 
former amounts to 1:2 of the latter. This means: The 
line which in the new measure we call one or a unit con- 
tains the inch, which in the common measure is called 
one or a unit, once, and, in addition, it contains two tenths 
of the same inch. Now, in all these triangles the radius 
is always unit, but this unit may be larger or smaller, the 
triangle becoming larger or smaller correspondingly. This 
we have seen in the exercises in enlarging the triangles. 
If a triangle, then, is to be drawn by the measure just 
adopted, the radius will be equal to the unit of this meas- 
ure, or to one and two tenths inches. How large, then, 
will be, for instance, the tangent and secant of 60°? Our 
number for this secant is 2. This means it contains the 
radius exactly twice. But 1:2 taken twice is 2:4. The 
number for the tangent of 60° is 1:7. This means that 
this tangent contains the entire radius once, and, in ad- 
dition, seven tenths of the same. Therefore, 1:2 must 
be taken 1:7 times. The computation whose significa- 
tion is readily guessed, if not already known, is as 
follows :

That is to say, eighty-four hundredths are seven tenths 
of 1:2; being added to once 1:2, they make 2-04—that is, 
two units, no tenths, and four hundredths. 
We might find the perimeter of the triangle, or the 
number of inches to which all its sides amount when 
taken together. We need only add the radius, the tan- 
gent, and the secant :

But there is a great deal in making an early acquaint- 
ance with decimal fractions, the employment of which 
should be introduced into every school. In the nature of 
the case it is impossible to work as conveniently with com- 
mon fractions. Besides, decimals are likely to occur in 
whatsoever can possibly be termed scientific computation. 
Mental arithmetic might be extended to them also. 
Next, let right-angled triangles be sought wherever 
they are likely to be found—in tables, windows, walls, 
houses, fields; and they are found in any rectilinear, 
quadrangular figure the moment it be cut diagonally. 
Estimate by the eye between which pair of model tri- 
angles they fall. The eye may find many aids in recti- 
fying the estimate by a number of trials till it reaches 
certainty. One angle would determine the whole triangle, 
but with this determination there must be agreement on 
the part of the other angle, and again on the part of the 
two numbers indicating the ratios for the tangent and for 
the secant. 
In the next place, let the pupil estimate the smallest 
side in common foot or inch measure, and by the previous- 
ly shown reckoning let him find from it the other sides 
and the circumference. The benefit of this species of 
calculation will be felt when it is applied to objects which 
it would be inconvenient actually to measure—such as 
high rooms, houses, etc. It requires only pedagogical tact 
and sagacity to awaken at this early stage an agreeable 
astonishment at the power with which numbers reach out 
into distance and bring close to us what seemingly with- 
draws from perception. If we know how to gain lively 
activity in the exercises developed hitherto, some voluntary 
attempts will be likely to cause the children to touch the 
limits of their knowledge. Then the following work— 
and later on science—may easily assist them to break

198 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
through these boundaries. From the right-angled tri- 
angles, model forms for isosceles triangles develop easily. 
From among the triangles studied thus far, let pairs 
of equal triangles be drawn conjoined ; first with the tan- 
gents coinciding. The two radii run into one continuous 
line—the base. The two secants furnish the equal sides. 
The altitude the former tangent indicates. The child, 
therefore, knows at once the base, the other sides, and the 
altitude in units and tenths. He also knows all the angles. 
The two angles at the base are equal; that opposite the 
base is twice the smallest angle of the right-angled tri- 
angle used in forming the isosceles triangle. All this we 
can make the child find for itself under the guidance 
of questioning. The right-angled model triangles are 9, 
counting that for 85°. On the present plan there will, 
then, result likewise 9 isosceles triangles. To these we 
add 8 new ones by again placing two equal right-angled 
triangles together, only this time along the radii. The 
base is now made by the two tangents. The angle oppo- 
site the base will be obtuse. Again, all numbers for the 
angles and sides are known at once. The isosceles model 
triangles are 17 altogether. But the two largest do not 
easily find room upon a slate. The rest should be drawn 
often in different positions ; their perimeters also can be 
computed by a method spontaneously found from what 
has preceded for a variety of measures, and the triangles 
themselves may be detected in a variety of objects. 
IV. Episodes.—Superficial Content of Triangles.—The 
Circle—The Ellipse. 
Pairing equal right-angled triangles by placing them 
together along the secants, and by inverting one of them 
so as to oppose tangent to tangent and radius to radius, 
rectangles are formed easily determined as to their square 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 199 
contents, and which, because they are derived from tri- 
angles, are the best means for making obvious the men-. 
suration of triangles and the influence of their form upon 
their content. 
The triangles having been drawn together upon the 
slate so as to form rectangles, let the pupil use the square 
measure, Fig. 2. To avoid confusing the figure, fe has 
not been produced as far as dc; hence only one square 
inch is indicated. But the linear measure ad suffices 
plainly to show even to a child how many whole square 
inches have room in the rectangle under measurement. 
The square inch divided into hundredths serves to meas- 
ure the remainder which is contained in the rectangle in 
addition to these wholes. 
Let the first rectangle be that which originates from 
the first triangle, the second from the second, the third 
from the third, and so on. Then the first rectangle will 
be a square, as the tangents of 45° are equal to the radii, 
and hence none but equal sides are given to the quadri- 
lateral. The second rectangle comprises that square or 
a whole inch, and in addition two strips as long as the 
square, each strip equalling nearly 10 hundredths of the 
square ; nearly two, because the tangent of 50° is a whole 
and nearly two tenths. The rectangle determined by it 
has therefore a square content of one unit and nearly 20 
hundredths. Here it is seen at once how the numbers 
for the rectangles depend upon those for the tangents. 
In the next following, or third rectangle, we get more 
than 1 and +40, ; for the tangent of 55° is more than 1-4. 
The number of units is the same in both length and sur- 
face, but the number of tenths in the tangent becomes ten 
times as many in the surface, 2 becoming 20; 4 becoming 
40; 7 becoming 70; the results, however, not being tenths 
but hundredths, Thus the numbers for these rectangles 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
  200 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
are easy to memorize. Only, do not “for short” say 4 
tenths for 40 hundredths. You would confuse the con- 
cept of the divisions in square measure. The square is 
not divided into tenths; it is divided into hundredths. 
It must be so divided, for the reason that each of the 
sides, considered as linear measure, is divided into tenths. 
The rectangles increase very irregularly and with in- 
creasingly large differences. Call attention to the fact 
that even this arises still from the uniform progress of 
the angles in the original triangles. If we desired the 
rectangles, and hence, to begin with, the tangents, to pro- 
gress uniformly, what would haye to be the course of 
the angles? Obviously, the steps would have to become 
smaller and smaller; ultimately, as the rectangle grew 
very long, almost imperceptibly small. 
Each rectangle is double the triangle whence it origi- 
nates. The triangle, consequently, is half the rectangle. 
Thus, then, the square content of the model triangles, too, 
is found. We need but halve the numbers for the rectan- 
gles. The first triangle is 4, or 50 hundredths; the sec- 
ond is $ of almost 1,%%,, or it is nearly $ and 7%, or 50 
and 10—that is, 60 hundredths. The third is more than 
Tis, ete. 
These numbers are all valid for enlarged standards. 
Only, it is essential first to consider accurately the en- 
largement of the square measure. A square must have 
four equal sides. They are, therefore, all four determined, 
if one is established. But one side of the square that 
“is used for measuring all surfaces is as long as the line 
which in the linear measure we call one or a unit. This 
Fig. 2 shows. If this unit of linear measure is enlarged, 
the square, the unit of surface measure, must conform. 
How does it conform? If length dc is doubled, thus be- | 
coming dd, will the square of it also become only twice as
-P-A-G-E-235
  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 901 
large? No doubt on the line dd there is room for two 
squares side by side, each as large as beef. If we dou- 
ble the base dc, leaving the altitude @f unchanged, the 
surface determined by both will therefore also be doubled. 
This proposition is correct and very useful. Only, it can 
not here be applied. For, obviously, we have not done 
what we should have done. We were to enlarge the 
square. Instead of the smaller square, there was to be a 
larger square. But by the doubling there has arisen no 
square, but a rectangle, one of whose sides is twice as long 
as the other; the shape is therefore completely changed. 
The sides were to remain equal. Consequently, doubling 
one, we should have doubled the other. By being doubled, 
it doubles the previously originated rectangle. But this 
rectangle was already a doubling of the square. Hence, 
the square is twice doubled, or contained in the enlarged 
square four times. Suppose, further, that the length be 
becomes thrice as great. By this fact alone, before the 
altitude is altered, the square bcef will be multiplied by 
three ; and the triple square will be tripled a second time, 
since the height, as the sides must remain equal, is also to 
become three times as great. Three squares thrice make 
nine squares. The square becomes, therefore, nine times 
as large by the base becoming three times as large. If dc 
is taken five times, then the square would be multiplied 
by 5 twice—that is, it would be taken five times five times, 
or 25 times. As many times, then, as dc is taken, so many 
times, in order that the sides may remain equal, 0f also 
must be taken. Hence, the square will always be multi- 
plied twice by that number by which the side was mul- 
tiplied only once. This truth remains, though we mul- 
tiply by fractions. Let the fraction be 3. Then not only 
is dc to be taken half, which would halve the square, 
making a piece like dgfn, but f also must be reduced to
-P-A-G-E-236
202 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
its half, bp. Thus there remains of the one half of the 
square only its half. The square has been halved twice, 
or been twice multiplied by 4; and since one half of one 
half is one quarter, the whole has been changed into its 
fourth part, dgpo. Or suppose multiplication by 1:2. Then 
the linear measure being taken once, and in addition to it 
two tenths, there are added likewise to the square, before 
any alteration in the altitude, two tenths of it. But these 
tenths are strips, each containing 10 hundredths together, 
therefore they make 20, and, adding the square itself, 120 
hundredths. Now, as the height also must be multiplied 
by 1:2, we have for the square once 120 hundredths, and 
in addition to it 2 tenths of 120 hundredths. The tenth 
part of 120 is 12, which being taken twice is 24; conse- 
quently, the complete result is 144 hundredths, or 1445. 
This may be computed as follows: 
12 
1:2 
1:2 
124 
144 
That is, the square is to be taken 1:2 times 1:2 times. 
We seek, therefore, in the first place, 1:2 times 1:2—which 
we found in the reckoning just shown—and next multiply 
the square instead of twice by 1:2 only once by 1:44. By 
this means the two required multiplications are accom- 
plished simultaneously, just as instead of twice multiply- 
ing by 3 we multiply at once by 9. 
Before going further this must be made absolutely 
plain to the children, still more in detail than here, 
and by a still greater number of examples. Next, let 
them draw an enlarged square measure on the slates, and 
let them combine triangles, whose radius is equal to the 
side of the enlarged square, into rectangles. A few di-   
 
-P-A-G-E-237
  
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 203 
visional lines drawn in these rectangles will show to the 
senses of the child that the enlarged rectangles, and there- 
fore the enlarged triangles, contain as much of the en- 
larged measure as former figures drawn by common meas- 
ure contained of the latter. It will, in other words, be 
clear that the numbers formerly found for the rectangles 
are valid for any measure. Consequently, it is plain that 
in order at any time to find the content, we need not mul- 
tiply the measure by the appropriate number, being care- 
ful only not to confound square measure with linear 
measure, If the latter, being one side of the square meas- 
ure, is given, the square measure itself must be found from 
it in the first place. 
The treatment of surface mensuration here adopted, 
separating measure from number more carefully than is 
done by the usual way of multiplying the base by the 
height, has one advantage which is important for the 
A’B C of Sense-Perception. The children become ha- 
bituated to separating mentally the size and the shape 
even in the case of surfaces, and learn to think of draw- 
ings presented to them merely as symbols for objects 
which may be greater or smaller. They learn to conceive 
any form as an alteration of some other form, and of the 
numbers which serve to distinguish different forms as 
abstract ideas of ratio. In the measurement of actual 
objects, however, where the purpose is not to train the 
intellect but to obtain the sought-for result as quickly as 
possible, multiplication of the base by the altitude is a far 
shorter way than it would be to find first merely the form 
by the comparison of the angles at the diagonals, and 
then the enlargement of the measure by estimating the 
shortest side. The teacher will act accordingly in the 
mensuration of fields, windows, houses, and so on, He 
can not expend too much time or care upon the perfect

904 HERBART’S A B C OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
conversion of percepts into concepts. But, to facilitate 
work which may be necessary in later life, he may after- 
ward show that two numbers belong to height. One de- 
termines it as tangent of the angle at the diagonal. The 
other, which is owing to the enlargement of the measur- 
ing square, is common to it and to the base line. In the 
method of considering the subject which we have adopted 
these two numbers are separated, as only the first depends 
on the form, the second depending on size. The separa- 
tion, however, is not serviceable for the determination of 
the square contents, since in this the two numbers recom- 
bine. Consequently, the altitude might have been given, 
like the base, by a single number. This would have con- 
tained both those numbers. To it must be joined multi- 
plicatively the number for the base, to give as result the 
content. 
Small but perceptible instances of incorrectness in the 
attempts at actual surface mensuration will again, and 
more strikingly than formerly, remind the pupil that the 
numbers for the tangents are known not accurately but 
only as far as tenths. There is no harm if the beginners 
become impatient at it. This impatience is a purposely 
excited desire for knowledge. Remind them that they 
found these numbers by their own measurements. Sug- 
gest to them that they measure more accurately if they 
can. Promise for the future the aid of the science in 
whose power it is to satisfy every wish of this kind. 
Adopt a like course in the case of yery oblong quad- 
rangles. Here the differences of the tangents appearing 
in the table become so large that the table numbers cease 
to determine anything exactly. Suggest to your students 
that they find the tangents for angles differing by less 
than five degrees by measurements similar to the first. 
When the slate becomes too small for the purpose, lines

may be drawn on smooth ground in the open air, or indi- 
cated by stakes and strings. These lines may be measured 
by feet and tenths, or even hundredths of feet, much 
depending, to be sure, upon how large and how accurate- 
ly at the start the angular measure has been inscribed on 
the ground, and how correctly the perpendicular has been 
erected on the radius. 
The following is such an addition to the table of tan- 
gents and secants :

The preceding work may easily be extended to oblique 
quadrangles and all species of triangles, and hence to the 
whole subject of surface measurement. 
In the first place, we may again join two equal right- 
angled model triangles along either their tangents or radii, 
but reversely, so as to form rhomboids. Obviously these 
are equal in content to the rectangles and the isosceles 
triangles originated by joining the same right-angled tri- 
angles. Again, at one side of rectangles of every kind, 
cut off an arbitrary triangular piece ; only, the cut must 
be straight and pass through a vertex of the rectangle. 
The piece can be added on the other side. The origi- 
nating oblique quadrangles, by similar cutting off and 
joining on, will become still more oblique, so as to make 
it possible in this way to run through all the varieties of 
rhomboids. In doing this, nothing is added to or taken 
from the surface of the original rectangles. Only the 
position of the parts is altered. Thus it is easy to make 
plain the proposition that any parallelogram may be 
changed into a rectangle of equal content at equal base 
and altitude, since these also are not altered in the cut- 
ting. In other words, the square contents of the rectan- 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
206 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
gle indicates the square contents of the rhomboid. Tri- 
angles being halves of rhomboids are therefore halves also 
of the corresponding rectangles, and may be computed as 
such. To conclude, any figure can be divided into trian- 
gles whose sum will equal the square contents of the fig- 
ure. It is not necessary to go into details on the subject, 
for we have already struck into the path oe discovering 
geometry for ourselves. 
In this episode may be included also, for the ablest 
among the pupils, a preliminary determination of the cir- 
cle. First, lead them to observe that in the smallest parts 
of the circumference the curvature becomes unnoticeable ; 
that a small are is almost equal to its tangent. On this 
occasion the word tangent is completely reinstated in its 
usual mathematical significance. Next, if necessary by 
the aid of the ruler and the protractor, have them draw 
a line of 10 inches, and join to it a line at an angle of 
10°, and at the other end of the line draw a perpendicu- 
lar. The latter when cut off by the two lines forming 
the angle will be the tangent of 10°, and hence only a 
very little more than the are of 10° for a radius of 10 
inches, Of such ares there pertain to the whole circum- 
ference 36; measured by the horn-leayes, the tangent of 
10° will be found to. be 1 and about 74 tenths inches in 
length. We accordingly multiply 1-75 by 36: 
15 
36 
10°50 525 
63-00 
The circumference for a radius of 10 inches would be 
therefore about 63 inches. Conceive the circle ten times 
as small. There results for the radius of 1 inch a cireum- 
ference of 6:3 inches. It is customary, however, to com- 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
  
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 207 
pare the radius with the half circumference, or the diam- 
eter with the whole circumference. One half of 6-3 is 
3:15, a number which is a little too large, as we computed 
it on the tangent instead of on the arc. It should really 
be a little more than 3:14. 
From this point on it is again only necessary to pre- 
sent geometry comprehensibly in order to make the 
strictly geometrical transition from the circumference of 
the circle to its square content. 
Pestalozzi has included in his A B C of Sense-Percep- 
tion the ellipse, or, as he incorrectly terms it, the oval. It 
deserves to be included, partly because it accustoms the 
youthful draughtsman to a changing curvature, partly be- 
cause we need it so often when circles not directly facing 
the eye are to be drawn. Under such circumstances the 
ellipse is usually drawn wrongly. It is well to make sure 
of its course by a rule, even though by the analytical in- 
vestigation of this line we can in this place derive noth- 
hing but just the rule. 
Draw a circle, and in it a horizontal and a perpendic- 
ular diameter. Exactly parallel to the latter draw a few 
lines through the circle. On either side of the horizontal 
diameter, between it and the circumference, divide these 
lines in half, or cut off from them 4%, 3, any fraction you 
please, only use the same fraction for each line. Through 
the points by which you indicate the fraction draw a line. 
It will be a regular ellipse. Its form will be determined 
by the chosen fraction. It may be altered by changing 
the latter. Not till after these preliminary exercises is 
permission given to draw ellipses freehand. 
V. A General View of all Triangular Forms. 
Our preparations are now complete for presenting 
in one view to the imagination and the understanding 
16 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
208 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
every variety of triangular ground forms. ‘The first 
mechanical occupation upon lines and circles was in- 
troduced among the first beginnings of instruction. It 
seemed only to furnish play for the hand. The matter 
became a more serious occupation when the child was 
required accurately to measure and discriminate lengths 
and angles. The right-angled triangles even caused us, 
if not to gain an insight into a scientific necessity, at 
least to feel it and to find it; for their angles and sides 
revealed a system in which there was mutual determin- 
ing and being determined. This important step in the 
training of the understanding, which required a close and 
collected reflection, was rewarded by affording an oppor- 
tunity for observations on objects that illustrate those 
principles, and which could be followed up with freedom 
to a greater or less extent. In order to secure this lib- 
erty let the teacher discontinue the regular lessons in this 
branch. Having included as much of the Episode as he 
deems well for his pupils, let him pause for a few weeks, 
introducing during the periods which were devoted to the 
A BC of Sense-Perception some other instruction. It is 
well to let recollection slumber a brief while, that it may 
reawaken with uniform vivacity, so as to have the distine- 
tion disappear between that which was learned earlier and 
that which was learned later, and so that all the details 
may be properly adjusted. 
When the thread is taken up again, give a synopsis of 
the preceding exercises. Next, invite the pupil to con- 
sider the question whether it is likely to be the intention 
of this instruction to determine only right-angled forms. 
Even if one chooses to evade greater difficulties by ocen- 
pying himself with only the simplest forms, namely, those 
which consist of spaces inclosed by three lines, the three 
lines are not always joined into right-angled triangles, but
-P-A-G-E-243
  
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 209 
into a very great variety of triangles. The tangent, which, 
by the gradual opening of the opposite angle, was cut off 
at greater and greater length in ever-varying proportions, 
would be cut off in a still greater multiplicity of ways 
should we incline it more or less to either side. For every 
angle of inclination that we should give it, there would 
be possible an entire series of model triangles like our 
right-angled triangles. A host of possible triangles are 
revealed, any one of which may be expected to be formed 
by us. For example, opening a door, you will change the 
direction of its base line to every point in the room. 
Mention the case of a man going straight ahead or to 
one side while passing two trees, ete. 
It is possible to find even more interesting examples. 
They are not to be despised. But the important object 
is to excite in this connection a kind of speculative inter- 
est that may, to be sure, be spiced with little accessory in- 
terests, but that neither can be thus replaced nor must be 
thus overbalanced. 
The question then arises how we shall traverse the 
multiplicity of triangles that extend on all sides. The 
observation that a perpendicular may be dropped in any 
triangle from the apex to the opposite side, dividing the 
triangle into two right-angled triangles, offers an easy 
means of orientation. Thus reduced, any triangle may 
be looked upon as composed of two right-angled triangles. 
Hence, there are as many possible triangles as there are 
possible pairs of right-angled triangles. To set forth, there- 
fore, from among the multitude a sufficient number of 
model forms between which the others must lie, we com- 
bine our right-angled model triangles into as many pairs 
as possible. The measurements and computations which 
we have made upon the right-angled triangles will thus 
furnish the basis for the computation of all the ratios that
-P-A-G-E-244
  : 210 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
are necessary to determine the forms of the remaining tri- 
angles. The way is now clear. Patient diligence alone 
is needed to follow out the road to the end. 
The perpendicular dividing the triangle into two right- 
angled triangles divides the angle at the apex into two 
parts. Each part determines perfectly the form of the 
right-angled triangle on its side. For this reason, the 
possible number of ways in which the angle at the apex 
can be composed of these two parts fixes the number of 
possible combinations of right-angled triangles. 
Across the slate draw a horizontal ; erect a perpendic- 
ular upon the middle, not too high. At the upper end on 
either side of the perpendicular imagine angles opening 
gradually. When each angle reaches 90°, both the exter- 
nal sides will run parallel to the horizontal and into one 
continuous line. Until they do, they and the horizontal 
together inclose triangles ever varying. All these triangles 
would be isosceles if the angle opened equally on both 
sides every time. If, however, we desire to have every 
possible triangle, then, for each magnitude of one angle, 
the other must traverse every possible magnitude, from 0 
to 90°. The angle at the apex of the entire triangle, 
which is the sum of these two angles, will thus be made 
up of two parts in every possible way. 
Let the angle at the left of the perpendicular have at 
first 5°. To begin with, let that angle remain unaltered. 
Let the angle at the right of the perpendicular have at 
first 5°, then 10°, then 15°, then 20°, and so on up to 85° 
Next, give to the left angle 10°, and again leave it unal- 
tered, while the angle to the right begins once more at 5° 
and grows by steps of 5°. Next, increasing the angle at 
the left to 15°, keep it so, letting the angle at the right 
again begin at 5°, and run through 10°, 15°, 20°, and so 
on. Then assign to the left angle 20°, and let the angle
-P-A-G-E-245
  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 211 
at the right traverse its series. It is obvious how this con- 
tinues. 
It is certain that we should thus get all the possible 
combinations of right-angled triangles. But there would 
be among them such as would differ in nothing but the 
reversed position. For instance, right at the beginning, 
when the left angle has 10°, and the angle at the right 
commences at 5°, the combination is repeated that oc- 
curred when the angle at the left was 5° and that at the 
right 10°. Only we have changed from left to right. 
Such a difference contributes no new form. It is here 
superfluous. 
To eliminate transpositions and leave the combinations 
that are of exclusive importance regarding form, observe 
that there will be a transposition every time the angle at 
the left is greater than the angle at the right; for we have 
had this greater angle once before, at the right, when that 
at the left had grown as large only as the smaller angle at 
the right is now. For example, suppose we have at the 
left an angle of 35°, at the right one of 25°; then there 
must earlier have been an angle of 25° at the left, and 
since at that time the angle at the right traversed its 
series it came to 35°, and at that time represented the 
combination. It is now repeated, only in reversed po- 
sition. 
Therefore let us guard against ever having the greater 
angle at the left. 
It will not happen if the angle at the right each time 
begins not from the beginning but from the number of 
degrees which the angle at the left has already at the mo- 
ment. For instance, if the latter has 75°, the former tray- 
erses only 75°, 80°, 85°. 
Now recall that in each of the right-angled triangles 
which are formed at the two sides of the perpendicular,
-P-A-G-E-246
  219 HERBART'S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
the angle at the base is determined by the angle at the 
apex. As the angle at the perpendicular opens, that at 
the base must become smaller. If the one increases by 
5°, the other loses as much. One goes from 5° to 85°, 
consequently the other from 85° to 5°. This occurs on 
each side of the perpendicular. The angle at the apex is 
always the sum of the two angles at the perpendicular. 
These reflections are the foundation for the first table 
which is appended to this book, and which the pupil un- 
der the teacher’s directions must make up for himself. 
Above runs a row of numbers from 10 to 90. Under each 
number is a line drawn straight down. It represents the 
perpendicular which divides the angle at the apex, the 
upper number, into two angles, right and left, noted by 
smaller figures on each side of the line. This determines 
the two angles at the base, which are indicated by large 
figures under the smaller. The first triangle at the left 
will have therefore at the apex an angle of 10°, below, at 
the base, two equal angles of 85°. Thus, throughout the 
table large figures arranged by threes triangularly about a 
stroke indicate the three angles of a triangle; the small 
figures written between them indicate the division of the 
upper number which stands for the angle at the apex. 
The uppermost horizontal row of triangles may be called 
the first, the next under it the second, the following the 
third, fourth, and so on. In the first row the angle at the 
left of the perpendicular remains 5° and consequently 
the complementary angle at the base 85°; in the second 
row the former angle becomes 10°, the latter 80; the row 
begins one place later, as the angle at the right must not 
again become 5°, since this would be less than 10°. On 
the same principle the rows continue to shorten. It will 
be seen that this conforms with the above requirements. 
Carrying the eye straight down the table, we have col-
-P-A-G-E-247
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 213 
umns. ‘he first of these on the left, which contains only 
one triangle, may be called the first column; the next, 
which contains two, the second column, etc. In each 
column the angle at the right of the perpendicular, and 
consequently that at the base, remain constant. It is for 
the sake of this regularity that the rows began later and 
later. Finally, traversing the table diagonally from the 
right to the left below, the angle at the apex remains con- 
stant on any diagonal, because this angle is the sum of 
the two angles at the perpendicular, one of which grows 
by as much as the other decreases, since by taking a 
diagonal we simultaneously traverse the columns toward 
the left, while traversing the rows in a downward di- 
rection. 
The middlemost diagonal divides the table into two 
equal but dissimilar halves. It runs through all the right- 
angled triangles—those familiar model triangles. On its 
left are the acute-angled, on its right the obtuse-angled 
triangles. At first sight the multiplicity at the one hand 
seems as great as at the other. But the number of acute- 
angled triangles can be reduced very much after the fol- 
lowing reflections. 
In each of the triangles the angle at the apex is di- 
vided into two parts. But which is the angle at the apex? 
In right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles, no doubt, it 
is the right or obtuse angle ; for attempting a perpendic- 
ular to the base from any other corner of the triangle, the 
perpendicular drops outside ; it could not meet the side 
opposite unless the latter were produced. This case does 
not belong here, as the angle at the apex would not be the 
sum of the two angles at the perpendicular. Therefore, 
in right- or obtuse-angled triangles, so far as our subject 
is concerned, the largest side is always the base, and the 
largest angle opposite to it is at the apex. But in acute-
-P-A-G-E-248
: 914 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
| angled triangles no such decision mark is furnished. 
Turn it as we please, any side as base has an angle hover- 
ing above it, whence the perpendicular falls within the 
triangle. Here we have a threefold basis of choice, ex- 
cept in isosceles triangles, where the choice is only two- 
fold, since we can not distinguish which of the equal sides 
is taken as the base, the sides themselves differing in noth- 
ing. Now, since the table contains all the possible cases, 
every isosceles triangle occurs twice, and all the other 
triangles occur three times—that is to say, in the half 
which contains the acute-angled triangles. In the other 
triangles no repetition occurs. 
The front or left half of the table must therefore be 
searched more narrowly in order to find the repetitions. 
They easily show themselves if the student has a thor- 
ough hold on what has preceded. Look at the uppermost 
row: in it the angle of 85° remains constant; the other 
two approach each other in opposite but equal sequence, 
the one going from 10° to 85°, the other from 85° to 10°. 
Necessarily, one half the row repeats the other. Further- 
more, from the last triangle but one in the first row, go 
down parallel to the diagonal of the right-angled triangles. 
Compare each triangle you reach with the uppermost tri- 
angle of its column. These, too, repeat. For in the diag- 
onal, as has been observed, the angle at the apex remains 
constant. It has here 85°. It is the same, therefore, as 
the angle at the left in the first row, which also remains 
at 85°. In addition to this, in any given column the angle 
at the right is constant. But if in two triangles two an- 
gles are equal, the third angle must be equal also, as the 
three together equal 180°. This will be understood at 
once, as, in combining the two right-angled triangles to 
make a single triangle, the latter gets all the acute angles 
of the two, hence twice 90°. Thus, this geometrical propo-
-P-A-G-E-249
  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 915 
sition, which, of course, may also precede, can easily be 
rendered plain from the preceding. 
What is here shown in respect to the first row and its 
appertaining diagonal may be easily enlarged so as to 
apply to the rest. 
At the front each row begins with an isosceles triangle. 
This follows from the whole arrangement of the table, for 
the angle at the right is not to be smaller than that at 
the left. We commence it, therefore, when it equals the 
angle at the left. Now, the angle at the apex grows, that 
at the base on the right decreases. Thus, approaching 
each other with equal steps, either of them must at some 
time get to the place where the other began. This re- 
peats the first isosceles triangle. At this moment cut off 
the row. Then one half of the cut-off is the repetition of 
the other, only in inverse order. This will be shown with 
the greatest plainness by the table itself, which during 
these explanations should be kept before the eye con- 
stantly. From the point where the row was cut off go 
down diagonally. In the diagonal the angle at the apex 
remains constant. But in the isosceles triangle, from 
which we go down, this angle at the apex equals the left 
angle at the base, which angle remains constant through- 
out the row. Thus the row and the diagonal have one 
angle in common. In addition, both intersect the same 
columns where they always strike the same angles. Thus 
they have the second angle, and consequently all three 
angles, in common ; hence, their triangles are always the 
same. . 
The above conclusions presupposed from the first that 
the isosceles triangle commencing each row has at the apex 
a smaller angle than at the right at the base. Then these 
angles approached, the smaller increasing, the larger de- 
creasing. But the presupposition holds only as far as
-P-A-G-E-250
  216 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
the sixth row, which begins with the equilateral triangle. 
Further than this row, therefore, the conclusions will not 
hold. But this is exactly far enough to cover the whole 
half of the table. This, again, a glance at the table will 
make obvious. 
The teacher will have some trouble in making plain 
to the children the general view of all possible triangles. 
But his pains will be rewarded by the inestimable advan- 
tage of accustoming pupils to traverse completely and with 
steady eye a whole field of concepts. This combinatory 
exercise of the understanding is indispensable in teaching, 
for it is unusual for even cultured minds to have a spon- 
taneous mastery of it. Teachers, on the other hand, 
recommend for the discipline of the understanding many 
things which are trivial, and even some things which are 
contrary to the purpose; the latter being things in which 
the student must succeed untaught if he is not to become 
pedantic. Should the teacher feel that the survey of the 
table is none too easy for himself, let him not infer 
that “the children can not learn this,” but let him con- 
sider how much must have been lacking in the instruc- 
tion which he received in his own youth. Practice in 
combining should be an absolutely essential portion of 
every cycle of instruction. Many sciences would be better 
off if their founders and cultivators had possessed it. And 
many things in the lower grades, especially among others 
declension and conjugation, would no longer deaden the 
spirit but enliven it, and would be conceived of far more 
swiftly, easily, and surely if on the occasion combinatory 
reflections were introduced. he first and the second as- 
sertions are both so safe that even a writer quite without 
weight and reputation may risk throwing them out with- 
out proof, with full confidence that the course of science 
and of pedagogy will some time demonstrate them for him.

In addition to these considerations the concept of the tri- 
angle is a concept of such extreme importance as to deserve 
in the highest degree the pains of following it out com- 
pletely through all its modifications. Given a good in- 
structor, the only difficulty he can meet in doing so is that 
the attention of his pupils will tire too early. But if they 
do not lack the power of attention altogether, if the teacher 
is not too weak to ask of them that degree of exertion which 
they can easily bear, and that persistence through an hour 
or a few hours which, after an equivalent of as much time 
for recreation, even a boy must become accustomed to in 
order to be able to accomplish and perfect anything, then 
no harm is done even if it should be impossible to unwind 
before the boy the whole thread of those considerations at 
once and unbroken. Allow time for recovery from fatigue. 
Without disadvantage some of the following computations 
may be interspersed. A few days later recommence, chang- 
ing somewhat the presentation. Analyze, explain, objec- 
tify every single conclusion most accurately, and permit 
neither yourself nor the children to lose patience until a 
perfect insight is apparent. 
VI. Computation of Sides. 
In the field which we have now surveyed we must next 
contemplate and reflect upon the details—that is to say, 
they must be computed. 
Two auxiliaries are serviceable for properly apperceiv- 
ing every triangular form. First, before computing any 
triangle, let the children sketch it in miniature on the 
slates. Second, to avoid habituating the imagination ex- 
clusively to small drawings, have an instrument for pre- 
senting forthwith upon a large scale any triangle with 
which you happen to be occupied.

The following Aiocemeldt has been tried for such an 
instrument, which in any event will resemble the trique- 
trum of the ancients, and the model has turned out well 
for handy use : 
A staff of wood, ad, Fig. 4, is joined at 6 to another 
staff, be. On the other side, at @, there is another joint, 
which, however, is not fastened to the staff cd imme- 
diately. Instead, in the inner vertical side of the staff 
cd, a side not shown in the figure, a groove runs widen- 
ing inward. In this groove moves a small travelling 
piece, indicated in the figure by a dotted line between 
mand n. The traveller is connected with the staff ab by 
the joint at a. Hence, ab may be moved on cd; also the 
angle made by these two staves can at pleasure be closed 
and can be opened to 90°. ad and eb may be opened to 
180°, and may be closed as far as the point d of the staff 
cd allows at any position of the instrument. cd and le 
must be at the least five times as long as ad; it would be 
better to make them longer still but for the instruments 
becoming unhandy. The two protractors seen at a and b 
would best consist of very small brass ares; they may, how- 
ever, be made of horn-leaves. They are fastened to the 
staff ab; the other two staves must be free to turn under 
them. A third protractor may be applied at d to the staff 
ced; it need not have more than 60°. ed and Je are, in the 
first place, divided into five equal parts, each equal to the 
length ad. Furthermore, ad, although in the figure in 
order to prevent confusion this is not indicated, is divided 
into ten parts, as is also each of the five units on the staves 
cd and be—that is to say, ad is here taken as the unit, and 
we mark units and tenths on the other staves. If the in- 
strument is not too small, hundredths may be marked like- 
wise. If it is, they must be estimated by the eye as accu- 
rately as possible. The larger the instrument is made the
-P-A-G-E-253
  
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 219 
better. There ought really to be some arrangement for 
allowing the instrument to execute its motions upon the 
wall. By this means the triangles would be most obvi- 
ous to the eye. If the teacher prefers to have it at his 
side on the table, he will get a convenient size by making 
ab 4 inches long.* ‘The instrument may be made by any 
good joiner at a small cost. Only, you will be obliged 
to draw the protractors yourself on horn-leaves; and es- 
pecially you will be obliged to nail them on yourself, for 
this requires the utmost accuracy, such as one can expect 
of no artisan. Unless the centres of the protractors are 
exactly on the points a, d, and d, and unless their base 
lines coincide with the edges of the staves to a hair’s 
breadth, the instrument is useless. Protractors of horn- 
leaf are difficult to glue on; still less can they be fastened 
with ordinary nails, which split the horn-leaf. The best 
expedient is to use common sewing needles, breaking off 
the upper half ; the remaining half can be driven in with 
a tuning hammer. Two will hold the horn-leaf quite 
firmly, but a few additional ones may be driven in by way 
of precaution. If the instrument is to show the triangles 
quite accurately, it would better be set by the numbers in 
the second table, for the determination of a triangle by 
the sides is always more accurate than by the angles. This 
remark should not be turned as an objection against the 
method here chosen of finding the sides from the angles. 
By the angles the form is immediately offered to sense- 
perception. Besides, these preliminary exercises have not 
as yet, as mathematics itself has, the means that can be 
used for finding the angles from the given sides. Further- 
  
* or the purpose of stronger objectification, have the whole 
black, except the inner edges of the staves, which strictly show the 
triangle, and which should be white or red. 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  920 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
more, if we had assumed rational sides—and to do so is 
possible for the three sides simultaneously in very rare in- 
stances only—the angles would have turned out irrational ; 
—a concept having so little sensuous clearness as to be 
utterly unsuitable for an A B C of Sense-Perception. 
In the computation of the sides, which we are about to 
enter upon, proportion is both necessary and, which is no 
small advantage, it is objectified. 
There being even to-day some adults who complain 
that the reasons for proportion were never clearly pre- 
sented to them, it may be permitted for our ABO of 
Sense-Perception at this point to make an incnrsion on 
the A BO of arithmetic. 
If you wish to buy three yards of cloth you will inquire 
the price of one yard, and conclude: Since I wish to buy 
one yard three times, I shall have to pay the price of one 
yard three times. Put generally—as many times as I order 
one yard, so many times do I pay the price. For compu- 
tation, this extremely simple illustration is set down thus: 
1:3=06:: 30) 
signifying the price. Thus expressed mathematically it 
reads: One yard increases to three yards, hence the price 
} increases to three times b. If the price were $4, we 
should read: One yard increases to three yards, hence $4 
increases to three times $4, or $12. 
In the case of so easy an example no computation 
will be gone into. Rather, perhaps, for the following : 
850 x 5 
100 
read thus: $100 increase to $850, hence $5 annual 
interest increase to 850 times $5 divided by 100. It is 
understood that the supposition is that one wishes to 
know how much interest will be yielded by a capital of   
100 :850 = 5:
-P-A-G-E-255
  
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 991 
$850 at 5 per cent annually. As many times as one lends 
$100, so many times does one receive $5 annual interest. 
Now, how many times have $100 been loaned? You can 
not tell in this case without a fraction. It is convenient 
to think the subject over in the following form : Suppose 
that on every single dollar loaned I were to receive $5 ; 
then for $850 loaned I should obviously receive 850 times 
$5. But by actually making this demand on the debtor, 
it is certain one would ask a hundred times as much as 
he would pay. It is therefore correct to demand the one 
hundredth part of 850 times $5. Hence we shall divide 
850 times 5, or, what is the same thing, 5 times 850 by 
100. The computation will be as follows : 
850 
5 
4250 
it being only necessary to write 42°5 instead of 4250 to 
finish. For a division of 100 contains two divisions by 
10; now, every figure signifies ten times less when put 
one place farther to the right; the division by 100 is con- 
sequently accomplished by moving each figure two places 
farther to the right. Thus 50 units become 5 tenths ; 200 
units, 2 units; 4000 units, 40 units; consequently, 4250 
become 42°5—greater detail would not here be to the 
purpose. The following computations, however, will con- 
tribute clearness. Still, if one be not afraid of a slight 
trace of algebra, all that essentially belongs to proportion 
is very briefly said in the following formula :   
a:ma=b:mb 
a and 6 signify things known to be increased at the same 
ratio. Therefore, a increases to m times a, as b to m 
times 4. Now, since it is usually impossible to state the 
number m without a fraction, m times 6 is found by taking

    999 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
5 am, times, and, having taken it a times too many, divid- 
ing mab by a. Therefore the following expression shows 
the entire computation, sometimes fancied to be difficult :

Tn order now to determine the forms of triangles by 
the ratios of their sides, and in order to be able to com- 
pare these ratios among themselves, we must first elimi- 
nate from form the accidental difference of magnitude. 
Hence it is necessary for all triangles to have one side of 
common magnitude. Then the differences of the other 
sides will render the differences of form noticeable. 
But since the one equal side will be for all of them the 
equal standard, all the other sides being determined by 
stating how many units and tenths of that side they con- 
tain, the question is, Which side is best fitted to be the 
common standard? Most naturally the least, since one 
measures the greater by the less. Therefore, the least 
side itself serving as the measure, it contains the measure 
neither more nor less than once. Its number is always 
1. The number of any other side, on the contrary, is 
always larger than 1. 
For the purpose of computing the sides, which com- 
putation depends altogether upon the ratios for the right- 
angled triangles, it is necessary for mathematics to come 
to our aid by a few figures determining those ratios more 
accurately. Were we to compute the numbers now to be 
found only as far as tenths, very many of the triangles' 
thus determined would not be visibly different ; for they 
are equal up to the tenths. They do not begin to differ 
from each other until hundredths are reached. Hence it 
is necessary for the numbers for right-angled triangles to 
be known at the least up to the hundredths. Even so.

considerable uncertainty now and then remains in the 
computation. This obliges us carefully to think over the 
differences of triangles in order to choose from among 
several possible methods of computation that one which, 
in every individual case, leads to our goal most surely. If, 
at length, in a few rare cases, even this precaution proves 
insufficient, then the A B C of Sense-Perception refers, 
by the very fact itself, to mathematics—to the science 
toward which the beginner’s exertions are directed. The 
hundredths that we beg of the science as a preliminary 
gift will be found in the following table : 
Of 45° the tangent is 1:00 ; the secant more than 1:41,

Even by adding the hundredths the tangents and se- 
cants are not perfectly determined. There are lacking 
thousandths, tens of thousandths, etc. For the tangent 
of 55° we have added the thousandths, since 8 thou- 
sandths make almost one hundredth, and in the case of 
so small a tangent as this, so large a number of thou- 
sandths is not to be held insignificant; for it is plain 
that, by comparison with the entire remaining magnitude 
of this tangent determined by 1:42, the additional 8 thou- 
sandths amount to more than if, for example—as is actu- 
ally the case—as many of them be omitted after the num- 
bers for the secant of 80°. In connection with 5 units, a 
few thousandths more or less may be overlooked more 
readily than in connection with one unit. If one does 
not desire to be particularly accurate in the reckoning,

1:43 may be written instead of 1-428, but the error result- 
ing at the end of the computation may easily amount to

*TIf teachers versed in mathematics desire to instruct on the 
basis of the present book, the following proposition of a reviewer 
may, under certain circumstances, be commendable: “The reviewer 
would use the names radius and tangent as they are used in trigo- 
nometry, and before going on to the general subject of triangles he 
would by the use of arithmetic, which at any rate must begin here, 
presenting what in relation to one angle was the tangent, in relation 
to the other as the radius, and conversely, derive from the ratios of 
the sides in the first nine model triangles that are known already, the 
corresponding numbers for the remaining possible nine, thus causing 
the fundamental table to become complete from within itself with- 
out an additional burden to the memory. It is the same computa- 
tion ”—not quite—* into which the author later on in the compo- 
sition of triangles is anyhow obliged to enter every moment. But 
it is only here scientifically in the right place. Besides, it offers a 
considerable advantage by all the rules for the computation of tri- 
angles in general coinciding in one, thus enabling the student to 
carry out the development of the whole more easily and systemat- 
ically.” This is the language of the mathematician, seeking every- 
where the formula of greatest universality. The teacher, on the 
contrary, avoids intentionally the mechanism of doing a great 
amount of work according to one rule. For this reason, and on ac- 
count of other minor considerations, the proposition is not adopted 
in the present edition. But for pupils who themselves have an 
inclination to see at once through the manifold as subordinated to 
the general, and therefore to carry out through all special cases the|

right-angled triangles acd and bed. In aed, ed, being the 
smallest side, is to be taken for the radius ; ad, the middle, 
for the tangent. But in bcd, ed is the tangent, db repre- 
senting the radius. The circumstance that cd in one tri- 
angle is to be considered as radius, in the other as tangent, 
brings in proportion. In Fig. 5 it is otherwise: ad is the 
radius for both triangles; here, therefore, we do not need 
proportion. Merely put down the numbers for both right- 
angled sections; add dd to dc; take care to give the num- 
ber 1 to the smallest side, ac; and triangle Fig. 5 is com- 
puted. Being the easiest computation, it is shown first. 
Let the angle at the left of the perpendicular be 60°, that 
on the right 50°. Then the whole angle at the apex will 
have 110°, the angle at the right of the base 40°, that at 
the left 30°; and the triangle is found in the first table, 
twelfth column, tenth row, except that the right and left 
are interchanged, which for computation is as indifferent 
as for the triangle itself. The numbers demanded by the 
angles are, in abd, 1, 1:73, 2; in acd, 1,119, 1:55. But 
in order to get rid of all confusion which might possibly 
be caused by the decimal fractions, imagine the entire 
triangle and all its sides 100 times as large; then the 
numbers become : 
for abd, for acd, 
100, 173, 200 ; 100, 119, 155. 
Now, the line dc consists of the two tangents bd and de; 
therefore, add 173 and 119, making 292. The number 
100, pertaining to the radius ad of the two right-angled 
triangles, is now superfluous, for in the whole triangle ad 
does not occur. But ac is the smallest side; therefore, ac- 
  
general rule to completion, the more uniform mode of computation 
would have its advantages, although the results are somewhat less 
accurate, as an attentive comparison will show.
-P-A-G-E-260
9296 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
cording to the preceding, its number 155 must be changed 
into 1. But if this side, or its number, rather, becomes 
155 times smaller, then, in order not to destroy the form, 
everything in the triangle must be diminished as many 
times: ac was 155, ab was 200, be was 292; all these num- 
bers must be divided by 155. 155 + 155 is of course 1; 
the following divisions are expressed thus : 
155)200(1-29 155)292(1:88 
450 1370 310 1240 
1400 1300 1395 1240 
5 60 
These divisions are continued into decimal fractions. 
Let the remainder 45 in the third line be thought of as 
450 tenths; in these are contained 2 tenths of 155; then 
let the remainder 140 in the fifth line, being tenths al- 
ready, be thought of as 1400 hundredths; in these are 
contained 9 hundredths of 155. As one tenth of 155 will 
be 15-5, one hundredth of 155 will be 1:55; two tenths, 
therefore, twice 15°5 or 31:0, and nine hundredths of the 
same number are 13°95. With these tenths and hun- 
dredths, as is apparent, we have continued the reckoning 
as though by whole numbers, only annexing to every re- 
mainder a zero. The zero is not illegitimately to make 
the remainder ten times as large, but only to represent 
the remaining units as ten times as large a number of 
tenths, the remaining tenths as ten times as large a num- 
ber of hundredths. The division of the tenths produces 
obviously tenths, the division of the hundredths produces 
hundredths. 
In both divisions the number of the hundredths has
-P-A-G-E-261
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 227 
become a little too large, but the mistake in the first di- 
vision does not amount to half a hundredth, and in the 
second to scarce a thousandth. The errors originate be- 
cause the numbers for the tangents and secants are not 
determined with sufficient accuracy even by the thou- 
sandths which we annexed. In the second table appended 
to the book, and computed by the aid of logarithms to 
tens of thousandths, the numbers indicating the ratios 
for the two largest sides of this triangle are given as 
1:2855, and 1:8794. The smallest side being always 1, it 
is everywhere omitted from the table. 
If the least obscurity should still remain as to how 
these numbers can determine the sides, the use of the 
instrument previously described, setting before the eye 
immediately the units, tenths, and hundredths, will secure 
the highest degree of clearness. 
Triangle Fig. 3, at the apex of which the angle of 85° 
is divided into 50° and 35°, is found in the tenth column, 
seventh row. Again put down, in the first place, the radii, 
tangents, and secants for both the right-angled pieces : 
B02 55 
100, 119, 155 100, 143, 174. 
Here cd in the triangle acd is 100, but in triangle cdb 
143. The reason is that in the latter triangle the stand- 
ard, namely, the radius dd, is smaller than in the former, 
where cd is itself the radius. If the exercises in enlarg- 
ing and reducing right-angled model triangles have been 
performed with care, all this should be plain. Being 
measured by a different standard, ad and db can not, of 
course, be added. It must be done, however, in order to 
obtain the side ab for the whole triangle: cb, being ob- 
viously smaller than ac, would likewise be expressed incor- 
rectly by the number 174, if ac retained the number 155. 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  928 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
In a given magnitude a smaller measure is contained 
more times than a larger. Therefore, bee measure de- 
creasing, the number grows. But the m¢ 
of this triangle by the same measure as ¢ asure for acd 
—namely, by becomes smaller, even though we now salb he sides 
the radius dd. Hence, the number for ¢ has already 
grown larger; it has increased from 100 to 148. The 
numbers 119 and 155 must now increase similarly, since 
for all the sides of acd the same diminution of measure 
prevails. 
Suppose the 100 had increased to 200, it would have 
grown to twice its former size; hence, 119 and 155 also 
would require to be doubled. Or suppose 100 had in- 
creased to 150; it would have grown one and one half 
times as large as it was before. Therefore, 119 and 155 
also would have to be taken one and one half times. 
Now, 100 has not increased to quite 150. How many 
times as large as it was it has become, c not be indi- 
cated without a fraction; but one thing is certain, namely, 
that 119 and 155 must be taken just as many times. Now, 
remember what we have said of proportion, and you have 
the following computation : 
143 x 119 ye ee 143) 155 100 :143 = 119: Fao — 100: 143 = 158

as was shown above. We have next to ad vision by 100,

100 to 17017. This makes 270:17. ae by our computa-

tion is 22165; cb having retained its original measure, 
remains at 174. But cd is the smallest side, and there- 
fore is to become 1. As all numbers have to be dimin- 
ished an equal number of times, divide 270:17 and 221°65 
by 174.

The 961 in the third line are tenths; the 917 in the 
fifth line are hundredths; dividing the tenths, we get 
tenths ; dividing the hundredths, we get hundredths. 
The first resulting number is too great by not quite a 
thousandth ; the second coincides exactly with the second 
table, in which the ratios for this triangle are given as 15498 
and 1:2743, the least side being again understood as 1. 
The computation of every triangle will take a course 
similar to these examples; but modifications are useful, 
that we may everywhere operate to the greatest possible 
advantage. To be sure, the advantage here ‘consists at 
the most in a few hundredths. But he who would learn 
computation must deem worthy of increased care and 
sharpened reflection even fractions far smaller. Besides, 
it is possible only by the modifications to remove tedium 
from these exercises. What right have we to require chil- 
dren to repeat the identical monotonous computation as 
many times as there are triangles, that with persistent at-

And in spite of all tables, what a blurred mixture these 
triangles would be to them were there no differences to 
observe in order that the computation, in the form which 
the teacher requires, may be furnished !

shown in the example in Fig. 5. To allow on the whole,

tion to be viewed free from interpolated remarks, we give 
an additional example. Let it be the triangle in the first

the numbers themselves amounts to very little. This com- 
putation consequently agrees after all very closely with 
that by which the second table was made. The latter 
gives 14905. In the present computation, too, we should 
have found the 9, but that the secant of 80° was shortened 
of the 8 thousandths belonging to it. 
In the triangles of the second class the perpendicular 
is to be regarded as at the same time radius and tangent, 
the former for the larger, the latter for the smaller right- 
angled piece, determined by the larger and the smaller 
angle at the perpendicular. Therefore, we may compute 
as in the former second example. The process, in the 
case of triangle Fig. 6, will be:

outside the triangle, is in this case unnecessary. With 
Fig. 7, however, such a change becomes more useful. It 
will be shown after the reckoning has been conducted in 
the usual way: |

By comparing the second table, we find for this tri- 
angle in the sixteenth column, seventh row, the numbers 
5:2192 and 4°7173. The computation, therefore, especially 
in the case of the first number, is more iT. at fault   
  than usual. This can be avoided. 
The reader has been reminded already that in the case 
of the larger tangents and secants the lacking thousandths 
do not matter so much asin the case of the smaller. Hence, 
the larger are to be regarded as more accurately given. In 
case of choice we shall prefer them for computation. 
In the present case, the better choice is “wae Look 
at the perpendicular de, in Fig. 7. It is dropped to the

production of the secant of the larger right-angled tri- 
angle from the opposite apex of the smaller. Thus origi- 
nates triangle ead, which is a part of a larger triangle, ebc, 
with which it has the right angle at ein common. ea is 
the radius, ed the tangent, and ad the secant in ead; on 
the other hand, in ecd, eb is the radius, ec the tangent, 
and dc the secant. How shall we find the angles in the 
triangles? c¢ has 10°; 0, in the whole triangle edc, must, 
together with c, amount to 90°, and hence by itself to 80°. 
Subtracting from the latter number 55°, there remains for 
the little triangle ead, at 6, an angle of 25°. Consequently, 
the same triangle, in order to complete 90° for the two 
acute angles, has at a@ another of 65°. Now we can put 
down the numbers for ead and ebc. By proportion we first 
reduce them to the same standard; then subtract ea from 
ec, and at last properly divide by ad, which, being the small- 
est side in abc, must become 1. The advantage is that 
the tangents and secants of 65° and 80°, instead of as for- 
merly of 55° and 80°, enter into the computation. The 
difference in correctness in the numbers here known for 
65° and for 55° respectively is not too small to rectify 
noticeably the results previously found.

The greater necessity for changing the his eth 
in Fig. 7 rather than in Fig. 6 originates principally be- 
cause in the latter when using proportion the numbers 
multiplied were not so great, “and consequently did not 
multiply so many times the errors in he small tangent 
and secant. Since the large numbers obviously come of 
the large angles or of the more elongated form of the 
triangle, the more careful computation here employed is 
especially needed for the triangles in the last columns, 
with the exception of those in the uppermost rows in 
which the common computation employs the Hay ger num- 
bers anyway. 
The triangles of the third and fourth classes are in the 
front half of the table. We have noticed already the repe- 
titions which occur here, since the perpendicular may be 
dropped from any apex of the triangle, thus dividing the 
triangle into rectangles in three different ways. From| 
this results the arbitrary possibility of any one of three 
computations; or, rather, the question which of three| 
triangular divisions will give the safest computation. 
The difference between the last two classes consists i 
the fact that in the third class it is still possible to con 
sider the perpendicular as radius for one of the right 
angled sections, while in the fourth class the perpendiculay 
must be taken as the tangent in both sections. Now, fro’ 
the former computations we recall that in proportion th     
   
     
    
   
   
    
  
-P-A-G-E-269
  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 235 
first number was always 100—not only an easy divisor, but 
admitting no uncertainty as to the correctness of the num- 
ber, the 100 being a radius intended as 1, and only con- 
ceived a hundred times larger in order that we might be 
able to treat the decimal fractions as integers. The radius 
being itself the measure for the other sides, there is no 
question in its case as to the possibility of some lacking 
thousandths, tens of thousandths, and so on, whose ab- 
sence in the case of tangents and secants causes always 
some slight uncertainty. If, on the latter account, our 
computations already are inexact as to thousandths, they 
will now become even more uncertain, since in the fourth 
class we are compelled to use, instead of the number 100, 
a tangent, the liability to error increasing as size decreases ; 
and here it is the smallest number which from a safe 
changes into an unsafe one. 
In order to escape this inconvenience as long as pos- 
sible, the first rule for the third class is as follows: Never 
divide the triangle so as to make both angles at the per- 
pendicular less than 45°, and thus the opposite sides radii, 
but have a care to make at least one angle of more than 
45° at the perpendicular, and therefore the perpendicular 
itself the radius for one of the right-angled pieces. Re- 
membering also that larger tangents are given more accu- 
rately than smaller, there will be no further doubt as to 
the course to be taken in computation. 
In Fig. 8 the perpendicular ce is entirely unservice- 
able, for it would be tangent in both the triangle dce and 
the triangle ace. The remaining choice between ad and 
of is decided by of being the tangent of a very large angle 
at a, and having, therefore, as to ad, the advantage of 
greater exactness. The whole triangle abc is to be di- 
vided, then, into aif and dcf, making the angle at a 
85°, that at ¢ 40°; consequently giving to triangle dcf, at

The triangle may be found in the tenth column, first 
row. The numbers are perfectly accurate. Hence, the 
same triangle, on account of the repetitions, occurs also in 
the tenth column, seventh row, and in the seventh col- 
umn, first row. In the three different places the perpen- 
dicular divides the three different angles. At the two last- 
named places this division was inconvenient for computa- 
tion. We had to find the triangle at the first place in 
order to be led at once into the right course by the indi- 
cation in the table that points out the division of the 
angle at the apex. One should make it a general rule to 
look for triangles of the third class in the upper rows, but 
in the rear columns, where we always find one angle at the

perpendicular over 45°, and the other as small, and there- 
fore the corresponding angle at the base and the tangent 
of the latter as large as is possible in the triangle. 
In the case of triangles of the fourth class, on the con- 
trary, in order to diminish inexactness as far as possible, 
select from the first rows and first columns, for there the 
angles at the base and the tangents belonging to them are 
greatest. 
Triangle Fig. 9 occurs in the sixth column, fifth row, 
and again twice close by in the next column and row. 
It should be taken, however, at the first place. In the 
figure use the perpendicular &f, since at } it has the 
acutest angles adjoining it, those at the base being all the 
greater for it, having 60° and 65°. 
60 | 65 100, 173, 200 | 100, 214, 236 
The first 100 here stands for cf, the second for af. 
Both pieces of the base have become radii; but this was 
inevitable, as a look at the figure shows. Whether we 
take ab or bc as the base, either one would divide into 
pieces each smaller than the dividing perpendicular. As 
compared with the sections of its corresponding base, df is 
at least the largest perpendicular. In one case it is the - 
tangent of 60°; fc being the radius and therefore equal to 
100, of is equal to 173. In the other case it is the tan- 
gent of 65°, or, af being the radius and therefore equal to 
100, bf is equal to 214. The second time it is measured 
by the smaller measure ; hence, the number is larger. The 
other two numbers belonging to the triangle cbf must be 
enlarged at the same ratio, since all the sides are to be 
reduced to the same—to wit, the smallest measure. Hence, 
100 and 200 increase at the ratio at which 173 increases 
to 214. This originates the following proportions:

The divisions are here continued in decimal fractions 
by means of zeros appended to the remainders, represent- 
ing the remaining tenths as ten Cine a many hun- 
dredths, and so on. The procedure was necessary here 
because the resultant numbers haye to be used in further 
computation. For this purpose they must not lack the 
appended tenths and hundredths. That even thousandths 
were found is because the thousandths in this example 
visibly amount to almost a hundredth. We shall for 
brevity take them as such, writing instead of 123-699, 
123-70; and instead of 247-398, 247-40. In the first place 
we must add cf and fa, then divide by the smallest side,

still has seven tenths appended to it, think of it as ten 
times larger. It becomes 2237. In order to remedy the 
mistake thus arising, the numbers to be divided are also 
to be taken ten times larger. ‘This will amount to a mul- 
tiplication by 10 followed by a division by 10, which can- 
cels the multiplication.

The caution with which this computation has been 
conducted is rewarded by its being almost exact even in 
the thousandths, In the second division the last re- 
mainder is so large as to allow nearly of the writing of a 
6 instead of the last 5, precisely as required by the second 
‘table, which gives for this triangle 1:0572 and 1:1064. 
If the teacher will explain everything more definitely, 
or, rather, set forth everything more in detail, the methods 
indicated will make it possible for the children to com- 
pute the ratios for every triangle given in the second table. 
But it must not only remain possible; it must become 
actual. A few scattered instances would merely be exam- 
ples in arithmetic. The manifoldness of the triangles 
themselves should be exhausted. It must become, in the 
truest sense, an object of knowledge. To the mathema- 
tician the possession of methods for helping himself, if a 
case arises, is sufficient. But for the culture of sense-per- 
ception, actual acquaintance with all the possible cases and 
their ready and definite discrimination are the main ob- 
ject. Computation is only an auxiliary for getting at the 
18 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
       
    240 HERBART’S A BC OF SHNSE-PERCEPTION, 
    main point. The eye is to be caused to note even slight 
differences in the positions of three points. It is to com- 
pare and to measure against each other the different dis- 
tances of these points. It is to take heed of how much 
or how little a pair of lines are inclined toward each 
other. To speak generally, we must bring the eye to the 
point of shaping what it sees and of fixing what it has 
shaped. It must single out from the innumerable rela- 
tions offered by a single view certain chief relations, and 
erect upon the latter, securely progressing, the edifice of 
the rest. But in order to this the eye must be occupied 
primarily with the simplest fundamental forms. These 
occupations must be such as to make these forms, which 
are intrinsically devoid of charm, eet of reflection, 
and, as such, important and, if possible, interesting, while 
changing them from immediate percepts into concepts, 
which can be discussed and on which common judgments 
can be rendered. ‘To all these purposes computation 
serves, and for them it must not fail to be used. 
None of the examples by which computation is eluci- 
dated and practised must be lost. The results must be 
entered for preservation each time. To gather up the 
products of diligence, even if it had but the appearance 
of purpose, would be advisable if only for the reason that 
it is neither enjoyable nor a good habit to perform labour 
that is lost. In this case the collecting of ange com- 
puted for the sake of practice serves as the foundation 
for a larger collection, even possibly as an incitement to 
perfect an already half-won possession. 
Therefore, even though the art of reckoning has grown 
sufficiently easy, let the computation of the remaining 
model triangles be finished. The pupil will make up for 
himself a table which will coincide with the second table 
here appended, except that it will not give as many deci-

mal places. Where several pupils are studying together 
the work can, to some extent, be divided. The better way, 
however, is to let them only verify each other’s computa- 
tions, while otherwise all work out every problem. Thus 
every one will find occasion to draw every triangle for 
himself, and the eye will become uniformly acquainted 
with them all. In addition to the numerical table there 
should be drawn up a corresponding table of figures. In 
the latter, all the triangles as far as feasible should be 
drawn on a variety of scales, making the shortest sides 
equal always, the greatly elongated triangles, however, 
being drawn half size. Both tables, further on, serve 
many uses. 
VU. Episode—Computation of the Intermediate Tri- 
angles. 
For sense-perception it may suffice to distinguish the 
model triangles, and to be ‘able to indicate, in the case of 
any given triangle, between which of them it lies. But in 
order to prepare for mathematics it will be to the purpose 
to consider also the continuity between these points—in 
other words, the possibilities that are passed over by the 
triangles in the tables. 
It is plain that in the first table there may be rows 
between the rows, columns between the columns. Were 
the angles at the perpendicular to progress not from 5° to 
5°, but from degree to degree, very many more triangles 
would enter the table. It would thus expand from within. 
The triangles now present would be dispersed among the 
others, but without the slightest disturbance in arrange- 
ment. But the space between any two would seem to 
have enlarged by receiving four additional triangles, and 
only seem so, for the distance of five degrees neither in-

creases nor diminishes by being traversed by shorter or 
longer steps. 
If the angles should proceed by minutes only—by sec- 
onds only—the number of intervening rows and columns 
would be still more increased. It is absolutely indeter- 
minable how many rows and columns there might be, for 
even the step from second to second is infinitely subdi- 
visible. 
Still, any triangle might be regarded as consisting of 
two right-angled triangles. The preceding methods of 
computation would remain applicable, provided one only 
possessed the numbers for the intervening tangents and 
secants. 
The mathematician has for these lines printed tables. 
The A BC of Sense-Perception 
table, portable in any memory,

were weighted with new burdens 
hooves us, therefore, to take car nows of nothing but its 
ever through life to be

it might break. It be- 
to put our little posses- 
sion to its utmost possible use by reflection. However, in 
doing sowe shall sensibly feel the limits, which we can 
not break through without science. T'o awaken this feel- 
ing is the chief aim now. | 
To begin with, objectify once more by drawings, mova- 
ble staffs, etc., the accelerated in ease of the tangents and 
secants when the angle progresses uniformly. The tan- 
gents of 46°, 47°, 48°, 49° traverse, no doubt, the differ- 
ence between those of 45° and of 50°. Just so the dif- 
ference from 50° to 55° is traversed by the intervening 
tangents for 51°, 52°, 53°,54°. So, likewise, each of the 
following differences visible in Fig. 1 between the num- 
bers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 will be ivided into five parts by 
inserting between the tangents drawn in the figure all 
those pertaining to the angle in its rT froin. degree    
-P-A-G-E-277
  
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY, 243 
to degree. But will the parts into which each difference 
is divided be five equal parts? Certainly not. The first 
parts will be smaller, the latter greater. Yet, if we desired 
to give not an exact but only an average indication by 
how much the tangents grow in this or that region, each 
of the differences might, to this end, be divided into five 
equal parts. Here, having no means of determining the 
parts accurately, we must needs content ourselves with at 
first making them equal, and rectifying them, perhaps, to 
some degree subsequently. 
The following table, besides the known tangents and 
secants, shows their differences, and each difference is 
furthermore divided by five. For example, the difference 
for the tangents of 45° and 50° is 19 hundredths, of which 
      the fifth part is almost 4 hundredths :

On an average, then, according to this table, the tan- 
gents will grow between 45° and 50° by 4 hundredths for 
one degree; between 50° and 55°, by 5 hundredths; be-

tween 55° and 60°, by 6 hundredths, lisa soon. By this 
means the tangent of 46° is found to be about 1:04; that 
of 47°, about 1:08; that of 51°, about 1:24—that is, 1:19 
plus 05; that of 58°, about 1-61—that is, 1:43 plus thrice 
‘06, since 58° equals 55° plus 3°; that of 59°, about 1-67, 
and so forth. 
Now this must be rectified so as to make the first in 
each of five increments smaller, and the latter, or at least 
the last, greater than is indicated by the average. Up to 
65° the correction for the present purpose is easy. Drop 
simply every time one hundredth. For instance, instead 
of 1:04 put 1:03; instead of 1:08 put 1:07; instead of 1°67 
put 1-66, ete. Thus the last increment becomes of itself 
greater. The tangent of 59° being 1°66, and the follow- 
ing of 60° being 1-73, this progress, the last one of the 
five between 55° and 60°, amounts obviously to 07. It 
is therefore 01 larger, and was bound to be so, since the 
four preceding tangents were all taken ‘01 smaller than 
is indicated by the average. 
Obviously the correction is very crude, merely made 
by estimate and haphazard. In what respect and to what 
extent it is utilizable we could have only poor notion, if 
the large tables of the mathematicians did not furnish us 
confirmation. But this correction does not hold beyond 
65°. For does not even eyesight show that the larger 
tangents deviate from the average by very much more than 
one hundredth? Simply try to determine on this plan 
the tangents between 75° and 80°. Throw away, if you 
will, more than one hundredth. Use every care to divide 
the whole difference, here according to the table amount- 
ing to 1-94, into five unequal, ever increasing parts. Will 
you guess the correct numbers? They are found in the 
following table :

The last numbers, which are bracketed, are those that 
would have resulted according to the given average—that

every difference would be 0:39; this example shows how 
the first three differences are smaller, while the last two 
are greater. 
The preceding illustration will indicate sufficiently how 
the teacher ought to direct the attention and to excite in- 
quiry by experiments on the rate of increment of magni- 
tudes not increasing uniformly, such as tangents and se- 
cants, before giving the numbers themselves. The same 
suggestion ought to be followed in presenting the elements 
of mathematics, logarithms, sines, cosines, etc. Let the 
teacher add one additional observation. The progress of 
the tangents and secants, however lacking in uniformity, 
is nevertheless throughout determined necessarily and com- 
pletely by the further and further opening of the angle. 
Hence, there must certainly be some universal rule stating 
in general terms this necessity, this dependence of tan- 
gents and secants on angles. Thus the teacher will pro- 
duce a conception of mathematics as the science of such 
rules, a conception many students do not possess even after 
completing their entire course in so-called pure mathe- 
matics.

Below we give, from degree to degree, the tangents and 
secants above 65°. It is understood that they are not 
given to be learned by heart. They are a present from the 
teacher to those pupils who have learned to appreciate it.

We are now prepared to compute Ps: triangles. 
Let a triangle have the following angles: 74°, 43°, and 
consequently a third of 63°; the ratio of the sides is re- 
quired. The triangle is acute-angled, of the third class. 
According to the foregoing rules, we are, for the purpose 
of computation, to look it out in the upper row, in the 
rear columns. Under the third row conceive inserted 
another row, which will have at the left of the base an 
angle of 74°. It runs through all the columns. Among 
others, it strikes the tenth column, where the angle at the 
right of the base is 40°. This angle would change into 
41°, then into 42°, and then into 43°, if we set between 
the tenth and ninth columns intercalary columns. The 
angle at the apex gains what the others lose, and reversely. 
Here it gains 1°, and at the same time loses 3°. It con- 
sequently loses in all 2°, and from 65° becomes 63°. Thus
-P-A-G-E-281
  
OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY, 247 
the place of the triangle in the first table is determined. 
How the angle at the apex is to be divided is indicated 
by the angles at the base, as it must furnish the comple- 
ments to make each = 90°. The 63° divide into 16° to 
complement the angle of 74°, and 47° to complement the 
angle of 43°. We shall use, therefore, in computation the 
tangents and secants of 74° and of 47°. Those of 74° ap- 
pear in the table just given. How to find those of 47° has 
also been shown. ‘To the tangent 1 add twice ‘04 less ‘01. 
To the secant 1-41 add twice 03 less (01. The tangent 
will be 1:07, and the secant 1:46. The computation then 
proceeds altogether as before. Its result is that the sides 
have almost the ratio of 1 to 1:3, and to 1:4; or as 10 to 
13 and 14. By comparing the second table, it will be 
seen how these numbers fall between those there given. 
The following exercises a teacher familiar with loga- 
rithms can very readily increase at pleasure:

As regards the form of instruction, we wish once more 
to insert the general observation that the student, when 
the angles have been given out, should always make on 
his slate a sketch, however crude, of the approximate shape 
of the triangle, and keep it before him during computa- 
tion. This keeps present to his mind the meaning of the 
numbers and prevents confusion. 
VILL. Gathering the Results.—Trigonometrical Questions. 
The sum total of the required elementary percepts has 
now been brought together. Each has its number. By 
this means it is not only indicated and fixed, as in lan-
-P-A-G-E-282
  248 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
guage a thought is fixed by its word, ee everything by its 
name, but it is also comprehended as to its essence, and 
the concept is properly expressed. Pure form without 
magnitude is no object of bodily vision at all. Relations 
of form are reached only by numerical concepts.* 
But imagination mediates between the concept and 
the percept. Without entirely banishing magnitude from 
form, it makes magnitude accidental by enlargement and 
by reduction. For this reason transition is rendered easy 
from figure to number in larger and smaller representa- 
tions of an identical form, for which we introduced both 
the exercises in making drawings larger and smaller, and 
the instrument indicated in Fig. 4, If, therefore, the 
teacher has well administered his duty—if he has not 
allowed his pupils to lapse into mechanical computation— 
the eye, the imagination, and the understanding must by 
this time be equally accustomed to, and on friendly terms 
with, our triangular model forms. 
Now, the important point is to make a good combina- 
tion of all this detail, and elevate the many concepts of 
number into a unit of thought; to present them as transi- 
tional, as flowing into one another, and thus as constitut- 
ing one continuity. For this purpose we need, in the first 
place, an attentive observation of the second table, and 
then a few exercises which give occasion to search and 
traverse this table in all directions. 
In the second table all repetitions are omitted. Thus 
we now find at the left corner the equilateral triangle 
alone, and the farther from this corner the more we re- 
move from equilaterality. Every column terminates in an 
  
* Numerical concepts do not, however, attain what is properly 
spatial, namely, distance generally, and position or angles. For 
this reason an A BC of Sense-Perception must not fail to observe 
its peculiar difference from merely objectified arithmetic.

  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 249 
isosceles triangle; even above the columns commence 
alternately perfect or almost perfect isosceles triangles. 
The difference between the lower and the upper isosceles 
triangles consists in this: Below there is always one side 
equal to the smallest side, and hence equal to 1; the other 
side, being the smallest side itself, is omitted from the 
table. Above, on the contrary, two equal numbers ap- 
pear, both greater than 1; they indicate the equal sides; 
the omitted smallest side is the base. In the lower tri- 
angles, therefore, the base is greater, in the upper tri- 
angles smaller, than the equal sides. 
Precisely because going from the left to the right we 
remove farther and farther from equilaterality, the num- 
bers in the rows constantly increase; they signify sides 
which compared with the smallest become ever greater. 
The angle at the right of the perpendicular* opens 
farther and farther, thus the right side and the base in- 
crease. On the contrary, the angle at the left remains 
constant throughout each row, and with it remains un- 
altered the smallest side. For all the triangles occurring 
in the second table have, it will be observed, on account 
of the arrangement of the table, the smallest side in every 
instance at the left, the intermediate at the right, the 
greatest lying below as the base. This arises from the 
largest angle, the repetitions in the first table being cut 
  
* For angles always compare the first table. In the second, the 
numbers for the angles could not well be placed so as to indicate 
their position. On the contrary, at the right, beside the rows, those 
angles are indicated which conformably to the presentation here 
chosen must be thought of as being at the left; above are those 
that belong at the right. The larger numbers indicate the angles 
at the base, and the smaller those at the perpendicular, which, taken 
together, constitute the angle at the apex. Practise the imagination 
so as to think the numbers into their places at once.

off, being always situated in the apex, and the smallest to 
_ the right, which determines the op | site sides. 
A slight confusion might arise in the use of the word 
base with the upper isosceles triangles. This may, how- 
ever, be obviated easily by a caution; namely, of the equal 
sides in this case one lies below, and the smallest side, 
which should be the base, if the triangle had its accus- 
tomed position, is placed, as always, at the left. 
A little less easy than in the rows is the explanation 
of the progress of the numbers in the columns. In the 
first place, separate the acute-angled triangles, retaining 
only the obtuse-angled, or, in other words, that portion 
which lies at the right of the diagonal running through 
the right-angled triangles. In each column the angle at 
the right of the perpendicular remains unaltered ; that to 
the left opens, and through it increases, in addition to the 
base, the smallest side. Now, it is the latter with which 
the other sides are compared. It is their measure. When 
a measure becomes greater it is no longer contained as 
many times in that which is measured ; the number indi- 
cating how many times it is contained becomes smaller. 
This is the reason why the numbers decrease as we descend 
the columns. At last the left side becomes equal to the 
right. This makes the triangles isosceles and terminates 
the column. 
In the obtuse-angled triangles, for the reason suggested, 
both the numbers decrease. The base, to be sure, increases 
also as the smallest side enlarges. But let the latter be- 
come greater and greater—let it become infinite—the 
base then becomes also infinite. The difference between 
the two as compared with the sides themselves becoming 
less and less considerable, they may be considered almost 
equal. Calling, then, the side 1, the base, too, is hardly 
more than 1. Here in our columns, to be sure, the left
-P-A-G-E-285
  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. O51 
side must not exceed the right; still this observation ex- 
plains to some degree that the base, though it increases, 
approaches nevertheless the ratio of equality with the 
smallest side, and hence that its number, which must ex- 
press this approximation in ratio, can not become larger, 
but only smaller. 
This latter observation does not fit the acute-angled 
triangles found above the diagonal running through the 
rectangular triangles. In them the larger number, which 
indicates the base, is seen to increase constantly ; only the 
smaller number decreases. The number for the right side, 
of course, must decrease, as the right side remains un- 
altered while its measure, the left or the smallest side, 
increases. This will be understood from the preceding. 
But it has been just shown that the number for the base 
need not necessarily increase by reason of the base itself 
increasing ; and now we find, none the less, that the num- 
ber here increases with the line. The former is true of 
obtuse-angled, the latter of acute-angled triangles. But 
how can this distinction of triangles cause the base, 
which increases in both cases, to receive in the former 
case decreasing and in the latter case increasing num- 
bers ? 
For the mathematician this difficulty does not exist; 
he knows from the relations of the sines that it can not 
be otherwise. But here the matter can not be elucidated 
clearly. It must be taken notice of as one of the future 
questions in mathematics. 
To some extent Fig. 10 may be used for elucidation. 
Compare triangles abe and aec. When the lines ab and 
ae, by the further opening of the angle, merge respectively 
into the nearest dotted line, what consequence follows for 
the base and for the smallest side? Both gain; but if 
the angle at the perpendicular is small, as in the case of
-P-A-G-E-286
952 HERBART’S ABC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
ab, the increase of the smallest side is insignificant; the 
base increases much more. Hence the measured gains 
far more than the measure. If the angle at the perpen- 
dicular is, on the contrary, large, as in the case of ae, both 
gain equally. It is an additional point to consider whether 
the growth of the base amounts to much in comparison 
with the base itself. This depends upon its size, and, in 
connection with it, on the size of the angle at the other 
side of the perpendicular. If it extends as far as f, its 
ratio of growth does not amount to as much as if it ex- 
tends only as farasc. Taking all this together, this much 
is plain: that the angle at the apex, comprehending the 
two at the perpendicular, must not be too large if the base 
is to grow more in proportion than the smallest side. If 
it be greater than 90°, then the 7 table tells us that 
the smallest side, in comparison with itself and in com- 
parison with the other sides, grows more than the base, 
making the number for the latter, therefore, smaller. 
Our considerations—and they must not fatigue the 
patience, as they are necessary to the use of the second 
table—have not yet been made exact and definite enough. 
It is not sufficient to know merely that certain magnitudes 
increase or decrease; we must also inquire how far, how 
rapidly, they progress. And here, especially, we must 
take into consideration the difference between the two 
numbers pertaining to one and the same triangle. 
’ Traverse the rows. It appears that the numbers grow 
with ever-increasing rapidity. This will be explained at 
once by imagining the triangles, and remembering how 
the angle at the right of the perpendicular accelerates its 
tangent and its secant more and more the farther it opens. 
Finally, it is also plain that this growth is not confined to 
the numbers in the table, but continues to infinity if the 
angle is opened beyond 85°.
-P-A-G-E-287
  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. 253 
Traverse the columns; first the hindmost. Behind 
the last in the table there would be columns were the 
rows lengthened. These columns would commence above 
by far greater numbers. Even the hindmost column in 
the table has incomparably greater numbers than all the 
other columns. It terminates, however, in 1 and 1-9924. 
It traverses, therefore, the identical numbers which also 
occur in the other columns. This is true of every rear 
column in relation to those preceding it. This cireum- 
stance makes it somewhat troublesome to assign to given 
numbers their place in the table. Numbers not amount- 
ing to much over 1 and 2 might singly be brought in 
almost anywhere. But for any determinate triangle there 
are always two numbers given. The point is to find the 
place into which both will fit simultaneously. If, for ex- 
ample, 1°6 and 2 are given: the number 1°6 appears at 
several places in the table—for instance, in row thirteen, 
column fifteen ; but we do not, at the same time, find 2 but 
2-4; therefore this can not be the place for the numbers. 
To find the place one must have got one’s bearings among 
the differences of the numbers which belong to the same 
kind of triangle. 
For this purpose we assume certain points of view in 
the table whence we may survey it. 
Traverse the diagonal of right-angled triangles from 
right to left, omitting alternate triangles. Between the 
numbers 11:43 and 11:47 we find but little difference; be- 
tween 3°73 and 3°86 it is somewhat more than 1 tenth; 
between 2°14 and 2°36 a little over 2 tenths; between 1:42 
and 1°74 a little over 3 tenths; and between 1 and 1:41 
somewhat more than 4 tenths. 
Traverse row nine. It divides the field of obtuse-angled 
triangles through the middle. Here we find the difference 
to be between 1:41 and 1:93, about 5 tenths; between 2°73
-P-A-G-E-288
See aay ee ee ee ee a ee 
954 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
and 3°34, about 6 tenths; between dish and 8-789 it is 
not quite 7 tenths. 
These differences should be remembered. 
At the end of each column the difference of the num- 
bers belonging together is visible at once. It amounts to 
exactly the decimal of the lower number, the units cancel- 
ling by subtraction. 
Near the head of the columns there is no or almost 
no difference, but it grows continually till it attains to 
the decimal fraction just mentioned. The differences 
which we have but just noted serve in a degree to trace 
this growth, because most columns—and these the larger 
—are cut by that diagonal and by that row. 
We are now sufficiently prepared for the solution of 
the following questions which belong to trigonometry : 
It may be required to make a triangle out of three 
sides of given lengths; or the sides of a triangle may be 
known, the angles unknown. In this case the problem is 
to find the angles. Similarly, two sides and one angle 
may be given. In this case, the third side and the remain- 
ing two angles are to be found. 
In these problems we must ont form from size. 
If, for example, the lengths of the sides are 2, 3, and 
4 feet, the triangle will certainly have a definite size. 
This the second table ignores. The smallest side in it is 
always 1. But the 3 and 4 feet may also be measured by 
the 2 feet—i.e., the inquiry may be how many times 
these are contained in those. The measurement is per- 
formed by dividing 3 and 4 by 2. If the division is con- 
tinued into decimals, the resulting numbers must either 
occur in the second table or it must at least be possible to 
assign their places among its numbers, since all the num- 
bers in this table signify nothing else than how many 
times the smallest side of a triangle of altogether arbitrary
-P-A-G-E-289
  OBJECT LESSONS IN TRIGONOMETRY. Oba 
magnitude is contained in the other two sides. To find 
that place is the kind of solution of these questions which 
is suitable to the A B C of Sense-Perception. Methods re- 
sembiing those of mathematics would be as devoid of pur- 
pose as they would be impossible. Here the triangles are 
considered as objects of knowledge, not of computation. 
Our sole concern is to recognise them by the ratios of 
their sides as well as by their angles, and to find them out 
among the other triangles. The division required is here 
very easy: 
2)3-0(1'5 2)4(2 
2 4 0 = 
10 
‘We must find, then, in the table the numbers 1°5 and 
2. That we shall not be liable to mistake the 2 in row 
six, column twelve, for our 2, is self-evident, since in that 
place the number which belongs with the 2 is1‘7. We 
have to look in some place in which the difference can 
amount to 5 tenths. We have therefore wholly missed 
the region, though close to that 2, at the left, occurs a 
number, 1°5098, that seems to coincide with our 15. On 
the contrary, we must seek for orientation in row eleven, 
at the numbers 1:41 and 1:93, which have the required 
difference. From this point in what direction shall we 
turn? The numbers must increase; certainly not, there- 
fore, to the left. Nor straight up or down; the difference 
would be too large in this direction, too small in that. 
But straight on in the row the difference increases. Di- 
agonally down it grows likewise. Hence, nothing remains 
but to mount very slightly diagonally to the right. It is 
obvious that here the numbers 1:41 and 1-93, while in- 
creasing into those neighbouring them, must pass through 
19
-P-A-G-E-290
  956 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
15 and 2. Hence the triangle is to be located between 
rows thirteen and nine, and between columns twelve and 
thirteen. It has therefore one angle between 50° and 45° 
and another between 20° and 25°. 
The finding of the direction whither we must turn was 
made a little difficult intentionally for the sake of prac- 
tice in surveying the table. Merely by comparing row 
eleven with the isosceles triangles the direction is appar- 
ent in which approximately equal differences are to be 
expected. The decimal fraction ‘5321 below, in column 
ten, taken together with the numbers 1:41 and 1:93, or 
the decimal fraction -7320, together with the last numbers 
of row eleven, whose difference also amounts to nearly 7 
tenths, indicate this direction, only the latter indicate it 
somewhat too obliquely. It is indicated, however, with 
especial distinctness by the upper isosceles triangles, when 
taken together ina line. In them the difference is no 
doubt equal. It is 0—that is to say, there is none. 
With the aid of our last remark it is no longer diffi- 
cult to assign to all the triangles determined by the sides 
their positions in the table, and thus to find their angles. 
Let the sides be 3, 4, and 5 feet long; 4 and 5 are first 
divided by 3:

diagonal direction, starting from the middle between the

given sides actually is right-angled. Its numbers, it is 
apparent, fall midway between rows seven and eight in the 
transition from column ten to column eleven. Besides 
the right angle, it therefore has another between 50° 
and 55°. 
Let the sides be 3, 8, and 9 feet. 9+3=3and8+3=

tinue in the former direction, toward the right. The 
numbers 2°53 and 2°87 still give the difference too large, 
and are themselves too small. A little farther upward 
we come to numbers that are too large already. The tri- 
angle, therefore, lies between rows five and six and col- 
umns fourteen and fifteen. It has angles between 65° 
and 60° and between 20° and 15°. 
Let the sides be 10, 13, 14 miles—whether miles or feet 
makes here no difference. The numbers will be 1, 1:3, 
1:4; the difference 0-1. This difference will be found 
close under the line of the upper isosceles triangles. The 
numbers fall between rows five and six, and columns nine 
and ten. The angles are between 55° and 60°, and be- 
tween 45° and 40°. 
Let the numbers be 10, 19, 25, or 1, 1:9, 2°5. The 
difference will be 0:6. A little above the nethermost 
numbers in column eleven begin to go upward in the 
well-known direction. We come to the numbers 2:06 and 
2°64, which are too great already. The triangle lies be- 
tween rows nine and ten and columns thirteen and four- 
teen, and has angles of nearly 45° and 20°. 
Let the numbers be 1, 1°8, 2:6—difference, 0-8. Angles 
very nearly 30° and 15°. 
By the aid of the instrument abl 4, it is very easy to 
practise this work. 
When the problem is solved, let the fein be sketched 
each time.

  258 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
It is obvious we have here the regress from given con- 
cepts to the corresponding percepts, as formerly, in com- 
puting the sides from given angles, progress occurred from 
the percepts to the concepts. 
If it be desired to connect the Hrocpt and the con- 
cept still more immediately, still more simultaneously, the 
second problem mentioned above may be used, which gives 
two sides* and one angle. It thus gives the triangle 
partly by concept, partly by perception, but by both only 
imperfectly, the student being left to find the complete 
determination. At any rate, this problem could be 
solved from the table or by computations alone only with 
difficulty. Being now entitled to suppose practice in 
drawing and an acquaintance, already somewhat familiar, 
with the second table, we may adopt the following method : 
A triangle—one angle of which is given—can always be 
drawn pretty accurately. This being done, its very shape 
will permit us to recognise, in a measure, in what region 
of the second table it belongs. We may get additional 
aid from the given angle, which in this particular region 
of the table can, of course, occur in only one line—column, 
row, or diagonal. Compare also the ratios of the given 
sides with the numbers in the table. From this the true 
place of the triangle may be determined with considerable 
exactness. The exercise requiring drawing, examples can 
not well here be given. It is intended only for the abler 
among the pupils, and for this reason we may be the 
rather permitted to abstain from apne exposition. 
Perhaps it will seem desirable that the determinations 
  
* Do not mistake given sides for given pereepts—at all events, 
not in respect to shape; and it is with the latter, not with magni- 
tude, that we have to do. The sides give us nothing but their ratio, 
and that is a concept.

of the triangles by the sides be less uncertain. It is a 
matter of rendering the table more complete, and the fact 
is, that a rather easy method might be given for interpo- 
lating intermediate members. If it were permitted to ex- 
pand the plan of the A BC of Sense-Perception beyond 
the necessary relations—if, for example, we desired also 
to practise the imagination in the presentation of physical 
spaces—the present elementary exercises might fittingly 
be increased to twice the number; but considering the 
mean opinion usually entertained by pedagogues of the 
abilities of children, even what is given thus far may per- 
haps appear to many too difficult and too long. At all 
events, to break off here is more modest. 
Turrp SEcTION, 
USE OF THE A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
If the reader has had the kindness to follow the writer 
attentively to the end of the preceding section, and has 
not decided as yet for rejection, he will not be willing to 
grant to the author permission to retire absolutely at this 
point. Aside from the additions perhaps suitable, or pos- 
sibly even essential, to that circle of preliminary exercises, 
it remains to fit, in a suitable manner, this circle into the 
other parts of instruction. Its use must become visible, 
and it must be definitely pointed out by what procedure 
the same may be realized. Otherwise this use will appear 
altogether chimerical, which would place our proposed ex- 
ercises in the objectionable catalogue of foolish and airy 
projects. There is much instruction and reading which 
without either preparation or sequel is thrust in haphazard 
among other studies, and which leaves scarcely even the 
joyless recollection of a vain endeavour. These prelimi- 
nary exercises would be nothing better if, without being
-P-A-G-E-294
  260 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
worked up any further, this raw material were now left 
to itself. 
How little these meagre fundamental forms, by them- 
selves alone, would effect for the improvement of sense- 
perception is easy to conceive. ‘True, as early as the be- 
ginning of the First Section their occurrence as component 
parts in every shape, howsoever composite, and the facili- 
tation of the articulation of forms by their means, were 
mentioned. In fact, the application of the A BO of 
Sense-Perception -was there indicated as far as the general 
idea is concerned. Still, nothing was indicated but the 
concept, and this only as one member in a series of thoughts 
which in that inquiry served to find the materials for the 
A BC of Sense-Perception. But when a conception is to 
be actualized, when thus as a force it is to enter into com- 
bination and conflict with other forces, there arises at once 
the question, How can we assure to this force the measure 
of strength needful for it? An additional question is, 
Into what combination can it be put with other forces, 
and how can this combination be introduced into still 
further combinations? How far should we spin out this 
particular line of our endeavours? Where may we cut it 
off, as one principal thread ready now for the whole woof ? 
Sense-perception, this indispensable, this firmest, broad- 
est bridge between man and Nature, certainly deserves, as 
far as it is capable of being cultivated by any art, to have 
dedicated to it one chief line of pedagogical endeavour. 
Where this line begins has been shown, as also its further 
direction. Except for closer reflection it possibly would 
now fall into the hands of the drawing teacher, who might 
use the model triangles in order to secure exactness in 
copies by causing to be noted in the originals the position 
of certain chief points, which would be a little neater and 
more convenient than the use of disfiguring nets, parallel

USE OF THE A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 961 
lines, and the like. Butan advantage so small would hardly 
be worth the expenditure of time and trouble which the 
elementary foundations have cost. And, furthermore, how 
far we should thus be from reaching that great idea, the 
cultivation of sense-perception! This has for its object 
Nature itself. How far down any practice in drawing 
must be subordinated here! It would be the highest pride 
of the drawing teacher as well as the teacher who is cul- 
tivating the sense-perception if they could unite in bring- 
ing out by their training the desired accuracy and facility 
in the apperception of Nature. 
But they can not join hands immediately. The leap 
would be enormous, from the simple triangles of the one to 
the extremely composite combinations of these triangles 
which the other would demand. Besides, the artist would 
tolerate them only as first auxiliaries, as the fundamental 
beginnings of formation. He would require the atten- 
tion, though beginning with them, to turn away thence 
to actual contours, to the flowing curves, to what is beau- 
tiful, forgetting in it the sharp corners and angles. But 
the pupil, his attention being still required by the com- 
binations of the triangles, would cling to them, unless he 
had acquired the ability previously to cast all this behind 
him as something absolutely completed and done with. 
It is plain, then, that between simple triangles and the 
composite forms which art and Nature offer to the eye 
some transition must be made. 
One might, for example, by adding and gradually em- 
ploying in all its combinations a fourth point with three 
given ones, form a series of quadrilateral model forms, 
going thence to five-sided, to six-sided figures, intending to 
familiarize them analogously as formerly with the three- 
sided, through drawing and calculations. But is it not at 
once apparent in what an interminable labyrinth we should 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  262 HERBARI’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
become involved, and what a tiresome prolongation would 
thence be given to the preliminary exercises ? 
Were all these details needful, the whole enterprise 
would stand in danger, though its usefulness were fully 
conceded, of being declared practically impossible on ac- 
count of the cost. 
But there is no longer need of the slightest expendi- 
ture of time and pains; on the contrary, time-saving is 
to be hoped for. 
Among the indispensable and generally intron 
studies of boyhood there is one which, we might say, has 
waited for these model triangles, one that without them 
can not fulfil its purposes, and, conversely, which renders 
to them the perfectly reciprocal services of presenting to 
the eye all their combinations, more or less composite, al- 
ready enlarged or reduced, and of requiring their repro- 
duction by the imagination, and of thus rendering them 
familiar to both. 
Geography—what is its intent? The location of cer- 
tain names of provinces and cities by means of other names 
of countries and divisions of the earth? What, after all, 
is the purpose of maps? Doubtless it is to give us some 
sort of a—no matter how confused—picture of the rela- 
tive positions of these things. But does the map fulfil 
its purpose if the picture remains confused? What is 
the intention of Gaspari’s maps, which give the cities 
without names? What is the intention of the peda- 
gogues who make boys copy whole maps in outline and 
colour? True, it is not the whole map that ought to im- 
press itself upon the imagination uniformly, even if by such 
trifling it could. But, in the ratio of their greater or less 
importance, separate points, such as cities, capes, sources 
and mouths of rivers; less so, the ever-variable bounda- 
ries of countries and provinces, should be present to the 
 
-P-A-G-E-297
USE OF THE A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 963 
imagination in their relative position as definitely as pos- 
sible. One ought to be able to traverse in thought a 
whole division of the earth with quickness and certainty. 
But this imaginary journey hastens from capital to capi- 
tal, from one port to another. Minutie should not de- 
tain it on the way, except as here and there it may find a 
special incitement to sojourn. Hence, what is of minor 
importance must be thought of as merely interjacent, as 
contained in a region previously determined by more note- 
worthy points. The latter must be made prominent, must 
be separated from the rest, and must be apperceived only 
as connected among themselves, howsoever far apart. Im- 
mediately and without gradually creeping through what 
intervenes, one must be able, as to position, to picture 
them to the mind definitely. 
This leads us straightway to triangles. It definitely pre- 
supposes the preliminary exercises; for neither more nor 
less than three points are in a simple, immediate relation 
as to mutual position. The question is now, Is the pupil 
able separately to fix any three points on the map, and to 
discriminate their position from every other possible posi- 
tion? Has the teacher a means for investigating how 
well or ill this fixing, this discriminating, has been accom- 
plished? Can the teacher and pupil mutually communi- 
cate the apperception and test and correct it? Are both 
sufficiently versed in orientation, in the whole possible 
multiplicity of triangular forms definitely to assign to the 
oceurring triangle its place in that wide field? For this, 
and nothing else, is meant by the required discrimination. 
Let the teacher commence the presentation of every 
new map by naming and pointing out the three most im- 
portant places on it. They will form a triangle. This 
will fall into one of the four classes which we distin- 
guished in the Second Section, Number VI. Into which? 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  264 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
Let that be the first question. Next, the student should 
point out between which columns and rows in the table 
it should be intercalated. To do so, inexpert students 
may employ the aid of the instrument, Fig. 4, and the 
table of diagrams which they have previously drawn. 
Finally, by comparison with the scale on the map, let the 
eye estimate the amount of the smallest side of the tri- 
angle in miles. The two other sides result from a sim- 
ple multiplication of the number of miles just found by 
those numbers in the second table which belong to this 
triangle. (Of course, in this work no great accuracy is 
exacted.) If even this much be difficult, let a single tri- 
angle suffice for this map. But geography is continued 
long enough, and hence proficiency will increase. As 
rapidly as it does so, take in addition to the three points 
a fourth noteworthy point in the map, selecting at least 
one of the three new triangles thus originating for simi- 
lar treatment. Later on, a fifth, a sixth, and even more 
points may be added. The four-, five-, and many-sided 
figures thus originating may be compared for similarity or 
dissimilarity. Thus an important point may be made 
clear—the connection between different maps. The web 
of triangles may be connected with the determination of 
latitude and longitude. Not only will all this not retard 
the progress of geographical study, but its success will be 
considerably quickened.* 
Let the bearing of the teacher toward his pupils in 
this application of the A B C of Sense-Perception to geog- 
raphy be very easy and gentle. Rapid zeal is rather for 
  
* T should think that no one, for the sake of Pestalozzi’s method, 
first given in his book How Gertrude taught her Children, will aban- 
don the excellent method of Gaspari. But with the latter the ad- 
vantages furnished by the A BC of Sense-Perception can be very 
easily combined.

  USE OF THE A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 965 
Numbers III, V, and VI of the Second Section, where 
it is of importance boldly, dexterously, and insistently, 
now by encouraging and again by the pressure of au- 
thority, to lead the student over difficulties in the needful 
preliminaries of knowledge. At the present stage it is 
essential rather to conciliate favour for the triangles in 
order early to call forth unconstrained and spontaneous 
applications. Besides, in geography, being already 
known, they are the easiest part. For this reason they 
furnish by themselves welcome resting points. The 
tiring pupil will seek for them, and will like to rest at 
them. 
The more happily the youthful fancy has recognised 
in maps the representations of the earth’s surface, the 
more easily and unconstrainedly can our triangles mount 
next to the starry sky. Its brilliant points are still more 
obvious than the cities on the map—better suited, there- 
fore, for apperception by the aid of our preliminary 
exercises, and only by their aid capable of unconfused 
apperception. Now let guidance change completely into 
companionship. Occasionally the names of the constel- 
lations may be given. Still, the pupil should not be for- 
bidden to draw his own animals, plans, and maps in the 
sky. 
There can hardly be a doubt possible that by these ap- 
plications the eye will be rendered sufficiently familiar 
with the combinations of the triangles. The eye, resting 
upon a map or upon the sky, is unable almost at the mere 
thought of triangles to refrain from seeing before it a 
large number, since all that is required is to abolish the 
uniformity of vision by picking out some few from among 
all the points presented. The arbitrary play among tri- 
angles, quadrangles, pentagons, turning and twisting, com- 
bining and separating, building and destroying, the deal-
-P-A-G-E-300
  966 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
ing this way and that with the given material, are really 
the business of childhood. It is the natural course which 
children’s observations always take. Therefore we may 
say, all that is necessary in the A B C of Sense- Perception 
is to render familiar to children the general concept of the 
triangle, to guide them next to the possible differences in 
triangles, and finally to place before their eyes objects in 
which occur, and are emphasized, not regularly formed 
lines and surfaces, but in the main only scattered points. 
Out of these they create triangles for themselves, together 
with all the possible combinations. Therefore, putting 
the worst case for the preliminary exercises—a case which 
every good teacher can and ought to prevent—namely, the 
case of one half of the children in a school instead of draw- 
ing and reckoning, sitting thoughtlessly, merely gaping or 
staring at the horn-leaves or at the instrument used in 
presenting the triangles. Even this mere gaping, which 
in this case consists at least in taking a view, will here, as 
perhaps in no other branch of instruction, help to attain the 
object to some extent. If geography follows, then, only 
assuming a similar act of looking at the map, the mere 
recollection of the triangles will awaken the eye auto- 
matically, dissolve and split up the chaos of the com- 
mingled signs for cities, and secure some degree of atten- 
tion for an instruction aiding in this decomposition. 
Not until now have we reached the actual limits of the 
A B C of Sense-Perception. It was not concluded till 
everything was prepared for an immediate transition to 
the multiplicity of natural objects; only the ending was 
advantageously interwoven with another instruction so as 
to avoid separate exertion. 
To take care of the transition itself should now be the 
office of the drawing master. Let him not decline it, for
-P-A-G-E-301
  
USE OF THE A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 967 
it will give greater dignity to his specialty ; he will even cul- 
tivate it more felicitously by making his art the means for 
the cultivation of the apperception of Nature. Whether, 
for the purpose, our A B C of Sense-Perception is service- 
able to him has partly been discussed in the beginning of 
the First Section; in part, the following proposals per- 
haps will tend to determine more definitely the mode of 
execution. First, a few preliminary observations. 
The forms that Nature presents are by the eye apper- 
ceived in one way, by the imagination in another. The 
eye sees them flat. The imagination endeavours to repre- 
sent them as they are actually extended in physical space. 
This endeavour succeeding partly, man falls into a vacil- 
lating, midway condition. He sees a definitely raised re- 
lief. Both art and science seek to extricate him from this 
condition. Drawing and perspective teach imagination to 
go back and to restore the visual plane destroyed by it. 
Taking the term anatomy in its broadest sense (by which 
miners may be termed anatomists of the earth’s crust and 
astronomers anatomists of the sky) all species of anatomy 
and solid geometry, contrariwise, urge the imagination on 
to complete its course. They practise it in expanding the 
yacillating relief till the true boundaries of the body are 
reached. This gives us the ability to think unconfusedly, 
in the next place, its internal structure, the strata, lodes, 
and veins it contains, in their order and combination, and 
finally, even the changes in this order, in the case, for 
instance, of motions in the internal structure. 
The latter business of the imagination, however, as 
difficult as it is important, is based entirely upon sense- 
perception. The imagination makes up the picture of 
the body from parts apperceived through sense-perception. 
For this reason the culture of sense-perception is so neces- 
sary a preparation for all those anatomists—that is, it is
-P-A-G-E-302
  968 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSH-PERCEPTION. 
a necessity to physicians, surgeons, mechanicians, archi- 
tects, carpenters, physicists, geologists, astronomers, and, 
in general, to all people to whom accurate presentations 
of physical objects are important. ‘This preparation is all 
the more necessary because, in actually learning the arts 
and sciences which those names indicate, the operation of 
the imagination is that which is constantly presupposed, 
not that to which attention is directed. Hence, the im- 
perfections, the errors, that creep into this operation lurk 
deep, the teacher not comprehending wherein the pupil 
is deficient, and rejecting him, perhaps, as brainless, sim- 
ply on account of clumsiness in the imagining of physical 
images. 
This observation is placed here partly to open up a 
prospect into the distance through which we desire the 
A BC of Sense-Perception to extend its effects, partly in 
order to make felt the necessity of a systematic connection 
which ought to join in its bonds the teachers of different 
and in other respects heterogeneous branches, if the root 
of so many abilities—to wit, ff culture of sense-perception 
—is to be properly nurtured in the mind of the pupil. We 
have been obliged already in in the geographer. Nor 
      are we able to dispense with the draughtsman, precisely 
because practice in seeing what is convex as if it were flat 
constitutes one principal branch of the trunk of sense-per- 
ception; not to mention that its apprenticeship, the ap- 
perception of surfaces, must be complete before physical 
images can be composed correctly and readily. In respect 
to the latter it might be asserted that really no whole con- 
stituted in physical space is imagined completely, unless 
the imagination knows how to present to itself also with 
the greatest facility every perspective projection of the 
same. However, to carry this into detail would be too 
prolix here. 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
USE OF THE A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 969 
Now, the teacher of drawing might, somewhat like the 
teacher of geography, begin by emphasizing a few promi- 
nent points in the engraving used as a copy by first de- 
termining their position through triangles, and then by 
causing the student to join to them, by the aid of other 
triangles, the interjacent or surrounding parts. By doing 
so, he would take the A BC of Sense-Perception into his 
service; but he would not by his service further our pur- 
pose. Whether his pupil learn to copy an engraving is 
of no interest whatever to us. We rather wish, for the 
teacher’s sake, he might not need at all so dreary an aux- 
iliary for facilitating instruction. We rather wish he might 
be able to avoid altogether the dubious question whether 
the pupil really recognises and understands the engraving 
as a portrait and representation of real Nature, which we 
hope is the master’s intention. We rather wish that he 
had means enabling him to lead the pupil from the first 
successfully to draw from Nature. We, too, should thus 
reach our end, because what the teacher would require 
would be exactly this—to draw that which is convex with 
correct perspective upon a flat surface, and then to shade 
this surface so as to make it appear to change back again 
into the physical space which Nature herself occupies. 
It perhaps needs but a slight device to help the draw- 
ing to attain perspective correctness. Our only presup- 
position is that the teacher will join his work to the A BC. 
In order to do so, he can not well make the beginning on 
pictures of organized beings. Everything is too round, 
too soft. It is not easy to pick up firm points in them 
upon which teacher and students can with certainty reach 
a mutual understanding. In landscapes, on the contrary, 
there occurs much that is pointed and angular, and every- 
thing is scattered more accidentally. We are reminded 
as yet of the map with its triangles.
-P-A-G-E-304
ESSE aT tree ee eee gare ee eee 
970 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION. 
In order that the prominent points in the landscape 
may be co-ordinated into plain triangles, it is only neces- 
sary to have these points fall into a few lines which hover 
before the landscape, and are in a plane which is verti- 
cal to the axis of the eye. That, as we take it, can be 
arranged for. Have, for example, a staff with a groove 
in it, in which the end of another staff at right angles 
with the former can be shoved up and down. Take this 
extremely simple machine into the open air. By a plumb- 
line fix the first staff, sharpened below, vertically in the 
ground, so as to let the student, standing before it at some 
little distance, see in the anda a couple of principal 
points exactly on the edge of the staff. Shove the other 
staff till it touches some third point. Cause the student 
to note the originating triangle. Let us hope it will be

only before a tree, all the points of the landscape thus 
coming successively to the edge of the staff, and therefore 
into one plane, only this plane is not seen simultaneously ; 
no triangle can actually present itself. 
After thus achieving measurement of free Nature by 
the eye, neither teacher nor pupil will be any longer tied 
to the landscape. Attempts may be founded. for winning 
from the plaster cast or the marble the contours of man, 
no longer now immediately upon the A B C of Sense- 
Perception, but upon the eye’s perspective measurement 
attained by its aid. This power is no longer, so to speak, 
compelled to isolation on tripods. Let the teacher make 
the beginning. In the presence of the students let him 
draw from the bust. The copy thus produced certainly 
will represent the original; surface and body will inter- 
pret each other reciprocally. The student will grasp their 
mutual relations and easily try a contour himself. If the 
eye be well instructed, the hand will soon be compelled 
into obedience. 
It is needless to add much. The true artist takes care 
without being reminded that with impressive sense-per- 
ception, which here alone occupies us, the esthetic per- 
ception be united early. He will cover up now, so to 
speak, the hard triangles. He will incite the student by 
the gentlest curvatures, by the softest gliding of bend into 
bend, to conceal from his eye the model forms still hoy- 
ering before the imagination, as if burying them in inten- 
tional oblivion. Thus they become, what they ought to 
be, the well-draped and ever firmly holding, sustaining 
skeleton of all drawing. Young people of talent the 
artist will carry far enough to enable them, after so many 
exercises in impressive sense-perception, to single out from

especially study the skeletons. In the interior cavities of 
the latter, it would consider the place for the many kinds 
of organs which are arranged within them, not only in a 
general way as to place, but as a geometrical body deter- 
mined thus and so. It would compare skeletons with liy- 
ing beings placed by their side, in order to make clear to 
itself the covering of the bones by flesh and muscles as ac- 
curately as either sculptor or painter need. In skeletons 
of several animal species it would know how to observe the 
various modifications of one and the same general animal 
structure, not merely as a difference, but as a difference 
of such a kind and magnitude. It is well known that 
natural science, as long as it distinguishes its objects by 
only external marks, represents them as only accidental 
phenomena. Not till it traces organization and its pur- 
pose does it represent the plants as plants, animals as ani- 
mals; and not until it refers whole genera and classes to 
the common fundamental idea, as different expressions of 
the latter, does it, in fact, represent Nature as Nature— 
that is to say, as bringing forth according to concepts. 
But it is equally certain that in order so to understand 
Nature, nay, in order even to be inclined to devote the time 
and attention necessary to this understanding, we must be 
given, in the first place by mere sense-perception, a far 
more definite knowledge of the immediate data of Nature, 
and a far closer habituation of man to Nature than can 
ever be gained by a superficial showing and viewing of all 
species of engravings and natural objects. Here we are 
shown again the necessity of the teacher’s having some 
means of compelling perception—at least, in emergencies, 
to sharp attention. He must be able to require from it 
certain definite data and to bring home to it its mistakes.

powerful apperceptive faculty, but, with the least inherent 
mobility of mind, of an extremely useful faculty of me- 
chanical invention also. Far from becoming confused in 
the schools of the geometrician, architect, physiologist, or 
any workshop of high or low degree, by the multiplicity 
of objects, he would, on the contrary, know how to acquire 
and continue by self-activity all the manifold instructions 
there pressing in upon him. He would know how to take 
hold with head and hand, if in the earlier years some care 
be taken for manual dexterity—a care which surely need 
not be commend specially to such teachers as are able to 
take an interest in the A B C of Sense- Perception. 
And now this thread of instruction might be laid aside 
as completed; it might be left to general pedagogy to 
ordain the rest concerning it and its interweaving with 
the whole, if only there were not left in the elementary 
exercises a gap which robs of its necessary basis everything 
that is connected with the imagining of physical spaces. 
There is needed a preparation for the imagining of geo- 
metrical solids, similar to the preparation which the plane 
model triangles furnish ; primarily, to be sure, for sense- 
perception in general; secondarily, however, especially 
and exclusively for superficial perception. This imagining 
of physical spaces requires its own model forms. It would 
not be difficult to fill the gap. For the present it is left 
purposely. Why should one erect a large edifice before 
it is known whether any one desire to dwell in it? 
The question is, whether men of intellectual eminence 
are inclined to take up the pedagogical concerns here dis- 
cussed, and whether the present treatment may obtain 
their assent. 
The question certainly is not, whether the external 
phenomena, the first to nurture, the most faithful to at- 
tend, the most tireless to teach the youthful mind, are

The question certainly is not, whether it be good that

of his senses, which for the p

the sensuous clearness and distinctness, in spite of the

Neither, it should seem, can there be any question 
whether there is a connection between clear sense-percep- 
tion and sound judgment, between precise vision and pre- 
cise thinking, or whether by a knowledge of Nature a 
bright mind is well prepared for occupying itself with 
abstract concepts, and the more sluggish man is guided 
by the incitement to the use of his senses into the nearest 
and right groove for his activity. 
Can we question ene education comes up to its 
idea, when that which accident and ordinary instruction 
shed upon youth unordered is moved by education close

Nature good enough? Whence the means for the cul- 
ture of the imagination? Why triangles? What is the 
reward for their computation? For such early mathe- 
matical labours? What transition from triangles to the 
world ?—which does not look as if it were a heap of tri- 
angles. Where is the place among and what is the con- 
nection with the other studies? 
It would be unbecoming to repeat what we have said 
on these and similar questions. Not so, perhaps, to ask 
an examination and to express a desire for practical trials 
made with that sagacity which in adaptation to given cir- 
cumstances aptly alters the inessential without displacing 
essential elements. For example: The right age for this 
instruction is determined by ability and necessity. Toa 
good memory there might be trusted for the lattermost 
computations, besides the tangents, sines also. However, 
sines must not be taken from the beginning instead of 
tangents, in order to avoid injury to objectification. Slow 
students must reckon with only two, the most skilled might 
reckon with four or five figures, which may be taken from 
the second table. At first, one teacher will have to take 
care of a variety, which strictly should be divided among 
. different teachers, etc. 
What definite modifications should the mechanism of 
this instruction receive in order to be suitable for many stu- 
dents simultaneously—for schools? Should it be notice- 
ably altered for girls? What advantages, what upplications, 
and what difficulties will result in connection with other 
instructions? Above all, what involuntary effect will be 
produced in the youthful mind by these preliminary exer- 
cises over and above the chief effect which we hope we 
have foreseen rightly ? 
All these many questions are committed to the judg- 
ment and to the experience of others.

PART III. 
CONCLUSION. 
WE have endeavoured, through a graded series of intro- 
ductory writings from Herbart’s own pen, to lead by a 
course which might not itself seem wholly unpedagogical 
to a proper appreciation of the only treatise on the method- 
ology of a specific branch of instruction which the master 
has bequeathed to us. The test of the A B C of Sense-Percep- 
tion in somewhat extensive application, it may be permitted 
to add, has neither been omitted nor proved unsatisfactory. 
Details would, of course, be out of place, and justly open to 
the charge of egotism. 
We have thus far emphasized the fact that, strictly speak- 
ing, the only science of education is the pedagogy of edu- 
cative instruction. This rests, of course, upon psychology. 
We must not, therefore, close without equal emphasis upon 
the fact that as yet we know very little of pedagogy, because 
of the limitations entailed by this dependence. This is the 
other half of the truth. He who would understand the 
sphere of pedagogical endeavours must realize that it has 
two hemispheres. 
In 1812 Herbart published in the Kénigsberg Magazine 
for Philosophy, Theology, etc., his Psychological Research 
into the Strength of a Representation conceived as a Func- 
tion of its Duration. The problem is worked out by the 
liberal use of the integral calculus distinctive of Herbart. 
This paper is followed immediately by the essay : 
279

280 HERBART’S A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
d i On THE DARK SIDE OF PEDAGoGy. 
Immediately after the preceding psychological essay, 
it is unnecessary, I presume, to remind the reader which 
side of pedagogy is here by emphasis called the dark side. 
How immeasurable a distance from the inquiry concerning 
the strength of a simple sense-representation considered 
as a function of the duration of that representation to a 
complete psychological theory of ethical education! And 
all along the road primeval night prevails, and all this 
road runs along the dark side of pedagogy. 
In order to remain somewhat in touch with the pre- 
ceding researches, let us first reflect what significance they 
may have for pedagogy. They furnish a fragment of a 
theory of attention, and a nat of attention would con- 
stitute an essential though but a small part of a psycho- 
logical pedagogy. 
Since on the dark side of anything nothing can be 
said except to the extent that points of light shine forth 
out of the darkness, it may pes be proper to look once 
more at the points of light just found, and to compare 
them with the desideratum of a more extended pedagogic 
knowledge. 
I take for granted it has escaped no one how almost 
  impossible it is to avoid m 
attention of the pupils, and king incessant claims on the 
how harmful are some of the 
  means—such as rewards, ci mpetitive excitement, etc.— 
occasionally devised for obtaining, after all, faithless atten- 
tion, and how much depends on utilizing without harm- 
ful means and to the best advantage the attention that is 
possible from a pupil. 
It is equally well known, I presume, that in being and 
especially in becoming attentive we feel largely passive, 
while, nevertheless, though in very different degrees for
-P-A-G-E-315
CONCLUSION. 281 
different individuals, our own will controls the atten- 
tion. 
From the preceding investigation it is apparent how 
that which seems to us passive in attention—for the soul 
is never strictly passive—is jointly determined by the 
strength of the impression, the freshness of receptivity, 
the degree of contrast to already existent impressions, and 
the degree of unrest of a mind more or less occupied an- 
tecedently. From the same investigation it is apparent, 
not, indeed, what constitutes the activity of a more highly 
educated mind in controlling its own attention, but at what 
points the activity must be applied in order to produce the 
intended effect. The art in purposed attention consists 
in properly directing the physiological receptivity, in seek- 
ing the stronger impression, but, above all, in quieting the 
mental unrest, and in calling up such presentations as 
constitute the smallest opposition to the percept to be 
impressed. 
This reminds us of the most important element among 
those which we still need in order to make of the preced- 
ing investigation a theory of attention—an element which 
is to be commended to the educator as one deserving his 
especial care. Even the faintest beginning of attention 
reproduces older presentations partly similar to, partly 
opposing, what has been noticed, and leading to opposite 
presentations. The ingredients and the strength of the 
reproduction are the results of earlier states of mind and 
of earlier culture. The educator, therefore, who requires 
attention without the proper preparation plays upon an 
instrument without strings. 
To arrange the whole of instruction from its first be- 
ginnings to its conclusion most advantageously, so as to 
have each antecedent prepare the mental disposition of 
the pupil for each proximate and remote consequent, was
-P-A-G-E-316

the problem I have made the main subject for considera- 
tion in several mea writings. In respect to the 
preceding essay, what is said in the General Pedagogy con- 
cerning the alternation of immersion in a subject and re- 
flection upon it as an ever-needful mental respiration may 
be restated as follows, though the restatement does not 
quite exhaust the meaning of those expressions: When a 
series of ere has caused a certain summation of 
checks to accumulate, the latter should be allowed to sub- 
side before we attempt to goon. This law of the proper 
pausing in instruction, as we might call it, does not, how- 
ever, contain the whole import of those words. To reflect 
is not merely to allow a summation of checks to subside. 
Reflection is fusion of what was first apperceived singly 
and by a separate consciousness. This is a subject for 
another peychological investigation, far more complicated 
than even the preceding. But this subject is not yet be- 
fore me in an elaborated form. Neither is the closely 
connected subject of the reproduction of associated pres- 
entations, whose elaboration could alone enlighten us fully 
on such concepts as noticing and expecting, and therefore 
on the pedagogical art of continuously spinning on the 
thread of expectation, so as to set everything that has 
been noticed in the most correct relations to already ex- 
istent expectations and to expectations still to be excited. 
The law of proper alternation alone receives from the 
preceding investigation a serviceable elucidation, thus: 
He who should tarry at what was wholly expected would 
meet with almost exhausted receptivity, because the pres- 
entation existent already in consciousness is capable of but 
little further gain. On the other hand, he who brings in 
the excessively novel, the totally foreign, has to fear the 
strong contrast which it will meet, and the strong sum- 
mation of checks which it will form.   
   
-P-A-G-E-317
  CONCLUSION, 283 
It may be left to thinking readers after understanding 
the preceding essay to give greater completeness as well 
as more definiteness to the reflections which are here indi- 
cated briefly. However, a pedagogue is guided not only 
by separate elaborated mathematico-psychological invea- 
tigations, but even by the general metaphysical main view 
that such investigations are possible, so as to prevent his 
altogether missing the direction in the dark. 
Such investigations can, of course, expect no applause 
from the adherents of the well-known teachers of tran- 
scendental freedom. All pedagogy costs them an incon- 
sistency. The “intelligible” act of freedom in us does not 
stand in any temporal relation. On the other hand, edu- 
cation, when we leave out of thought its temporal begin- 
ning and progress and the causal relation between edu- 
cator and pupil, becomes to us something completely 
incomprehensible. Pedagogy, therefore, is connected 
with a philosophy different from that of Kant, Fichte, 
or Schelling, and different even from that of Leibnitz; 
for his Pre-established Harmony would leave the educator 
and pupil no choice but to correspond with each other 
through the Deity. 
The idea of a mathematical psychology, on the con- 
trary, not only allows us to assume the possibility of act- 
ing upon the pupil, but also that to definite actions corre- 
spond definite results, and that by continued investigation 
and pertinent observation we shall more and more ap- 
proach foreknowledge of the results. This has the espe- 
cial advantage of removing an error to which practical 
educators are prone, usually to the same degree that they 
have a less accurate and familiar acquaintance with the 
idea of transcendental freedom. I refer to the notion 
that the talents which constitute what we call a man’s 
turn of mind are an organic unit, unfolding in accordance
-P-A-G-E-318

| A BC OF SENSE-PERCEPTION, 
with inherent int to which, to be sure, nurture and food 
may be offered, but upon which can be imposed no other 
development than that which aboriginally is peculiar to 
it. This notion is favoured by experiences showing many 
a pupil to have grown into something wholly different 
from what parents and teachers intended. But such ex- 
periences only prove that the educators, completely losing 
the way in the darkness of psychological pedagogy, pro- 
duced repugnance when their object was to produce incli- 
nations and habits. 
It is true, in the process of both enlarging and con- 
catenating more intimately that which was already con- 
nected, every circle of thought and feeling becomes more 
and more similar to an organism which expels that which 
is repugnant to it, and assimilates the suitable elements it 
meets with. Nevertheless, there is no original organic 
constitution in the human soul any more than any other 
hypothesis of multiplicity will hold. All the more free- 
dom remains to the educator’s activity, who in early youth 
in large part himself forms the germ from which subse- 
quently is produced what is apparently organic. 
That put into general terms is the conviction which 
constitutes the basis of the idea of a mathematical psy- 
chology, and consequently of the hopes which may be 
thence transferred to pedagogy. A theoretical insight, 
not future but instantaneous, into the possibility of edu- 
cation, is, however, an impossible thought to one who sees 
before him mathematical psychology as a problem in the 
main unsolved. 
Recently, none the less, a man has publicly affirmed 
that he possesses that theoretical insight into the possi- 
bility of education. Which is the philosophy of this man? 
Without inconsistency it can not be that of Leibnitz or 
Kant or Fichte or Schelling. But least of all is it mine; 984 HERBART'S

CONCLUSION, 285 
for the same man in the same place has given a very ex- 
tensive demonstration of what may become of a critique 
of my General Pedagogy with no vestige of knowledge of 
my Philosophy.* 
The reader will the rather permit me to make a few 
observations in conformity with my philosophical con- 
victions on the bright side of pedagogy, as they will 
enable me to conclude this article by pronouncing defi- 
nitely to what extent I think pedagogy possible for the 
present. 
In my General Practical Philosophy, second book, 
eighth chapter, I have indicated the scientific topic 
whence, out of the general and superior science, pedagogy, 
as far as subordinate to the latter, emerges. It will be 
understood that the content of the eighth chapter of the 
second book is determined by all that precedes, and that 
so extensive a disquisition could not be made an inci- 
dental appendix to a treatise on pedagogy. In the first 
place, the entire Theory of Ideas, or first book, is con- 
centrated into the concept of virtue. In the next place, 
when the limitations and auxiliaries of man have been 
taken into consideration, this concept sets up side by side 
the problems in human culture and civic life. Of human 
culture, education is a pre-eminent part, and by accurately 
fitting itself to practical philosophy, pedagogy will in the 
latter find all the determinations of the pedagogic purpose 
completely together. 
But even if pedagogy for the sake of popularity is not 
to fit itself closely to a presupposed systematic work, it 
must, nevertheless, know exactly the purpose toward which 
it is working. My General Pedagogy, though it appeared

earlier than the Practical Philosophy, was acquainted with 
the latter. The completed sketches of both, as well as the 
sketch of the Metaphysics, lay side by side. It was open 
to choice which was to be elaborated first. Precedence 
was given to that work which must necessarily, by reason 
of the lack of psychology, remain the less complete. The 
presentation was made as far as possible vivid and inciting 
to practice, and was so arranged as to let everybody meet 
first that which is more easily understood, and to put in, 
further on, texts at least for thoughts by the more patient 
readers. ‘T'o remove, however, the possibility of anybody’s 
fancying that the book pretended to be understood alto- 
gether by itself, the explanation of the main concepts was 
intentionally given with such aphoristic brevity as to make 
its insufficiency patent to everybody. 
To Chancellor Niemeyer, eminently among others, we 
are indebted for excellent and detailed presentations of as 
much pedagogy as can be universally understood and is uni- 
versally applicable. Clear moral concepts and an empirical 
psychology, not so much of systematic form as drawn from 
life, constitute the basis. This species of empiricism, en- 
larged by suitable experiments and combined with sharply 
determined concepts of Practical Philosophy, is doubtless 
the best pedagogy which, as a thoroughgoing work, homo- 
geneous in all its parts, is possible hitherto. But let us 
hope that the time will come when it will be worth while 
to make the concept of virtue in the unity of its com- 
pleteness the principal concept, and to inquire in the case 
of each of its requisites the means to the purpose from a 
speculative psychology which has stood the test of com- 
parison with experience. Not until this happens—and 
the time for its happening is not as yet—shall we be able 
to boast that we possess a pedagogy which is in truth 
science.

CONCLUSION. 287 
To our elementary exposition of Herbart’s Pedagogy lit- 
tle need be added. We may say of Herbart’s works what he 
said of Schwarz’s Pedagogy: “ When in an eminent writer 
full of heart and intellect we seem to miss something, it is 
competent for him to reply that if we will only let his work 
act upon us a longer time, if we will read ourselves into it, 
if we will use it anew and repeatedly on a variety of occa- 
sions, much will be found in it that is not set down in so 
many words. No work of significance can be more than one 
instance of intellectual riches that are far greater.” 
Of the intellectual wealth of Herbart not a tithe has been 
placed before the reader in this book. It has only been at- 
tempted to indicate the point of view which is right historic- 
ally for surveying the Herbartian system and to impart an 
introductory knowledge, genuine and connected as far as it 
goes. But the reader should understand that he has only 
passed the outposts. Beyond lie the Outlines of Pedagogic 
Lectures and the General Pedagogy, whence he may make 
his way into the Text-book of Psychology and into the Psy- 
chology itself, not flagging by the way till he has entered the 
General Practical Philosophy also. If beyond these strong- 
holds of Herbartianism he can penetrate the granitic Meta- 
physics of Herbart in all its stern realism, the main ridge 
of the Herbartian system, of which all the rest are but spurs, 
he will see something very different from what one famil- 
iar only with the idealistic philosophers of Germany means 
when he speaks of German metaphysics. The world will 
have changed for him, and he will know that education, the 
art of arts, is not a fortuitous assemblage of accidental de- 
vices, nor pedagogy, the queen of the sciences, to be wooed 
and won in a summer’s day. 
Not all the conclusions of Herbart may be accepted in all 
their details ; yet the time has fully come when no one can 
pretend to an adequate knowledge of educational science 
unless he has, for a time, been the disciple of the greatest 
pedagogical thinker, who to the few that in his lifetime 
were able to appreciate his philosophic genius seemed “an 
unapproachable magnitude of the greatest content,” and who

to those who knew his character was dear as one who “never 
knowingly hurt the feelings of a human being.” 
Nor is the latter qualification in Herbart inferior to the 
former. The Christian religion and the sociological phi- 
losophy of Herbert Spencer alike proclaim to us in the 
realm of thought and feeling what the spread of democracy 
and international arbitration show in the realm of facts: 
that the race “shall let the ape and tiger die” ; that the time 
of altruism is coming; that education must produce not the 
clever man to whom morality is a convenient cloak, but the 
man whose cleverness is subservient to his ethical convic- 
tions. Thus men will go to Herbart, and having learned 
from the all-embracing pedagogist a pedagogy beginning 
with triangles and ending with the moral law, they will 
part with him bearing upon their minds the impress of the 
noblest line even that fine spirit ever penned— 
“ Love is the beautiful soul of life.”

Books by and about Froebel. 
The Education of Man. By FRIEDRICH FROEBEL, Translated 
by W. N. Hailmann, Ph.D. $1.50. 
In all directions this book sounds the keynote of a new education. It lifts all educa- tional work from narrow, merely utilitarian standpoints, to an intensely and broad! Christian view of life; it measures every activity by its influence on character and ful life efficiency. In all questions of system and method Froebel places the teacher on solid ground, and indicates the way to loftiest achievements. 
Froebel’s Laws for all Teachers. By James L. HuGuEs. $1.50. 
This book is a clear and comprehensive statement of Froebel’s principles, adapted to the work of every one engaged in the education and the training of humanity in the kindergarten, the school, the university, or the home. _ It is the most intelligible expo- sition of the fundamental principles of the New Education as revealed by Froebel. 
Pedagogics of the Kindergarten. By FRIEDRICH FROEBEL, 
Translated by Josephine Jarvis. $1.50. 
This volume contains a practical elucidation of the theories of Froebel, and will be invaluable to earnest educators—particularly to parents, kindergartners, and primary school-teachers. Froebel explains very fully and carefully his motives for the entire plan of the work and play of the kindergarten, and its purpose and influence on life. 
Education by Development. By FRIEDRICH FROEBEL. Trans- 
lated by Josephine Jarvis. $1.50. 
In this volume the educational principles underlying the “ gifts” are more thor- oughly discussed than in “The Pedagogics of the Kindergarten.” ‘The student of Froebel has great advantage, therefore, in reading ‘‘ Education by Development,” in- asmuch as Froebel cast new light on his thoughts in each exposition that he made. 
The Mottoes and Commentaries of Friedrich Froebel’s 
Mother-Play. By H.R. Eriot and Susan E. Bow. $1.50. 
The Songs and Music of Friedrich Froebel’s Mother-Play. 
Prepared and arranged by Susan E. Blow. $1.50. 
The increased interest in kindergarten work and the demand for a clearer exposition 
of Froebel’s philosophy have given these excellent books the widest popularity. No one could be better equipped for their preparation than Miss Blow. In the first vol- ume the original pictures have been faithfully reproduced. 
Symbolic Education. A Commentary on Froebel’s Mother-Play. 
By Susan E. Blow. $1.50. 
This book discusses in a practical way the foundations of the philosophy of Froebel as found in ‘‘The Mother’s Songs and Games,” and shows the significance of the 
kindergarten and its claims for being the corner-stone upon which all child education 
should rest, It is emphatically a book for mothers as well as for teachers.

Dickens as an Educator. 
By James L, Hucues, Inspector of Schools, Toronto, 
Vol. 49. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50. 
Adopted by several State Teachers’ Reading Circles. 
All teachers have read Dickens’s novels with pleasure. Yrobably 
few, however, have presumably thought definitely of him as a great 
educational reformer. But Inspector Hughes demonstrates that such is 
his just title. William T. Harris says of ‘‘ Dickens as an Educator”: 
“ This book is sufficient to establish the claim for Dickens as an edu- 
cational reformer. He has done more than any one else to secure for 
the child considerate treatment of his tender age. Dickens stands 
apart and alone as one of the most potent influences of social reform 
in the nineteenth century, and therefore deserves to be read and studied 
by all who have to do with schools, and by all parents everywhere in 
our day and generation.” Professor Hughes asserts that “ Dickens 
was the most profound exponent of the kindergarten and the most 
comprehensive student of childhood that England has yet produced.” 
The book brings into connected form, under proper headings, the 
educational principles of this most sympathetic friend of children. 
“Mr. James L. Hughes has just published a book that will rank as one 
of the finest appreciations of Dickens ever written.”—Colorado School 
Yournal, 
“Mr. Hughes has brought together in an interesting and most effective 
manner the chief teachings of Dickens on educational subjects. His extracts 
make the reader feel again the reality of Dickens’s descriptions and the 
power of the appeal that he made for a saner, kindlier, more inspiring peda- 
gogy, and thus became, through his immense vogue, one of the chief 
instrumentalities working for the new education.” Wisconsin Fournaé of 
Education,

FOR TEACHERS OF ELEMENTARY GRADES 
  
Stories and Story-Telling 
By ANGELA M. Keyes, Head of the Department 
of English, Brooklyn Training School for Teachers. 
12mo, Cloth, $1.25. 
“Miss Angela Keyes’s book, ‘Stories and Story-Telling,’ 
is a most charming and helpful exposition of an art as difficult 
as it is precious. Sound and sensible in theory, clear as crys- 
tal in its practical suggestions, it is more than stimulating— 
it is positively inspiring.” —KatTre Douctas WIcGcIN. 
The first sixty-two pages of this book are devoted to a 
discussion of story-telling, including the following topics: 
1. The value of story-telling. 
2. The kind of stories to tell. 
3. The principles of the art of telling stories. 
4. Getting the story. 
5. Telling the story. 
6. The children’s part in story-telling. 
The remaining two hundred and ten pages contain a care- 
ful selection of long and short stories, all of which have been 
tested with children. At the request of many teachers there 
have been included seventy-five or more very short stories 
intended to help young children to express their observations, 
experiences and fancies. 
This book cannot fail to prove exceedingly helpful for the 
busy teacher. It sets forth the essential principles of story- 
telling in unusually comprehensible form.

Bibliography of Education. 
By Witt S. Monroz, A.B., Department of 
Pedagogy and Psychology, State Normal School, 
Westfield, Mass. Vol. 42. 12mo. Cloth, $2.00, 
This book will prove of great use to normal schools, training 
schools for teachers, and to educational lecturers and all special 
students seeking to acquaint themselves with the literature of any 
particular department. It will be of especial value to librarians in 
the way of assisting them to answer two questions: (@) What 
books has this library on any special educational theme? (6) What 
books ought it to obtain to complete its collection in that theme? 
™m America no less than in Europe there has been marked de- 
velopment in the collection of books on education. The library 
connected with the Bureau of Education at Washington has over 
50,000 books and 150,000 pamphlets on education and subjects 
more or less directly allied to education. Movements have 
recently been organized to establish state educational libraries 
in Massachusetts and New Jersey, and county libraries in 
New Jersey and California. Colleges and universities are segre- 
gating the books in their collections bearing on education, and 
giving special attention to the acquisition of pedagogical books, 
These activities make possible and desirable the publication of 
a systematic Bibliography of Education. This work contains in 
all the titles of 3,200 books and pamphlets. The selection has 
been limited to publications in the English language supposed to 
be obtainable in the ordinary course of trade. For convenience 
and economy of space the titles have been grouped into classes 
and these broken into sections and subsections. Much care has 
been taken tosecure the titles of British books as well as American 
in the belief that it is helpful to the teachers in all English-speaking 
countries to know the best books on education in the mother tongue 
without regard to political boundaries.

Psychological Foundations 
of Education. 
An Attempt to Show the Genesis of the Higher 
Faculties of the Mind. By W. T. Harris, A.M., 
LL.D., United States Commissioner of Education. 
Vol. 37. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50. 
In offering this book to the educational public the author feels it 
necessary to explain its point of view. Psychology is too frequently 
only an inventory of certain so-called “ faculties of the mind,” such as 
the five senses, imagination, conception, reasoning, etc. And teachers 
have been offered such an inventory under the name of “ educational 
psychology.” It has been assumed that education has to do with 
“cultivating the faculties.” Perhaps the analogy of the body has 
been taken as valid for the soul, and, inasmuch as we can train 
this or that muscle, it is inferred that we can cultivate this or that 
faculty. The defect of this mode of view is that it leaves out of 
sight the genesis of the higher faculties from the lower ones. 
Muscles are not consecutive, the one growing out of another and 
taking its place, but they are co-ordinate and side by side in space, 
whereas in mind the higher faculties take the place of the lower 
faculties and in some sort absorb them. Conception, instead of 
existing side by side with perception, like the wheels of a clock, 
contains the latter in a more complete form of activity. Sense- 
perception, according to the definition, should apprehend individual 
things, and conception should take note of classes or species. But 
conception really transforms perception into a seeing of each objec‘ 
as a member of aclass, so that the line between perception and con- 
ception has vanished, and we cannot find in consciousness a mere 
perception of an individual object, but only that kind of perception 
which sees the object in its process of production. This indicates 
the point of view of this book. It is an attempt to show the 
psychological foundations of the more important educational factors 
in civilization and its schools. Special stress is laid on the evolu- 
tion of the higher activities or faculties and on the method of it.

THE INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION SERIES 
Edited by WILLIAM T. HARRIS, LL.D. United States Commissioner of Education 
  Educational Issues in the Kindergarten. 
By Susan E. Biow, author of “Symbolic Edu- 
cation,” ‘“ Mottoes and Commentaries of Froebel’s 
Mother Play,” etc. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50 net. 
In this work Miss Blow presents with her usual clearness and vigor 
the outcome of some of the proposed modifications of the Froebelian 
kindergarten. Her discussions will prove of interest not only to the 
kindergarten public, but to thoughtful educators in all fields of work. 
Within the past thirty years all grades of education, from the kin- 
dergarten to the university, have been more or less influenced by the 
scientific principle of evolution, and by the attempt to make this a 
working hypothesis in history and sociology and even in theology and 
in religious institutions. So much is admitted on all hands; but the 
readers of Miss Blow’s book will many of them be surprised to see 
how conflicting world-views masquerade, not only in popular literature 
and in semi-philosophical writings, but also in methods of instruction 
in the schools and even in the programmes of the kindergarten. 
In the light of this illuminating survey the educational creed of 
Froebel is given a new setting, and Froebel’s disciples will find in this 
book a better statement than has been made hitherto of his claims as 
the great educational reformer for the period of infancy.

Principles of Educational Practice 
By Pau. Ktapper, Ph.D., Department of Edu- 
cation, College of the City of New York. 8vo, 
Cloth, $1.75. 
This book studies the basic principles underlying sound and progres~ 
sive pedagogy. In its scope and organization it aims to give (1) a com= 
prehensive and systematic analysis of the principles of education, (2) 
the modern trend and interpretation of educational thought, (3) a cransi- 
tion from pure psychology to methods of teaching and discipline, and 
(4) practical applications of educational theory to the problems that 
confront the teacher in the course of daily routine. Every practical 
pedagogical solution that is offered has actually stood the test of class- 
Toom demonstration. 
The book opens with a study of the function of education and a con- 
trast of the modern social conception with those aims which have been 
guiding ideals in previous educational systems. Part II deals with the 
physiological aspects of education. Part III is taken up with the prob- 
lem of socializing the child through the curriculum and the school disci- 
pline. The last part of the book, Part IV, The Mental Aspect of Edu- 
cation, is developed under the following sections: Section A. The 
Instinctive Aspect of Mind. Mind and its development through self- 
expression. Self-activity. Instincts. Section B. Intellectual Aspect 
lof Mind. The functions of Intellect, Perception, Apperception, Memory, 
‘Imagination, Thought Activities. The Doctrine of Formal Discipline 
id its influence upon educational endeavor. Section C. Emotional 
spect of Mind. Section D. Volitional Aspect of Mind. Study of will, 
inds of volitional action, habit vs. deliberative consciousness. The 
‘ducation of the Will. Education and Social Responsibility, the prob- 
lems of ethical instruction, and the social functions of the School. 
In order to increase the usefulness of the book to teachers of education 
ere is added a classified bibliography for systematic, intensive refer- 
ce reading and a list of suggested problems suitable for advanced work.

AN INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY   
  
The Mind and Its Education 
By Grorce Hersert Betts, Head of Depart- 
ment of Psychology and Education in Cornell 
College. Pages xiii, 264. 12mo, cloth, $1.25 net. 
The reason for this book’s extraordinary success is because 
of its practical value as an introduction to psychology. Pro- 
fessor Betts has worked out a remarkably clear statement of 
the elementary truths of psychology, making at the same 
time an immediate and vital application of these truths to 
education. The book is not a pedagogy, nor is it a text on 
educational psychology in the usual sense of the term. It is 
more than either of these, in that from the first page to the 
last it makes the truths of psychology a guide to 
mental development and conduct. It is psychology 
applied to life. 
The book is written in the lecture style and is attractive 
and readable; the subject-matter is fresh and interesting and 
is thoroughly abreast of the times in scientific accuracy. 
The volume is particularly adapted to teachers and 
to those who are just entering upon a study of| 
psychology. Especially serviceable to the student and suit- 
able for school use are the exercises and references furnished| 
throughout the book. The following chapter headings show} 
both its scientific basis and educational trend:

The Honorable the SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, : 
Washington, D. 0. 
Sir: I have the honor to transmit herewith the manuscript of the 
history of Higher Education in Wisconsin. The preface will explain 
the nature of this work, which was prepared under the supervision of 
the most accomplished historian of the West, Prof. William I. Allen, of 
the University of Wisconsin, aided by Mr. David E. Spencer, one of the 
instructors in that institution. 
This is the first of a series of monographs relating to higher educa- 
tion in the group of north-western States composed of Ohio, Indiana, 
Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, and was undertaken with the ap- 
proval and by the direction of the Hon. L. Q. C. Lamar, late Secretary 
of the Interior. It will prove a very valuable addition to the educa- 
tional history of the country. 
I respectfully recommend that the same be printed as a circular of 
information of this Office. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
N. H. R. Dawson, 
Commissioner.

PREFACE. 
The following sketches of the colleges of Wisconsin do not aim to 
give more than a very general outline of the career ofeach. For details 
of their statistics, organization, history, and tendencies, reference must 
be had to the sources of information, lists of which are appended to the 
several sketches. 
In the sketch of the State University, only such matters are dwelt 
upon as have had a direct bearing upon the fortunes of the institution, 
and those which concern its relations to the educational movements that 
have taken place during its history, to the school system of the State, 
and to the practical progress of the people. While the graduates of the 
University are filling positions in many cases of greatest trust and use- 
fulness, it is yet too early to estimate the precise drift and measure of 
the influence of the school upon the educational, political, and social 
life of the community. The older graduates are but now in the prime 
of life, in the midst of the years of greatest activity and influence. The 
University has not a sufficiently distant past to make its inner life of 
special interest as matter of history ; nor does it fall within the scope 
of this sketch to trace, in any special manner, the influence of the 
graduates of the institution beyond its walls. 
There is considerable variety in the character of the chapters devoted 
to the five private colleges, since the sketches for the greater part are 
adapted from articles previously published; but the leading features 
in the character of each college, and the scope and tendency of its work, 
are indicated. 
Many other colleges have from time to time, especially in the first 
twenty-five or thirty years of our history, been established in Wiscon- 
sin. Of two of these which still exist, brief notices are given at the end 
of this work.

COLLEGES IN WISCONSIN. 
L 
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 
THE TERRITORIAL PERIOD. 
Territorial Universities.—When the Territory of Wisconsm was 
formed, in 1836, the policy of Federal grants of land to the new States, 
for the support of higher institutions of learning, had long been well es- 
tablished. Each of the four States*already carved out of the North-West 
Territory had received two seminary or university townships. In order 
to make the aid to Wisconsin available at an early date, Governor 
Dodge, in his first message to the Legislature, October 26, 1836, recom- 
mended an application to Congress for the donation of one township of 
land for the foundation of an academy. By this a school of high grade 
was evidently intended. This suggestion to memorialize Congress was 
not followed. During the session, however, an act was passed to es. 
tablish the “‘ Wisconsin University” at Belmont ; trustees were named, 
to the number of thirty-one; but no steps were taken to carry the act 
into effect. A year later the “Wisconsin University of Green Bay,» 
afterward called ‘Hobart University,” was incorporated. 
At the same session an act of the Legislature provided for the “ Uni- 
versity of the Territory of Wisconsin ;” and here we find the conception 
of the future State University taking definite shape. The institution 
was to be under the government of a Board of Visitors not exceeding 
twenty-one in number. Of these the Governor, the secretary of the 
Territory, the judges of the supreme court, and the president of the 
University were visitors ew officio; the remainder were named by the 
Legislature. The merits of this organization of the Board need not 
detain us, since these Visitors never had an actual university under 
their control. 
This attempt to establish a university was genuine and earnest; a 
joint resolution of the two houses of the Legislature directed the ter- 
ritorial Delegate in the House of Representatives to ask of Congress an

appropriation of twenty thousand dollars for the erection of buildings 
for the new institution, and also an endowment of two townships of 
land. It was desired that this grant should be located east of the Mis- 
sissippi River, as it was known that that stream would be the western 
boundary of the new State.! 
The Delegate was-unable to secure the twenty thousand dollars ; but 
by an Act of Congress approved June 12, 1838, the Secretary of the 
Treasury was authorized to set apart and reserve from sale, out of any 
public lands within the Territory of Wisconsin to which the Indian title 
had been, or might be, extinguished, and not otherwise appropriated, 
a quantity of land not exceeding two entire townships, for the support 
of a University, and for no other use or purpose whatsoever. This land 
was to be located in tracts of not less than an entire section each, cor- 
responding with any of the legal divisions into which the public lands 
are authorized to be surveyed. 
One or two portions of this Act are worthy of note here. The earlier 
Congressional grants for university purposes had provided for the loca- 
tion of the townships en bloc. In the grants to Michigan and Wisconsin 
a different policy was inaugurated. Authority was given to select the 
lands in seventy-two parcels from unoccupied lands in any portion of 
the State, and opportunity was thus. given to secure, by judicious choice, 
excellent lands for the endowment of the University. The sequel will 
show how shamefully this opportunity was abused. 
Again, the land was given for the support of a University. The grant 
seemed to contemplate that the proceeds should be used for the mainte- 
nance of-an institution whose grounds, buildings, apparatus, and all es- 
 sentials to its organization should be furnished by the State at its own 
expense. The results of ignoring this manifest intent of the grant were 
most disastrous, and in time brought the University to very narrow 
straits. 
An attempt was made by the Board of Visitors of the Territorial 
University to have these 46,080 acres of land put under their control; 
but the land was never so appropriated. The powers of the Board of 
Visitors continued throughout its existence of nearly ten years to be 
merely nominal. Its only office was to keep alive the university idea. 
Something was accomplished during the territorial period in the way 
of selecting the lands. Commissioners for this purpose were appointed 
by the Legislature in January, 1839. But nothing was done by them, 
and, in 1841, Nathaniel F. Myer was appointed to select a quantity, not 
exceeding 10,248 acres. The duty was performed with care and good 
1 The Territory of Wisconsin in 1837 included, outside the boundaries given to the 
State on its admission into the Union, what now forms the States of Iowa and Min- 
nesota, together with a large portion of Dakota. By Act of Congr June 12, 1838, 
the limits of the Territory were contracted so that of all the terri beyond the 
present bounds of the State, the north-eastern portion of Minnesota alone remained. 
This, in turn, was lopped off when the State was admitted in 1848.

judgment. The subject of the appraisal of the university lands will be 
treated in another connection. 
Summary.—Up to the time of the admission of Wisconsin as a State, 
in 1848, no progress had been made toward the establishment of a 
University beyond the location and appraisal of part of the seventy-two 
sections of land donated in 1838 by the General Government. A Board 
of Visitors of the “ University of the Territory of Wisconsin” had been 
in existence, but had served no function other than the merely passive 
one of perpetuating the expectation of a University, and thus prevent- 
ing the dissipation of the resources of the prospective institution. 
LANDS AND FUNDS. 
In the 46,080 acres of the grant of 1838 was the possibility of a most 
liberal university fund. But, although Wisconsin might have taken 
warning from the evils that had accompanied the administration of the 
university grants in the four States previously created out of the North- 
West Territory, she neglected to take counsel from this experience and 
even fell into special error of her own. The history of the Wisconsin 
grants is important and interesting, not only as a contrast to the more 
enlightened and faithful management of similar trusts in other States, 
especially those admitted in later years, but also as being intimately . 
connected with the fortunes of the University, at least in the earlier 
portion of its career. 
Selection of the Lands.—By joint resolution of January 11, 1840, the 
Governor of the Territory was authorized to appoint one competent 
person in each of the land districts in the Territory to locate a ‘portion, 
not exceeding two-thirds, of all the lands given by Congress for the 
support of a University. The lands were to be selected by the commis- 
sioners in equal quantities in each of the districts, as best to promote 
the interests of the fund. No improved land or lands claimed by actual 
occupants should be selected. Within thirty days after making the 
selections in any one district, the commissioner was to give public 
notice thereof, in a newspaper printed in his land district, for six suc- 
cessive weeks, and on completing the selections, make a report to the 
Governor, to be by him approved and transmitted to the Secretary of 
the Treasury of the United States, with a request that the several tracts 
of land therein mentioned might be set apart and reserved for the in- 
tended purpose. During the year 1840, 30,748 acres were located ; but 
the lands set apart in the Mineral Point land district, although twice 
selected, were not approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. In tle 
other two districts about 20,497 acres were reserved, leaving yet to be 
set apart on February 3, 1846, a fraction over 25,582 acres. This resi- 
due of the seventy-two sections was located during the territorial period. 
Appraisal and Sale of the Lands. —Notwithstanding steps were taken 
to induce the Legislature to apply the grant of 1838 to the “ University 
of the Territory of Wisconsin,” and to put the proceeds of sale under
-P-A-G-E-16
    
14 HIGHER EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN, 
the control of the Board of Visitors of that nominal institution, it was 
never so disposed of. The State Constitution made these lands a basis 
for the support of a State University. Measures were immediately taken 
to make the fund available. The Legislature, by an act approved Au- 
gust 12, 1848, authorized the appointment of three persons in each 
county as State appraisers of school and university lands. They were 
required to take an oath ‘to appraise the same at a fair valuation, with- 
out reference to any improvements made thereon, but giving due con- 
sideration to other circumstances, such as proximity to settlements, 
credit for purchase money, etc.” Sixty-three sections were soon ap- 
praised at an average valuation of $2.78 per acre, ranging from $1.13 in 
Grant County to $7.06 in Washington County. In many cases the ap- 
praisements were ridiculously small. Immigrants were pouring into 
the new State and the country was being rapidly settled. The lands in 
ashort time would be worth many-fold the appraised value. The policy 
adopted by the State was not that of securing the largest possible fund 
for the University, but of attracting settlers by the low prices of land. 
This course, though undoubtedly of temporary advantage to the State 
atlarge by promoting immigration, was disastrous to the permanent 
interests of the University. 
The Congressional grant was bestowed, not for the foundation, but 
for the support of the University ; not as an original basis, but as an en- 
dowment. These lands were not the property of the State to be disposed 
of at will and pleasure; they were held in trust to be sacredly guarded. 
A faithful administration of this trust would have required that the 
Jands should be sold at the highest possible price, and, if necessary for 
this purpose, they should have been withheld from sale for a consider- 
able time. But the State was recreant to the trust reposed in her. 
Reasonable care and judgment had been bestowed upon the selection of 
the lands, and the appraisers had opportunity to insure to the Univer- 
sity the basis of a magnificent endowment; but it was preferred that even 
the best lands should be sold at the low Government price, in order to 
enhance the attraction to settlers to the highest possible extent. 
The lands selected were often found to be pre-empted under the 
United States homestead laws, and new lands had to be selected and 
appraised at considerable expense. In January, 1850, the regents called 
the attention of the Legislature to these illegal appropriations and ap- 
praisals. They pointed out that “ while the school lands, which are of 
course lands of ordinary quality, are appraised at an average value of 
$3.44 per acre, the selected university lands are appraised at the average 
value of $2.78, being sixty-six cents less per acre than the appraised 
value of the school lands.” 
Of course no effort was made to obtain more than the appraised val- 
uation for the lands. <A law of 1849 authorized sales and provided for. 
the investment of the proceeds. The minimum price was fixed at the 
appraised valuations, but these were too easily converted into a maxi-

mum. Many sales were made during the following year. In 1850 a 
better policy was adopted, looking to a larger ultimate fund; the mini- 
mum price was raised to ten dollars per acre. Notwithstanding the 
sale during the next year of more than a thousand acres at or above 
the increased price, the pressure brought to bear upon the Legislature 
was sufficient to procure the passage of au act reducing the mininum 
price to seven dollars an acre, with some exceptions. Pre-emptors were 
given credit for the excess over the new minimum price. 
* But this more enlightened policy in reference to the university trust 
was but temporary. The particular evil in the administration of the 
educational trust funds in Wisconsin was that of using the national 
grants in a way to attract immigration at the expense of the interests 
of the trusts. The advancement of the material interests of the State 
was laudable in itself, but there is not a particle of justification for sac- 
vificing permanent educational interests to more rapid settlement. But 
the latter became the settled policy of the State. In 1852 new ap- 
praisals, at a minimum of three dollars per acre, were directed, and. 
most of the remaining lands were accordingly valued and sold at that 
price. The sum of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars was all that 
was realized from the seventy-two sections. From a similar grant 
Michigan realized over half a million. 
In 1848 seventy-two sections of saline lands were granted to Wiscon- 
sin. As there were no saline lands in the State, the Legislature peti- 
tioned Congress to substitute for them seventy-two additional sections 
for the University. The desired substitution was made in 1854. But, 
although the lands were carefully selected, the errors and shortcomings 
displayed in the management of the former grant were repeated in this. 
Sales were wade on the terms fixed by the law of 1852, absurdly low as 
they were. In 1859 the provisions for appraisal were repealed, leaving 
the minimum price, however, at three dollars; and in 1864, in spite of 
the constitutional provision requiring appraisal before sale, the price of 
all lands never appraised was fixed at three dollars per acre. 
System of Invegtments.—The system of investments was pernicious, 
and caused great losses to thefund. The proceeds of sales were loaned 
by the commissioners—the secretary of state, treasurer, and attorney- 
general—to individuals in sums of not over five hundred dollars to each, 
upou real estate mortgages. It was impossible for three individuals at 
the capital to make safe investments to thousands of persons all over 
the State, of whose responsibility they knew nothing. The absurdity 
of the system was exposed by the land commissioners in their report for 
1861: “The State government having assumed the management of a 
trust fund, ought, at least, to manage it as prudently and carefully as 
aman of ordinary judgment and discretion would manage his own af- 
fairs. Yet, would any prudent capitalist invest his own money in loans 
to men he did not know, taking security upon lands he never saw, with 
no better evidence of their value than the appraisement of two men of

whom he knew nothing?” In 1862 investments in State bonds were 
authorized, and subsequent laws provided for loaning the funds to cities 
and counties, and for investments in United States bonds. But great 
losses had occurred under the old system of loaning to individuals; ex- 
actly how much these were it is impossible to say. 
_ Disposition of the University Funds.—Not only was the trust reposed 
in the State betrayed and the interests of the University sacrificed by 
the illegal or inadequate appraisals of the lands and the low prices fixed, 
but the fund when accumulated was diverted from its true objects. 
The grants were bestowed, not for the foundation, but for the support 
of the University. But loans of twenty five thousand dollars and fifteen 
thousand dollars were authorized by the Legislature from the principal 
of the fund to build North and South Dormitories. It was necessary, 
therefore, to use the interest largely for the repayment of these loans, 
instead of for its true purpose of carrying on instruction and providing 
a library and appliances. 
The grant of 46,080 acres in 1854 renewed the hopes of the friends of 
the University. The report of the regents for that year pictures the 
future in glowing terms: ‘‘After the reduction of this new grant to the | 
productive form, and the extinction of the debt, the annual income of the 
whole endowment will not fall far short of twenty-two thousand dollars, 
and receipts from other sources will swell this amount to twenty-five 
thousand dollars. These conditions will enable the Board to carry on 
successfully the collegiate, normal, and agricultural departments; to 
provide for the additional structures without the accumulation of debt; 
to make yearly additions to the apparatus, library, cabinet, and other 
collections; and, finally, to establish the professional schools of law and 
medicine.” But these just hopes of what should be realized from the 
new endowment were vain; in a few years the University passed through 
the severest crisis in its history; fresh loans for the erection of the main 
hall threw an additional burden upon the funds, so that the closest 
economy barely sufficed to prevent the temporary closing of the Uni- 
versity. Finally, the income of the University in 1866 had dwindled to 
a@ mere pittance of five or six thousand dollars. 
In 1862 Wisconsin received two hundred and forty thousand acres of 
land by virtue of the Agricultural College Act. It is not necessary to 
review the old tale of low appraisals and of sales at almost nominal prices. 
The history of the application of this grant, in its productive form, be- 
longs properly to the second period of our history. And we may now 
leave this story of mismanagement and fraud to review the internal 
affairs of the University. When we return to the subject of the funds 
and endowments of the institution, we shall find that the year 1866 forms 
areal and decisive turning-point; we shall observe a different attitude 
toward the school on the part of both Legislature and public, and we 
shall see an attempt to atone for these errors of the past.

ORGANIZATION AND EARLY YEARS. 
Constitutional Provisions.—In addition to provisions for the appraisal 
and sale of the university lands, the State Constitution, which went 
into effect in 1848, contains the following section in relation to the Uni- 
versity: 
‘Provision shall be made by law for the establishment of a State 
University, at or near the seat of State government, and for connect- 
ing with the same from time to time such colleges in different parts of 
the State, as the interests of education may require. The proceeds of 
alllands that have been or may hereafter be granted by the United 
States to the State for the support of a University, shall be and remain 
a perpetual fund, to be called the ‘University Fund,’ the interest of 
which shall be appropriated to the support of the State University, and 
no sectarian instruction shall be allowed in such University.” 
Board of Regents.—An act of incorporation was passed soon after the 
organization of the State government. The control of the University 
was vested in a Board of Regents, consisting of a president and twelve 
members. The twelve were to be chosen by the State Legislature; 
they were to elect a chancellor, who should be ew officio president of 
the Board. : 
State Universities were at this period a new departure; the compar- 
ative merits of different systems of control had not yet been tested by 
experience, nor had events as yet called for thorough discussion of va- 
rious plans of external management. 
Early Conditions.—The first meeting of the Board of Regents was 
held October 7, 1848; but the first steps toward the organization of the’ 
University were not taken until January 16, 1849. Subsequent events 
indicate that the attempt to create a State collegiate institution was 
premature. Indeed, these preliminary steps had in view only a prepar- 
atory school; regular college classes were yet in the future. Even the 
common schools of the State were still in a low and struggling condi- 
tion. There were no high schools, intermediate in grade between the 
district school and the college. Academies under private management 
were extremely few in numbers. Altogether, there were no such ade- 
quate facilities for preparatory instruction as would be necessary to give 
the University the quality and number of students requisite for the 
highest success. Add to this, that there was no general public interest 
in higher education, and that such enthusiasm as there was attached 
almost exclusively to denominational schools. The toils incident to the 
development of a new country leave little opportunity for devotion to 
intellectual culture, and those labors are even hostile to growth in this 
direction. All energy and zeal are occupied in the daily practical duties 
of life. In addition to this, the people generally had not become recon- 
ciled to the idea of State control of higher education. Even now, many 
who concede fully the right of the State to establish and control the

common schools are opposed to extending the same principle to Higher 
education. But in 1849 the support of common schools by general tax- 
ation was a very recent departure from the old rate system. ‘There 
was a general feeling that it is not the proper function of the State to 
foster higher education, and that this should be left to private and de- 
nominational effort; and this the early settlers were taught by the ex- 
ample of their native States, from which they migrated, where govern- 
ment had done but little to build up the best institutions of learning in 
the land. 
Necessity of Barly Organization—But notwithstanding these formi- 
dable obstacles, it was necessary that the University should be imme- 
diately organized and launched upon its career. The reason for this 
Jay in the danger that the funds would be lost if an earnest were not 
given of a genuine intention on the part of the State to maintain a 
University. An actual University must be put into operation, to which 
the friends of State support of higher education could point, to empha- 
size the necessity of a careful management of its funds. A living uni- 
versity interest had to be created, that should rally its supporters to 
ward off all attacks upon the University’s resources. For, as we have 
seen, the experience of Michigan in the mismanagement of university 
grants was being repeated in Wisconsin, and to an even greater extent. 
The possibility that the University might never be more than a name 
would give free scope for other educational “interests” to seek to share 
its funds. There was also a manifest tendency to appraise and sell the 
university lands at merely nominal rates in order to attract settlers. 
Thus it became necessary to organize the University, even though, from 
. one point of view, the people were not ready for it. If an actual school 
were not at once instituted, there would soon be no adequate resources 
left to establish and sustain one in the future. 
Accordingly the regents, in their first annual report, were able to set 
forth some measures taken during the year, looking to the development 
of the nascent University. 
Selection of a Site—Among the locations yaUnnlh near the village of 
Madison, the regents decided that the one that had long been known 
as “College Hill,” in recognition of its fitness for the purpose, was the 
most suitable. The eminent wisdom of the choice was perhaps not 
fully realized at the time. The advantages to be offered by Madison 
as a centre of educational, social, and political activity could not indeed 
have been foreseen. But popular choice had long fixed upon the site 
chosen because of its natural attractions; and in this regard no place 
more thoroughly adapted for a University could be desired. As was 
said by President Bascom, long after the time we are now considering, 
“Tn the natural beauty of its grounds, and the desirableness of its loca- 
tion on Lake Mendota, it stands almost unrivalled among the colleges 
and universities of the United States. When this beauty shall be fully 
developed, it will be a constant source of inspiration, and an ever re-

newed invitation to the student to a thorough delight in the natural 
world. Adding itself to the enthusiasm of youth and the enthusiasm 
of inquiry, it makes the morning hours of knowledge bright in reality 
and glorious in memory.” 
The terms of sale offered by the owner of the property were accepted, 
and recommended to the Legislature for the required approval. The 
choice and the terms were sanctioned, and fifty acres were accordingly 
purchased. 
Preparatory School.—There were, at this time, few academies in the 
State where the requisite preparation.for a college course could be ob- 
tained. In new States a considerable period must elapse before the 
growth of population, the accumulation of wealth, the development of 
educational interest, and the appreciation of liberal culture lead to the 
establishment of high schools and academies in sufficient numbers to 
supply the colleges with adequate and abundant material. Accord- 
ingly the regents established a preparatory school. The western col- 
leges and universities generally have found it necessary to create and 
maintain for many years such adjuncts to the regular college instruction. 
The people of Madison tendered the use of a building rent-free, and 
the school was opened in February, 1850, under the charge of Prof. 
John W. Sterling. Professor Sterling was connected with the Univer- 
sity for thirty-four years, and his services to the institution, whether in 
its severe trials or in its prosperity, were of incalculable value. 
The regents limited their liability in respect to salaries to five hun- 
dred dollars. This illustrates the feeble beginnings and the scanty 
resources of the new University. It was expected that the avails of 
the tuition fees, which were fixed at twenty dollars per papil, would 
supply sufficient additional means. The preparatory course embraced 
the usual amount of classical study required for admission to the east- 
ern colleges. 
The Chancellor.—Although it was not expected that regular Univer- 
sity classes would be organized for some years to come, the regents 
elected a chancellor, in order that they might have the benefit of his 
professional skill and experience in all preliminary action. In view of 
prospective headship of the school, he would of course feel a great in- 
terest in all measures relating to it. As also the chancellor was made 
by the act of incorporation ex officio president of the Board, the law 
seemed to contemplate the election as one of the first duties of the 
regents. John H. Lathrop, then president of the University of Mis- 
souri, was chosen, His duties were to commence with the next col- 
legiate year. The chancellot’s salary was fixed at a maximum of two 
thousand dollars per annum, which was then the average salary of Ameri- 
ean college presidents. This amount was recommended to the Legisla- 
ture and approved. 
Cabinet.—Steps were taken to form a cabinet of natural history. H. 
A. Tenney, Esq., of Madison, was made the agent of the Board to col-  
-P-A-G-E-22
  
  20 HIGHER EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN. 
lect specimens, and served in this capacity and as librarian for some 
years. At the end of this period he had formed a very respectable 
nucleus of a cabinet. Said Prof. S. H. Carpenter, writing in 1876, 
“ Under his able and efficient management this department of the Uni- 
versity soon reached a development far beyond the most sanguine ex- 
pectations of its friends. It is to the self-denying labors of this early 
and true friend of the University that our present cabinet owes its ex- 
istence.” But these collections, together with very valuable and ex- 
tensive subsequent accumulations, were destroyed by fire in 1884, and 
cannot easily be replaced. 
The subject of buildings was also considered by the regents during 
the first year, but no definite plan was adopted. 
Opening of the University.—Section 9 of the act of incorporation pro- 
vided that ‘The University shall consist of four departments : 
1. The department of science, literature, and the arts. 
2. The department of law. 
3. The department of medicine. 
4, The department of the theory and practice of elementary in- 
struction.” 
The preparatory school was, of course, intended to fit pupils for the 
“ department of science, literature, and the arts.” The. opening of the 
University proper did not occur until January 16, 1850, when Chancellor 
Lathrop was formally inaugurated. The question of immediate practi- 
cal interest and importance was that of the organization of the fourth 
department mentioned above. Special stress was laid upon this, both in 
the inaugural address and in that of one of the regentson behalf of the 
Board. 
The Constitution of the State provides that the residue of the school 
fund beyond the amount required for the support and maintenance of 
common schools in each school district, and the purchase of suitable 
libraries and apparatus therefor, shall be appropriated to the support 
and maintenance of academies and normal schools. One of the most 
prominent educational topics under discussion in the country at the 
time was that of normal schools, and it was foreseen that earnest efforts 
would be made to establish them in Wisconsin and to secure a large 
fund for the purpose. It was the object of the University to secure 
these resources, or part of them, in aid of the normal department. 
But in providing for the support of normal schools, the constitutional 
provision rather had in view separate schools for purely professional 
training. It does not fairly embrace a branch of the University, such 
as is indicated in the charter and such as is now being revived in our 
university chairs of theory and practice of teaching. But in the absence 
of normal schools it was thought that the patronage of the University 
would be increased by the attendance of those seeking preparation as 
teachers, and that the teachers’ institute work could be most readily 
carried on for a time through the medium of the University. Zealous ex-

ertions were made, year after year, to secure aid for the normal depart- 
ment from the school fund. 
Professorships.—Previous to the inauguration, at a special meeting in 
November, 1849, the regents had taken the first steps toward opening 
two of the departments marked out in the organic law: The depart- 
ment of “ science, literature, and the arts,” and that of the “theory and 
practice of elementary instruction.” There were established in the first- 
mentioned department the following six professorships: 
1. Ethies, civil polity, and political economy. 
Mental philosophy, logic, rhetoric, and English. 
. Ancient languages and literature. 
. Modern languages and literature. 
. Mathematics, natural philosophy, and astronomy. 
6. Chemistry and natural history. 
Here were incongruous unions of unrelated subjects. But these sub- 
divisions of the field of learning, although not as minute as the special- 
ization of knowledge and research even then required, were asextended 
as the resources would permit. It will be noticed in particular that his- 
tory was not provided for at all. But with all its imperfections, viewed 
from the stand-point of to-day, the scheme was not inadequate to give 
the University a very respectable rank, as American colleges then were. 
A normal professorship was established for the other department. 
The salary of each professor was fixed at a maximum of one thousand 
dollars per annum. ‘The chancellor took the chair of ethics, civil polity, 
and political economy; to Professor Sterling was assigned that of 
mathematics, natural philosophy, and astronomy. The other profess- 
orships were to be filled as fast as means would allow ; in the meantime, 
the labors in these were divided among the existing professors and 
tutors. 
College Classes.—Meanwhile, the preparatory school was in successful 
operation, and the first university class was formed August 4, 1840. 
The chancellor and Professor Sterling constituted the instructional force 
during the ensuing year, with the addition of O, M. Conover, who was 
employed as tutor the second term. Mr. Conover was also destined to 
long and useful service in the University. 
In their report of January 16, 1850, the regents again called special 
attention to the desirability of an early beginning in the normal de- 
partment. The plan conteniplated the admission of female as well as 
male teachers to all advantages of the school. A model school was to 
be conducted for observation and practice. The plan in itself was wise 
and efficient; but the State furnished no aid, and the resources at the 
command of the regents were not sufficient. a 
For many years thereafter the lack of funds prevented any serious 
consideration of departments of law and medicine. 
The Faculty remained unchanged until the third year, commencing 
September, 1852, when Mr. Conover was made professor of ancient be cle Oo

languages and literature. His place as tutor was filled by Stephen H. 
Carpenter. A Sophomore class was formed in September, 1851, a Junior 
class the next year, and a Senior class in 1853. In 1854 the first class— 
two young men—was graduated. 
Buildings.—There was not sufficient interest and faith ina State Uni- 
versity to secure a State appropriation for needed buildings. The re- 
gents were consequently obliged to have recourse to a loan of twenty- 
five thousand dollars from the principal of the University Fund. This 
was, in reality, an illegal measure, as it was the income merely of the 
Federal grants that were to be applied to the support of a University. 
It became ‘necessary to apply the income of the fund, which should 
have been appropriated solely for the salaries of professors and to the in- 
erease of library, cabinet, and apparatus, to the repayment of the loan. 
The University was thus seriously crippled for many years. But with 
the loan, in 1851, North Dormitory, the first University building, now 
knownas North Hall, was constructed. Some of the rooms were used 
for lectures, recitations, library, and apparatus, and others afforded 
apartments for study and lodging for from fifty to sixty-five students. 
The foundations for a second structure, intended for the use of the nor- 
mal department, were laid at the same time, but lack of means prevented 
the continuance of the work for several years. Finally, a loan of fifteen 
thousand dollars from the principal of the University Fund was author- 
ized by the Legislature, and the South Dormitory was ready for use in 
the fall of 1855. Again the fatal policy of making the cost of these 
structures lie as a dead weight on the income of the University Fund 
was secn. The cost of the work exceeded the amount of the loan by 
three thousand dollars. This deficit was swelled by the cost of super- 
intendence, furnaces, and fitting up of public rooms to four thousand 
five hundred dollars. The diversion of large sums to extraordinary 
uses compelled the regents to defer the appointment of a professor of 
modern languages, and the enlargement of the library, cabinet, and ap- 
paratus. 
Nevertheless the regents were full of hope. An additional grant of 
seventy-two sectiens of land was made by Congress in further endow- 
ment of the University. It has already been shown in what glowing 
terms the regents in their report for 1854 pictured the future of the 
University, and how these bright prospects were soon overclouded. A 
farther loan for a building that was finished in 1859 added to the em- 
barrassments already mentioned. 
Agriculture and Mechanics.—As early as 1851 the regents had urged 
the need of a department of the practical applications of science, and 
also of a school of agriculture. These were then subjects of intense 
and wide-spread interest throughout the country, and public opinion 
was forcing the colleges to take measures for providing facilities for 
scientific and technical studies. The report of 1851 was, therefore, 
largely taken up with the subject, and year after year the hope was ex-
-P-A-G-E-25

pressed that by means of national or State bounty the University might 
be able to comply with the public sense and demand in these directions. 
But it was not until 1854 that the first slight advance was made; in 
that year the regents were able to provide specially for the teaching of 
natural science. In May 8S. P. Lathrop entered upon the duties of pro- 
fessor of chemistry and natural history. A small appropriation of one 
thousand dollars for chemical and philosophical apparatus was ex- 
pended in judicious purchases by Professor Lathrop. He died in Decem- 
ber, 1854, and a year passed before his place was filled by the appoint- 
ment of Dr. Ezra Carr to the vacant position. Professor Carr delivered 
a course of lectures on agriculture, chemistry, and the applications of 
science to the useful arts, but the limited time, the lack of appliances, 
and the limitation of the instructional force to one professor made the 
work in mechanics and agriculture entirely superficial and inadequate. 
This was due, not to any lack of ability or fitness in the professor, but 
to the very necessities of the case in the infant institution. E 
Completion of the College Faculty.—During the collegiate year 1855-56, + 
the College Faculty was completed by appointments to all the remain- 
ing professorships, as provided for in the plan adopted six years before. 
Dr. John P. Fuchs, previously employed as tutor, was appointed to the 
chair of modern languages and literature; Daniel Read, LL. D., was 
made professor of mental philosophy, logic, rhetoric, and English litera- 
ture; and Dr. E. S. Carr, as above stated, professor of chemistry and 
natural history. 
Normal Department.—In addition to his collegiate appointment, the 
regents elected Professor Read to the normal chair in the department 
of “theory and practice of elementary instruction.” Professional in- 
struction was “to be rendered in the art of teaching, during the sum- 
mer term of each year.” Thus the first step was taken in the long- 
eherished project of normal training. The experiment was continued 
only to the extent of two courses of lectures by Professor Read. The 
first, beginning in the latter part of May, 1856, continued through the 
eight remaining weeks of the term. Highteen students attended these 
lectures. The second course, in 1857, was attended by twenty-eight 
students. Several years passed thereafter before a special course for 
teachers was revived. 
Attendance and Growth.—Meanwhile the number of students was 
steadily increasing. The hostility of a large portion of the public to 
the new institution was, however, but slowly overcome. There was 
little popular appreciation of State universities. Chancellor Lathrop, 
in his report of December 25, 1851, thus indicated the state of the pub- 
lic mind: ‘¢ Were the funds of the institution in a productive form and 
now adequate to its liberal support, there would not be, in my judg- 
ment, any lack of liberal patronage arising from any supposed bias in 
the mind of the community against a University under the control of 
the State, and constituting a part of its educational system. If a preju-
-P-A-G-E-26

dice of this kind ever existed, it is fast disappearing before more en- 
lightened views of the duty of the State to make the range of its 
institutions of learning co-extensive with the entire educational wants 
of the community. 
“Tn a new country, and among a pioneer population, there is not, 
generally, the same appreciation of a liberal education as prevails in 
older communities. The immediate objects of men in the formation of 
new settlements do not so manifestly require high intellectual culture. 
From the operation of this cause, the patronage of a new University in 
a new State is not likely, during the first generation, to keep pace with 
the progress of wealth. 
“Tt is also true in a new country, that in proportion to the popula- 
tion, there are fewer families than in older communities who are able 
to send their sons from home for the prosecution of a liberal course of 
study. 
“There is another cause which has greatly retarded the growth of 
. western institutions. There is, not unnaturally, a disposition on the 
part of those of our citizens who have been most successful in the ac- 
cumulation of wealth to finish the education of their sons at eastern 
institutions, with whose reputation they had been familiar from their 
earliest years. 
“From the operation of these causes it cannot be expected that the 
classes which pursue the whole collegiate course through to gradua- 
tion will be large for the first ten years. This has been the universal 
experience of western institutions ; and the most that can be reasona- 
biy expected of the University of Wisconsin is, that it should not fall 
behind, in the number of its graduates, the most successful of the new 
institutions of the like grade.” 
The whole number of students up to 1852 was but 46; the attend- 
ance in 1852-53 was 66, and, with the exception of two years, we finda 
steady increase. In 1858-59 the attendance was 243. There were five 
graduates in 1857, the largest number until 1859 and 1860, in each of 
which years there were eight. 
A Critical Period.—Y et, this increase in patronage was in spite of the 
growing feeling of hostility which has already been noted. Criticisms 
upon the University were rife, and there were constant charges of gen- 
eral mismanagement and failure to meet the wants of the people. But 
the fortunes of the University had been so largely taken out of the con- 
trol of the regents by the action of the State that the Board was power- 
less to accomplish more thanit did. From authorizing loans from the 
principal of the University Fund the Legislature had gone on to the as- 
sumption of complete contro]; and the idea was fostered and spread 
abroad that the State might doas it pleased with the trust reposed in 
her. “ Indeed,” says Professor Carpenter, “‘ many members of the Leg- 
islature came to the capital ignorant of the fact that the University was 
supported by a trust fund; and looked upon the funds used in its main-
-P-A-G-E-27

tenance as so much taken from the State treasury (as it was by the 
fiction of the law of 1854), and therefore so much added to the burden 
of general taxation. The denominational colleges sent up petitions 
asking that the University Fund and its income be divided among them, 
and the State University be abandoned. Many names were attached 
to these petitions, and the local press favored the measure, until a press- 
ure was brought to bear upon the Legislature that was almost irresisti- 
ble.” 
“On the 19th of March, 1855, a member of the Board of Regents 
(elected on the 15th) introduced a bill into the Assembly to repeal 
the charter of the University, distribute its funds, and give its in- 
come to the denominational colleges of the State. This was looked 
upon as such a manifest betrayal of his trust as a regent that his prop- 
osition met with but little favor, and he obtained permission to with- 
draw it. The next year (in March, 1856) a bill was introduced into 
the Senate ‘for an act to regulate the disbursement of the income of 
the University Fund.’ The reasons assigned in support of this meas- 
ure were the general mismanagement of the institution, and its alleged 
failure to meet the wants of the people. The temper of the. Legisla- 
ture is shown by the fact that the Senate ordered the document printed 
at the expense of the State, and two thousand copies were scattered 
over the State.” 
In order to obviate some of the criticisms, the Board of Regents pro- 
ceeded to organize the departments of law and medicine. The latter 
of these was established in 1855 with eight professorships, to which in- 
cumbents were named. But the medical school only existed for a short 
time, on. paper. 
Professors of law were elected in 1857, but, owing to lack of funds, 
this attempt at organization of a department of law came to naught. 
But an outery against the additional expenditure involved in the 
small appropriation made by the regents for the support of the law and 
medical schools caused the Board to rescind their action at a meeting 
called specially for the purpose. Soon after a bill for the total reor- 
ganization of the University was presented in the Legislature, and 
finally failed of passage only by not being reached in the last hours of 
the session, 
As a result of the agitation the regents were compelled to yield to 
the popular demand by voluntarily adopting substantially the same 
plan as was contained in the defeated bill. The following communica- 
tion from Chancellor Lathrop to the Board of Regents, in June, 1858, 
indicates the points wherein the failure or inefficiency of the Univer- 
sity was conceived to lie: “The agitation of the University interest in 
‘the late Legislature developed two ideas connected with the adminis- 
tration of the institution, of sufficient importance, in the opinion of sev- 
eral members, to justify a call of the Board. 
“The first is, that the time has arrived for a full development of the
-P-A-G-E-28
  
  26 HIGHER EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN. 
normal department of the University. As the regents of normal 
schools indicate a disposition to co-operate with the regents of the 
University in this behalf, I would recommend this subject to the favor- 
able consideration and action of the Board. 
“The other idea is, that in the administration of the department of 
‘science, literature, and the arts’ in the University, a more distinct bias 
should be given to its instructions in the direction of the several arts 
and avocations as they exist among men; that the practical should 
take rank of the theoretical in the forms as well as the substance of 
University culture.” 
These two points, in fact, had been specially prominent in the popu- 
lar demand from the very beginning. In the plan proposed in the Leg- 
islature the departments were enumerated as follows: (1) Normal in- 
struction; (2) agriculture; (3) commerce; (4) civil and mechanical en- 
gineering; (5) natural science; (6) philosophy; (7) jurisprudence; (8) 
philology; and doubtless these were enumerated in about the order in 
which the supporters of the bill conceived they should take rank. The 
Legislature also broke over the ancient college tradition in proposing 
to admit women to the full benefits of the University. 
In the plan of reorganization adopted by the Board of Regents there 
was a somewhat different arrangement of departments, or schools: 
Philosophy, philology, natural science, civil and mechanical engineer- 
ing, agriculture, polity. The order in which these departments are 
named is significant of the opinion held by the regents as to the proper 
place of the humanities in the college curriculum, as contrasted with 
the views put forth in the Legislature. 
Immediately after this reorganization Chancellor Lathrop resigned, 
and was elected to the chair of ethical and political science. But this 
position, too, he resigned soon after, and withdrew entirely from the 
University, in order that the institution might not be embarrassed by 
any odium which had attached to him, though unjustly, on account of 
his part in the late struggle. This crisis in the history of the Univer- 
sity is thus summed up by Professor Carpenter: “ Thus ended the long 
and eventful struggle between the University and its critics. In the 
end the justice of much that was urged against its’ management was 
acknowledged by the substantial acceptance of the proposed plan by 
the Board of Regents, and by the fact that with its adoption all legis- 
lative interference ceased, and a firm and generous friendship took the 
place of the old coldness and lack of confidence.” 
The University was yet to pass through a period of trial and decline; 
but it was not again obliged to contend for its very existence; it did 
not again have to meet such extreme and virulent hostility. : 
The Ohancellorship—Dr. Henry Barnard was chosen as successor to 
Chancellor Lathrop. In addition to the presidency of the University, 
Doctor Barnard received an appointment as agent of the normal school 
board, to conduct institutes and deliver educational addresses. Great   
 
-P-A-G-E-29

expectations were formed of the benefits to accrue to all parts of the 
school system from Doctor Barnard’s connection with it. But these 
hopes were not destined to be realized, although they were justified by 
the reputation and by the well-known zeal and energy of the new 
chancellor. Dr. Barnard’s health was poor, and for considerable pe- 
riods he was unable to attend to his duties. Such effort as he was 
able to make was put forth in discharge of his duties as agent of the 
normal school board. The uplifting of the common schools was the ob- 
ject of his special labor and enthusiasm. The University saw little or 
nothing of him, and. suffered greatly in consequence from lack of a 
guiding and controlling hand. 
Dr. Barnard’s resignation, offered in June, 1860, was accepted in 
February of the next year. The chancellorship remained vacant for a 
number of years. Professor Sterling, as “dean” of the Faculty, acted 
meanwhile as executive officer of the University. To him the Univer- 
sity owes a great debt for faithful and untiring services in these criti- 
eal years. Doubtless the Board of Regents should have given him 
in name the position and the power that he held in fact. The lack of 
responsible headship was of great detriment to the University; its po- 
sition was lowered in the opinion of both students and public. 
The Ciwil War.—Financial embarrassments, which became very se- 
rious about 1860, obliged the regents to lessen the working force of the 
University and reduce expenses to the lowest possible figure. An or- 
dinance of June 11, 1860, limited the instructional force to five profes- 
sors and one tutor. Salaries were reduced at the same time. In this 
way the University was able to tide over a period of extreme adver- 
sity. 
The following were the members of the faculty as reorganized: 
John W, Sterling, Dean of the Faculty and Professor of Mathe- 
matics and Natural Philosophy. 
Daniel Read, Professor of Mental, Ethical, and Political Science, 
Rhetoric, and English Laterature. 
Ezra S. Carr, Professor of Chemistry and Natural History. 
James D. Butler, Professor of Ancient Languages and Literature. 
John P. Fuchs, Professor of Modern Languages and Literature. 
J.B. Parkinson, Tutor. 
David H. Tullis, Instructor in Commercial Calculations and Book- 
keeping. 
The military spirit developed by the War pervaded the University not 
less than the community at large. At the beginning of the year 1861, 
a military company was organized among the students. It was en- 
couraged by the Faculty, who state, in their report of 1862, “Besides 
enabling most who have left us for the army to start as officers, it has 
heightened the physical vigor of all who have shared in it, and thus 
given aid to true mental efforts.” The War of course caused a great

decrease in attendance. Not only did it prevent the accession of new 
students, but it drew many away from the University itself. Nineteen 
students are reported as serving in the army in 1861, and thirty-five in 
1862. All the class of 1864 were in the field, and, for the first time 
since 1854, no commencement exercises were held. The annual attend- 
ance was reduced to fifty or sixty. In the face of extreme discourage- 
ments and in spite of meagre compensation the little band of professors 
toiled bravely on, until the return of peace and a new era of prosperity 
infused fresh life into the University. 
The Female College.—During the spring term of 1863 a normal depart- 
ment was opened under charge of Prof. Charles H. Allen. Seventy-six 
ladies at once took advantage of the course. For the first time women 
were allowed the privileges of the University. The members of the 
normal school enjoyed the full course of University studies. While the , 
department was established primarily for the training of teachers, the 
regents explained that the lectures in the University courses, upon 
chemistry, geology, botany, mechanical philosophy, and English litera- 
ture, would be free to all. The Faculty in 1865 say of the normal school : 
“The Faculty are of the opinion that the normal department has 
made the University a more useful institution, during the past three 
years, than otherwise it would have been. It is not, however, to be 
disguised that, among many former students of the University, and 
among leading ones now in the institution, there has been a strong feel- 
ing of opposition to the department, mainly on the ground ofits bring- 
ing females into the University. There has been an apprehension that 
the standard of culture would be lowered in consequence. No reason 
whatever has as yet existed for this apprehension. There has been no 
such mingling of classes in the higher and more recondite subjects as to 
render this effect possible, even if it would be the result; and, in point 
of fact, there has not been a period in the history of the University when 
some few students have carried their studies to a higher or wider range 
than in recent classes.” ‘ 
The time was to come when it would be recognized that these young 
men must look well to their laurels in the “higher and more recondite © 
subjects.” 
Professor Allen resigned in January, 1865, intending to leave at the 
end of the school year. He remained, however, a part of the fall term. 
Prof. Joseph L. Pickard was his successor, serving during the winter 
and spring terms of 1866. 
Dawn of Prosperity.—The close of the War and the revival of business 
prosperity increased the number of students and led to plans for ex- 
panding the scope of the university work. But the prospects were not 
yet sufficiently bright to induce Hon. J. L. Pickard to accept the chan- 
cellorship, which was offered him in June, 1865. The office of vice- 
chancellor was created, and held by Professor Sterling until 1866. 
But increased resources and a radical reorganization were necessary
-P-A-G-E-31
  
UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 29 
to enable the University to meet the requirements of the work demanded 
from it. From the report of the Secretary of State for 1866 it appears 
that the whole amount at the disposal of the regents for the year 
1866-67 was about $5,646.40, Out of this were to be paid the salaries 
of six or seven professors, two assistants in the normal department, and 
incidental expenses, such as fuel, repairs, ete. And, in order to create 
confidence in the University and secure the needed aid from the State, 
a reconstruction of the Faculty, and, in fact, an entire change in the 
organic law were necessary. The people were now prepared to sustain 
a public institution for higher education, if it were mide adequate to 
its purpose. 
Summary.—The history of the University thus far has been one of ad- 
versity and, at times, even of struggle for life. There has been little to 
recount of progress and expansion inits work. The causes of this lack 
of vigor and progressiveness were two—the hostility to State institutions 
of higher education and the dissipation of the resources of the University 
through the mismanagement of its finances. Yet, meagre as the origi- 
nal endowments proved to be as compared with what was justly ex- 
pected, they were sufficient to maintain the University until public 
sentiment was ripe in favor of State support of higher education. The 
foundations were then laid npon which a goodly structure could be 
raised. But without the nucleus of the national aid there would in 
Wisconsin, as in other States, be no State University. It would have 
been impossible in the first twenty years of Wisvonsin’s history to in- 
duce the people to tax themselves for the support of higher education, 
and probably the time would yet be distant when they would do so to 
build up an institution from the very corner-stone. At the time now 
reached, however, the old dislike toward “State” universities had 
largely disappeared. An institution already in existence and with at 
least a local ‘reputation could command general favor and generous 
support. 
REORGANIZATION AND GROWTH. 
The development of Wisconsiw’s resources, the increase of wealth, the 
broadening educational interest, stimulated by the success of such State 
institutions of higher education as those of Michigan and Iowa, made 
it necessary to reorganize the University and enlarge the scope of its 
work, in order to adapt it to the new and larger demands. The curricu- 
Jum was narrow and inflexible. The University could not be lifted out of 
the accustomed rut without a radical change in its spirit and methods. 
The traditional college course must be superseded by an organiza- 
tion capable of expanding in response to the requirements of the 
active educational thought and experience, and which would bring the 
University, closer to the real needs and life of the people. The plan 
of reconstruction adopted in 1866 was sufficiently broad to embrace new 
elements of progress for many years.
-P-A-G-E-32
  30 HIGHER EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN. 
The history since this reorganization presents a marked change from 
the former period in the spirit and attitude of the public toward the 
University. Distrust and neglect are replaced by confidence and gener- 
osity. The history of the past twenty years is one of steady growth, 
progress, and prosperity. 
Endowment, Funds, and Buildings.—The act to reorganize and enlarge 
the University was approved April 12, 1866. » Provision for its support 
is made by Section 13: “For the endowment and support of the Uni- 
versity there are hereby appropriated: Ist, The income of the Univer. 
sity Fund. 2d, The income of a fund to be derived from the sales of 
the two hundred and forty thousand acres of land granted by Congress 
to the State of Wisconsin, by virtue of an act approved July 2, 1862, 
entitled ‘An act donating to the several States and Territories which 
may provide colleges for the benefit of agriculture and the mechanic 
arts,’ which fund shall be designated as the Agricultural College Fund. 
3d, All such contributions to the.endowment fund as may be derived 
from public or private bounty. The entire income of all said funds 
shall be placed at the disposal of the Board of Regents, for the support 
of the aforesaid colleges of arts, of letters, and of such colleges as 
shall be established in the University, as provided in Section 2 of this 
act: Provided, That all means derivable from other public or from 
private bounty shall be exclusively devoted to the specific objects for 
which they shall have been designed by the grantors.” 
The University Fund consists of the proceeds of the grants of 1838 
and 1854. The income, aside from taxes levied since 1866, is derived 
from interest on land certificates and on loans. At the time of the re- 
organization the Fund amounted to $160,230.70, and the receipts for the 
year ending September 30, 1867, were $11,894.20, In 1887 there were 
1,710 acres of university lands unsold. The principal of the Fund, ex- 
cept a small cash balance in the State treasury, is produttive, drawing 
interest mainly at seven per cent. On September 30, 1886, the amount 
of the productive University Fund was $190,998.35. 
The second item of the endowment accrues to the University by the 
incorporation with it of the school of agriculture and mechanics, founded 
on the so-called agricultural college grant of 1862. One of the most 
difficult questions involved in the reorganization was the proper disposi- 
tion of this grant. Inducements were offered to secure the connection 
of the school of agriculture and mechanics with some private denomi- 
national school, as was done in other States. Two successive Legisla- 
tures refused to apply the fund to the establishment of an independent 
school. Action was postponed until near the end of the period of five 
years within which the school must be in existence in order to avoid a 
forfeiture of the grant. Finally it was deemed best to incorporate the 
school with the University, especially in view of its character as a State 
institution. Accordingly it was made the duty of the Board of Regents, 
as soon as organized, to make arrangements to secure suitable lands in

the vicinity of the University for an experimental farm, and to make 
such improvements thereon as would render it available for experi- 
mental and instructional purposes, in connection with the agricultural 
schools. To enable the Board to purchase and improve these lands, 
Dane County, under authority of the act, issued bonds for forty thou- 
sand dollars. With this amount nearly 195 acres of land west of the 
old university grounds and adjoining them were purchased at a cost of 
$27,054. The amount of productive Agricultural College Fund, Sep- 
tember 30, 1886, was $258,597.74. The Fund yielded in the two years, 
1886 and 1887; $32,990.91. The number of acres unsold, 1887, was 4,974. 
Both the University and the Agricultural College Funds have very 
nearly, if not quite, reached their maximum limits. 
Before the reorganization in 1866 the State had never appropriated 
one dollar toward the support of its University, notwithstanding its 
serious financial embarrassments. The income was reduced from $18,- 
397.70 in 1861, to $13,005.56 in 1862, and to $11,540.90 in 1863. The 
amount of University Fund income on hand September 30, 1866, was 
$5,501.47. This, with $144.93 belonging to the income of the Agricult- 
ural College Fund, constituted the whole amount at the disposal of the 
Regents for defraying incidental expenses and paying the salaries of 
six or seven professors, and two assistants in the normal department, 
during the year 1866-67. But immediately after the reorganization, the 
Legislature adopted a more liberal policy. By a law of 1862, $104,- 
339.42 had been taken from the University Fund. This sum was virtu- 
ally restored by an act of 1867, which appropriated annually for ten 
years to the income of the University Fund $7,303.76, being the interest 
on the amount taken from the Fund by the law of 1862. Hitherto the 
burden of caring for its funds had been thrown upon the University ; 
but now the State treasurer was made ex officio treasurer of the Uni- 
versity. The same liberal policy was still further pursued by the Legis- 
lature of 1870, which appropriated fifty thousand dollars for the erection 
of Ladies’ Hall. A gymnasium was built in that year; but this is ill- 
constructed and poorly equipped, and must soon be replaced by a struct- 
ure better adapted to the purpose. 
By an act of the Legislature approved March 22, 1872, it was provided 
that there should be levied and collected for the year 1872, and annually 
thereafter, a State tax of ten thousand dollars, to be used as a part of 
the University income. The preamble cites in justification of this ap- 
propriation the reckless way in which the State had disposed of its grant 
from the General Government, thereby diminishing by one-half the fund 
which a faithful administration of the trust would have produced. Thus, 
when it was too late, confession of the wrong done the University was 
frankly made. . 
The increasing good-will of the people of the State toward the Univer- 
sity was further shown in 1875 by an appropriation of eighty thousand
-P-A-G-E-36
32 HIGHER EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN. 
dollars for the erection of Science Hall. This building was completed 
in 1877. 
In 1876 the annual tax of ten thousand dollars was replaced by one 
yielding alarger amount. ‘The new tax was based on the assessed valua- 
tion of the taxable property of the State, being one-tenth of a mill on the 
dollar. This tax was declared “to be deemed a full compensation for all 
deficiencies in the income arising from the disposition of the lands do- 
nated to the State by Congress in trust for the University.” This tax was 
increased to one-eighth of a mill on the dollar in 1883, and the increase 
is deveted to the maintenance of a chair of pharmacy and materia 
medica, and to an agricultural experiment station. The State tax in 
1886 yielded $61,017.45. It now forms the chief resource of the Uni- 
versity. 
In 1879 an assembly hall and a library were completed at a cost of 
thirty thousand dollars. December 1, 1884, Science Hall was burned 
with allits contents. At its session that winter the Legislature appro- 
priated out of the general fund of the State the sum of one hundred 
and fifty thousand dollars for a new Science Hall, machine shop, and 
boiler house ; twenty thousand dollars for chemical laboratory; twenty 
thousand dollars for heating apparatus; a total of one hundred and 
ninety thousand dollars. Science Hall, first occupied in February, 1888, 
was the last of these buildings to be completed. 
In 1885 a permanent appropriation, not to exceed five thousand dol- 
lars in any one year, was made for farmers’ institutes. These will be 
treated of in another connection. 
From private munificence the University has received Washburn Ob- 
servatory, named in honor of the donor, the late Governor ©. C. Wash- 
burn, at whose expense it was erected and equipped in 1878. 
In 1878 Hon. John A. Johnson, of Madison, endowed ten scholar- 
ships of thirty-five dollars annual value each, and in 1888, Hon. John 
Johnston, of Milwaukee, established a scholarship of two hundred and 
fifty dollars per annum, in addition to a fellowship, mentioned elsewhere. 
Board of Regents.—The method of election of the regents by the Legis- 
Jature was abandoned in the reorganization, and the power of appoint- 
ment was vested in the Governor. The president of the University was 
no longer to be a member of the Board. In both these respects events 
have shown that the new organization was faulty. The States gener- 
ally have given the presidents of their Universities a voice in the delib- 
erations and decisions of the boards of control. By this means the skill 
and experience of the president, and his intimate acquaintance with 
the condition and needs of the school of which he has immediate charge 
and for whose welfare he feels himself most responsible, are made avail- 
able and effective. The almost universal agreement on the point 
among institutions of the kind indicates that experience has shown the 
desirability of this feature. Without it there is lack of mutual confi- 
dence and helpfulness, a constant tendency to irritation and conflict.

No other State besides Wisconsin, except Ohio, has ventured to leave 
so important a trust as the selection of regents in the hands of the Gov- 
ernor alone. However smoothly such a system as this may work under 
favorable circumstances, the possi bility that the power of appointment 
may be used for political or personal ends is too great to warrant such 
a prerogative. : 
These objectionable features of the act of 1866 remain unchanged; 
but of late a movement has sprung up looking especially to securing for 
the alumni a voice in the election of regents and a representation in the 
Board. A bill to that effect was defeated in the Legislature in the ses- 
sion of 1887, A substitute bill, providing for elections by the people, 
after passing both houses was vetoed by the Governor on merely tech- 
nical grounds. In all the legislative discussions upon the subject no 
valid objections were offered to the proposed plans upon their merits. 
Hither of them would be an improvement upon the present system. 
The Board of Regents consists of twelve members, of whom the State 
Superintendent is ex officio regent, two are appointed from the State at 
large, and nine from the respective congressional districts. The term is 
three years from the first Monday of February in the year of appoint. 
ment, unless the member is sooner removed by the Governor. 
Internal Progress.—The organic law of 1866 systematizes the Univer- 
sity thus: The college of arts, the college of letters, and such other col- 
leges as from time to time may be added thereto or connected therewith. 
Under the authority of this latter clause a law school was established, 
so that, as at present constituted, the University comprises three col- 
. leges: Letters, arts, law. 
Sections 2 and 3 of the act point out the scope of the instruction: 
“SECTION 2, The college of arts shall embrace courses of instruction 
in the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences, with their applica- 
tions to the industrial arts, such as agriculture, mechanics, and engi- 
neering, mining and metallurgy, manufactures, architecture, and com- 
merce; in such branches included in the college of letters as shail be 
necessary to a proper fitness of the pupils for their chosen pursuits, 
and in military tactics; and as soon as the income of the University 
will allow, in such order as the wants of the public shall seem to re- 
quire, the said courses in the sciences and their application to the 
practical arts shall be expanded into distinct colleges of the University, 
each with its own Facnlty and appropriate title. 
“SECTION 3. The college of letters shall be coexistent with the col- 
. lege of arts, and shall embrace a liberal course of instruction in language, 
literature, and philosophy, together with such courses or parts of courses 
in the college of arts as the authorities of the University shall pre- 
scribe.”. : 
The long vacant presidency was filled by the election of Paul A. 
Chadbourne, then president of the Agricultural College of Massachu- 
setts. J. L. Pickard had before this been offered the position, but de- 
11411—No. 1 2 oO

clined to accept. Doctor Chadbourne likewise had once refused to 
take the presidency. He had twice visited the State to inquire into the 
condition and prospects of the University, but feared that the admission 
of women to the full privileges of the University would prevent its 
growth and usefulness. Not until the Legislature of 1867 had passed 
an act allowing the regents to provide for women in a separate depart- 
ment and “ under regulations and restrictions,” was he prevailed upon 
to accept the presidency. Then, says Professor Carpenter, “he entered 
with great zeal and ability upon-the task of a thorough reorganization 
of the University. A new Faculty was to be selected, new courses of 
study to be provided, the female college to be adjusted in its relations to 
the University, besides the numberless details and unforeseen difficul- 
ties that beset any new undertaking. So radical a change in the man- 
agement of the University of course awakened more or less opposition, 
and the acts of the new managers were in some quarters severely criti- 
cised, but, on the whole, public sentiment sustained the new Board.” 
On account of ill health President Chadbourne resigned in 1870. 
For a year the University was again under the charge of Professor 
Sterling, as vice-president. In June, 1871, Rev. J. H. Twombly was 
elected president. After his resignation, January 21, 1874, John Bas- 
com was chosen to the presidency, and held the office until June, 1887. 
T. C. Chamberlain, formerly State geologist and professor in Beloit 
College, now holds the position. 
Professor Sterling was the only one of the former Faculty perma- 
nently retained after the reorganization. Yet the difficulty met with in 
securing a president necessitated a temporary retention of the profes- 
sors under the old régime, as well as a continuance of the old course of 
instruction. Agriculture, however, was at once added to the list of 
studies. In 1867 the Faculty was wholly re-constituted, except that 
Professor Sterling, as above stated, was retained. <A list of the sue- 
cessive additions to the Faculty, with the dates of the same, is appended 
for the purpose of showing the progress in the expansion of the uni- 
versity work and in the specialization and division of the various de- 
partments.

A few of these were, at the dates given, assistant professors, most of 
whom have since been promoted to full professorships. No mention is 
made in the above list of many instructors and assistants. Many named 
in the list were instructors before being elected to professorships; in 
very many cases they were advanced, after varying periods of service 
as tutors, on true civil service principles. Various successive changes 
in the titles of several of the chairs are not indicated in the above list. 
Further than this brief outline and suggestion of the lines and times of 
development in the respective departments, little can be added here. 
At the time of the reorganization the need of better facilities for in- 
struction in the various branches of physical science occupied attention 
most largely forthe moment. The material development of the country 
after the Civil War brought into sharp contrast the desirable and the 
possible with the actual fruits of scientific teaching. The deficiency of 
the University in natural science was one of the principal causes of the 
public distrust, and it was these studies that assumed special promi- 
nence under the new order of things. In fact, the University of Wis- 
consin, especially in recent years, may seem to have leaned toward 
scientific rather than literary studies. But this is only apparent. It 
js due to the large appropriations for the erection of buildings for the 
scientific departments and for the supply of apparatus and appliances. 
The cost of furnishing the scientific-departments is of necessity much 
greater than that which secures the outfit for the college of letters. 
But there has been no intention to give any preference to physical sci- 
ence, and future appropriations, which will doubtless be made, will 
temporarily give the same apparent preponderance to the literary 
courses. : 
The “ modern classical” course was established in 1872, and has served 
as a model for similar courses in many private colleges in the West. 
The course was identical with the “ancient classical,” except that Ger- 
man and French were substituted for the Greek of the latter course. 
The adoption of this course was a part of the general movement then 
prominent for replacing the traditional curriculum by studies of a more 
modern cast. The degree of bachelor of letters is given upon the com- 
pletion of thi€ course. A portion of the Faculty strongly advocated 
granting the same degree, bachelor of arts, to graduates in this course 
as was bestowed upon those who completed the ancient classical 
course; but it was finally decided not to give the new course the equal 
rank that this would imply. 
A distinct course in general science was arranged in 1873. The 
English course, in which there is only one language required—and that a 
modern, French or German,—was adopted in 1886; the degree of B. L. 
(English) is given at graduation in this course. 
The College of Arts now includes the general science course, and the 
special technical departments of agriculture, pharmacy, civil engineer- 
ing, mining and metallurgical engineering, and mechanical engineer-
-P-A-G-E-43
  UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 37 
ing. The College of Letters embraces three courses; ancient classical, 
modern classical, and English. 
In 1879 an increasing teaching force rendered it possible for the 
University to offer a wider range of studies than before, and also oppor- 
tunity for more extended study in the several branches. A somewhat 
extended election of studies was granted in the Junior and Senior years. 
The system of prescribed studies for the first two years, with large 
opportunities for election in the last two years of the course, has since 
been maintained and improved. One year’s study at the University, 
after having received the baccalaureate degree, or three years if carried 
on elsewhere, leads to the degree of master in the four general courses. 
Corresponding study and practice for one year, not necessarily, how- 
ever, at the University, entitles the graduates in the special courses ofthe 
College of Arts to the degrees of civil engineer, mining engineer, metal- 
lurgical engineer, and mechanical engineer, in the respective depart- 
ments. 
The medical schools at Chicago having preoccupied the field, no 
attempt has been made since 1855 to establish a medical department in 
the University. If this addition of a school of medicine should be 
made, it would probably be established in Milwaukee, where alone in 
the State there are sufficient opportunities for clinical and surgical 
practice. 
On the other hand, the capital city of the State, with a large law 
library and frequent sessions of courts, both State and National, offers 
unusual facilities for the study of law. "The College of Law was opened 
in 1868, with five professors and fifteen students. The attendance in 
1887-88 was 113. The course as at first established comprised but one 
year’s work; afterward, it was enlarged to two years. The professors 
thus far have always been lawyers actively engaged in practice in the 
city of Madison. With a view to the improvement of the school in 
accordance with its growing importance as the principal training school 
for the profession in the North-West, the Board of Regents, in June, 
1888, directed the president of the University to recommend a suitable 
person as dean of the law Faculty, who should give all his time to the 
work in the College of Law. The rapid increase in the number of stu- 
dents has also justified a considerable advance in the tuition fees charged. 
The new rates, which go into effect after 1889, will furnish means for 
the extension and improvement of the work. 
Co-education.—Probably the most important change made by the re- 
construction, at least as viewed from the stand point of the time, was 
the open and avowed recognition of the claims and the right of women 
to an equal share in the benefits of higher education. They were no 
longer to find entrance to the University only under the shelter of a “nor- 
mal department,” or other annex. Section 4 of the act of 1866 declares, 
“The University in all its departments and colleges shall be open alike 
to male and female studenis.” But in looking about for a president,
-P-A-G-E-44
  38 HIGHER EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN. 
the regents were obliged to ask the State to recede slightly from this 
advanced position. Dr. Chadbourne, to whom the presidency was of: 
fered, refused it from fear that the University would lack public con- 
fidence and support on account of this dangerous innovation. To obvi- 
ate this difficulty, the charter was amended the next year as follows: 
“The University shall be open to female as well as male students, un- 
der such regulations and restrictions as the Board of Regents may deem 
proper.” 
So early as 1857 the Board of Regents called attention to the success 
of co-education in the normal schools and higher academies of the East- 
ern States ; and, while they felt that public sentiment in Wisconsin 
might not yet be ripe for the admission of women to the University, 
they announced their intention to prepare to meet the wishes of those 
parents who might desire to send their daughters there. But very little 
was done to carry out this plan for some years. In the spring of 1860 
a ten weeks’ course of lectures was given to a “normal” class of fifty- 
nine, of whom thirty were ladies. Thereafter no women appeared in 
the institution until 1863, when the regents opened the “ department of 
the theory and practice of elementary instruction” in charge of Prof. 
Charles H. Allen. A three-years’ course of study was arranged; but 
it was intended that women entering this department should enjoy sub- 
stantially the full privileges of the University. This, then, was the first 
entrance of women into the institution in a regular course. 
No substantial change in the female college course was made until 
1868, when it was enlarged to four years. The recitations of the young 
women were separate from those of the young men. In1871 the young 
women were allowed at their option to enter the regular college classes, 
chiefly on account of lack of a sufficient number ot professors and in- 
structors to carry on separate classes. But experience showed that no 
harm resulted, and that in some respects the admission of women on 
equal terms brought about a subs tantial improvement. Hence all dis- 
criminations were soon abolished. 
The University thus entered upon the experimental test of ‘the 
widely-mooted question of co-education. In the president’s report for 
1875 we find: ‘‘ During the first year the young women have been put. 
in all respects, on precisely the same footing in the University with the 
youngmen. No difficulties have arisen fromit. There were eight young 
women among the graduates at the last commencement. Their average 
scholarship was certainly as high as that of the young men, and they 
are apparently in good health.” The Board of Visitors for 1877, how- 
ever, thought that the health of the young women deteriorated in the 
University. As far as intellectual attainments were concerned, the dif- 
ference, if any, was, they thought, in favor of the young women. But 
they were “deeply impressed with the appearance of ill health” pre- 
sented. The hygienic condition of the University they regarded as 
excellent, and the only cause of iil health, in their opinion, was the
-P-A-G-E-45
  UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 39 
undue mental strain to which the young women were subjected. The 
visitors therefore recommended that more attention be paid to phys- 
ical training, even if the course of study were not modified. 
The president of the Board of Regents, replying to these criticisms, 
in his annual report deprecated the idea of limiting female students to 
a minor degree of culture by lowering the standard of education for 
them. On this point nocompromise could be made with adverse opinion. 
But as regards the question of health the visitors seem to have drawn 
upon their imaginations. President Bascom took issue with them thus: 
“One thing we profoundly regretted in the report of the Board of Vis- 
itors, and that was the opinion expressed by them as to the health of 
the young women. * * * Contrary to the opinion of the visitors, the 
young women do their work with less rather than with greater labor than 
the young men, and certainly do not fall below them if any respect as 
scholars. We also believe this labor to be done by them with perfect 
safety to health, nay, with advantage to health, if ordinary prudence is 
exercised. The young women, whose health was primarily the ground of 
criticism, have improved in strength, rather than deteriorated, since they 
have been with us, though they have burdened themselves with extra 
work, which we do not counsel.” A record of excuses kept by the presi- 
dent revealed the fact that the number of absences on account of ill 
health was relatively greater among the young men than among the 
young women. It was found also that a correspondingly large number 
of young men were compelled from the same cause to leave the Univer- 
sity altogether. Further than this it was shown that the absences of 
the young women were almost exclusively in the lower classes, while 
those of the young men were evenly distributed through the entire 
course. 
A slight concession was made, however, to the conservative feeling 
represented by the Board of Visitors. At the semi-annual meeting of 
the regents in January, 1877, resolutions were introduced in favor of 
restoring the female college. Thesubject was referred to a committee 
which, at the annual meeting of the regents in June, reported adversely 
to the resolutions, notwithstanding the representations of the Board of 
Visitors. The whole matter was then turned over to the Faculty of the 
University, with the request that they “report to this Board at its next 
meeting whether the course of study can not be so arranged as to re. 
lieve ladies from some of the severe studies, and allow them to take 
some others in lieu thereof, without inereasing the number, cost, and 
labor of the teachers; and if so, in what way.” The subject was re- 
ferred to a committee of five, who submitted a report in November, 
1877. 
The committee were of the opinion that a complete separation of stu- 
dents according to sex would be impracticable, and that.a partial separa- 
tion in the same manner would be injudicious. Distrust and irritation 
on the part of patrons and students would result. The committee main-
-P-A-G-E-46

tained that the physical strength of young women was fully equal to the 
task of maintaining a creditable standing in any of the courses of study, 
and they exposed the absurdity of the opposite view when they said, 
“Tt ean not be presumed that a college course taxes to the utmost the’ 
physical power of young men, so that any presumed deficiency on the 
part of young women would debar them from attempting it.” It was 
shown also that separate instruction would be-impracticable. Young 
women were found in about equal numbers in the scientific and classical 
courses, and the separation proposed would make four classes instead 
of two, and would require four hours for recitation. The instructional 
force was not adequate to permit of such a duplication of instruction, 
and the committee were of opinion that a partial separation would not 
be advisable. 
But in order to meet exceptional cases of physical weakness, and also 
to supply the wants of those desiring instruction in music, painting, 
and drawing, for which the regular eourse would not allow sufficient 
time, the committee proposed the adoption of a six-years’ course, cover- 
ing the regular modern classical studies. Students completing this 
course were to receive the same degree as those received who completed 
the course in the usual time. There was to be no lowering of the re- 
quirements for the degree; the object was simply to give more time for 
the completion of the course. 
The report was accepted by the Faculty, and unanimously adopted 
by the regents at the meeting of the Board, January 15,1877. Very 
few have chosen the six-years’ course, but its establishment was un- 
doubtedly beneficial. 
The Board. of Visitors for 1878, with the exception of ere member 
who had been one of the Board that had, the year before, so severely 
criticised the health of the lady students, were ‘on the whole, not ill- 
pleased with the evidence of physical strength on the part of the ladies.” 
Bat the Board recommended systematic physical exercise. The presi- 
dent reported that “the record of ill health, kept through the year, 
shows, especially in the upper classes, less interruption in work by ill 
health among the young women than among the young men. In the 
last Senior class the young women were one-fourth of the whole num- 
ber; their absences from sickness were one-tenth. In the Junior class 
the first ratio was one fourth, the second. one-eleventh. We certainly 
see no proof that the health of the young women suffers with us from 
their work. There are clear indications to the contrary.” 
With this the discussion closed. The opponents of ¢o-education were 
signally routed on the ground that they had chosen for the encounter. 
It was, in fact, the final struggle of the conservative feeling that was 
fast passing away. The opposition to the admission of women to the 
University did not openly rest upon hostility to their claims to higher 
education; it was professedly based upon the subordinate question of 
physical capability to perform the entire work accomplished by young 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
  UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. Al 
men in the University. But no reasons were advanced on this point 
that would not have applied with equal force to separate institutions 
for women; and it was finally shown that those who made much of this 
alleged ill health were mistaken in their facts and conclusions. On its 
nerits, this issue also was decided against them. The question was 
now permanently set at rest as far as the University of Wisconsin is 
-concerned. Never since has the propriety and expediency and the com- 
plete success of co-education been questioned here. The drift of public 
opinion everywhere is clearly toward the recognition of the justice of 
opening the doors of institutions of higher education to women equally 
with men. The example set by the young State Universities of the West 
is being followed, slowly though it be, by the older colleges of the East. 
In Europe, also, and especially in England, some progress has been 
made. 
The University and the Common Schools—The University was long in 
reaching its true place in the educational system of the State, and in 
establishing an organic connection with the common schools. Its real 
function was not served and the conditions of its highest usefulness at- 
tained until its relations as a part of the public school system were 
clearly defined and systematized. 
The preparatory department was retained “for many years after the 
reorganization of 1866. Candidates for admission to the college of let- 
ters were examined in the studies of the preparatory course, or their 
equivaleats. These included Latin and Greek, which were not required 
for entrance into the College of Arts. When the modern classical course 
was established, candidates were examined in Latin in addition to those 
studies prescribed for the College of Arts; in 1874 some knowledge of 
German was made an additional requirement. 
The standard of admission was raised as fast as @uld be done with- 
out wholly severing connection with the common schools. President 
Bascom, in his report for 1875, said: ‘We shall be glad to yield the en- 
tire field, a portion of which we now occupy with our Sub-Freshman 
classes, to the high schools, as soon as the interests of the University 
will allow us todoso. * * * Just at present, for the University to 
reject altogether preparatory students, would be to endanger a portion 
of its labor.” In 1875 more stringent requirements for admission were 
exacted. The number of students taking a special or partial course was 
reduced by the more systematic and thorough examinations. The steady 
increase in the number and efficiency of the high schools enabled the 
University to raise the standard from year to year. Finally, in 1880, 
the preparatory department was abolished. But, owing to the lack of 
instruction in Greek in almost all the high schools of the State, a pre- 
paratory class in that study is still maintained. 
In 1877 the system of accredited schools was adopted. A law of 1872 
providing for free tuition to “all graduates of any graded school of the 
State who shall have passed an examination at such graded school sat-
-P-A-G-E-48
  42 HIGHER EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN. 
isfactory to the Faculty of the University,” indicates that even then the 
need of a closer and more methodical connection with the common 
schools was felt.’ In 1876 tuition was made free to all who had been 
residents of the State for one year. This was perhaps the immediate 
. occasion of the system adopted the next year. Any high school of the 
State, whose course of instruction covers the branches requisite for ad- 
mission to one or more of the colleges of the University, may make ap- 
plication to be entered on its accredited list. On such application, the 
University sends a professor to examine the course and methods of in- 
struction in the school, and on his favorable report, enters it on the ac- 
credited high school list of the University. The graduates. of high 
schools so entered are received by the University into any of its colleges 
for which they have been fitted, without further examination. This 
arrangement holds good until the administration of the high school is 
changed, or until notice is given by the University of unsatisfactory re- 
sults. (Catalogue.) 
Shortly after the professorship of the science and art of teaching was 
established, the subject of accredited schools was placed in the hands 
of the professor in that department. His supervision of the relation- 
ship between the University and the common schools greatly increases 
the advantages of the clése organic connection already established. 
The influence of the University, reaching downward to the rest of the 
public school system, is made doubly beneficial and effective. 
In June, 1888, there were fifty-six accredited high schools. Of these, 
only six were accredited for all courses. For ancient classical and gen- 
eral science courses, there was one; for modern classical and general 
science courses, seventeen; for modern classical, general science, and 
English, ten; for general science, ten; for general science and English, 
four; for the Engffsh course, eight. 
Popular Aspect of the University—The leaning in the West has been 
toward the “practical” in education, and the University has gained 
favor by meeting the demand, as far as possible, by liberal support of 
teaching in natural science and its applications in the arts. A too par- 
tial devotion to these departments is not fulfilling the high function of 
the University ; yet the way is prepared for the recognition of the claims 
of all departments of study to State support. -In order to achieve the 
success that is possible for it to reach, the University must be deeply 
rooted in the affections and pride of all the people of the State ; it must 
be looked upon as the source of that which is highest and best in the life 
of the community, and the conditions of its prosperity and of efficiency 
for its work must be an object of greatest solicitude. During the last 
twenty years the University has been steadily gaining in public favor ; 
but it does not yet command that general and enthusiastic devotion 
that a State University must command as a condition of full success, 
and which is exemplified in Michigan. 
The popular attachment to the University must be close and strong.

UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN. 43 
From this point of view one of the most noticeable and important feat- 
ures of the University of Wisconsin, and one that is thus far peculiar 
to it, is the system of farmers’ institutes carried on by the University. 
These are an illustration of that striving that is everywhere manifest 
to secure a more vital connection between the people and the higher . 
institutions of learning. Thus the professor of the science and art of 
teaching employs a portion of his time in giving lectures in connection 
with teachers’ institutes. In this way the University does much to scat- 
ter its fruits abroad. The farmers’ institutes are also notable as an 
agency for the direct propagation of the influence of the University be- 
yond its own walls. They were begun in 1885, and are held every win- 
ter. At the eighty-one institutes held in as many different localities 
during the winter of 1887-88, there were about fifty who read papers 
or delivered lectures. Some of these were noted specialists from other 
States. The total attendance was probably fifty thousand. The in- 
stitutes have been instrumental in broadening the view, in awakening 
thought, in instilling ideas. They have already accomplished great 
material as well as intellectual benefits. Farmers have learned to take 
advantage of opportunities and resources that before were ill-under- 
stood or entirely unknown. Altogether, with its practical lessons, its 
stimulating discussions, and its intellectual quickening, the institute is 
an educational agency of undoubted potency. These are the immediate 
results. But as regards the University a most valuable and permanent 
service of the institutes will be to bring the people of the State into 
close and friendly relations with their own University. Many who 
would otherwise have little or no interest in the institution are learning 
to appreciate its claims to generous recognition and support. 
But the special significance and value of the teachers’ institute lect- 
ureship and the farmers’ institutes lie in the fact that through these in- 
strumentalities the University is brought into close relations with the 
people and with the educational and material progress of the State. In 
two directions the University has thus taken the lead in the matter 
of University extension. 
Recent Progress.—Several changes and new features were introduced 
during the year 1888. Among these were special local examinations for 
admission, to accommodate candidates who live at a distance; the devel- 
opment of a civic-historical course antecedent to the study of law and 
journalism, and of a special science course antecedent to the study of 
medicine; the introduction of special courses for normal school gradu- 
ates; the development of courses in Hebrew and Sanskrit; and the intro- 
duction of Spanish and Italian. The German seminary system has been 
introduced into several departments. The departments of original inves. 
tigation and of extra-collegiate education have received more distinct 
recognition and development. Two departments of the University are 
devoted almost exclusively to original research,—the Washburn Ob- 
servatory and the Agricultural Experiment Station. An increasing
-P-A-G-E-50

amount of original investigation is done in other departments in imme- 
diate connection with instructional work. At least fifteen per cent. of 
the resources of the University will be devoted the coming year to this 
fundamental class of work. The publications of the Washburn Observ- 
atory and of the Agricultural Experiment Station are well known, and 
the latter, in particular, disseminates information of great interest 
and value. In two lines of extra-collegiate education, or “ University 
extension,” viz., the teachers’ institute lectureship and the farmers’ in- 
stitute, the University is a successful pioneer. 
The Hon. John Johnston, of Milwaukee, has endowed a fellowship on 
a financial basis of four hundred dollars per annum for two years. The 
Board of Regents have established eight fellowships, with an income of 
four hundred dollars a year each.

TE 
BELOIT COLLEGE. 
The course of migration in our country runs naturally from east to 
west on lines of latitude; there was thus a large infusion of New Eng- 
land elements in the stream of human life which first poured in to oc- 
cupy the Territory of Wisconsin aud northern Illinois. Puritan ideas 
of the home, the school, the church, and the college were transplanted 
and took root here with the first upturning of the prairie sod. They 
were especially cherished in the Congregational and Presbyterian 
churches organized. Hence, within ten years of the time when the In- 
dian council fires were extinguished by the Black Hawk War, represent- 
atives of these churches were gathered in council, praying together and 
thinking on a college. These thoughts were deepened in conference 
with others at aconvention of representatives of those two denominations 
from the north-western States, held at Cleveland, Ohio, in June, 1844. 
They became defined and matured in four successive conventions, held 
in that and the following year, for the specific purpose of considering 
what could be done for the promotion of higher education for Wisconsin 
andnorthern Illinois. These deliberations resulted in a unanimous judg- 
ment of a convention which numbered sixty-eight members, that a col- 
lege for young men, and a female seminary of the highest order for 
young women, should be established, one in Wisconsin and the other 
in Ilinois, near to the border line of the two States. The college was 
located at Beloit, Wis.; the female seminary was subsequently located 
at Rockford, Ill. In October, 1845, the fourth convention adopted a 
form of charter, and elected a Board of Trustees, to whom was commit- 
ted the charge of carrying forward the enterprise. Beloit was selected 
as the place for the college because it was central and easy of access to 
the population of the two States, and because the people of that village 
had already evinced an interest in the work of education by sustaining 
a seminary which offered facilities superior to any found elsewhere in 
the region. 
The Charter.—On application, the Territorial Legislature of Wiscon. 
sin enacted a charter for the college, approved February 2, 1846, and 
printed on pages 103-4 of the Laws of Wisconsin for 1846. The cor- 
porate title is ‘‘ The Board of Trustees of Beloit College.” By the act of 
incorporation the Board of Trustees consists of sixteen members, with 
power to increase the number to twenty-four. Any seven constitute 
a quorum for the transaction of business. The Board elects new mem- 
45
-P-A-G-E-52
  46 HIGHER EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN. 
bers for no definite term of service, but failure for more than one year 
to attend to the duties of the trust may create a vacancy. The charter 
specifies no particular requirements for membership. 
Of the sixteen original trustees, one-half were clergymen and one- 
half laymen; one-half resident in Wisconsin and one-half in Illinois. 
The charter passes the administration of the college into the hands of 
the Board of Trustees, with broad general powers, subject to no direct 
supervision or control by the State or municipal authorities. The col- 
lege is, however, always open to visitation, and, in accordance with a © 
subsequent statute, a report of the condition of the institution is made 
annually to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The Con- 
gregational and Presbyterian churches of Wisconsin and northern Illi- 
nois are regarded as the proper constituency of the college; but the 
charter precludes the prescription of any religious tenets or opinions as 
qualifications required of instructors, or conditions of admission for 
students. Its aim is accordingly to give a Christian, but not a secta- 
rian, education. The charter fixes the location of the college and all 
its departments in Beloit, and reserves to the Legislature full power to 
alter or repeal the act of incorporation. The Board of Trustees are em- 
powered to confer on those whom they may deem worthy all such 
honors and degrees as are usually conferred by like institutions. The 
original charter has served the purpose of the college thus far without 
amendment or alteration. 
The Object of the College.—The American college is an institution sui 
generis, developed by circumstances and conditions peculiar to this 
country. The founders of Beloit College had before them the type form, 
as presented in the colleges of the older States, especially in those of 
New England, and their aim was, not in servile imitation to copy a 
model, but as wisely as possible to adapt the leading ideas and features 
of those institutions to the fresh life and swift growth of the West. So 
the object of the institution they aimed to build was defined to be, to 
provide for the thorough, liberal, Christian education of young men ; edu- 
cation being understood to mean chiefly a self-development of the indi- 
vidual under training to a true self-possession and a command of his best 
faculties. The design comprehends a training in language as the great 
instrument and condition of all culture, civilization, or thought; in 
mathematics and science, as means of both guiding the processes of in- 
vestigation and thought, and furnishing the matter of learning; in the 
histories of nature and of man, as the sources of practical knowledge; 
and in those philosophic and moral principles necessary to complete the 
general preparation for a broad and useful life. Under the conviction 
that positive principles of religious faith are essential to right thought 
as well as to right life, the institution is intended to be a religious col- 
lege—not denominational, but distinctly and earnestly evangelical. Its 
endeavor is to combine in its culture learning, religion, and morality, 
so as to form habits of thought, faith, and rectitude, which will best fit

    BELOIT COLLEGE. AT 
men alike to succeed in the world, to do the world good, and to realize 
the Christian’s hope in the world to come. 
History.—The Board of Trustees of Beloit College held their first 
meeting October 23, 1845, and took preliminary measures to secure a 
charter, select a location, and devise a plan for a building. The charter 
enacted by the Legislature was accepted October 13, 1846. On the 
24th of June, 1847, the corner-stone of the first building was laid with 
appropriate ceremonies and public exercises. On the same day the 
first appointment of a professor was made, but that appointment was 
declined. The college was opened for its first class October 15, 1847, 
when five young men were examined, admitted as a Freshman class, and 
placed temporarily under the instruction of Mr. S. T. Merrill, then in 
charge of the Beloit Seminary. On the 23d of May, 1848, Mr. Jackson 
J. Bushnell was appointed professor of mathematics and natural phi- 
losophy, and Mr. Joseph Emerson professor of languages. These two 
gentlemen entered upon their duties at once, and to them was commit- 
ted the class already received and the further internal organization and 
administration of the college. On the 21st of November, 1849, Rev. 
Aaron L. Chapin was elected president of the college. He entered 
upon the duties of that office February 1, 1850, and on the 24th of July 
of the same year he was formally inaugurated with public exercises 
held in a grove near the north-west corner of the college grounds. The 
first class was graduated July 9, 1851. Since then a regular succession 
of classes has been kept up. 
Site and Buildings.—The site of the college is near the centre of the 
city of Beloit, on the south line of the State of Wisconsin, midway be- 
tween Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River. The city is easily ac- 
cessible from all directions. The population of the city is about five 
thousand. : 
The college grounds inclose an area of tweuty-four acres. The prem- 
ises are bounded by streets on every side, and the surface is diversified 
by groves and ravines, presenting a broad and elevated plateau front- 
ing to the east, and on the west sloping down nearly to the level of 
Rock River, from which it is separated by a street and.a narrow tier 
of lots on the west side. 
There are six college buildings : 
1. Middle College, begun in 1847, was finished so far as to be occu- 
pied the following year. The attic is occupied by students’ reoms. The 
remainder—three stories—is devoted to lectures, recitations, and lab- 
oratory work. Its cost was about ten thousand dollars, mostly donated 
by citizens of Beloit with the original site. 
2. North College, a dormitory of brick, erected in 1854. The’ cost 
was about eight thousand dollars, a small portion of which was contrib- 
uted for the specific purpose. 
3. The Chapel, erected in 1858. The cost was about six thousand 
* dollars, one-half of which was contributed by the citizens of Beloit.

4, South College, costing five thousand dollars, was erected in 1868, 
to furnish additional dormitory accommodations. It has since been re- 
modelled to serve temporarily as a chemical laboratory. 
5. Memorial Hall was erected in 1869, in honor of more than four 
hundred sons of the college who took part (forty-six of whom died) in 
the War for the Union. Its cost was twenty-six thousand dollars, pro- 
vided for mostly by special donations for the object, gathered in the 
region. The vestibule is devoted to tablets and memorials of the War. 
The main building is occupied by the library and the cabinet. The 
library contains upward of thirteen thousand volumes. The permanent 
library fund is about twenty-five thousand dollars. The libraries of the 
literary societies number about one thousand volumes. 
6. The Gymnasium was erected in 1874, at an expense, including ap- 
paratus, of three thousand nine hundred dollars, contributed chiefly by 
alumni and members of the college and citizens of Beloit. 
7, The Astronomical Observatory was presented to the college by the 
liberality of Mrs. J. S. Merrick, as a memorial to her brother, Mr. John 
F. Smith, whose name it bears. The observatory is fully equipped with 
all the usual accessories, including a standard mean time clock, with 
which a time service is maintained in the city of Beloit. Meteorolog- 
ical observations are also published daily. 
8. In 1883 the college purchased the residence and grounds of the 
late Judge Keep, situated on the brow of the hill south of the college 
' grounds. The building is at present used for recitation-rooms and dormi- 
tory purposes, but itis expected that it will give place to some structure 
designed directly for college uses. 
Plans have been drawn for a building suitable to the growing wants 
of the preparatory school, which is to be erected at once. It is hoped that 
a science hall and a more commodious chapel may soon be built. 
Later History.—On the 8th of July, 1857, at the close of the first dec- 
ade of the life of the college, a convention of its friends was held, when 
-Prof. J. Emerson delivered a historical address, and resolutions were 
adopted recognizing the Divine favor to the enterprise, and commend- 
ing the college anew to the confidence of the friends of thorough educa- 
tion, with an earnest appeal for contributions to increase its resources. 
The annual commencement, July 14, 1869, was made an occasion of 
special interest by the formal dedication of the Memorial Hall, erected 
in honor of those connected with the college who had served in the War 
for the preservation of the Union. Hon. Matthew H. Carpenter, United 
States. Senator from Wisconsin, delivered an oration, and several of the 
alumni and distinguished soldiers of the War gave brief addresses. In 
connection with the commencement of July 9, 1872, the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the opening of the college was commemorated by appro- 
priate exercises, in which representatives from the trustees, the Faculty, 
and the alumni bore a part. 
President Chapin, after a service of thirty-six years, resigned in 1886, -

and was succeeded in the presidency by Rey. E. D. Eaton, a former 
graduate of the college. The inauguration of the new president, No- 
vember 4, 1886, was the occasion of a large gathering of the alumni and 
friends of the college generally. 
The number of students in attendance during the collegiate year 
1887-88 was 265. Of these, 59 were in the regular college course, and 
the remainder in the Academy, or preparatory school. 
The whole number of graduates up to and including 1887is 371. The 
classes of 1886 and 1887 each numbered sixteen. The college first 
began its work with the distinct object of training Congregational and 
Presbyterian ministers, and it held to that object with such tenacity 
that several whole classes bedame ministers. A map of the United 
States, says one writer, was shown, with the places where graduates of 
Beloit College had been pastors marked with red. Wisconsin and north- 
ern Illinois were studded close with these red dots, which covered over all 
the Western States quite thick, and were sprinkled all over the rest of 
the United States from New England to the Pacific. Out of 311 grad- 
uates 107 are clergymen or theological students, 12 of. whom are mis- 
sionaries. 
A very large number have adopted teaching as a profession. Of edi- 
tors Beloit has furnished some distinguished examples. Of lawyers and 
law students there have been 55 among the graduates of the college, and 
of physicians and medical students 21. These professions include the. 
majority of the graduates. Of the 311 alumni 28 are dead. Of the rest 
nearly all are filling positions of usefulness and influence. 
The work of the college is now distributed to two departments : 
I. The College proper, with two parallel courses:. 
(a) A classical course, giving prominence to ancient languagesand 
literature. 
(b) A philosophical course, combining with Latin a wider range of 
science and of modern languages. 
Il. The Academy. This comprises three courses of study : a classical, 
a scientific, and an English or business course. The classical course 
gives ample preparation for college; the scientific course prepares for 
the philosophical course in the college, and for the best schools of tech- 
nology in the country. The English course meets the wants of those 
not intending to enter college, but wishing those studies helpful to an 
entrance upon a business life, or teaching.

III. 
LAWRENCE UNIVERSITY. 
(Chiefly from the Alumni Record, 1881.) 
Lawrence University, of Appleton, was fortunate in having as its 
founder and benefactor Amos Lawrence, whose name it bears. His 
wide benevolence found one of its most fitting objects in aiding the 
Methodist denomination in the new State, which still had its wealth to 
accumulate, in entering early into the work of higher education. Through 
aid given by Mr. Lawrence, the church was enabled to establish a uni- 
versity in this field much sooner than would otherwise have been pos- 
sible. 
April 17, 1846, a proposition was made by H. Eugene Eastman, agent 
of Mr. Lawrence, to Rev. W. H. Sampson in the following terms: “ If 
there is any certainty of a vigorous co-operation by any other body, lay 
or clerical, I should be willing to put such sum of money in the hands 
of trustees as, placed at interest, will in ten years amount to ten thou- 
sand dollars, and also give (provided there should be no failure in case 
of my death) the sum of ten thousand dollars, one thousand dollars a 
year for the term of ten years, toward sustaining a competent salary 
for such instructors as may be required; or, if necessary, I will pay ten 
thousand dollars in cash, now, to secure the desired object. But all this 
is founded on the expectation of a similar sum from other quarters.” 
This proposition was made with the understanding that the institution 
should be located at or near De Pere, Brown County. But the city of 
Appleton met the requirements of the gift, and the location was changed 
to that’place. In the earlier history of the University Mr. Lawrence 
gave in all about thirty thousand dollars to the institution. For several 
years prior to 1876 he gave five, hundred dollars annually toward cur- 
rent expenses. 
On December 28, 1846, at Milwaukee, the proposition was laid before 
a meeting of clergy and laymen of the Methodist Episcopal Church, 
who then accepted the offer of Mr. Lawrence, and proceeded to meet the 
conditions upon which it was made. <A charter incorporating “The 
Lawrence Institute of Wisconsin” was granted by the Legislature, and 
approved by the Governor January 17,1847. On the 23d day of Sep- 
tember, 1847, the charter trustees organized the Board of Trustees, with 
Hon. Mason C. Darling, of Fond du Lac, as president; N. P. Talmadge, 
of Fond du Lac, and Henry A. Baird, of Green Bay, as vice-presidents ; 
* 61

the Rey. W. H. Sampson, as secretary ; and Morgan L. Martin, of Green 
Bay, as treasurer. 
The Board thus organized immediately took measures necessary to 
make the enterprise a reality. The Hon. George W. Lowe, of Kau- 
kauna, and John F, Meade, of Green Bay, generously donated sixty- 
two acres of land situated in what was then known, as the “ Grand 
Chute,” but which is now the very centre of the City of Appleton, on 
‘condition that the Lawrence Institute should be located thereon. The 
Board of Trustees accepted the gift,and on the 9th of August, 1848, 
located the Lawrence Iustitute on said lands. On the 21st of March, 
1849, the Legislature changed the institute to “The Lawrence Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin,” which it has since retained. During the same year 
a school building seventy by thirty feet and three stories high was 
erected. 
November 12, 1849, the school was opened with the following corps 
of teachers: Rey. William H. Sampson, A. M., as principal, Romulus 
O. Kellogg as professor of languages, James M. Phinney as professor 
of mathematics, Emeline M. Crooker as preceptress, and Miss L. Amelia 
Dayton as assistant teacher. Thus constituted, the school continued as 
an academic department until 1853, when the first college classes were 
organized. Here again the necessities of a newly-settled country re- 
quired the organization of a preparatory department before the com- 
mencement of the proper college work. 
The number of students the first year was about sixty. The accom- 
modations were meagre, the surroundings in many respects disagreea- 
ble, and the means very scauty. But the school had an excellent rep- 
utation from the start, and increased in popularity. The sacrifices of 
those who had the immediate management were very great, and at times 
the prospects quite discouraging. 
September 1, 1852, the tev. Dr. Edward Cooke, of Boston, Mass., 
was elected president of the University, and on the 29th of June, 1853, 
he was installed, took charge of the college, and organized the college 
classes. The frame building having been destroyed by fire, the present 
college building was commenced in 1853, and completed the following 
year. This buildingis one hundred and twenty feet long by sixty wide. 
It is built of stone, and is three stories and a half above the basement. 
It contains a commodious chapel, capable of seating eight hundred or 
a thousand people, six recitation rooms, a large library room, two fine 
society halls, large cabinet and reading-rooms, apparatus rooms, and 
dormitories for about fifty students. 
November 7, 1854, a communication from Nathan Appleton informed 
the executive com mittee of a donation from the estate of Samuel Apple- 
ton, of Boston, Mass., for the purposes of a college library. The trust 
was promptly accepted and made the foundation of the present excel- 
lent library, one of the best working libraries in the West. It now con- 
tains over eleven thousand volumes. From the income of the Appleton
-P-A-G-E-63
LAWRENCE UNIVERSITY. 5D 
fund of ten thousand dollars, and the liberality of friends, large addi- 
tions are annually made. A well furnished reading-room is supported 
by the students and faculty, and is well supplied with daily and weekly 
papers and the best periodicals. 
In 1860 the Hon. Lee Claflin, of Boston, gave property to the value 
of ten thousand dollars to found the Claflin Professorship of Hthies and 
Civil Polity. : 
During the Civil War many of the students entered the military serv- 
ice of their country, a goodly number under the leadership of one of 
their professors, Henry Pomeroy. Some sacrificed their lives for their 
country; others, after valiant service, returned to honor and be hon- 
ored by their alma mater. Of the alumni, the gallant Nathan Paine 
died in battle, and the brave Alfred F, Lamb, of the same class, in 
Libby prison. 
In 1859 Dr. Cooke resigned the presidency, and Prof. R. Z. Mason 
was elected to fill the chair. During his term the college suffered, as 
all institutions did, from the demands incident to the state of the coun- 
try during the Civil War. Yet in‘spite of the effects of that war the 
college was steadily progressing in reputation, scholarship, and.attend- 
ance of students. 
In 1865 Dr. Mason retired from, and the Rev. George M. Steele was 
elected to, the presidency of the University. Fourteen years of untir- 
ing labor he devoted to the interests of Lawrence University, estab- 
lishing there thorough Christian spirit and scholarship. In 1879 Dr. 
Steele resigned, and Dr. E. D. Huntley was elected to the presidency. 
The latter, in turn, was succeeded by Dr. Bradford P. Raymond, in 1883. 
Like nearly all the colleges in the country, Lawrence University had 
its struggle with debt. Not until the commengement of 1880 could the 
president announce the college free from debt. But the revenues were 
not sufficient to meet the annual expenses, and it was necessary to make 
up the deficiency by donations and gifts, as far as possible, until such 
time as the productive property should be sufficient to provide the 
necessary revenues. Dr. Huntley’s labor to secure the necessary funds 
was strenuous, and met with considerable success. 
During 1881 a commodious dwelling for the president was erected on 
the college grounds. A new building is in contemplation for the accom- 
modation of the lady students. 
Lawrence University, having admitted women to equal privileges with 
men in all respects from its organization, was one of the first of Ameri- 
can colleges to accord to women the right and privilege to share with 
men the labors and honors of a college course. 
The courses of study are the ancient classical, the modern classical, 
the scientific, and the courses preparatory to the same. These courses 
cover for the most part the same fields in natural science, history, 
philosophy, and general literature. The ancient classical gives promi- 
nence to the Latin and Greek; the scientific excludes Greek, drops Latin

at the end of the Freshman year, and adds several terms of mathemati- 
cal and scientific studies, while the modern classical, introduced to meet 
the growing demand for the modern languages, gives to the French 
and German each six terms-—a part of the last term being devoted to 
the history of the literature. Itis also proposed for such as can not 
take a fall collegiate course, to provide facilities for both a thorough 
English and a complete commercial course. The academic course—em- 
bracing modern languages, mathematics, natural science, history, phi- 
losophy, and general literature—and the commercial course are de- 
signed to supply these demands. There is also a musical and literary 
course, and instruction is given in painting and drawing. 
Besides the sketch in the Alumni Record, 1881, the chief sources of 
information are the catalogues, the files of the local papers, the reports 
of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction and of the Commis- 
sioner of Education, and the Historical Sketch of Lawrence University 
written for the Centennial Exposition, 1876.

IV. 
RIPON COLLEGE. 
Beginnings.—On a pleasant hill of what is now the city of Ripon, in 
the autumn of 1850, two men might have been seen marking out the 
location of a college building. This was done amid the jeers of some, 
the indifference of others, and with but slight anticipation, on the part 
of any interested, of the real significance of this small beginning. Only 
one of those concerned in the undertaking made any pretension to a 
liberal education, and none of them were men of wealth. 
There were but fourteen rude buildings in the village of Ripon, as 
only one year had elapsed since the first clearing had been made. Yet 
the novelty of founding a college among these rough surroundings and 
at this early stage of the city’s development won the sympathy and 
co-operation of most of the members of the young settlement. Wiscon- 
sin, as a State, was less than three years old, and its population about 
three hundred thousand. There were then but two colleges in the State, 
and they had in attendance only seventy-five students. The pioneers 
in this new college enterprise argued wisely that another institution 
more favorably located for the middle and northern parts of the State 
would soon be needed, and like many another company they “ builded 
better than they knew.” Contributions of materials, of money, and of 
land were made, and although lumber had to be drawn twenty miles 
over rough roads, the work of building was pushed rapidly forward. 
When the walls were completed and the structure roofed in, the funds 
were exhausted and the enterprise halted for a time. 
The next step was the obtaining of an act of incorporation, and andar 
the name of Brockway College the new institution became known to the 
people of the State. The purpose of the corporation was declared to 
be “to found, establish, and maintain at Ripon, in the county of Fond du 
Lac, an institution of learning of the highest order, embracing also a 
department for preparatory instruction.” 
It was now decided that it would be best to enlist some religious de- 
nomination in the enterprise. Accordingly a proposition was made to 
the Winnebago District Convention of Presbyterian Ministers and 
Churches to adopt the institution. The trustees offered to transfer all 
the property for four hundred dollars, but the churches were just be- 
ginning their work and felt too poor to accept the proposal. The min- 
ister at Menasha, however, Rev. J. W. Walcott, bought the property 
  
‘Contributed in part by Prof. Newton S. Fuller. on a
-P-A-G-E-68
    
56 HIGHER EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN. 
for the convention, agreeing to transfer it to that body whenever it was 
able to take it. One of the conditions of the trustees was that the 
building should be so far cgmpleted that a school should be opened in 
1853. Mr. Walcott took possession of the property in November, 1852, 
and enlarged the grounds by the purchase of land adjoining. Two 
rooms on the east side of the building were soon finished, and a school 
for young ladies was opened in June, 1853, The first teacher was Miss 
Martha J. Adams, and the aumber of pupils for the first term sixteen. 
In September a young men’s department was added, Mr. Walcott as- 
suming the control of both departments as principal, and remaining in 
charge three years. 
In February, 1855, a new charter was obtained, and two years later 
Mr. Walcott conveyed to a Board of Trustees, designated by the con- 
vention, the grounds and building. During that year liberal subscrip- 
tions were obtained, and a second building, now known as Middle 
College, was erected. The financial disaster of the country in this year, 
together with a debt incurred in building, a second time crippled the 
resources of the school. Yet it struggled on till June, 1861. At that 
time many of the young men enlisted in the ‘ Ripon Rifles,” the first 
company that went from Ripon to aid in the War for the Union, and 
teachers and schdlars devoted themselves to the worl: of fitting out the 
new volunteers. During the summer vacation the trustees leased the 
grounds to the Government for a camp. The white tents of the First 
Wisconsin Cavalry dotted the campus till the last of November, while 
troops occupied the Hast Building and used some of the rooms of Mid- 
dle College for hospital purposes. 
For nearly a year after this Mrs. C. T. Tracy and Miss Martha Wheeler, 
who had been connected with the school for two years previous, gave 
private instruction to a class of young ladies. To the fidelity of these 
two women in this crisis, the continuous existence of the school is due. 
In July, 1862, a notable meeting was held by the Winnebago District 
Convention, to decide whether the institution should live or die. Its 
friends rallied to its support and raised a subscription which partially 
paid the debt. The trustees accordingly reopened the school, in Sep- 
tember, with Rev. E. H. Merrell at its head. This gentleman was then 
recently graduated from Oberlin College, and has now been longer con- 
nected with the institution than any other professor. The school grew 
so rapidly, and its prospects seemed so favorable, that in April, 1863, 
the trustees began the organization of a permanent Faculty. . Rey. Will- 
iam E. Merriman, of Green Bay, a graduate of Williams College, was 
elected president, and Rev. E. H. Merrell professor of languages. 
At the opening of the term in September, 1863, the first college class 
was formed. During that year the debts. were all paid, the library was 
begun, and amendments to the charter were obtained, among other 
things changing the name of the institution to Ripon College. 
Tn 1866, three years after the permanent organization of the college,

the school had outgrown its accommodations, and by the following year 
a third building, now West College, was erected and oceupied. A lab- 
oratory has since been erected. The growing requirement for room has 
also necessitated the building of a ‘“ Ladies’ Cottage,” which will be 
much more pretentious in appearance and proportions than the name 
would indicate. The new building will be commodious, beautiful, and 
complete in all its appointments. The building was completed in the 
spring of 1888. 
Charter Powers and Control of the College.—The charter of the college 
incorporates the Board of Trustees of Ripon College, fifteen in number, 
including the president of the college, who is ex officio a trustee. The 
others hold office for three years, one-third retiring each year. The 
Board fills its own vacancies. It has power to establish any depart- 
ment of learning, to confer the usual degrees, to control the finances, 
and in general to manage the affairs of the college. 
Design and Character—Young men and young women enjoy equal aad- 
vantages at Ripon. It is the aim of the institution to keep its standard 
fully up to that of the best western colleges, and its methods in harmony 
with the most enlightened views of education. It aims also to furnish 
a thorough preparation for the pursuits of college courses, and to pro- 
vide a sound practical education for such as may desire to fit themselves 
for common school teaching or for business. It is likewise the earnest 
purpose of the officers of the institution to conduct it on distinctively 
Christian principles, and to have it pervaded with a strong and healthy 
moral and religious influence. 
The institution comprises the following departments: The college, 
the preparatory school, the English academy, and the school of music. 
In the college two liberal courses of study—the classical and scientific— 
have been arranged, each extending through four years. The courses 
of preparation extend through three years. Besides these regular 
courses of study a select course, extending through five years, has 
been arranged for such as are unable to take either of the degree 
courses. The course of study in the English academy extends through 
three years.

V. 
RACINE COLLEGE! 
Racine College was founded in 1852, under the auspices of the Epis- 
copal Church in the diocese of Wisconsin. It was incorporated by act 
of the Legislature March 3d of that year. The first president was the 
Rey. Roswell Park, D.D., a graduate of West Point and Union Col- 
lege, and for some time a professor in the University of Pennsylvania. 
For its real estate and its first building, the old Park Hall (destroyed 
by fire in 1864), the college was mainly indebted to citizens of Racine. 
An early circular states that “the location is a beautiful one, on the 
southern margin of Racine, traversed by the main. street of the city, in 
an oak grove, fronting on Lake Michigan, and commanding an exten- 
sive view of the lake in its ever-varying phases.” The school opened 
on the 15th of November with nine students, closing with thirty-three 
the next summer. 
There were from the outset arrangements for two departments, pre- 
paratory and collegiate. There were also two courses; the “ full course,” 
intended to comprehend a full classical education, and the ‘shorter 
course,” constituting a preparation for business. 
The degree assigned to the latter was that of bachelor of science. 
This was the degree generally taken during the earlier years of the col- 
lege. The classical course was apparently thorough, but much less ad- 
_ vanced than at the present day, though perhaps equal to that of the 
majority of American colleges thirty years ago. The degree of bache- 
lor of arts, however, was only granted to six candidates between the 
years 1852 and 1859. 
The moral supervision was somewhat more strict than is the case 
at the majority of colleges. The religious worship from the first was, 
of course, in accordance with the formularies of the Episcopal Church, 
and attendance at the chapel services, morning and evening, was en- 
forced. 
The new school was soon in a flourishing condition, and increased 
from year to year until it had attained to the number of eighty students 
in 1856-57. In the summer of that year, July 4th, the corner-stone of 
Kemper Hall was laid, subscriptions having been obtained in Racine to 
the amount of twelve thousand dollars. But in 1857-58, the period of 
the great financial crisis, the decline in numbers was so rapid as to

threaten the very existence of 'the youthful institution. It also became 
impossible to collect subscriptions previously made. The deliberations 
which ensued bring us to a new epoch in the history of the college. 
The preparatory department of Nashotah Seminary had not long be- 
fore received a new organization, and had been placed in charge of the 
Rey. James DeKoven. This school was known as St. John’s Hall. It 
was now determined to call DeKoven to Racine, and to transfer the 
students of St. John’s to Racine College, thus combining the two insti- 
tutions and making Racine the preparatory school for Nashotah. This 
plan was carried into effect in the autumn of 1859. Dr. Park, through 
whose zeal and energy such substantial foundations had been laid, re- 
tained his connection with the college as chancellor, but retired from 
the active management of affairs. DeKoven was appointed rector, and 
assumed the entire responsibility. 
A complete reorganization was effected, substantially after the present 
model. The genius of DeKoven soon gave the school a wide reputa- 
tion, and its numbers rapidly increased; nevertheless, the presence of 
so large a proportion of candidates for orders, together with the rela- 
tion now assumed toward Nashotah, led to a wide-spread impression 
that the institution was exclusively a theological seminary or school, an 
impression which has not yet entirely faded from the public mind. But 
while there was a preponderance, for a time, of students destined for the 
ministry, and while the preparation of such students was declared to 
be an especial object of the college, it was never the exclusive object, 
and each year brought a Jarger number destined for all walks of life 
and seeking simply a liberal education, until in 1865 the statement of 
theological preparation as a special object finally disappears from the 
catalogue. 
The new statutes of 1862-63 indicate the ideal which was now had in 
view. The first was as follows: “ Racine College shall be a Christian 
home for the training of the youth committed to its care in Christian 
virtue and sound learning.” In accordance with this, much stress is 
- laid in the circulars and catalogues upon the family organization, and 
this is still the underlying idea which distinguishes Racine. ‘The fol- 
lowing are some of the general principles of government and discipline: 
“To trust as far as possible to the honor of the boys, and at the same 
time to observe sufficient watchfulness to prevent secret disobedience ;” 
“To insist upon obedience as a duty to God, and to encourage by every 
means possible the voluntary confession of offences ;” “ To govern the 
boys by means of a certain number selected for their fitness and gen- 
eral good conduct, who shall be the honored students of the college.” 
In the primary organization much was borrowed from the tried and 
time-honored systems of the great English public schools, but with 
careful adaptations from the first to the conditions and requirements 
of American life and character. Further modifications were intro- 
duced as time and experience dictated, but the fundamental princi-
-P-A-G-E-76

ples have remained unchanged. During the period from 1859 to 
1875-76, the college and grammar school were nearly homogeneous, 
much the same rules being in force and the same surveillance exer- 
cised in the one as in the other. In the development of the organi- 
zation, and in establishing the discipline of the school, DeKoven 
was ably seconded by Mr. E. B. Spalding, as head-master and after- 
ward sub-warden. But while the formation of the moral and spirit- 
ual life, and the establishment of a high tone and character in the 
school, absorbed much of the attention of Dr. DeKoven during these 
early years, there was also a steady advance in intellectual strength 
and efficiency. 
From 1858 Prof. Homer Wheeler ably filled the chair of mathematics. 
Steps which indicate the progress of the college as an institution of 
learning were the addition to the Faculty of the late Dr. Passmore in 
1862, for twenty years previously professor in St, James’s College, Mary- 
land; of Dr. Dean in 1865, as professor of Latin and Greek; of Dr. 
Hinsdale, since president of Hobart College, in 1867; and of Drs. El- 
mendorf and Falk a little Jater. Although there remained still much 
room for improvement in the course, the Faculty of 1868 was a body of 
men which would adorn any institution. 
Under the combined influences of a carefully developed method of 
moral and spiritual training on the one hand, and of an effectual intel- 
lectual culture on the other, the growth of the college was vigorous and 
rapid. The time seemed to have arrived for anew adjustment. Hith- 
erto the college had been closely connected with the diocese of Wiscon- 
sin, but it was now determined to make it a more general institution, 
and to place it under the patronage of the bishops and clerical and lay 
trustees from several adjoining States of the West and North-West. It 
was believed that it would-be possible by a legitimate and natural 
development to establish here a true University, which should pro- 
mote the cause of sound learning in the North-West, and at the same 
time vindicate for religious and moral culture its true place in edu- 
cation, as opposed to the secularism and materialism which have 
become so widely spread. In 1875 the requisite changes in the 
statutes and internal organization were made, looking toward the 
establishment of a “ University for the North-west.” The college was 
organized in more distinct separation from the lower school, and in 
other respects its discipline was modified with reference to a higher de- 
velopment of intellectual life. Additions to the Faculty in close con- 
nection with these changes were the Rey. J. H. Converse, A. M. (Har- 
vard), in 1872, as Dr. Dean’s successor, and somewhat later the Rev. F. 
§. Luther, A."M., in the chair of mathematics, and Robert ©. Hindley, 
A. M., ‘as professor of chemistry, both of Trinity College. 
Racine is well known as a place where religious principles are fear- 
lessly taught and moral guidance carefully insisted upon; but few, ex-

sistent has been the endeavor to raise the intellectual tone, and to make 
both college and grammar school second in thoroughness to none in the 
country. 
Up to the present date the college has lacked those endowments which 
are essential to give permanency to the work. With the exception of 
the several prize funds, as stated in the catalogue, the only endowment 
Racine possesses, besides its ninety acres of land and its substantial 
buildings, is the Taylor foundation of thirty thousand dollars for the 
benefit of orphan sons of the clergy and candidates for holy orders. 
This was derived from the legacy of Mrs. Isaac Taylor in 1866. 
In this state of things the loss in 1879 of that commanding genius 
which had for so many years guided the destinies and shaped the life 
of the college, was a severe blow. But the work of DeKoven has proved 
. Strong enough to endure, and, without any departure from the great 
* principles of education so long maintained, it is believed that the in- 
ternal organization and discipline were never better, the intellectual 
work never more effective, than at present. There is every ground of 
hope that with a body of officers and instructors sincerely commit- 
ted to the principles which have been here asserted, a Board of Trus- 
‘tees exercising a wise guidance of her substantial interests, and an army 
of devoted sons who have gone forth from her fostering care during 
these thirty years, and who never fail to respond to appeals in her be- 
half, Racine College may fulfil the designs of her founders and vindi- 
cate the great principles of education for which she has invariably con- 
tended. :

MILTON COLLEGE. 
In the summer and fall of 1844 an humble structure for the use of an 
academic school was erected in the village of Milton. The institution 
was established with no other purpose than to accommodate the young 
people of the immediate vicinity. There was no expectation that it 
would ever become a first-class academy or college. 
The nature of the locality and the character of the inhabitants have 
materially aided the enterprise. The intermixture of small prairies and 
woodlands with rich alluvial soils attracted, in an early day, the notice 
of the pioneers of the Hast, and led to the closely compact settlement of 
the country. The position, on a broad, rolling upland, one of the high- 
est elevations between Lake Michigan and the Mississippi River, and 
one hundred and thirty feet above the beautiful Rock River, which flows 
around in nearly a half-circle at the distance of six to eight miles, is one 
of exceeding healthfulness. The scenery is surpassingly delightful. 
The present inhabitants migrated principally from New England and 
New York. <A few families came from Scotland and Pennsylvania, All 
were acquainted with the workings of public schools, and some with the 
advantages ofan academy. The ideas of education first formed by an 
experience under the school system of Massachusetts, and remoulded 
afterwards in the midst of the thrift and greatness of the Empire State, 
guided those who built up and patronized the school. One of the first 
teachers in the institution says: ‘Nowhere else have I ever witnessed 
the exhibition of more zeal and public spirit in the behalf of education.” 
It was ex pected that a few of the young people of this section might 
here fit themselves to enter some college, either in the West or in the 
East; but the instruction to be given in the school was designed almost 
exclusively for two purposes, viz, to aid young men in qualifying them- 
selves for the ordinary business pursuits, and both young men and 
young women to prepare themselves for teaching in the public schools, 
From the beginning every advantage which was to be offered to young 
men in the academy was also to be offered to young ladies. They both 
were to recite in the same classes. A school of this kind, it was thought, 
would tend to induce families coming into this new gountry to settle in 
the vicinity of the place. Many persons were moving at the time into 
this region, and a well-regulated and enterprising academy would com- 
pensate them in part for the educational facilities which they left be- 
hind them in the Hast.

MILTON COLLEGE. 63 
The academy was opened in December, 1844, as a select school. For 
the first two or three years the average annual attendance was about 
seventy. 
In the winter of 1847-48 the citizens of the place combined together 
to secure a charter for the school, and to place it under the control of a 
Board of Trustees. Up to this time it had been solely under the man- 
agement of Hon. Joseph Goodrich, who had sustained all the losses for 
the teacher’s salary and the incidental expenses. The advantages 
which the school had conferred upon the community were marked and 
satisfactory. It was settled that a school with academic privileges could 
be maintained here. The people had been partially educated to foster 
such an institution, and to look forward to its assuming a higher and 
more permanent position. Accordingly, an act of incorporation was 
obtained from the Wisconsin Territory February 28, 1848, granting to 
seven trustees the exclusive control of the school, which was entitled 
the “ Du Lac Academy,” a name that was never popular, nor used be- 
yond the charter and the correspondence of the officers of the school. 
In 1849, under the guidance of energetic and enthusiastic instructors, 
a decided impulse was given to the school. Young people from localities 
twenty or thirty miles distant joined the classes, and the attendance 
was raised to over a hundred a year. 
For the want of suitable accommodations the school was suspended 
two-thirds of the year in 1853. It became evident that better facilities 
by way of buildings, apparatus, and cabinets must be furnished or the 
enterprise must be abandoned. A larger Faculty must also be se- 
cured, and regular courses of study be adopted. A greater number of 
the people in the section must be enlisted in the support of the acad- 
emy and money contributed to place it in a better working condition. 
With this result the history of the school as the Du Lac Academy 
ended. 
The awakening of a new interest in the school led to the formation 
of a larger association of the citizens; and a new charter was obtained 
from the Legislature March 31, 1854, naming the institution the “ Mil- 
ton Academy.” 
From the opening of the fall term, 1851, Prof. A. C. Spicer had the 
supervision of the academy most of the time for seven years. After 
his resignation in 1858, the trustees, failing in several efforts to obtain 
a successor, prevailed upon Rev. W.C. Whitford, then the pastor of the 
Seventh-Day Baptist Church of Milton, to assume the charge during 
the following fall term. Afterward he consented to remain in the 
same position the balance of the year. Finally he resigned the pastoral 
charge of the church, and became permanently connected with the 
school as the principal. 
At the time scarcely any other place could have been more uninviting. 
Heavy debts for the erection of the buildings had been contracted; the 
community was sharply divided on questions which were connected

wit tha management of the academy; a rival institution had been 
opened in the place; and several academies within twenty-five miles of 
Milton had sprung into existence. 
The institution closed its operations under the charter as an academy 
July 2, 1867, in consequence of its incorporation as a college. A re- 
view of its history for the last thirteen years, under the title of the © 
Milton Academy, wil! furnish the reasons why its friends sought and 
obtained the college charter. Beginning with the attendance of about 
one hundred students per year, the school registered, in 1866, four hun- 
dred and twenty-one pupils. Seventy-three students—thirty-nine gen- 
tlemen and thirty-four ladies—had graduated in all the courses of the 
academy. The opposition academy organized in the place had perished 
soon after its opening. All classes of people were united in maintain- 
ing the school at a high standard. While the institution had been sus- 
tained mainly by the means and labors of the Seventh-Day Baptists, 
yet it was very largely patronized by the young people from the other 
religious denominations in this section. Over five thousand dollars of 
the indebtedness had been cancelled. In all these thirteen years not 
the debt of a single dollar for teachers’ salaries had been contracted, — 
nor an obligation against the institution, in any form, had been added 
to the indebtedness. The philosophical and chemical apparatus had 
been enlarged, and some valuable collections had been made for the 
botanical and geological cabinets. The basement of the main hall had 
been refitted for boarding accommodations, and the grounds orna- 
mented with shade trees. Several thousand dollars in subscriptions 
had been received for the enlargement of this hall, and about five thou- 
sand dollars for an endowment fund. 
Three courses of study had, most of the time, been sustained; namely, 
the normal and English, the scientific, and the classical, each extend- 
' ing over a period of four years. In the normal department a large part 
of the work of the institution was performed. It was organized under 
the regulations of the normal regents of the State from 1858 to 1865, 
and received some aid each year from the normal school fund. During 
the last eight years nearly one hundred teachers were annually pre- 
pared for the public‘and private schools. The report of the State Super- 
intendent for 1866 states that one hundred and fifty-nine students were 
in the normal classes of the academy, and that eighty-one of this num- 
ber taught during that year. The Wisconsin Journal of Education for 
1864 said that “no academy in the State furnishes so many teachers for 
the surrounding schools as this.” The members of this department 
were trained for their profession, not only by daily recitations in the 
studies of the prescribed course, but by lectures and discussions on the 
different principles and methods of education. The students who were 
pursuing the scientific and the classical courses had an opportunity to 
fit themselves for the Junior classesin our colleges. In these the mod- 
ern and the ancient languages were most carefully taught. Marked

attention was given to the natural sciences and the higher mathemat- 
ical studies. The more advanced students—both gentlemen and ladies— 
often expressed the wish that the institution would add to its curricu- 
lum the studies of the last two years of the college courses. Eighty-five 
students were found, at the close of the academic year for 1867, ready 
to form the Freshman and Sophomore Classes, under the organization 
of the college. 
It was no hasty or ill-advised movement on the part of the friends 
of the school in obtaining a college charter with university privileges. 
The respousibility and toil in building up such an institution were care- 
fully considered, and the risks to be encountered were thoroughly 
canvassed. The act incorporating the college passed the Legislature 
of the State in February, 1867, and was formally accepted by the stock- 
holders of the institution March 13th following. The charter grants 
the privilege of conferring degrees, and prohibits the exaction of any 
religious test or qualification of any trustee, officer, professor, teacher, 
or student of the institution. 
It was resolved to unite both the academic and the collegiate courses 
of study, an arrangement which the institution has since pursued in 
common with most of the collegesin the West. There are now three 
courses of study—a classical course, a scientific course, and a teachers’ 
course. The classical course embraces all the studies of both the pre- 
paratory and the collegiate departments, excepting those in the modern 
languages. Graduates from this course receive the degree of bachelor of 
arts. The scientific course accommodates those students who prefer 
the study of the German and the advanced English languages to that 
of the Greek. Graduates from this course receive the degree of bachelor 
of science. In the teachers’ course special attention is given to the 
preparation of students for teaching in the public schools of the State. 
The above sketch is in part taken from the Historical Sketch of Mil- 
ton College, prepared for the Centennial Exposition, 1876. 
The other chief sources of information respecting the college are the 
annual reports to the Bureau of Education at Washington, to the Su- 
perirtendent of Public Instruction of Wisconsin, and to the Education 
Society of the Seventh-Day Baptists of the United States.

GALESVILLE UNIVERSITY, WAYLAND UNIVERSITY, AND 
CARROLL COLLEGE. 
Galesville University.—The charter for this institution was obtained 
January, 1854, by Hon. George Gale, who procured also the organiza- 
tion of the new county of Trempealeau, with its seat at the incipient 
village of Galesville, which was to be the location of the University. 
At first designed by the founder as an independent institution, the 
Methodist Episcopal Conference of West Wisconsin in October, 1858, 
accepted the official control of its management, in conjunction with a 
local Board, as tendered by its trustees. It was planned as a Univer- 
sity proper, with the several departments appropriate to such an organ- 
ization, and some of these were for a time in actual operation. The 
building of a college edifice, begun in 1858, was completed in 1862. In 
1859 the preparatory department was opened with Rev. Samuel Fallows 
as principal, and Hon. Geo. Gale as president of Faculty and lecturer 
in law and history. Scholarships were issued to obtain funds for build- 
ing, and these after several years were redeemed in exchange for lands 
owned by the University, so that little was left for the maintenance of 
instruction except the agricultural farm attached to the building. 
Rev. Samuel Fallows was succeeded at the end of two years by Rev. 
J. 8. Farleer, and he again by Rev. Harrison Gilleland in 1865, who as 
president of the Faculty remained at the head of the institution till 
1877. At this date a change was procured in the terms of the charter 
through the agency of the local trustees and the consent of others, 
which transferred to the Presbytery of Chippewa, in the Presbyterian 
body, the prerogative of control in the choice of a majority of the trus- 
tees. John W. McLaury was then chosen president, and served for six 
years. The building was enlarged soon after, and a department of mili- 
tary instruction was added. January 6, 1884, the interior of the school 
building was destroyed by fire, and was restored for use in 1886. Rev. 
J. Irwin Smith, D. D., succeeded President McLaury in the duties of 
that office, and has continued to discharge them to the present time. 
The institution has now an establishment admirably equipped with 
buildings and teachers, and a fair library, together with apparatus for 
thorough college work, in a region unsupplied by any other agency of 
like grade, and with fair promise of enlarge ment and rapid progress.'

OTHER INSTITUTIONS. 67 
In addition to the colleges whose histories have been related in the 
foregoing pages, many others have been established and have met with 
varying degrees of suecess. Very often, indeed, these schools started 
with prospects fully as bright as those had that have secured a perma- 
nent footing. But some found the field already occupied, some were 
organized on too narrow a basis, while some, on the other hand, at- 
tempted too much work, failing as colleges when they might have 
attained great success as academies ; owing to these and various other 
causes, most of them have perished. Several, however, are still in 
existence as academies, sometimes adding also the first year or two of 
collegiate work. Carroll College, for instance, now an excellent acad- 
emy, granted degrees for some years, and Wayland University still 
offers part of a college course. 
Wayland University. — Wayland University, at Beaver Dam, was 
chartered January 31, 1855. The same year instruction began, the in- 
tention being to conduct a regular college, introducing other depart- 
ments as occasion required. Mistakes in management and the poverty 
of the Baptists of Wisconsin prevented the realization of the plaus of 
the founders, Instead of a college curriculum, the Freshman and Sopho- 
more years are all that have been attempted in addition to preparatory 
and academic work. Through varying fortunes the schovul continued 
doing fir st-class academic work until, in the fall of 1876, a small Fresh 
man class was organized. About 1876 a movement for an endowment 
culminated in the collection of thirty-five thousand dollars. The school 
has at present a Faculty of eight—three gentlemen and five ladies, and 
in the fall of 1887 had ninety four students. 
Carroll Oollege.—Carroll College, at Waukesha, was shaban by act 
of the Council and House of Representatives of the Territory of Wiscon- 
sin, approved January 31, 1846. For some years preparatory instruc- 
tion was carried on in rooms procured for that purpose. On September 
11, 1850, Rev. John A. Savage, D. D., of Ogdensburg, N. Y., was elected 
president, and filled the duties of that position until April 7, 1863. A 
buildiug was erected in 1852, and was occupied the following year. 
College classes were formed, and four classes, numbering nineteen 
young men, were graduated in the years 1857, 1858, 1859, and 1860. 
Owing to financial difficulties and the excitement due to the outbreak 
of the Civil War, the college was poorly sustained for the ensuing year, 
and on the 5th of December, 1860, the trustees took action suspending 
instruction. 
The institution was reopened in September, 1863, under the charge 
of Prof. Wm. Alexander, and continued for nearly two years. 
After a year’s further suspension the trustees offered the charge of 
the institution to W. L. Rankin, a graduate of Princeton College, and 
at that time principal of one of the graded schools of Elizabeth, N. J. 
He accepted the offer and opened the school March 5, 1866. Since

then a persistent and earnest effort has been made to raise the institu- 
tion to a position of permanent stability. 
An academic course has been maintained, and one thousand and 
sixty-two pupils have been enrolled (1886). Since 1876 diplomas have 
been conferred upon its graduates. The possession of this diploma 
entitles the graduate to admission to the University of Wisconsin 
without examination. Students have been sent to Princeton, Yale, 
Williams, Lafayette, Wabash, Wooster, Ann Arbor, Lake Forest, and 
to the different colleges in our own State. Many have entered schools 
of law and medicine without further collegiate preparation. About 
two hundred have become teachers.

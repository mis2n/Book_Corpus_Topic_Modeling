  INTRODUCTION 
Tuts manual for examiners using the Binet-Simon scale of 
mental tests is particularly valuable through its emphasis on a 
number of highly important points that are frequently not fully 
apprehended by users of mental tests. What long experience has 
taught clinical psychologists, who check up their diagnoses by 
outcomes discovered through later observations, does not readily 
filter through to class-room instruction in mental testing. It is 
only by teaching such sane, careful qualifications of method and 
interpretation as are set forth in this manual that it is possible 
to carry out the requisites of scientific training and the develop- 
ment of common-sense and scientific attitude in the matter of 
mental testing. 
The application of the Binet system is to be safely regarded, 
in surveying individual capabilities or in estimating group capaci- 
ties, only in the light of being what the author has aptly called it, 
namely, first aid work. For final diagnosis of the mentality of 
the individual, the Binet test score is simply one out of several 
main facts to be taken into consideration. Not even all mental 
abilities are represented in this system, to say nothing of their 
not being thoroughly tested at each age level, and many items 
of the physical background inevitably form part of the problem. 
For group evaluations, social norms (many of them not yet estab- 
lished) are to be ascertained and reckoned with. 
The author sees these points clearly and we welcome his 
endeavor to stimulate a broad-minded view of mental testing in 
his students and readers. His praise of the work of Binet and 
Simon, which we all sound, is sufficiently witnessed to by this 
publication of a new study of their scale for mental testing. I 
confess myself particularly interested in this two-fold attempt to

devise more exact methods of using this scale, while at the same 
time absolutely insisting on the setting of sharp limitations to 
the interpretation of findings by this scale. In both ways the 
aim of truly scientific method is complied with. 
The uniform procedure developed by the author he adequately 
states to be provisional, but it is based upon more attention to 
details, we are inclined to believe, than any other manual of 
directions that has so far appeared. It should be clearly under- 
stood that it is addressed particularly to those who make examina- 
tions of children in the work of codperating with larger or more 
intensive educational and medicopsychological efforts. A prom- 
ising field is opening rapidly for this better study of human 
beings. To take advantage of the opportunities there is need 
of people of sound training and good judgment. Competent 
examiners using a standard and thoroughly objective method 
will be in increasing demand. 
The whole text of the manual, apart from the specific direc- 
tions, should be carefully read. The Summary of General Pro- 
cedure (p. 41), the General Directions (p. 29), the Preface and 
other portions of Part I, contain fundamental ideas to be con- 
stantly held in the background of the examiner’s consciousness. 
I have responded with pleasure to the invitation to supply 
an introduction to this carefully evolved manual of procedure.

  STANDARD METHOD OF 
TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE STANDARD METHOD 
THE present manual ' grew out of a series of lectures, demon- 
strations, and laboratory conferences in connection with conduct- 
ing an organized mental survey of the pupils in the Philadelphia 
special classes.? Various methods of mental testing and of ortho- 
genic case study were tried out but no consistent detailed plan of 
procedure could be found. It appeared necessary to simplify for 
the sake of clearness most of the plans for collecting supplemen- 
tary data. 
Hitherto as regards the matter of test order, examiners have 
relied either upon personal opinion, upon “random testing” 
(S. R.),? or upon some inflexible order of tests (Y. P.).4 How- 
ever, it has been recognized that “ the child’s efforts in the tests 
are sometimes markedly influenced by the order in which they 
are given” (S. R.). In like manner the choice among alternate 
formule—e.g., in the picture test—has not been clearly decided 
though lack of insight in the choice of the formula “ would ruin 
the test” (S. R.) ; or the examiner has been instructed that “ if 
one form of expression or explanation is not intelligible to the 
child, care should be taken that a clear understanding is estab- 
lished by some variation of the form of statement” (Y. P.). Prac- 
tically all recent investigators of mentality testing show that they

feel the need of standard rules in regard to allowing second 
chances, to deciding certain details of scoring, etc. 
Part I of this manual includes directions for using the 
Standard Record Form, which has been adopted as Form 43— 
Record of Binet Examination—Philadelphia Public Schools. 
The first side of the-record form provides for a summary of the 
results of (1) the application of the Binet scale and (2) standard- 
ized measurements and judgments of physiological age, school 
ability, etc. The second side provides a convenient means of 
scoring each test. The grouping of the tests by years is identical 
with that of Binet and Simon, 1911.5 The arrangement of the 
tests is based upon two considerations. 
(1) Tests which the majority of investigations thus far re- 
ported® have shown to be most highly diagnostic in differ- 
entiating the mentally deficient from the normal, constitute the 
first or a series of tests; those next in diagnostic value consti- 
tute the b series, etc. Writers on the subject agree also that 
the tests here constituting the a series are in general the ones best 
suited for the early part of the examination. (2) Those tests 
which involve the use of similar materials or methods are ar- 
ranged in the same series so that they will be given in sequence 7— 
a procedure specified by Binet at certain points in the scale. The 
third and fourth sides of the record’form provide space, usually 
sufficient, for recording all important oral responses and responses 
requiring writing and drawing. Provision is also made for re- 
cording each step in the calculations by which the final test scores 
are obtained. By the use of the Binet quotient as herein ex- 
plained, “the Binet-Simon ‘age-grade’ method becomes trans- 
formed automatically into a ‘ point-scale method,’ if one wants to 
use it that way. As such it is superior to any other point scale

‘This latter principle of arrangement was suggested by Dr. J. M. 
McCallie.

  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 5 
that has been proposed, because it includes a larger number of 
tests and its points have definite meaning” (S. R.). Principles 
for guidance in the administration of the tests and the evaluation 
of the data are included in Part I, together with a selected 
bibliography representing some of the numerous fields of activity 
where the Binet-Simon scale has proved valuable. 
The Uniform Method of applying the Binet-Simon scale, with 
notes suggesting supplementary trial variations, comprises Part 
II of this manual. The Uniform Method is not another re- 
vision or adaptation of the Binet-Simon tests. The standardiza- 
tion is based upon (1) the experiences growing out of an applica- 
tion in over a thousand cases of the recommendations * of the 
Buffalo Conference on Binet testing and (2) a comparative study 
of the methods used by other investigators. A series of confer- 
ences were held with the directors and clinical assistants in 
ten psychological clinics and laboratories. Finally every detail of 
the Uniform Method was reviewed in the light of the returns of a 
questionnaire on the details of Binet testing and scoring sent out 
by Dr. Mabel R. Fernald, of the Laboratory of Social Hygiene, 
Bedford Hills, N. Y. 
Previous contributions toward standardizing Binet testing, 
with the exception of the work of the late Dr. Edmund B. Huey, 
have been devoted chiefly to adapting the tests on the basis of 
results obtained with children of a given nationality. However, 
the employment of tests throughout a wide range of years and 
the careful interpretation of the test data, obviate the necessity 
of adaptations. Such varied adaptations prevent the establish- 
ment of racial and group norms based upon one standard method. 
This idea of radically altering the scale for subjects of different 
nationalities appears similar to the ideal of revising thermometer 
scales for various altitudes. The analogy would be more complete 
if one would imagine all these various thermometer scales called

development of a standard procedure from that time on, 1913.

Centigrade and each designed to register the boiling point at 100° 
in its own altitude. The confusion and incomparability resulting 
from such revisions appear to more than counterbalance any ap- 
parent advantages. 
With a view to promoting intercomparability of results, notes 
have been appended to the test directions indicating the variations 
found in the adaptations of the Binet-Simon scale in use in this 
country. Such adaptations are referred to in this manual by 
the following abbreviations:

Owing to the many social and practical issues involved, the 
following considerations appear to the writer to be of importance 
in connection with the future of the work: 
(1) That we endeavor to define more accurately the qualifica- 
tions in the matter of training and experience for (a) Consulting 
Psychologists, who should know both how to administer accu- 
rately the several mentality scales that are in use and how to 
interpret the total age scores and the individual plusses, minuses, 
or points in the light of the racial and social averages obtained 
to date, together with all the other educational and social data 
which should accompany each test result; and (b) Field Exam- 
iners or Binet Assistants, advanced students in psychology who 
should probably have as a minimum 60 hours of laboratory work 
together with courses in child psychology and in the technique of 
applying the tests with the aid of a standard manual that does 
not necessitate improvization.
-P-A-G-E-15
  
  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 7 
(2) That we insist that a Binet age score, a Goddard age 
score, and the like be not accepted on their face value, recom- 
mending their interpretation in terms of mental growth periods 
in the light of group norms and of supplementary data. 
(3) That instead of attempting to make adaptations of the 
Binet scale, investigators strike out along new lines in the de- 
velopment of supplementary scales. Experiments in this direction 
are now being conducted by means of apparatus hitherto used in 
studying pre-verbal intelligence as found in idiots, animals and 
young infants. Those who have been doing most work with such 
apparatus, as for example Drs. Healy, Witmer and others, are 
+ using it in supplementing the Binet-Simon scale (1911) as valid 
for subjects “ up to ten years or so of age.” ® 
This manual is intended for the training and use of advanced 
students of applied psychology who wish to co-operate in the work 
of grading and classifying children and others of juvenile men- 
tality on the basis of their mental development. All co-workers *° 
in the educational, sociological or medical fields should have both 
general and specific preparation for the application of juvenile 
mentality scales. Such preparation should include attendance at 
a series of demonstrations, supplemented by practice testing under 
observation. Only those directions and explanations are given in 
the Method which have proved valuable in accompanying and 
supplementing the demonstrations and practice testing mentioned 
above. 
Field examiners and clinical assistants, who have been thus 
trained to observe a standard procedure, may take the Binet level 
of a subject and make tentative evaluations. Such evaluations 
are useful as a “ first aid” in selecting and classifying those who

workers. Their testing is then done under supervision, and the results are

are in need of further examination and of special education. Such 
classification tends more -toward social justice and educational 
efficiency than do the unpsychological groupings of everyday life. 
The presence of the mentally handicapped in many communities 
in numbers entirely disproportional to the number of available 
specialists makes it highly desirable that a system of preliminary 
examination and evaluation be employed. The study of individual 
cases has repeatedly shown the frequent need of such first aid 
tests not only for the subnormal but also for the normal and 
the supernormal. 
The typographical arrangement of this manual is the result 
of a trying-out of various ways of assembling the test materials 
with a view to increasing efficiency in testing. Heretofore this 
has been not infrequently impaired by the mislaying of materials 
in the form of loose cards or by the difficult handling and partial 
covering of the test materials, when crowded together in an ap- 
pendix. The pictures and drawings are so printed that they face 
the subject while the directions for using them face the examiner. 
Should a subject appear to be distracted by the reversed printing, 
the manual may be folded back so that only the plates appear to 
the subject and another copy used for the directions. So far 
this precaution has not seemed necessary with any of our sub- 
jects. The test manual may be placed so as to rest against a 
stand. The manual will then act as a shield behind which the 
scoring may be done unobtrusively. 
ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF MENTALITY TESTS 
The fact that any measuring scale is in part a convention 
adopted for practical purposes should never be lost sight of in 
analyzing results. Owing to the ethical and legal questions in- 
volved, such terms as imbecile or dement should not be applied to 
a given individual except when the Binet findings are corrobo- 
rated by a thorough psycho-biological study of the case. Even 
   
-P-A-G-E-17
TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 9 
then such formal diagnoses are inferior to a description (1) of the 
general mental and physiological level in terms of the analogous 
growth period, such as early infancy, later childhood, etc., and 
(2) of the kinds and degrees of anomaly found. The Orthogenic 
and Psycho-educational Tables given in the Appendix are a guide 
in the work of provisional classification. The Table of Anatomical 
Limits there given and the method of collecting supplementary 
_ data, explained on pages 32-38, should be studied in connection 
with the discussion of the statistical and Clinical analysis of results. 
As Binet and Simon insist, the attempt to analyze mentality 
tests under the rubrics of introspective psychology such as atten- 
tion, etc., is usually due to a desire to explain mental anomalies 
by the absence or weakness of some one of “the primordial 
faculties. (We have sometimes employed these expressions in 
our descriptions but we have not abused them.) The theory of 
the intellectual faculties and the theory of the scheme of thought 
belong to two different planes.” 
PROVISIONAL EVALUATIONS AND 
CLASSIFICATIONS 
As indicated in the Table of Orthogenic Classification in the 
Appendix, both the total Binet score and the Binet base value are 
significant as indicative of the mental growth period which the 
subject’s mental level resembles. The total Binet score is fre- 
quently called the mental age or more correctly the Binet age 
value. The Binet base is the higher of two successive years 
wherein the subject passes all the tests. The significance of the 
Binet base for purposes of mental classification has been empha- 
sized in the studies of Frederick W. Ellis and in the preliminary 
study of potential feeble-mindedness by Doll, both cited below. 
However, the total score and the age difference, indicative of 
mental retardation or acceleration, have thus far been more gen- 
erally used in orthogenic case studies,
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
The rule adopted by Binet for computing the total score has 
been used by the majority of investigators as valid up to year nine. 
The rule is to add to the base year 0.2 credit for each test passed 
above the base year, irrespective of the extent of the ‘ scattering’ 
of such make-up tests. For the tests above year nine we employ 
the following plan in determining credit: (1) The first to the 
fifth test passed above year nine each receives 0.2 year credit, 
irrespective of the extent of ‘ scattering ’—that is, whether or not 
such credit accrues from tests within the ten year group or from 
tests which compensate for failures in the ten year group. (2) 
The sixth to the tenth test passed each receives 0.4 year credit. 
(3) The eleventh test, etc., passed above year nine, each receives 
0.6 year credit. According to the Uniform Method the tests 
in years ten and above are employed with all high grade cases. 
The above plan of credit preserves the calibration of the upper 
end of the scale. At the same time the scores worked out 
by this plan appear to characterize the mental level of our sub- 
jects more nearly than the scores resulting from other methods 
of computation. 
Conservative estimates today place the upper limit of feeble- 
mindedness at least in a legal sense at Binet age ten; others place 
it at Binet age eleven.1 Hence failure in some of the twelve year 
tests and in all of the fifteen year tests is not necessarily an indi- 
cation of feeble-mindedness even in the case of adults. However, 
failure in certain of the tests may have diagnostic significance as 
explained hereafter. 
A Binet age score below eleven when accompanied by a sub- 
age (retardation) of more thar three years is usually indicative 
of serious mental deficiency. Even when accompanied by a slight 
sub-age score, a Binet age score below eleven may be indicative 
of potential mental deficiency’? when the test record reveals

Scale and the Question of Borderline Case.

edness. (See Refer’s.)
-P-A-G-E-19
TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 1 
a Binet base that is six** or more years below the life age. 
Owing to the wide variations possible in the fields of success 
which go to form the total or final Binet score, it has been found 
desirable to base the more important provisional classifications 
upon a systematic analysis of the test records. Our system of 
group comparison is embodied in the Orthogenic Table given in 
the Appendix. It is presented as a tentative standard working 
plan. 
In accordance with the above system of classification, the sub- 
jects fall into orthogenic divisions which are designated by the 
analogous mental growth periods. For purposes of institutional 
or special school training, some such grading of subnormal sub- 
jects by mental growth periods rather than by amount of deficiency 
is generally recommended. However, for purposes of individual 
and group treatment of all exceptional cases by educational means, 
it is important to bear in mind (1) the amount of mental superior- 
ity or inferiority indicated by the scale, (2) the presence of 
curable or incurable special defects, and (3) the degree of literacy’ 
or illiteracy in relation to the age and to the environment of the 
subjects. These factors are brought into relation in the Table of 
Psycho-educational Groups. 
THE PROBLEM OF STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 
The refinements of statistical and clinical analysis are not 
essential in the work of provisional classification just discussed. 
However, in making diagnoses, prognoses and recommendations 
for orthogenic treatment, careful interpretation is essential. The 
employment of a standard scale, supplemented by correction tables, 
and the establishment of standards of interpretation are invaluable 
for progress in this field. Given a standard method of test pro- 
cedure and of treating the results, it then becomes possible to

Inst., N. Y. 5th and 6th Ann. Rept. of N. Y. Probation and Protective 
Assn., 1913, 1914. 
 
-P-A-G-E-20
2 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
compare results wherever obtained by that method and to con- 
struct correction tables for each racial and social group on the 
basis of such data. Binet pointed out, for example, that the age 
markings on his scale indicate standards of normality based on 
children in the schools of Paris, situated inthe poorer districts, and 
that children of persons in comfortable circumstances have shown 
an average of one year in advance of the scale. The establish- 
ment of detailed correction tables is a task that must follow upon 
the working out of a uniform method of procedure. 
In constructing such correction tables, attention should first 
be given to the establishment of racial and social norms for the 
Binet base and for the total score. Any attempt to construct 
these composite scores from data gathered on the individual tests 
is doomed to failure because such procedure ignores the element 
of compensation that is involved in pooled correlations. 
Many statistical refinements have been proposed for the treat- 
ment of Binet values. Several investigators, following Stern, 
have advocated the use of the so-called mental quotient. This 
measure, to which we apply the term Binet quotient, is calculated 
by dividing the Binet age by the life age. This method of sub- 
stituting a percentage or point-scale score for the age difference 
score has the disadvantage that it requires more interpretation 
than the values from which it is derived. 
Among the most important statistical problems to be worked 
out is the determination of the co-efficient of correlation between 
Binet ages and measures of sticcess in various fields of juvenile 
and adult activity. The question of correlation between Binet 
age and physiological age is of considerable interest. In attacking 
this problem there is need of some standard method of computing 
physiological age and of determining the frontiers of physiologi- 
cal abnormality, especially as regards the height-weight index, the 
vital index, and that of physical excess. Binet’s Table of Limits 
for Subnormals (Boys), printed in the Appendix, is one of the 
most useful contributions at present available in this field.

  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY cas 
In conclusion, let us realize that as long as there are important 
human qualities like emotional attitude which have not yet been 
adequately measured, clinical interpretation must go hand in hand 
with statistical interpretation. Finally it should be remembered 
that as long as clinical interpretation is essential in diagnoses 
many of the finer problems of statistical treatment are to a cer- 
tain extent academic in character. There is one problem of sta- 
tistical evaluation, however, which appears to have immediate 
significance for applied psychology and sociology. This is the 
problem of determining as closely as possible what per cent. of 
the population of a given country may be expected to reach each 
of the Binet levels. Such data would afford valuable criteria for 
a uniform interpretation of standard scores. 
THE PROBLEM OF CLINICAL INTERPRETATION 
The preceding suggestions on the problem of statistical inter- 
pretation are based for the most part on the conclusions reached 
by Binet and Simon. The problems of clinical interpretation will 
be presented in the form of abridged quotations taken directly 
from the reports of these investigators published in L’Année 
Psychologique from 1905 to 1911 inclusive: ** 
In previous publications, we (Binet and Simon) have shown 
that it is possible to divide the methods of measuring intelligence 
into three groups: (1) the anatomical method (measurement of 
the cranium, of the face, of corporeal development; observation 
and interpretation of stigmata of degeneracy, etc.) ; (2) the peda- 
gogical method (measurement of knowledge acquired at school, 
principally in spelling and arithmetic); (3) the psychological 
method (measurement of the uncultured intelligence). All these 
phases of the same study are rapidly being developed, thanks to 
the collaboration of a few persons whom we have succeeded in 
“The Vineland translations have been drawn from, except in the 
final paragraphs.
-P-A-G-E-22
    14 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
interesting in them, but we shall present elsewhere the anatomical 
study. To sum up, we can utilize three methods for the diagnosis 
of the intellectual level among subnormals. 
1. The psychological method which is almost always applica- 
ble and which is almost certain to reveal the signs of defect; 
the difficulty being in the execution of the tests which demand 
in the experimenter a great facility in experimental psychology. 
2. The pedagogical method which is very frequently applica- 
ble, and. which reveals probable signs of defect. 
3. The medical method which is applicable only in a restricted 
number of cases, and which reveals possible signs of defect. 
Here we shall consider only the psychological measurement of 
intelligence. This measurement is taken by means of a series of 
tests, the gradation of which constitutes what we call a “ Measur- 
ing Scale of Intelligence.” This scale, strictly speaking, does 
not permit the “ measure ” of the intelligence, because intellectual 
qualities are not superposable, and therefore cannot be measured 
as linear surfaces are measured but on the contrary, a classifica- 
tion, a hierarchy among diverse intelligences; and for the neces- 
sities of practice this classification is equivalent to a measure. We 
shall, therefore, be able to know, after studying two individuals, 
if one rises above the other and to how many degrees, if one rises 
above the average level of other individuals considered as normal, 
or if he remains below. Understanding the normal progress 
of intellectual development among normals, we shall be able to 
determine how many years such an individual is advanced or re- 
tarded. Ina word, we shall be able to determine to what degrees 
of the scale idiocy, imbecility, and moronity correspond. 
In the course of our explanation, we have insisted on the 
character of our method of measuring. Notwithstanding appear- 
ances it is not an automatic method comparable to a weighing 
machine in a railroad station on which one need but stand in 
order that the machine throw out the weight printed on a ticket. 
It is a method which requires some originality to operate, and
-P-A-G-E-23
TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 15 
we warn the busy doctor who would apply it by means of hospital 
attendants that he will be disappointed. The results of our ex- 
amination have no value if deprived of all comment; they need 
to be interpreted. We are conscious that in insisting upon the 
necessity of this interpretation we seem to open the door to 
arbitrary opinions and to deprive our methods of all precision. 
This is so only in appearance. Our examination of intelligence 
will always be superior to the ordinary examinations of instruc- 
tion, because it has many advantages over these. It unfolds accord- 
ing to an invariable plan, it takes the exact age into account; it not 
only depends upon ‘the replies but compares them with a norm 
which is at the same time a real average determined by experience. 
_-~~ Distinction between intelligence and scholastic aptitude. Let 
“us commence with the easiest distinctions. We have often 
said that in our study we have sought to find the natural intel- 
ligence of the child, and not his degree of culture, his amount of 
instruction. 
Furthermore, the intellectual faculty appears to us to be inde- 
pendent not only of instruction but of that which may be called 
the scholastic faculty, that is to say, the faculty of learning at 
school, the faculty of assimilating the instruction given in school 
with the methods used in school. It seems to us that the scho- 
lastic aptitude admits of other things than intelligence; to suc- 
ceed in his studies, one must have qualities which depend espe- 
cially on attention, will, and character; for example a certain 
docility, a regularity of habits, and especially continuity of effort. 
The lack of attention, of character, of will, do not appear or 
scarcely so, in our tests of intelligence. In fact, in our examina- 
tions we have not found an inattentive child except among those 
of three or four years. All make a good effort; they are near 
us and our presence alone is sufficient to prevent a weakening of 
attention. It is not under such conditions that one can measure 
the ordinary power of attention of a child; it is when he is left 
to himself.  
-P-A-G-E-24
  16 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
Does our measuring scale fail to do justice to a child of un- 
common intelligence without culture, or with a scholastic culture 
much inferior to his intelligence? We do not think so. Such a 
child will show his superiority in the repetition of figures, in 
the repetition of sentences, paper cutting, the arrangement of 
weights, the interpretation of pictures, etc. And it is a specially 
interesting feature of these tests that they permit us, when neces- 
sary, to free a beautiful native intelligence from the trammels 
of the school. 
The maturity of intelligence is very distinct from the recti- 
tude of intelligence, and the proof is that there exist very plain 
examples, already cited by us, where the intelligence has maturity 
without rectitude. Thus a pupil of twelve years succeeds in 
uniting in one sentence the three words given him, but the sen- 
tence is meaningless; he has maturity, not rectitude. Another, 
a true adult, a man of twenty-four, a veritable block-head—to 
quote his companions—gives us the interpretation of a picture, 
but his interpretation is remarkably false. To interpret is to 
have maturity ; to make gross errors is to lack rectitude. 
The same distinction is also observable when one compares 
the answers to the tests of intelligence given by the subnormal 
with those of normal pupils. Let us take for example, without 
choosing, 13 subnormals of nine to twelve years, whose intellectual 
retardation varies from one to four years. * * * The average 
of absurd mistakes for the subnormal would be 3, for the normal 
scarcely 0.5. A very sensible difference which shows us, be it 
said in passing, that what is lacking in the subnormal is not only 
the maturity of intelligence (which is doubtless also lacking, for 
they are constantly retarded) but also the rectitude of intelligence. 
We limit ourselves for the present to formulating these remarks ; 
they are stepping-stones. 
Other traits of childish intelligence must also be studied so 
as to discover ‘if in certain cases the lack of rectitude does not 
also result from lack of maturity. 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 17 
Retardation is a term relative to a number of circumstances 
which must be taken into account in order to judge each particu- 
lar case. A defective adult even of inferior degree, for example 
an imbecile of forty, who is in general of the mental level of five 
years * * * from one point of view is certainly much su- 
perior to the child of five years, and the reason is that he has 
profited by an experience very much longer. Let us then lay aside 
these practical notions which have no bearing here. There re- 
main six or seven fundamental tests uniquely expressive of the 
intelligence ; these are the tests that may be considered as form- 
ing for the laboring class of Paris and its environs the border- 
line between moronity and the normal state. These tests are: 
first, arrangement of weights (Xa) ; second, answers to questions 
difficult of comprehension (Xc) ; third, the construction of a 
sentence containing three given words (Xd, XIId) ; fourth, the 
definition of abstract terms (XIla) ; fifth, the interpretation of 
pictures (XVa) ; sixth, the making of rimes (XVc). Our sub- 
jects in the hospital were able to pass some of these tests but 
not one could pass all, nor even three of them. Now this is not 
a special localized success, which is important for diagnosing a 
level of intelligence. All work has shown that intelligence is 
measured by a synthesis of results. We hope then that we are 
not dangerously precise in admitting that the six preceding tests 
will apprehend all feeble-minded adults; and that one who can 
pass the majority of them, or at least four, is normal. For us 
every subject from the laboring class of the region of Paris is 
normal if he has satisfied the condition of this examination of 
intelligence; however, the examination shows only that he has 
intelligence enough to live outside of an institution, and that in- 
telligence may coexist with accentuated instability, or with irre- 
sistible impulses, or even with other pathological symptoms grave 
enough to necessitate his segregation. 
In terminating this account, it will suffice to make a very 
brief allusion to the appreciation of penal responsibility ; there also 
2 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  18 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
our scale will render service. The problems of penal responsibility, 
such as are actually placed before the tribunals, are most complex 
and recently have caused discussions that are highly curious on 
account of the attention which has been paid to words rather than 
to things. We have scarcely the space here to make the multiple 
distinctions which would be necessary in making clear the real 
situation. It will suffice to remark that in certain cases experts 
have to give their opinion on the degree of intelligence of an 
accused person; and that according to their customary point of 
view, which consists in distinguishing health from illness, they 
are preoccupied in learning if the accused should or should not 
enter the group of feeble-minded. It is strange that so far, no 
other criterion than a subjective impression can guide them; they 
weigh each case with their good sense, which presupposes in the 
first place that this is a possession common to all men, and in the 
second place that everybody’s good sense is equal to every other. 
person’s. 
We have taken the level of intelligence of a great number of 
dements and here is what we have noted. Although the method 
was organized for children and imbeciles only, the great majority 
of dements lend themselves admirably to it. 
One who relied solely upon the results of our measuring scale 
would not be able to grasp the mental differences which differ- 
entiate an imbecile ament from a general paralytic dement. Shall 
we conclude that these subjects have the same mentality? Evi- 
dently not. We must put our readers on their guard against this 
erroneous interpretation of the bearing of our measurements. 
The scale which we use is made up of a series of small, intellectual 
problems, and it is quite possible that two individuals may fail in 
the same problems without for that reason having similar men- 
talities; the practical consequence is that the efficiency of their 
mentality is the same; but the mentalities may be different. Chil- 
dren, imbeciles and paralytics are alike in their inability to solve
-P-A-G-E-27
  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 19 
the same problems ; they are stopped by the same obstacles so that 
we can attribute to them the same mental level; but the identity 
of the results in no way implies the identity of mechanisms; the 
mentalities remain distinct. 
In the first place, that which distinguishes the ignorance of 
the imbecile from the functional inertia of the dement is that with 
the latter the failures and the errors have a remarkable degree of 
inconsistence, which indicates disturbances, accidents, while the 
negative results of the imbecile present on the contrary consider- 
able consistency, something which is not a disturbance but is the 
expression of the limit of his mind. In fact, we have seen certain 
dements fail before some difficulty and five minutes later triumph 
over it brilliantly. It is the same for their disturbances of articu- 
lation. Give them a word difficult to pronounce, they fail; then 
at a moment when one expects it least they pronounce it without 
difficulty. The second distinctive sign between the mentality of 
an imbecile and that of a general paralytic is furnished by the 
consideration of the intellectual level. It is in fact by relation to 
their level that one must judge of the importance of the phenomena 
of deficiency which they present. The errors committed by an 
imbecile are not surprising since his intelligence is so limited. On 
the contrary the errors of a paralytic are at variance with his level. 
The inertia of functioning which we observe in general para- 
lytics is especially recognized by the contrast which exists between 
their failures and their intellectual level in so far as one can 
accurately measure it; and, furthermore, their intellectual level 
appears to be higher than it really is because of the presence of 
residues, which consist in the verbal form of their replies rather 
than in the content. It remains for us now to go a little farther 
and having explained what a disturbance of functioning is, to con- 
trast it with a lack of development. 
A curious experiment that we have often tried with children 
of all ages, adults of every social condition, imbeciles and morons 
of every level, and general paralytics of every degree of disor- 
 
-P-A-G-E-28
  20 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
ganization shows admirably in what this development consists. 
We refer to the comments upon pictures. We place before an 
imbecile and a general paralytic a picture representing two old 
people in want, stranded upon a bench; one of them is an old 
man with a white beard and eyes closed; the other, a woman, is 
leaning against him. An imbecile is satisfied with the response, 
“Tt is a man.” A general paralytic, impressed no doubt by the 
head and beard of the man, makes this reflection, ‘One would. 
say Victor Hugo.” There is here the character of specialty 
(differentiation) which we consider one of the qualities of in- 
tellectual development. A second character is that of represent- 
ing what is essential in the reality. Here again the comments 
upon pictures furnish us with many examples. Many children 
looking at the pictures are struck by some insignificant detail; in 
the same way dull intelligences take only the immediate appear- 
ance of the reality and neglect what they do not see but what is 
nevertheless of infinitely greater importance. 
In opposing thus ‘the quality of the states-of consciousness 
with their evocability we make a distinction between.the develop- 
ment of the intelligence and its functioning, and at thé same time 
between the mentality of the imbecile and that of the paralytic 
dement ; the mentality of the imbecile is composed of simple states 
of consciousness which are evoked with normal facility ; the men- 
tality of the paralytic is composed of states which are more com- 
plex but which have become difficult of evocation. 
If senile dements are especially affected in the evocation of 
their memories, is it right to say that we should compare them to 
general paralytics, since we have admitted that with the latter 
the impotence of evocation gives the key to all or nearly all of 
their disturbances of functioning? We have drawn at some length 
the portrait of Mme. Solas, a paralytic who passed judgment 
upon herself and found herself very stupid. One could not have 
said of her that paralytic dementia always destroys the judgment. 
To avoid these contradictions one must take into account the
-P-A-G-E-29
  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 21 
fundamental idea of level. Without doubt at a given level the 
general paralytic has infinitely less judgment than the senile de- 
ment. Mme. Langlais has an intelligence of scarcely four 
years; the paralytics of seven or eight years judge much less 
correctly than she and have consequently very much less common 
sense. 
Mental confusion gives to many psychopaths the appearance 
of a lowering of intellectual level due to incoherence of expression. 
It is necessary to know how to distinguish mental confusion and 
dementia; this is especially necessary for prognosis, which all 
idea of dementia renders much more serious. 
This problem is of importance for there are many cases in 
which mental disorder takes on a confusional form. The chief 
interest lies in the differential diagnosis of manic-depressive in- 
sanity and dementia preecox. In dementia precox there exists a 
real lowering of level, and mental confusion exists also in most 
varieties. On the other hand, in manic-depressive insanity there 
does not exist a real lowering of level, but this malady also pre- 
sents quite often a confusional element. Consequently the diag- 
nosis of dementia precox in relation to manic-depressive insanity, 
when the latter involves confusional states, consists in discov- 
ering what is the quantity of intelligence preserved under the 
confusion. 
There exist among certain imbeciles and among the unstable, 
fantastic ideas, impulses, sudden paroxysmis of rage, wild pranks. 
Possibly one might admit that these episodical phenomena are 
explained by a bursting forth of this automatic life, that is to 
say in the modern phrase, a lack of synthesis; let us put it better: 
a simultaneous lack of co-ordination and of hierarchy. One may 
understand from this that these impulses take on so much impor- 
tance because they have escaped the control of the higher facul- 
ties. So be it. But all defectives do not by any means present 
phenomena of this kind. Besides, it is not because they present 
them that they are defectives. Outside of these accidental trou- 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  22 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
bles they have a peculiar mental state, characteristic of defec- 
tives, which is imbecility, idiocy, or moronity as the case may be; 
and what we insist upon is, that in order to explain this chronic 
mental state, one has no right to speak of lack of synthesis, as 
is habitually done; here the expression has no sense whatever, 
and those who employ it are parrots. 
Is it possible to cite known mental faculties which belong to 
normals and are not to be found among defectives? Formerly 
this was believed and certain authors believe it still, but this is 
because they have submitted their subjects to incomplete observa- 
tions. Let us make an enumeration. Is the defective radically 
incapable of attention? Evidently not. We have proved, even 
with idiots, that they give undeniable evidences of attention. Re- 
call the idiot Vouzin, who looks at us a little, specially when we 
call him loudly, and who for a moment even showed spontaneous 
attention, when he took the music box from our hands. Is it 
memory that is lacking? Not that either. We have noted many 
instances of prolonged memory among them. Denise, the poor 
girl, remembered for several days the object that we called 
of apa.” 
We may thus pass in review all our faculties, and determine 
that not one is entirely lacking in them. They always have them 
in some degree. The arsenal of their intellect is equipped with all 
the weapons. All this leads to the conclusion that the difference 
between the defective and the normal is not produced by the 
absence of a particular faculty, and alienists who in their defini- 
tions have seemed to insinuate the contrary, are deceived. 
To this conception of a structural psychology we oppose its 
counterpart, that which gives action as the end of thought and 
which seeks the very essence of thought in a system of actions. 
There are intimate consequences that will make themselves felt 
in the manner of positing the most serious psychological prob- 
lems, in particular the manner of understanding the attention, 
generalization, and also the relation of the conscious to the yn-
-P-A-G-E-31
  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 23 
conscious, and the reciprocal influence of the emotions and the 
thoughts, and finally the relation of delirium to emotivity. We 
note, as a logical example of the revolution which we predict, a 
new method for measuring the phenomena of consciousness ; 
instead of measuring the intensity of these phenomena, which 
has been the vain and foolish ambition of the psycho-physicists, 
we shall measure the useful effects of the acts of adaptation, and 
the value of the difficulties conquered by them; there is here a 
measure which is not arithmetical, but which permits a lineal 
seriation, a hierarchy of the acts and of different individuals 
judged according to their powers. 
Questions of detail aside, if we seek to take into account the 
evolution of the whole, which we approve, we can assert that 
psychology, having become a science of action, takes on an alto- 
gether different attitude for pedagogy, for morals, and for scien- 
tific philosophy. 
We have endeavored to perfect the procedure in the direct 
examination of the mental functions. For that: purpose we make 
use of the new method, that of taking the level. It has the ad- 
vantage as a clinical interrogatory of being constantly at our 
service instead of our being obliged to wait until the hazards of 
observation should put us in the presence of the signs of Kraeplin. 
The interpretation of the results furnished by this examina- 
tion is contained entirely in the two following laws: 
1. The results obtained from the experimental standpoint 
are available for judging the intellectual faculties of a subject; 
the consideration of the residues will enable us to judge whether 
it is a question of demented person or a feeble-minded person. 
2. The results obtained from the clinical standpoint are to be 
interpreted according to the intensity of the concomitant trou- 
bles: If one discovers a lowering of level, the question ought to 
be investigated whether or not there is sufficient excuse; if not, 
one will have to assume a real dementia.
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
Our method is eclectic. We do not refuse any way to make 
use of the signs furnished by different observers; we are con- 
vinced that all the signs ought to be of service; one should not 
neglect the stigmata of Magnan nor the signs of Kraeplin: circum- 
stances determine which method will be more suitable.*® 
In the detailed clinical study of mentality cases the detection 
of other mental and physical anomalies than those indicated by 
the use of scale is valuable. Most work of this kind is at present 
the task of descriptive rather than of experimental psychopathol- 
ogy. The aim of such work is the diagnosis and prognosis of 
the clinical varieties of amentia such as cretinism, etc., of allied 
neuropathic states such as epilepsy, etc. However, the modern 
_ authorities on descriptive psychopathology agree in emphasizing 
the value of mental tests—particularly of serial tests—in the 
work of diagnosis and prognosis.

  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 29 
GENERAL DIRECTIONS TO EXAMINERS 
The examiner should attend in advance to all, details that will 
reduce fatigue, discomfort, noise, or other disturbing factors. 
Use an isolated quiet room. Try to secure an assistant ** to 
record the answers verbatim. Except when a witness is necessary, 
allow no others to be present—if possible. If it is necessary to 
have a visitor or an official present, insist politely on absolute 
silence. 
Meet the subject pleasantly. Ask him his name but as ex- 
plained hereafter, do not ask his age until the end of the examina- 
tion. With a young subject, tell him that you are going to play 
some games; with an older subject, that you are going to ask 
him some questions. In all cases tell the subject that you want 
him to do his best and that he is to guess rather than to give 
no answer. Before beginning the tests try to get one or two 
responses on matters of common interest, e.g., base ball or a 
practical activity like sewing, carpentry, etc . 
Try to find out through officials or indirectly from the sub- 
ject whether he has been tested before; if so how long since; 
and what he knows about the test materials. If this is the sub- 
ject’s second experience with Binet tests, write an exponent 2 
after the Binet Age on all records; then indicate on the back of 
the blank how long since he has been tested, what he appears 
to know about the tests, etc. Supplementary observations for 
which space is not provided on the record blank should be written 
on a memorandum sheet which should be fastened to the record 
blank. These records should be made by the assistant in such a 
way as not to attract the attention of the subject. The test record 
should never be visible to the subject. 
Except when the subject is looking for encouragement, pay 
no particular attention to him so that he forgets himself in what 
  
"With clinical cases the presence of an assistant is sometimes un- 
desirable.  
-P-A-G-E-38
30 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
he is doing. Never stare at him lest he feel that he is under 
observation. Sitting casually with the subject as if entertaining 
him, encourage him constantly throughout the examination. Ina 
tactful way show an equal and lively satisfaction with all efforts 
except in the few instances noted in the directions where the 
examiner must be passive lest he mislead the subject and thus 
prevent him from doing better. If the subject fails to respond 
after slight urging, pass the matter by as easily as possible. Make 
him feel that you hope that he will succeed and that you are try- | 
ing to discover his best—not tripping him up at his worst. “ It 
is the business of the examiner to keep the subject in that state of 
mental exhilaration which enables him to do his best.” 
Never criticise and do not make a lesson out of any test. For 
the time being, the pedagogical habit of mind must be laid aside. 
The object now is to judge the mental level of the subject, not to 
instruct him. His mind must not be guided or taught while he is 
doing the tests, just as one does not usually stop to instruct a 
friend while playing a game with him. Never attempt to “im- 
prove” or to discipline a subject during an examination, even if 
he openly refuses to respond. If a disciplinary situation should 
arise, this would, like the onset of any physical ailment, auto- 
matically terminate the examination. 
Beware of the various pitfalls that await the beginner. In the 
first place, he is almost certain to array himself on the side of the 
subject and to declare in some instances that the test is not a 
fair one. In the comprehension tests and the like the beginner is 
tempted to complain that the language of the test is beyond the 
vocabulary of the subject. The examiner must remember that 
ability to respond to standardized formule and questions without 
supplementary demonstration or explanation, forms one of the 
most important elements in the complex mental processes being 
tested throughout the scale. Even if at first the subject mis- 
understands what he is to do, do not check him but watch for a 
possible clue in his reactions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 31 
If the procedure in any test has been interrupted or you 
realize that you have unintentionally varied from the Uniform 
Method, mark that test m in the margin. If at the close of the 
examination you wish to make supplementary variations, keep a 
careful record of each variation and of its results. Variations 
referred to in the supplementary notes may be indicated by appro- 
priate abbreviations placed in the margin; the results of such 
variations should be enclosed in parentheses on the record blank. 
Mental hygiene demands that no sitting should last more than 
three-quarters of an hour with subjects who test at the level of 
later childhood or higher ; nor more than a half an hour for those 
who test at lower levels. The Uniform Method, when used by 
a trained examiner with an assistant, should not exceed these 
time limits, which were adhered to by Binet in his own testing. 
If necessary, finish the testing in a later sitting. 
The examiner should unobtrusively record his judgments 
+, —, ?+ or ?— (as illustrated in the Method) immediately 
after giving each test. These judgments should be reviewed later 
in conjunction with the Examination Notes. The answers on the 
Examination Notes should be compared with the examples of 
correct and incorrect responses contained in the Method.17 A 
study of these examples will show that correctness generally in- 
volves a comprehension of “the exact shade of meaning con- 
veyed” by the formule (S. R.). The criterion is not, does the 
answer have perfect grammatical or logical form, but has the 
subject comprehended all that he is expected to grasp at the given 
level and has he responded correctly on the basis of such com- 
prehension (G.). This criterion minimizes the effect of formal 
education. 
Observe and record, as directed, the attitude of the subject 
towards the tests. Keep such notes as will aid in making a 
characterization of (1) general intelligence, (2) general behavior 
and disposition, and (3) general appearance.   
“Doubtful responses should be scored in the light of the responses 
o adjacent trials and tests.

INSTRUCTIONS TO SCHOOL EXAMINERS 
1. Report at the principal’s office each day to get permission 
to begin testing. Be careful not to interrupt the work of the 
principal or the class teacher. 
2. Ask for instruction as to signals for (a) fire drill, (b) 
recess, and (c) dismissal. Make sure that you understand how 
to carry out such instructions and see that you do so. 
3. Accompany each pupil from the class room to the ex- 
amining room and back again to the class room. Interrupt your 
testing to take the pupil back to his class so that he can get in 
line for recess and for dismissal unless special arrangements have 
been made. 
4. Upon request show a given pupil’s record blank to the 
principal or teacher. Under no circumstances offer a diagnosis 
of the case. A verified duplicate of each record should later be 
sent to the principal of the school. 
STANDARD RECORD FORM AND DIRECTIONS FOR 
USING Z 
The methods of gathering and assembling the data from the 
Binet-Simon tests and from supplementary sources are explained 
in the following directions for using the Standard Record Form. 
These directions are, for convenience, addressed to the examiners 
in the Philadelphia schools. 
The Standard Record Form is reproduced at page 38 of 
Part I.'8 Efficiency in using it should be acquired during demon- 
strations and practice work. 
First Side (see Record), Summary of Binet Examination and of 
Supplementary Data 
The first and third lines of this side and as far as practicable, 
the lines for recording Supplementary Data should be filled in   
* Also a specimen copy of the form is supplied with this manual 
for convenience in studying these directions.

before the examination by some official in charge of the subject; 
e.g., his teacher. This blank is then to be known as the original. 
The other sides of the original are to be used by the examiner in 
the manner directed hereafter. 
Date of Birth: Indicate by C or W over date of birth whether 
this is based on birth certificate or on word of parent or guardian. 
An error of one year vitiates the measure of mental retardation 
or acceleration, i.e., the sub-age or super-age. The next three 
items should not be written in until the second and third sides of 
the record form have been verified—preferably under the direc- 
tion of a consulting psychologist. 
Age (Chronological or Life Age) : See space provided at top 
of third side, for steps in calculation. 
Binet Age: See directions for third side. 
Sub-Age: A minus age difference, i.c., when the Binet Age is 
less than the Life Age. 
Super-Age: A plus age difference, i.e., when the Binet Age is 
greater than the Life Age. 
Handicaps: For explanation of terms that are not self-evident, 
see key to Supplementary Data below. 
Room: Give room number. 
Regular Grade: Kg., IA, IB, or the like. 
Special Group: Og.A (Orthogenic Class, group A); Op. 
(Orthopedic Class) ; Oa. (Open Air) ; F. (English to Foreigners). 
Name of Public School: Write first the name of the building 
where the pupil attends class; then if this is an annex, write after 
it the name of the main building. 
District: Indicate the district where the main building is 
located. 
General Attitude, etc.: Underscore the appropriate terms im- 
mediately on the close of the examination. Mentally active, ie., 
curious, self-critical, etc.

pleted in accordance with the Orthogenic Table; but like the 
three items named above, should not be written in until the second 
and third sides of the record forms have been verified. 
Directions FoR REcorpING SUPPLEMENTARY Data. 
In order that the Binet Age may be properly interpreted a 
number of supplementary facts should be at hand. The supple- 
mentary data here called for should, as far as possible, be ob- 
tained from (1) registration card, (2) medical record, (3) 
monthly report. An interview with the class teacher at some 
convenient time may facilitate the obtaining of such data as have 
not already been supplied. Whenever a number of descriptive 
words are given, each word that applies to the pupil should be 
underscored ; and if any one or more words apply with particular 
force, these may be doubly underscored. 
Line 1—Underscore: 
Foreigner: Has not a fair command of English because of 
environment. 
Temporarily handicapped: Has no lasting physical or mental 
defect but has fallen behind because of temporary illness, removal, 
or lack of educational opportunity, e.g., living in the country. 
Physically defective: Has some chronic physical defect which 
reacts on school ability, e.g., anemia. 
Dull: Has good judgment but is slow in his work. 
Incompetent: Is below the average in his judgment as well 
as in schooling. The actual degree of incompetency in SS 
is best indicated by the Binet scale. 
Iil-balanced : Morally defective, unstable in character, or in 
other ways shows signs of genuine or border-line insanity. The
-P-A-G-E-47
  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 35 
abnormal, i.e., the ill-balanced, subject should be distinguished 
from the subnormal, i.e., the mentally deficient. 
Delinquent: Is a disciplinary case, ¢.g., a truant, etc. 
Negligent: Is not a defective or disciplinary case, but indiffer- 
ent, inattentive, etc. 
Line 2: Insert after: 
Race—words indicating the original stock of parents, e.g., 
Scotch-Irish. The word American is not sufficiently definite for 
the purpose in view. 
Parents’ nativity—country in which parents were born. 
Language usually spoken at home—that is the language usually 
spoken by the parents. 
Line 3: Should indicate whether or not the subject spent his 
early life in the country or in the city, whether in the United 
States or some foreign country, and up to what age, e.g., for a 
foreign-born pupil Line 3 might read, “lived in country, in Italy 
till ten years old,” or, in the case of native-born child, “lived 
in city, in Philadelphia, since birth.” 
Line 4: The estimate of the language work should be based 
either on the teacher’s judgment or on pedagogical scales. If 
desirable, two estimates may be inserted here, one of the oral 
language, one of the written. Regular schooling—applies to 
regular attendance in any grade above the kindergarten. 
Line 5: The number of years spent in each grade, counting 
terms A and B together as one grade, should be obtained whenever 
possible from the registration card. Every change in school 
should be indicated by a double bar, ¢.g., grade 1 ? 1| | %4 indicates 
that in grade 1 the pupil spent two terms in one school and one 
term in another school. If a pupil is in a special class, the number 
of years spent there should be indicated after the name of the 
special class; and in the case of an orthogenic pupil, the group *®   
*In the Philadelphia public schools, the mentally handicapped are 
in orthogenic classes and classified into three-groups: A, incompetent or 
mentally deficient, B, backward or dull, C, temporarily handicapped or 
probable restoration case.
-P-A-G-E-48
36 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
in which he was first placed should be written after the word 
group, then the length of time he remained in that group; if he 
was promoted or demoted to another group, the letter indicating 
the second group should be written in front of the next question 
mark, followed by the length of time spent in that group, etc., 
eg. A ? %; B ? 144—indicates one term in Group A and three 
terms in group B. An attendance of less than three months in 
a given term should be ignored. 
Line 6: Age-grade retardation. Determine the average 
school grade of the subject’s entire language work by the use of 
standardized scales, if possible, or otherwise by the judgment of 
school officials. Taking seven as the upper limit of age for the 
first grade, the difference between the subject’s age and the upper 
limit of age for the grade indicated by the language work is the 
amount of age-grade retardation. 
Line 7: Consult school records and school officials. “ Inter- 
rupted” refers to absence of a month at a time. 
Lines 8 anv 9: Consult medical inspector’s records. 
Line 10: Consult parent when possible. Stigmata—for an 
illuminating discussion of stigmata consult Montessori’s “ Peda- 
gogical Anthropology.” 
Estimates made by Principal (P), Teacher (T), Medical 
Inspector (M), etc.,—indicate by letter over each column or 
beside each rating by whom said rating is made. 
In estimating “ standing,’ compare the pupil with the average 
members of his grade. G—Good, i.e., above average; F—Fair or 
average; P—Poor, i.e., below average. 
Balance—See directions for Line 1. The other terms are self- 
explanatory. In estimating development compare the subject with 
average males or females of his chronological or life age, e.g., 
“Physiological +” indicates more mature physically than the aver- 
age of his or her age; “ Physiological —” indicates less mature 
physically than average of his or her age; “ Physiological n” indi-
-P-A-G-E-49
  
  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 37 
cates near the median, i.e., neither clearly above nor below the 
average of his or her age in maturity as regards that trait. 
The developmental levels may also be studied in terms of 
growth periods (see section on Evaluation, p. 9). Such esti- 
mates may then be recorded after each trait, e.g., “ Emotional 
L. I.” indicates that the subject’s emotional reactions resemble 
those of later infancy, that is, of a child of three or four. 
Degree of physiological maturity is sometimes called physio- 
logical age. For further explanation see King, “The High 
School Age.” For discussion of other developmental levels, see 
writings of B. T. Baldwin, J. E. W. Wallin, and others. 
Supplementary Measurements: Optional. 
Recommendations—to be made by the official designated. 
Nore: The detailed directions for using the second, third, 
and fourth sides of the record form during the examination are 
contained in the test directions in Part IT. 
Second Side—Test Record 
As illustrated in Part II, the periods or record points indicate 
where the examiner should record his judgment of every trial 
and test given. Each abbreviation, etc., on this side is explained 
in the directions for the tests. 
Third Side—Examination Notes 
The required notes and other observations (see p. 31) may first 
be recorded on extra paper. Such paper should be headed “ Mem- 
orandum Sheet ” and filed inside the record blank. On the com- 
pleted record blank every space provided on the third side for the 
tests given should be filled in. These trials and tests should be 
finally scored here as well as on the second side. 
The rules for computing the Binet age, etc., have been given 
on pp. 9-10. “ Difference,” i.e., age difference, should be marked 
— or +, see Sub-Age and Super-Age, p. 33. See also special 
note, “ N. B.” on p. 115.
-P-A-G-E-50
  38 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
Fourth Side—Original Records 
The designs, Xb, should be drawn immediately here. The 
other tests should be done first on extra paper, e.g., on back of 
“Memorandum Sheet.” 
UNIFORM PROCEDURE IN REGARD TO TEST ORDER 
These rules embody the recommendations of the Informal 
Conference on the Binet-Simon Scale and provide a uniform 
objective procedure. The Standard Record Form and the Method 
are arranged to facilitate the application of these rules. For the 
principles upon which they were worked out, see page 4. 
FIRST SEQUENCE OF TESTS 
1. Begin with the pictures, page 44, Pt. II, Uniform Method. 
Then give the a test of the year just above that indicated by the 
results of the picture test.2” (See pp. 50-51.) 
2. Proceed with the a tests in succession as printed in the 
Method until the subject fails one of the a tests.? Then give the 
b test of the preceding year. 
3. Proceed with the b tests in succession as long as the sub- 
ject is successful. However, if he fails the first b test, proceed 
in reverse order until he passes one of the D tests.” 
4. As soon as you have in this way found the highest b test 
that the subject passes, proceed with the c test of the same year. 
Then apply rule 3 to the c, d and ¢ series of tests. 
SECOND SEQUENCE OF TESTS 
5. Determine the working base—i.e., the highest year con- 
taining no minus score." Starting at this working base, give in 
Tf XVa is passed, give XVb and then apply rule 4, etc. If any test 
in III is failed, give the next test of that year, applying rule 4 as far as 
the results permit. 
* T.e.—The highest year containing one or more plusses, but in which 
and below which there is no minus. 
 
-P-A-G-E-51
  
TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 39 
succession any a tests which have not yet been given or which 
have been failed through absence of response. Continue the a 
tests until two successive minuses have been recorded.”° Proceed 
likewise with the b tests, etc. 
THIRD SEQUENCE OF TESTS 
6. Determine the working sub-base—i.e., the year just pre- 
ceding the highest year wherein no tests are scored minus. Start- 
ing at the working sub-base, proceed as in rule 5; continue, how- 
ever, until two successive years of complete success and two suc- 
cessive years of complete failure have been recorded.** 
GENERAL RULES CONCERNING REPETITION 
Nore: Special exceptions to these rules are given in certain 
test directions. 
1. Unless otherwise specified, each question or direction should 
be reiterated once in an encouraging manner provided the subject 
does not begin to respond within about five seconds. 
2. A question- should be reiterated twice only provided 
(a) that there has been interruption or (b) that the subject 
requests it. 
3. After a question has been reiterated, the examiner should 
wait about half a minute for the subject to begin before giving 
the next question. 
4. A question should not be reiterated because of incorrect 
response unless it is manifest that the subject did not hear what 
was said. 
5. A second chance is given later only when the test has been 
scored minus through absence of response (see above). On 
second chance, observe rules 1-4. 
Tf ten or more tests are passed above year IX, give the “adult” tests. 
(See Appendix.) Record these results on Fourth Side.

TEST MATERIALS AND GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR 
USING 
The present manual ”* contains the printed materials—pictures, 
drawings, etc.—required for giving the tests.24 In addition to 
these printed materials, the following articles are needed for the 
application of the scale: 
(1) Watch showing seconds, preferably a football timer, 
noiseless (to be kept out of view at all times), VIId, VIIIc, [Xe, 
Xe, XIIb, XIIe, XVc. 
_ (2) Penand ink, some unruled scratch paper (about 4” x 6”), 
Vb, VIb; pencil, Xb, Xd, XIId. 
(3) Three one-cent stamps and 3 two-cent stamps (to be 
pasted in manual) VIId. 
(4) Box (any small box, e.g., a spectacle-mailing box used 
as a receptacle for articles 5 to 10 inclusive. Test articles 5-10 
should always be kept in such a receptacle so as to be ready for 
use). Two extra chairs (one to be placed near the door), VIIb. 
(5) Four pennies, Vd; 13 pennies, VId; if possible a desk 
blotter to cover the 13 pennies and other coins mentioned below, 
which may thus be laid out ready for use. 
(6) Two nickels, 2 dimes, a quarter, and the 13 pennies, IXb. 
(7) A half dollar, a dollar bill, and one of each of the coins 
used above, IXd. 
(8) Key (familiar kind), penny, penknife, [Vc. 
(9) Two visiting cards, one cut diagonally, Vc. Adult C. 
(10) Set of weighted cubes.**> (These may be obtained from 
C. H. Stoelting Co., 125 N. Green St., Chicago, Ill.) Va, Xa. 
® For suggestions as to the mechanics of handling the manual during 
the testing, see page 8. 
* J. B. Lippincott Company will furnish the Standard Record Forms for 
recording results. 
* Binet used uniform pill boxes (packed with cotton or the like 
and weighted to meet the requirements of the tests). We have found that 
druggists cannot be relied upon to prepare such boxes. If the examiner 
wishes to use such, he should (1) prepare them himself, (2) paste down 
the cover so that none of the contents are lost, (3) mark on the bottom of 
each box the code letter indicated in our test directions, see Va.  
-P-A-G-E-53
  TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 41 
SUMMARY OF GENERAL PROCEDURE 
1. Do not attempt to apply a mentality scale until you have 
had specific training in its technique. 
2. Do not begin to test a subject unless you have succeeded 
in getting him to appear at ease. Find some pleasant way of ter- 
minating a sitting if the subject appears not to be doing his 
best. Use every resource to secure his interest except severe 
reprimand or threat. ; 
3. Do not let the subject wait between the tests or watch 
you recording. Keep him occupied all the time so that the 
examination does not become tedious. Do this even at the expense 
of more complete verbatim records. 
4. Do not dismiss the subject even at the end of the time 
limit until you have looked over his record to be sure that it is 
complete for that sitting. As soon as he is dismissed, fill in such 
incomplete verbatim records as you can from memory, and the 
record of (1) General Attitude, and (2) Remarks. 
5. Do not permit yourself to give the subject any clue as to 
the correct response or as to whether or not his response is satis- 
factory. Assume a kindly and encouraging manner throughout, 
thereby being perfectly non-committal. 
6. Do not attempt to adapt or supplement the test instructions 
in any way. Remember that you are testing the ability to react 
to standardized formule. Foreign subjects should be tested with 
a standard translation. Remember, however, to adapt your man- 
ner to the needs of each subject, so that he will be at ease. 
7. Do not allow yourself to be prejudiced by any information 
as to the age, position, or character of the subject. Consider him 
an x to be solved by means of the tests first—and then later by 
all available supplementary data. 
8. Do not compute the Binet age, Sub-age, etc., until you have 
compared each response on the Examination Notes with the ex- 
amples of correct and incorrect responses contained in the method.  
-P-A-G-E-54
| 42 TESTING JUVENILE MENTALITY 
9. Do not conclude that the Binet age is an exact expression 
of the mental level of the subject. Remember that the Binet age, 
Sub-age and Super-age are conventions adopted for practical pur- 
poses and must be interpreted in the light of the whole test record, 
of biological data, etc. None but specialists in juvenile mental 
and physical disorders should attempt to make a diagnosis of 
mental retardation. 
10. Do not confuse the aims and technique of mentality test- 
ing with those of clinical or laboratory psychology. Standardized 
mentality testing is an invaluable preliminary to the more inten- 
sive study of certain cases. With immature subjects, i.e., juve- 
nile minds, the brief experimental probing used in applying men- 
tality scales is often the only procedure that yields results of any 
value. Remember that the fundamental principle here is a 
standardization (1) of test conditions and (2) of judgments in 
scoring the responses.

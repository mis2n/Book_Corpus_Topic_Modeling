EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tue spiritual nurture and religious training of the 
world’s childhood is vital to all we hold dear in our Chris- 
tian civilization. In this work of child training, the home 
holds the strategic place. It has the children in its care 
in the early years before they are old enough to attend 
either the Public School or the Church School. The im- 
pressions of these years determine or modify the whole of 
the life that follows. Even later, the children spend many 
more hours in the home than they do in either the Church 
or Public School. 
The training of parents for the task of child training 
in the home, therefore, becomes one of the Church’s great- 
est responsibilities. To perform this service effectively, 
every Sunday-school should have a parent training class 
and attempt to meet this responsibility in an organized 
way. Such a class greatly needs the help of a concise, 
practical text book. Indeed, without such a text book a 
parent training class is a most difficult class to hold. 
“Parenthood and Child Nurture” has been specially 
prepared for the Parent Training Class. Where the indi- 
vidual can find or form no group to join and gain the 
added benefit that comes from comparing notes, much 
good may be obtained from privately reading and fol- 
lowing the advice contained in this book. fe 
Its scope includes the physical, mental, social and spirit- 
ual life of the child from birth to twelve years of age. 
It contains unusually helpful suggestions regarding songs, 
games, stories and other material suitable for the child. 
The collateral reading recommended would enable any

parent or parent training class to build up a library on 
the training of children that would be of great value. 
We prophesy for this message a ministry of world-wide 
service in the work of training the young according to the 
spirit and teaching of the Master, who loved the children.

  PREFACE 
For understanding of the child and for inspiration in 
the writing of this book I am deeply grateful to many 
teachers and many authors as well as to my friends, the 
children, whom it has been my good fortune to know 
intimately in school and out of it. I wish to acknowledge 
my indebtedness to Anne Goodwin Williams for her val- 
uable assistance in preparing the bibliography and ques- 
tions for the chapters, and to my sister, Clara Belle Baker, 
for critical reading of the manuscript.

INTRODUCTION 
In the poem “Father and Son” by Edgar Guest the 
first stanza reads: 
“Be more than his dad, 
Be a chum to the lad; 
Be a part of his life 
Every hour of the day; 
Find time to talk with him, 
Take time to walk with him, 
Share in his studies 
And share in his play; 
Take him to places, 
To ball games and races; 
Teach him the things 
That you want him to know; 
Don’t live apart from him, 
Don’t keep your heart from him, 
Be his best comrade, 
He’s needing you so.” 
Children need more than anything else the kind of 
companionship with their parents that Edgar Quest 
pleads for here. Such a relation of father and son, of 
mother and daughter, accentuates the blood tie and makes 
the home something more than a place where the chil- 
dren eat and sleep and have clothing and shelter pro-. 
vided. It requires, however, for fullest realization more 
than parental instinct on the part of the father and 
mother. Parents need to know what to talk to their 
children about, where to take them for walks, how to help 
them so as not to hinder them in their studies, what plays 
and games are suitable to the various ages, and how much 
truth may be comprehended at a given age. The ideal 
companionship is based upon an intelligent understanding 
xili

of child nature, its possibilities and needs, and the means 
for its complete development. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF EARLY TRAINING 
Harold Copping has painted a very beautiful picture 
entitled “The Hope of the World.” The central figure is 
the Master of Galilee and around him looking up into his 
face are children representing every race, white, brown, 
red, yellow and black. The message of the picture is 
clear; the hope of the world lies in training the children 
of the world according to the principles of Christianity. 
There is no other cure for the profiteering, the strife 
between capital and labor, the extravagant expenditure 
of money, the narrow and selfish nationalism, the dis- 
regard of human life which in some form have dark- 
ened our own and every other period of history. Those 
who would base their hope upon reforming the men and 
women of the present generation are doomed to disap- 
pointment. The habits of thinking, feeling and acting 
have been so firmly established that they bind as chains 
the majority of our citizens. Any one who has attempted 
to reform his own habits of eating including a choice of 
diet knows that only with extreme difficulty has he made 
headway. There are scores of people who, convinced that 
a certain article of food was injurious, have found it 
well-nigh impossible to break the habit of eating it. ' Sta- 
tistics compiled for recent extensive revivals show that 
the great majority of conversions occur in adolescence and 
early manhood and that the numbers dwindle surprisingly 
as middle life and old age appear. The science of neurol- 
ogy gives us the reason for these facts; there is a physio- 
logical basis for every habit. In the connections in the 
nervous system of the human body invisible except under 
the strongest microscope, are laid what we have termed 
habits. As the nerve current passes year after year over 
the same path it traverses that path more readily each
-P-A-G-E-15
  INTRODUCTION xV_. 
time and there is more and more difficulty in switching 
it to any other path, as each time that a sled takes the 
same path down the icy hill it is less likely to make a 
different path. “Moreover, the younger the child the more 
plastic the nervous system, the more impressionable the 
life, we say using common terminology, and the older 
the child the less plastic the nervous system, the less 
easily impressed the individual. Little children are open- 
minded, curious, investigative, lacking in prejudice and 
superstition except as their elders engender it. They 
afford the opportunity par excellence of making a new 
world where brotherly love and the golden rule may func- 
tion. 
THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE HOME 
Such a new world cannot come, however, without the 
active codperation of parents and teachers in forming 
child nature. The original nature of the child is not 
all good. ‘There are some tendencies in our children 
which need to be eliminated like greed, insane rage and 
cruelty, inheritances from those days ‘when the human 
animal contended with the brute forces of land, water, 
wind, rain, plants, animals and other wild men.” ‘There 
are others that need to be modified such as the fighting 
instinct, and there is not one tendency, however good, 
which does not need some care for its perpetuation. 
Parents as well as teachers should know something about 
the original equipment of the child and what to do with 
it. If they did know, we should not have the tragedies 
of crime, suicide and wretchedness which strew the hu- 
man highway with wreckage. The opportunities of the 
home and the parents are peculiarly significant for many 
reasons. Teachers come and teachers go in the school 
eareer of the child, and so do playmates, but the home 
exercises a continuous influence from the cradle to man- 
hood. There is, moreover, a closeness in the home rela- 
tionships which is impossible to approximate outside.

XV1 INTRODUCTION 
The family forms a social unit where each member has 
his specific function to perform for the whole and his 
own rights in the group; and the size of the unit makes 
it possible for the little child to find his place, while a 
larger social group bewilders him. Long before the child 
knows other homes and other friends his own home and¢ 
parents are indelibly engraved upon his consciousness. 
Because the love of a child goes out most warmly to 
those who confer the most keenly appreciated benefits 
upon him, parents have an opportunity to win a very 
deep and abiding affection. The impressions gained in 
the home are enduring and cannot be divorced from the 
personality of the man or woman. It has been well 
said, “The child is wax to receive and granite to hold the 
impressions of the fireside.” 
THE NEEDS OF CHILDHOOD 
The needs of childhood are many. First_of-all there 
is the.xright_of every child to be well-born, physically 
‘ perfect and mentally sound. ~ Not until our prospective 
parents have learned the fundamental facts of the science 
of eugenics, the science of being well-born, will every child 
enter into his birthright, for the germplasm of the parent 
should be free from taint of insanity, feeble-mindedness 
and crime as well as from transmissible disease. Such 
a standard of morality must be built up through knowl- 
edge that legal measures can meet with the intelligent 
support which insures success. }-After the child-is~born

sympathetic understanding not only child life but all life 
craves; but child life needs it particularly because chil- 
dren are different from grown-ups, different in bodily 
structure and proportion and consequently different in 
their ways of thinking, feeling and behaving. To under-..

  PARENTHOOD AND CHILD 
NURTURE 
CHAPTER I 
THE STUDY OF THE CHILD 
To most parents the study of the child is an engrossing 
pastime. The first cry, the dawning smile, the sound 
that resembles ma-ma, the waving of the tiny hand, the 
early attempts to toddle are strange and unexpected 
phenomena when they appear. Often there has been no 
intelligent child study either preceding or accompanying 
the child’s advent in the home. Consequently the parent 
does not know what to look for or when to look for it. 
In other words there is no chart that helps the father or 
the mother to tell whether the child’s progress is normal, 
and they lack any knowledge as to how they may guide 
his development. While parents need to study the be- 
havior of their own children in order to understand them 
since no two children are alike, they need to check that 
study by the study of childhood for which there are to-day 
many fine sources. 
RESOUPCES OF CHILD STUDY 
‘More than a score of years ago G. Stanley Hall intro- 
duced formally a new subject, child study. It has in- 
creased in popularity steadily until to-day there are hun- 
dreds of books, pamphlets and magazine articles available 
under this general heading. Only a part of this material 
is thoroughly scientific because the observations of chil- 
1
-P-A-G-E-20
2 ParRENTHOOD AND Curttp Nurture 
\ dren have not been sufficiently accurate, have not ex- 
tended over a long enough period of time, and have not 
included enough children to warrant the generalizations 
that are made. However, every effort has had its influ- 
ence in calling attention to childhood and in setting this 
period of life apart from the adult world for contempla- 
tion and appreciation. Gradually a body of fairly re- 
liable information has been built up to which parents 
may turn for help and enlightenment in the care of their 
children. 
FICTION AN AID 
There has also developed a distinct type of fiction pic- 
turing the life of the child; Emmy Lou, Rebecca of 
Sunnybrook Farm, Understood Betsy, Penrod are favor- 
ite stories of this kind. These tales are full of the 
quaint humor, the vivid imagination, the engrossing in- 
terests, the comedies and tragedies of childhood, and 
touching as they do the emotions of the adult, they aid 
greatly in helping him to enter the kingdom of child- 
hood. Then there are the poems about little children by 
Field, Riley, Longfellow and others, all of which con- 
tribute toward a loving appreciation of the small sinner 
who creates the bear that “Alex ist killed his own self,” 
or the small saint who slips off to dreamland with ‘“Wyn- 
ken, Blynken and Nod.” It pays to spend time upon this 
literature, for nothing else will enable one to come so close 
in feeling to the little child. 
YOUR OWN CHILDHOOD 
Every grown-up was a child himself at one time al- 
though many adults. seem to forget this fact. They 
do not remember the day when in pink sunbonnet or 
straw hat they sneaked out of the back door and away 
to the fields or the meadows in search of wild flowers or
-P-A-G-E-21
Tue Stupy or THE CHILD 3 
butterflies or berries, and hence they have no patience 
with the small son or daughter who seeks adventure by 
ways forbidden. They forget when they took apart the 
clock or the music box or velocipede, and the wrath of the 
gods is invoked upon the meddlesome youngster who tries 
this experiment. The grown-up has little sympathy with 
the curiosity and wander-lust of the young, although at 
one time his behavior as well as the behavior of every 
other child showed similar manifestations. It is neces- 
sary to understand in order to deal wisely in checking 
any undesirable act on the part of the child. Many a 
child remembers with bitterness a deserved punishment 
not because of the punishment but because his motive 
was not appreciated. He was gripped by some powerful 
instinct, and his father judged him wilfully disobedient. 
Let us recall our own childhood in the lives of our chil- 
dren and be charitable, while with a firm hand we lead 
the way out of forbidden paths. 
OBSERVATION OF CHILDREN 
Not only should the father and mother study their own 
children but they can gain added insight by watching , 
other children. The street, the cars, the stores, the play- 
grounds and the parks are excellent observation centers. 
There will be points of resemblance and of difference. 
The resemblances will serve to temper any imagined supe- 
riority of one’s own offspring as well as to mitigate any 
exaggerated sense of his depravity. Your child will be 
more understandable as you see him in the light of the 
universal child. A careful observation of other children 
will, however, reveal a multitude of differences. Physical 
differences such as color of hair, stature, shape of hands 
and feet because so evident are easily recognized. The 
great mental differences not so outwardly apparent have 
been a subject for conjecture and have never until quite 
recently been taken seriously or properly considered in

4 ParRENTHOOD AND Cuitp Nurture 
planning a program of education for the child. It has 
required recent psychological tests and experiments to 
reveal the individual differences that do exist as well 
as the cause for these differences in a highly differ- 
entiated nervous mechanism which varies from child to . 
child. We might say that we have one type “man” as 
distinguished from the animals, but within that type, 
although we have several rough divisions as exceptional, 
good, average, fair and poor, there is really an infinite 
shading from one group to another and in every charac- 
teristic and ability possessed by any individual in any 
one of these groups. These variations are of course due 
to different ancestry, race, sex, maturity and training. 
Any child who is markedly different from other children, 
‘slower, keener, with some physical handicap, should be 
taken to a clinical psychologist for examination. Parents 
can often profit immeasurably by such advice, saving 
time, energy and sometimes shipwreck in the home and 
school education. Every child should be considered to 
some extent a separate problem and treated accordingly. 
A note of warning needs to be sounded here, however; 
to be a separate problem does not mean to be a law unto 
himself allowed to develop without proper relation to the 
other members of the family and codperation with them. 
QUALITIES OF THE GOOD OBSERVER 
There are certain qualities that mark the good observer. 
_ The first of these is sympathy. In the presence of an 
unsympathetic person no little child is ever himself, for 
children are keenly sensitive to atmosphere and have an 
almost uncanny power of recognizing their friends. A 
young kindergartner told of the naive conversation which 
her niece of seven had held with a little friend as they 
played with their dolls near the chair where she sat sew- 
ing. She said that the child’s mother was amazed when 
the conversation was repeated to her; she said, “I never
-P-A-G-E-23
Tun Srupy or tHE CurILtp 5 
' hear the children talk like that. They always stop when 
I come around.” The observer should be fair, and un- 
prejudiced either in favor of the child or against him. 
She should have no preconceived notions as to the intel- 
ligence, the temperament or the conduct of the child. She 
must not even permit what she has read in child psycholo- 
gies or child study books to prevent the recognition of 
new truth concerning the individual child or children in 
general. /To be a good observer one needs the ability to 
control self so as not to enter into the situation fully 
enough to lose perspective.’ It is especially difficult for 
parents to extract themselves sufficiently from the inti- 
macy of relationship to the child to see him as other peo- 
ple see him, to stand aside quietly and watch the child 
reveal himself in play and work both alone and with other 
children. They need this comparison in order to appre- 
ciate truly the strong and the weak points of their child. 
Of course most parents err in over-estimating their child, _ 
but a goodly number steadily underestimate; and as ap- 
preciation is one of the greatest factors in development 
the former failing is less likely to injure the child than 
the latter. Not only is self-control essential to the stu- ~ 
dent of childhood but conéentration also and accirate ob- 
servation. In order to understand the development of the 
child in any particular we must follow it painstakingly 
over a period of days or weeks or months or years, whether 
it be the growth of a vocabulary, the acquisition of the 
walking or skipping codrdination, or social responses to 
other children. Moreover, the development of the one 
child needs to be checked up by the development of other 
children. 
  ACCURATE RECORDS OF CHILDREN 
The matter of accurate observation suggests the contri- 
bution which any parent may make to the child study 
movement if he will keep an accurate record of the growth 
  
-P-A-G-E-24
—é#aésasaweeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
6 PARENTHOOD AND Cuitp NurTURE 
of his own child in any particular and will make daily 
notations as he observes changes. He must, however, 
analyze the causes in the condition of the child or in the 
surrounding environment including the people which may 
be responsible for these changes. Such observation lifts 
parenthood out of the drudgery, if it is ever so considered, 
into the interest of a science, for parents may make the 
greatest contributions to the science of child development 
since they have unparalleled opportunities for observation. 
Many of the most valuable contributions up to the pres- 
ent time have been made by parents who are also edu- 
cators. 
PLAN OF THE PRESENT VOLUME 
In this volume it is the plan to aid the study of the 
parent by presenting a summary of the facts of child de- 
velopment during the full period of childhood from birth 
to eleven years. This period has generally been divided 
into four secondary periods; infancy from birth to three 
years of age, early childhood from three to six years, mid- 
dle childhood from six to eight years, and later childhood 
from eight to eleven years. The children within these 
subdivisions have certain characteristics in common which 
make it convenient to classify in this fashion. It must 
be understood, however, that each period overlaps the pre- 
ceding and the following one; and that children within 
these periods differ from one another, as we have said 
before, in every single quality and characteristic, physical 
differences being but an index of mental and moral-social 
differences. In each instance we shall present the phys- 
ical characteristics with their implications as to physical 
needs and possibilities and how to meet them in the home 
education; the instinctive equipment and the opportuni- 
ties there; the mental activity and its guidance; and the 
spontaneous interests which afford the point of attack for 
education. (We shall also add one chapter on the tech-

  Tur Stupy or THE CHILD + 
nique needed by the parent who uses in the home the 
agencies for child development involved in story-telling, 
in music, in the manual arts, and in games and dramatic 
plays. 
While in the study of the developing child the attempt 
is Made to stress physical, mental and moral-social edu- 
cation under separate headings, they are so unified in the 
normal growth of the child that almost every response 
has implications. for all three. For instance the consid- 
eration of fear in the life of the child has a pronounced 
bearing upon his physical, mental, moral-social and re- 
ligious training. If we define religion as a mode of liv- 
ing based upon the standard of Jesus ‘Love the Lord 
your God with all your heart and your neighbor as your- 
self,” then religious education must concern itself with 
the establishment of attitudes, ideals, standards, and 
habits that are moral-social. It will have to do not only 
with the child’s relationship to God but also with his re- 
lationship to God’s creation, chiefly to his fellows. In 
the period of infancy which will be studied first little 
direct religious instruction can be given because as we 
shall see clearly later and as our own observation has 
already witnessed the child is not mentally mature enough 
to receive it. There is, however, as will be pointed out 
from time to time, the opportunity to lay the basis in 
the atmosphere of the home, the attitude of the parents, 
and in the happy experiences of daily living for an abiding 
faith in and love for God when later the concept of God 
may be more fully developed.

SUGGESTIONS FOR ADDITIONAL STUDY 
1. Read such books as Fireside Child Study and Beck- 
onings from Little Hands, by Patterson DuBois, and Mis- 
understood Children, by Elizabeth Harrison, to see how 
much sorrow may come into the happy period of childhood 
because truly loving parents do not understand their children.    
       
    
        
    
     
   2. Compare your own childhood memories with those in 
Part JIT of Child Life in Prose, edited by John G. Whit- 
tier. Mr. Whittier gathered together the early childhood 
memories of such men as Charles Dickens, Hans Andersen, 
Walter Scott and others. How is a study of this sort valuable 
to our children of to-day? 
3. Of what use to both teachers and parents are the mental 
tests which are being given to school children by specialists 
in the subject? Are such tests given in the schools with 
which you are most familiar? Why should such tests never 
be given except by an experienced psychologist? Why must 
the results be accepted with reserve? 
4, Why are the following qualities necessary if one is to 
observe children helpfully: (1) Sympathy, (2) An unbiased 
attitude, (3) Self-control, (4) Power of intense concentra- 
tion, and (5) “Stick-to-itiveness” ?

  CHAPTER II 
EDUCATION IN INFANCY—PHYSICAL 
GROWTH 
Tue first three years of a little child’s life witness a 
development so rapid and wonderful that the observer 
is filled with the marvel of it, watching the transforma- 
tion that proceeds almost moment by moment from utter 
helplessness at birth to the mastery of body possessed 
by the laughing, chattering, bustling three-year-old. 
“Birth,” says one writer, “is the greatest cataclysm in 
human existence. When for the first time the onrush of 
lights, sounds, touches and internal sensations flood the 
being of the babe, the shock is responded to by uncodrdi- 
nated movements of the arms and legs and possibly by 
shrieks and yells. There is, however, accompanying these 
responses only the vaguest and dreamiest sort of con- 
sciousness.” The mind is empty, consciousness is indefi- 
nite, chiefly a sense of pleasure or pain, of satisfaction 
or dissatisfaction. | The child is equipped with a few re- 
flexes necessary to sustain life, such as sucking, swallow- 
ing, movement of bowels and digestive organs, breathing 
and the like, and of course with the possibilities in his 
nervous system for the manifold and more complex move- 
ments of later life.! Little by little his growth proceeds 
until by the end of the first year he has learned to use 
his senses and to control his body in connection. To

tions, has elements of imagination and a growing will. 
He walks now as a rule; plays his first game of peek-a-boo

THE DEMANDS OF GROWTH 
The baby’s body is a sessile organ largely trunk and 
head which must be kept alive by proper food, air, warmth 
and exercise and whose main business is to grow. The 
increase in height and weight during this period is com- 
paratively great and should be continuous. The Child 
Welfare Division of the Bureau of Education has pre- 
pared a chart which shows the normal growth of the 
child; a copy of it should be in the hands of every parent 
and very careful weekly measurements of the infant 
should be taken. Any failure to make the normal in- » 
crease 1s a cause for careful investigation as to the reason, 
while loss of weight should create serious concern. The 
food is most often the reason for the baby’s lack of pro- 
gress; no other food is so well adapted to the needs of 
this organism as the mother’s milk, but of course if the 
mother is ill or worried her milk may be injurious or 
she may have no milk at all for the child. In this 
event other food must be substituted and should be 
used under the advice of a physician who is if possible 
a child specialist. The Child Welfare Division of the 
Bureau of Education stands ¥% o-advise parents who 
cannot secure thé services of such a “physician. There 
must be fresh air in the room at all times and air must 
be free from dust or other impurities, must be moving, 
moist and warm to give the best results. If furnace 
or hot water heat is used it is well to have the water 
pans for attachment to the radiators or an arrangement 
in the furnace which secures properly moistened air. 
Baby must also have exercise, and this means with the 
small child the arms and limbs left free so that the 
7] 
ae

child may stretch and kick and wave the arms freely. 
A few simple devices may be used by the mother to 
strengthen the child. He may be allowed to kick against 
a newspaper, and will greatly enjoy the rattling sound 
as well as the slight opposition to effort. The mother 
may also encourage kicking or pressing the feet against 
her hands offered as an obstacle. A little later the baby 
likes to pull himself up by his mother’s hands, and he also 
hikes the slight fall which occurs when she lets go and he 
sinks backward. 
CONTROL OF THE SENSES 
Along with the development of the body, which consists 
in getting control of the arms, legs, hands, feet and whole 
body, so that in time the child sits up, creeps, walks, runs, 
climbs, jumps and races, there goes the development in 
the use of the senses. The child gradually pays attention 
to the impressions gained through touch, taste, smell, sight 
and hearing. During the first month the baby moves his 
head and seems to follow bright objects, he is sensitive 
to jars rather than noises, he smiles in response to touch. 
During the second month he moves in order to peer about, 
he is frightened by hearing all sorts of sounds, he may be 
sensitive to rhythm. During the third month his fingers 
erow more active; there is a busy grasping; he searches 
with his eyes and tries to sit up to see better. During the 
fourth month he reaches for things and notices changes 
in the room. The fifth month opens the era for handling 
things. He prefers bright objects and begins to dis- 
tinguish faces. Then about the sixth month there comes 
the transition from learning to use the senses to learning 
to use the body, training it to respond with quickness and 
accuracy to sense impressions. Of course the time for 
this development varies with different babies so that what 
has been given is only an approximate schedule.

SENSE AND MOVEMENT PLAY. 
Luella Palmer in her book, Play Life in the First Eight 
Years, gives many fine suggestions gleaned from a variety 
of sources as to how the parents may aid the sense and 
movement development of the child during these years. 
In the first yéar toys may be given the baby to feel and 
to handle, such as a soft rubber ball, a hard celluloid 
ball, a bright-colored woolen ball suspended from the top 
of the baby carriage. While the child should have the | 
opportunity to investigate objects with the sensitive little 
mouth, no object like a pacifier should be continually in 
the mouth. Such pacifiers are unsanitary as a rule, they 
spoil the shape of thé=baby’s-mouth, causing malforma- 
+ion; “and are responsible for badly formed teeth later, 
and they are not good for the digestion, causing a constant 
flow of saliva. A bright object, such as a candle or a 
shiny ornament, may be used to develop attention, as well 
as tones struck on the piano or some other musical in- 
strument. Baby very much enjoys too his own pounding 
plays after he can manipulate a spoon on a tin pan or 
a plate. With the sense play, movement play also such 
as the kicking exercises may be used. Throwing the 
arms and the whole body will give great joy, and throw- 
ing objects from the chair or carriage. The mother may 
use little chanting rimes as baby performs these move- 
ments such as “up-down, up-down,” “‘here-there, here- 
there.” | 
~In the second year, when the child walks and is there- 
fore able to take himself to objects which he proceeds , 
to handle, his field of investigation is greatly widened. 
Miss Palmer suggests supplying him with soft, hard and 
‘colored balls, with a gong and hammer, bottles in which 
he may put objects such as stones or wooden beads, news- 
paper for tearing and other homely occupations not too 
difficult for baby manipulation. In movement he needs 
a pair of stairs to climb, he likes the tossing and balancing 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
14 ParRENTHOOD AND CHILD NURTURE 
plays to which father subjects him, and he hustles about 
continually himself as the year progresses. or the third 
year words are beginning to be used by this little child 
to clarify sense impressions of which there should still 
be a rich supply. Balls and blocks are the only special 
playthings needed with an ample number of home ma- 
terials which the child finds in the kitchen, the back yard 
and in fact everywhere he goes. This child walks, runs, 
climbs and jumps most of his waking hours, in fact is 
ceaselessly busy. 
This brief picture of the natural physical development 
and how it may be aided in these years is perhaps suffi- 
cient to suggest the cruelty of tying a child, putting him 
for hours in a high chair or penned in a go-cart, shutting 
him away from stairs, placing him in a narrow enclosure 
with little or nothing to investigate. The result of such 
treatment will be physical weakness in comparison with 
the strength that might have been attained; the formation 
of bad habits in handling the body, for the saying, “Satan 
finds mischief for idle hands to do,” is literally true here; 
and a mental retardation of which we will speak later. 
During all of this period the larger muscles of the arms, 
legs and torso are the ones to be exercised mainly instead 
of the finer codrdinations of hands and fingers sometimes 
chiefly provided for by the child’s play-materials. 
DANGER OF MALFORMATIONS 
The bones of the young child’s body are very plastic 
indeed, and there must be great care during all of this 
period that malformations do not occur such as bow-legs, 
knock-knees, and spinal curvatures. The story is told of 
an investigation made in a clinic in one of our larger 
cities as to why the children of one of the foreign national- 
ities were found to have an outward curvature of one 
side of the body with a higher shoulder. It was discovered 
that this malformation was due to the way the mothers 
   
-P-A-G-E-33
  EpvucaATION IN INFANOY 15 
carried the infants about as they worked, holding them 
in a peculiar fashion at one side of the body. The child 
should have a chair, carriage or go-cart so built as to meet 
the needs of his small body and provide the right sitting 
position. He should learn early to sit back in his chair, 
with feet squarely on the floor, and with back well sup- 
ported against the broad piece at the back of the chair. 
The seat of the chair should be curved to fit the shape 
of the child’s body and should be large enough to hold 
him comfortably. He should be taught to take a pride 
in his own furniture selected to give him satisfaction and 
to be used by him. 
SENSITIVITY OF THE BODY 
The body of the child_at this time is very sensitive to 
changes of heat and cold, so that Ne wMust be protected 
“against thesé by proper clothing and care. Little children 
of this age are not infrequently met on the street on a 
cold morning in the fall or winter with the tears rolling 
down the face, so greatly do they feel the change of tem- 
perature if not properly dressed to meet it. This child 
is also very susceptible to contagions such as whooping 
cough, measles and the like, and some of these contagions 
reap a veritable harvest. If the child survives he is often 
left with a physical weakness that he does not outgrow 
sometimes in years. For this reason small children and 
infants should be protected from contagions as far as 
possible. No child or grown person with a cold or cough 
ought to be near them. The little child who has a sturdy 
body well nourished is of course much more likely to 
be immune from disease than the one who does not have 
the same resistance. The digestive organs are also very 
easily upset, and malnutrition in these years often has 
serious consequences, mentally as well as_ physically. 
When the child begins to have other food than the mother’s 
milk his diet should be judiciously planned and super-
-P-A-G-E-34
  16 PaRENTHOOD AND CutItp NurturRE 
vised. Menus for the different ages may be secured from 
the Bureau of Child Welfare mentioned before. Confec- 
tions, candy in particular, and meats should never be 
included. 
The child at this age is easily fatigued, his reserve of 
energy being slight. The nervous balance is quickly upset. 
Therefore all plays should be sufficiently stimulating but 
not over-exciting. Older children often play with the baby 
until he laughs and crows hilariously or the father tosses 
and tumbles the two-year-old until hysterics result. Some- 
times the child cries after such excitement, at other times 
he.is cross and irritable and cannot sleep. Excursions to 
crowded shops, visits in the homes of relatives, the admi- 
ration and fondling of guests very often contribute to the 
same undesirable condition. <A quiet, happy environment 
for this child will conduce to a nervous poise later that 
is to be greatly coveted for him. An abundance of sleep 
is required during all these years. The baby who has his 
regular naps during the day and sleeps twelve hours at 
night is fortunate. 
   
-P-A-G-E-35
    SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY 
1. Make accurate observation for a definite period of the 
physical development of a child under three years of age— 
note the exact age of the child in days or weeks and compare 
your observations with those of Professor Dearborn (Moto- 
Sensory Development) and with the chart for normal develop- 
ment of infants which will be sent to you upon request by the 
Child Welfare Division of the Bureau of Education ( Wash- 
ington, D. C.). 
2. Observe a child for as short a period as ten minutes 
and notice how many bodily movements he makes. Why is 
a normal child very active? How should he be clothed? 
3. Observe the methods a little child takes in getting ac- 
quainted with a new object—manipulation of various sorts, 
tasting, smelling, seeing, hearing. He naturally puts every- 
thing into his mouth. What does this suggest as to the type 
of objects that he be allowed to investigate? What very 
serious injury may be done by giving a baby a pacifier? 
4. Study the playthings of a little child and a“ ac- 
cording to value in his development. 
5. What sort of games may a mother play with the infant 
which will really aid him in his physical growth? Is there 
ever danger of too much “Mother play”? 
6. A very healthy-looking baby was seen on the street car 
with its parents at seven o’clock in the evening. It was 
passed frequently from one to the other. It fretted, and sev- 
eral times cried tempestuously. What may have been the 
cause or causes? 
%. An infant of eighteen months was “pigeon-toed” and 
“knock-kneed.” How could this condition be remedied ? 
17

8. Do you agree with the theory of the parent who inten- 
tionally exposes his child to contagious diseases? Why or 
why not?

    CHAPTER III 
INSTINCTIVE EQUIPMENT IN INFANCY 
Two factors working with a third commonly termed 
self-activity determine what the child shall become. These 
two factors are heredity and environment. Heredity not 
only comprises family inheritance but the age-long- in- 
heritance of race dating back to primitive man, and, if 
we agree with Darwin, to lower forms of life from which 
the higher have evolved. This inheritance of original 
nature has been variously captioned by such names as 
reflexes, impulses, instincts, tendencies and capacities. 
Thorndike in Volume 1 of his Educational Psychology, 
Chapter 2, gives the following very helpful distinction 
between these terms, ‘‘When the tendency concerns a very 
definite and uniform response to a very simple sensory 
situation, and when the connection between the situation 
and the response is very hard to modify and is also very 
strong so that it is almost inevitable, the connection or 
response to which it leads is called a reflex. Thus the 
knee-jerk is a very definite and uniform response to the 
simple sense-stimulus of sudden hard pressure against a 
certain spot. It is hard to lessen, to increase, or other- 
wise control the movement, and, given the situation, the 
response almost always comes. When the response is more 
indefinite, the situation more complex, and the connection 
more modifiable, instinct becomes the customary term. 
Thus one’s misery at being scorned is too indefinite a 
response to too complex a situation and is too easily modi- 
fiable to be called a reflex. When the tendency is to an 
extremely indefinite response or set of responses to a very 
complex situation, and when the connection’s final degree 
19
-P-A-G-E-38
20 PaRENTHOOD AND Curtp Nurture 
of strength is commonly due to very large contributions 
of training, it has seemed more appropriate to replace 
reflex and instinct by some term like capacity, or ten- 
dency or potentiality. Thus an original tendency to re- 
spond to the cireumstances of school education by achieve- 
ment in learning the arts and sciences is called the capacity 
for scholarship.” Then Thorndike continues with the 
statement that there is no gap between reflexes, instincts 
and tendencies and that it is impossible therefore to make 
hard and fast distinctions. It is more useful and more 
scientific to avoid such distinctions in thought, since in 
fact there is a continuous gradation. 
In our consideration of the instinctive equipment in 
childhood as a basis for educational procedure we shall 
therefore not attempt to use distinguishing terms but have 
in mind only the contribution of original nature as the 
starting point. Upon this foundation supplied by hered- 
ity is erected the superstructure of learning. Education 
is an interacting process by means of the contacts between 
the nature of the child and the environing influences. 
Walt Whitman in poetic form very beautifully voices 
the importance of the second factor in this process: 
“There was a child went forth every day, 
And the first object he looked upon, and received 
With wonder, pity, love or dread, 
That object he became. 
And that object became part of him for the day, 
For a certain part of the day, or for many years, 
Or stretching cycles of years.” 
The actual process of education is engaged in perpetuating 
some of the original connections, eliminating some and in 
modifying and re-directing others. To quote from Thorn- 
dike again: “They are perpetuated by providing stimuli 
adequate to arouse them and give them exercise, and by 
associating satisfaction with their action. They are elimi- 
nated by withholding stimuli, so that they disappear 
through disuse, or by associating discomfort with their
-P-A-G-E-39
INSTINCTIVE EqurepMEeNnT IN INFANCY 21 
action. They are re-directed by substituting another re- 
sponse for the undesirable original one or by attaching the 
original response to another situation with which it works 
less or no harm or even positive good.” It is our purpose 
to suggest very simply and definitely some of the ways 
in which the parent may codperate in this process of 
education. 
FEEDING 
Feeding is a dominant instinct from the beginning of 
difes” Not only should wholesome food be supplied suited 
to the needs of the developing organism but this food should 
be given at regular intervals, allowing sufficient time for 
digestion between feedings. ‘The dangerous habit of 
“piecing” or of eating continuously is often formed before 
three years of age. For the future as well as the present 
welfare of the child such a habit is to be avoided. It is 
not alone the physical health that is involved but the con- 
trol of an appetite, which makes for moral strength. 
Many a life has been wrecked later through the intem- 
perate use of some article of food, narcotics or intoxicants 
because the basis for such weakness was laid in the early 
years in the failure to develop right and regular habits 
of eating. The enjoyment of food by the child is de- 
sirable, and he should be in a happy and contented mood 
when eating. If possible he should not be irritated or 
frightened and he should be encouraged to eat without 
haste, taking only a small amount of food in the mouth 
at a time. These habits will conduce to good digestion 
and will conserve nervous strength. Habits of proper 
social response when eating can be cultivated as soon as 
the child takes his food at the table with other members 
of the family. He can learn to wait patiently for his turn 
to be served, although the control of the little child must 
not be overstrained. He learns not to attempt speech 
with a mouth otherwise employed and to use correctly 
the spoon and in progressive series the other table appoint-

ments. There is no need for a little child to be a boor 
simply because he is little. If rightly approached he will 
take pride in mastering one by one the essentials of. good 
breeding. Such training is a part of his moral-social 
equipment, and if acquired early these habits will persist 
and will make him the more welcome in any social group. 
The child, because he enjoys eating, considers his food 
one of his greatest blessing’s;and_food is one of the first 
things for which a child spontaneously expresses gratitude 
to his parents and later to God. The grace which is said 
before each meal in the Christian home impresses the 
~ young child very much, and very soon he learns to par- 
_ ticipate by saying “Thank you, Heavenly Father, for this 
"food. ” His earliest prayers may thus be connected with 
the Roomy act of feeding. Jack’s little head was always 
b ie ad apnie his father said the blessing before each meal. 
$ particular day Jack had slept during the dinner 
cur 8 and consequently had to eat alone. His mother 
‘him in his high chair, and as soon as his food 
afore him, he bowed his head. He did not say 
+ ord, 1, but his mother, observing the act, repeated a verse 
for him. As soon as she had finished he raised 
1 and started to eat his dinner. Jack was only 
a half years of age when this incident occurred.      
    
    
   
     ACTIVITY 
- The most noticeable fact about infancy is the ceaseless 
movement. Even as the child lies asleep there are some 
twitchings of the limbs. Every movement is in response 
to a stimulus from some inner bodily state or from some 
outer condition. Touch, sight, sound, taste, smell,—all 
bring their quota of sensations arousing the organism to 
response. Every stimulus tends to be immediately fol- 
_ lowed by movement. When this movement of the baby 
“finds the check of the sides of the crib, of mother’s hand 
_or of the rubber ball, there is a fresh stimulus to activity. 
ie.

InstincTIvE Equipment In INFANCY 23 
The child grasps with the hand the opposing object or 
presses more strenuously against it. There is no purpose 
in this pursuit at first but if the performance be repeated 
time after time gradually a set habit of reaction to the 
particular situation is built up. There is an appearance 
of purpose on the baby’s part so quickly does he pursue 
the usual course of action on presentation of the stimulus, 
just as the dog who has learned to jump for his food 
begins the performance when he sees the master with meat 
in hand. In this very wonderful provision of movement 
in response to stimulus, a continuous reaction of the or- 
ganism to environing conditions, lies the possibility of 
education. Not only, as Bolton asserts, the entire brain 
and nervous system suffer if motor activity is lacking 
during the growing period; but the provision for abun- 
dant and fruitful activity through an environment rich » 
in things for the investigation of the senses and the testing. © 
of muscular control, affords the opportunity for devel 
ing future mental power. Suitable playthings, pets, 
plants, household articles and simple apparatus should 
be supplied in every child’s home. As we will show later, 
clear imagery is gained through the sense perceptions de- © 
pendent upon motor activity, and keen thinking requires — 
clear imagery. Activity characterizes all the life of the — 
child and play characterizes his activity. The little child 
has in all that he does the play attitude. His goals are 
inherent in the activity itself; the joy of doing is his 
sufficient reward. He chases the butterfly not for the 
sake of possessing the butterfly but for the fun of chasing.

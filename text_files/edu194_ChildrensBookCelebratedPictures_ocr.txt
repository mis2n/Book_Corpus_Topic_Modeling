Dear Children: 
The stories I am telling about the pictures and their painters in 
this book are gathered from many countries. Some of them be- 
long to very early times when history was told to grown up people 
by story-tellers at banquets and in the homes, on the street corners 
and public halls. Some of the stories are legends and traditions 
that grew up with the beginnings of the Christian era. All of 
them are taken from authentic sources and many of them illustrate 
some natural law. 
The artists who painted these pictures knew history and the 
early myths, the fairy-tales, the legends and the traditions, the 
Bible and the Apocrypha. We love these pictures because they 
are beautiful and true, but really to understand them we must 
know what the artists had in mind when they painted them. 
If you learn to know these pictures and love them, I will make 
you another book soon about statues and their stories. 
With love and best wishes, from your friend, 
Lorrnpa Munson Bryant

  THE HOLY FAMILY 
BERNARDINO PrntoriccHIo (1454-1513) 
N looking at pictures of the old masters you will often see one 
called the “Holy Family.” I want you to know who be- 
to the Holy Family. The grown people are Joseph 
e father and mother of Jesus; they had no last names 
e. The children are Jesus and his cousin, John the 
Baptist, six months older than Jesus. Sometimes the little John’s 
mother, Elizabeth, is in the picture and sometimes his father, 
Zacharias, is there also. 
In this picture painted by Pintoricchio, Jesus is about four 
years old and John four and a half. The Bible story gives very 
little about the growing up of these children. Of Jesus it says, 
“And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wis- 
dom; and the grace of God was upon him.’”’ And of John it says, 
“And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and he was in 
the deserts till the day of showing unto Israel.” 
One story from a very old book, “The Infancy,” tells about 
Jesus playing with the other boys. It says: 
“And when Jesus was seven years of age, he was on a certain 
day with other boys, his companions about the same age. Who 
when they were at play, made clay into several shapes, namely, 
asses, oxen, birds, and other figures, each boasting of his work, en- 
deavoring to exceed the rest. 
“Then the Lord Jesus said to the boys, I will command these 
figures which I have made to walk. And immediately they 
moved, and when he commanded them to return they returned. 
He also made figures of birds and sparrows, which, when he com- 
manded to fly, did fly, and when he commanded to stand still, did 
stand still; and if he gave them meat and drink, they did eat and 
drink.”

  THE VALLEY FARM 
JoHn ConstaBLe (1776-1837) 
‘ N old man, eighty-four years of age, lived in this house 
‘ on “The Valley Farm,” in England. He was born here 
ie and he used to say that he had never been away from 
this house but four days in all his life. He asked Constable to 
come and paint a picture of his home.} And what a beautiful 
picture itis! The old house, snuggled down so close to the little 
stream, could paddle its feet—if it had any—in the cool water. 
And see how tenderly the tall trees keep guard over it. How we 
wish that we could be there too! If only we could be in the punt 
—I am sure it is a punt-boat even if one end of it is pointed— 
and be rowed up and down in the delightful shade. Those two 
in the boat have no doubt been for the cows and are driving them 
home to be milked. k 
\’ John Constable liked to choose his subjects for his pictures from 
the familiar scenes near his home. He used to say to his friends: 
“T have always succeeded best with my native scenes. They 
have always charmed me)Nand I hope they always will.”

  THE MADONNA AND CHILD WITH 
ST. JEROME 
ANTONIO ALLEGRI DA Correccio (1494?-1534) 
beautiful women and splendid men. In this picture of 
“the Madonna and St. Jerome,” I want you specially to 
see St. Jerome and his lion. St. Jerome, a very noted man who 
lived four centuries after Christ, was the first person to translate 
the New Testament into Latin. It was called “The Vulgate,” 
because of its common use in the Latin Church. 
When St. Jerome was thirty years old he went away from the 
city of Rome and became a hermit and lived in desert places in 
the East. One day, so the story goes, as he sat at the gate of the 
monastery a lion came up limping as though he had been hurt. 
The other hermits ran away but St. Jerome went to meet the lion. 
The lion lifted up his paw and St. Jerome found a thorn in his 
foot. He took out the thorn and bound up the poor paw, so the 
lion stayed with St. Jerome and kept guard over an ass that 
brought the wood from the forest. 
One day when the lion was asleep a caravan of merchants came 
along and stole the ass. The poor ashamed lion hung his head 
before the saint, and Jerome thought he had killed and eaten the 
ass. To punish him St. Jerome had him do the work of the ass 
and bring the wood from the forest. One day some time after- 
ward the lion saw the ass coming down the road leading a caravan 
of camels. The Arabs often have an ass lead the camels. The 
lion knew that it was the stolen ass, so he led the caravan into the 
convent grounds. The merchant found that he was caught. St. 
Jerome was very glad to find that his lion was honest and true. 
Whenever you see a picture of a saint with a lion you must remem- 
ber that it is St. Jerome, the great Latin scholar.

    THE WOOD GATHERERS 
Jean Baptiste CAMILLE Coror (1796-1875) 
It is the last picture Corot signed after he was confined to 
the bed, a few days before he died. 
A curious story is told of Corot’s painting this picture. He 
had an old study of another artist’s of a landscape with St. Jerome 
at prayer: you remember I told you the story of St. Jerome and 
his lion. Corot took the study and made a number of sketches of 
it. Somehow his landscape would not fit St. Jerome, so he painted 
a man on horseback and a dog going off into the woods. Then 
in the place of St. Jerome praying he put a woman gathering bits 
of wood and another woman with a bundle of fagots under her 
arm. Now the picture must have another name and he called it 
“The Wood Gatherers.” When you go to Washington, you must 
not fail to see this picture in the Corcoran Art Gallery. T picture of “The Wood Gatherers” is very precious to us.

  AURORA 
Gumwo Reni (1575-1642) 
YPERION had three wonderful children, Apollo, the 
H god of the sun, Selene, the goddess of the moon, and 
Aurora, the goddess of the dawn. When Aurora ap- 
pears her sister, Selene (the moon), fades and night rolls back like 
a curtain. Now let us look at this masterpiece by Guido Reni care- 
fully that we may know how wonderful is the coming of day. 
Aurora, in a filmy white robe, is dropping flowers in the path 
of Apollo (the sun) as he drives his dun-colored horses above the 
sleeping Earth. The Hore (the hours), a gliding, dancing 
group of lovely beings, accompany the brilliant god. Each hour 
is clothed in garments of a special tint of the great light of day, 
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and violet. The golden- 
hued Apollo sits supreme in his chariot of the sun. 
The fresco—fresco means painted on fresh plaster—is on the 
ceiling of the Rospigliosi Palace, Rome. ‘The painting is as bril- 
liant in color to-day as it was when painted three hundred and 
fifty years ago. 
Aurora, like most of the gods and goddesses, fell in love with a 
mortal. She asked Zeus to make her husband immortal but she 
forgot to ask that he should never grow old. And, fickle woman 
that she was! when he became gray and infirm, she deserted him 
and, to put a stop to his groans, she turned him into a grass- 
hopper. 
Her son, Memnon, was made king of the Ethiopians, and in 
the war of Troy he was overcome by Achilles. When Aurora, who 
was watching him from the sky, saw him fall she sent his brothers, 
the Winds, to take his body to the banks of a river in Asia Minor. 
In the evening the mother and the Hours and the Pleiades came 
to weep over her dead son. Poor Aurora! even to-day her tears 
are seen in the dewdrops on the grass at early dawn.

the street or in some back yard just as singers do to-day, 
though they lived nearly three hundred years ago. 
Hals was such a rapid painter that he could make a picture 
while you wait. The story is told that one time young Van Dyck, 
the Flemish painter who painted “Baby Stuart,” went to see Hals 
in Amsterdam when Hals was an oldman. Van Dyck did not tell 
the old artist that he was Van Dyck but simply asked him to paint 
his portrait, knowing what a rapid painter Hals was. In an hour 
the picture was done. Van Dyck remarked, as he looked at the 
portrait: I 
“That seems easy; I believe I could do it.” 
Hals thought he would have some fun, so he told the young 
stranger that he would sit for him just one hour. 
Van Dyck set his easel where Hals could not see him work and 
began to paint. At the end of an hour he said: 
“Your picture is finished, sir.’ 
Hals, ready to laugh at the daub, looked at the portrait and the 
laugh went out of his face. He then looked at Van Dyck, and 
cried out: 
“You must be either Van Dyck or a wizard!” 
You see, Hals had-heard of Van Dyck and his rapid work, and 
knew that only a master painter could make the splendid portrait [Mee jolly singers are Dutch boys. They are singing on

    ST. BARBARA 
Jacopo Parma IL VeccHIo (1480?-1528) 
ler father, an eastern nobleman, loved her so much fand 
was so afraid something might happen to her that he built 
a very wonderful tower for her home and shut her up in it. And 
in that tower she studied the stars. Night after night she looked 
at the heavenly bodies until she knew more about the sun and the 
moon and the stars than any of the learned men. But as) she 
studied the shining bodies she decided that worshiping idols, 7s S: BARBARA, born a. p. 303, was a very beautiful girl. 
of wood and stone, as her father did, was wrong. Finally) she 
learned about the Savior, and to show her faith in Christianity 
she had some workmen who were making repairs on her towey put 
in three windows. When her father came as usual to visit het, he 
asked in surprise what the three windows were for. She oes 
“Know, my father, that through three windows doth the soul re- 
ceive light, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost: and folie 
are one.” 
Her father was very angry when he found she had learned about 
the Savior and had become a Christian. He condemned her to 
death and at last took her out on a hill and-killed her, but he} too, 
was struck dead. St. Barbara is always represented with a tower 
that has three windows in it. 
Palma Vecchio painted this picture for some Venetian soldiers 
nearly four hundred years ago. When the Germans bombarded 
Venice (1918) the Venetians took the picture from the church to 
a place of safety. Scarcely a week had passed before a bomb 
broke through the roof of the church tearing everything before it 
at the exact spot where the picture had hung. But “St. Barbara,” 
one of the great pictures of the world, was safe.

  CHARLES I AND HIS HORSE 
Stir ANTHONY VAN Dyck (1599-1641) 
Rubens gave to Van Dyck. It is said that Rubens gaye it 
as a present after Van Dyck had painted a portrait of 
Helena Fourment, the master’s second wife, and presented it to 
him. Van Dyck was twenty-two years younger than Rubens. 
You will remember that he was the master painter’s favorite pupil. 
Having Rubens as a teacher did not make the pupil a great painter. 
Van Dyck was never more than a prince; just an heir to the throne. 
Rubens was a king and sat on the throne. 
The story is told that once Rubens was away from his private 
studio when the students bribed the servant to open the doon for 
them. They stole into the master’s studio to see “The Descent 
from the Cross,” which he was then painting. By some mishap 
the culprits rubbed against the wet paint and spoiled that i of 
the picture. Of course they were terrified at the damage done. 
They finally decided that Van Dyck was the one to repair the spot. 
The work was so well done that they hoped Rubens would mi see 
the repairs. But the first thing that caught the eye of the master 
was that particular spot. He at once sent for the students /and 
asked who had worked on his picture. Van Dyck stepped out from 
the others and frankly confessed that he was the culprit. Rubens 
was so pleased with his frankness and also at the skill of the work 
that he forgave them all. 
King Charles I invited Van Dyck to come to England, and jthen 
he knighted him and gave him a pension for life. The hundreds 
of pictures of the royal family and court people of England left 
bv Van Dyck show us how rapidly he could paint, for the artist 
died when he was only forty-two years old. [X« horse in this picture of Charles I is probably the|one

THE GALE 
WINsLtow HoMeEr (1836-1910) 
INSLOW HOMER lived in Maine, where he heard 
the roar of mighty waters beating the rocks all lay 
and all night. Some days the ocean grew so angry 
" le because the winds whirled its waters about in such a cruel ma 
that it would fling itself upon the sands and rocks as though to er 
‘ar 
everything to pieces. The waves would raise up like furious horses 
champing their bits and foaming at the mouth. Somehow these 
angry waves could never go beyond a certain point, and the mot ner 
carrying her baby along the coast knows just the point at which 
the waves must stop. Let us clap our hands and shout with joy 
that old ocean cannot hurt that mother and her baby. Fill 
your lungs full of that glorious breeze whipping their hair and 
clothes. Open your eyes wide like the baby and let the salt 
polish them until they sparkle like diamonds as the baby’s do. air 
Winslow Homer loved old ocean, and so do we! Let us love 
his pictures of old ocean for he has taught us that that mighty 
power is under a greater Power.

  MADONNA DEL GRAN’ DUCA 
RAPHAEL SANZIO (1483-1520) 
was so kind and gentle and beautiful that everybody loved 
him. People said that when he walked on the streets| of 
Rome scores of young men went with him until one would think 
him a prince. The pope gave him a large order to decorate |the 
Vatican, the pope’s home. Every artist was willing to help him|be- 
cause he was always ready to do anything he could to help |his 
brother artists. 
Raphael only lived to be thirty-seven. When he died all Italy 
mourned his death, and his funeral was one of the largest of any 
artist of his time. 
When Raphael was only twenty-one he painted the “Madonna 
del Gran’ Duca.” He had gone to Florence for the first time. 
We do not know where the picture was for a hundred years after 
it was painted; then the painter Carlo Dolci owned it. Again 
another hundred years went by, and we find it in possession of 
a poor widow. She sold it to a picture-dealer for about twenty 
dollars. It then went into the hands of the grand duke of Tlus- 
cany, Ferdinand III, for the big sum of eight hundred dollars. 
No amount of money could buy the picture to-day. 
Ferdinand loved the picture so much that he always took it with 
him on all his travels and the grand duchess, his wife, felt that 
her baby boys were purer if she had the picture near her. It |got 
its name “Madonna of the Grand Duke” from the title of |the 
family. I WANT you to learn everything you can about Raphael. |He

    JOAN OF ARC 
Jutes Bastien-LEPAGE (1848-1884) 
O young girl in history has had such a wonderful story as 
N Joan of Arc. She began to hear voices and see visions 
when she was a little child. She was born in the |tiny 
village of Domremy, France. Just like the other little peasant 
girls around her she helped her mother about the house and A 
spinning. Also she went into the fields with her brothers. the 
One day when she was in the garden the Archangel St. Michael 
came to her in a glory of light. He said she was a good little girl 
and that she must go to church and that some day she was to 
great act; she was to crown the dauphin as king of Fran 
Rheims. Joan was afraid and cried at what the angel told

over. No prince in the land had more magnificent h TT: stables of Peter Paul Rubens were known the ao 
rses, 
and no cavalier could ride with more grace and ease than 
Rubens. 
When Van Dyck, the artist who painted “Baby Stuart,’ was 
- ready to leave the studio of Rubens to travel in Italy, the master 
gave him a beautiful horse from his own stables. Van Dyc 
bably used this horse as a model in his picture of “Charles I 
his Horse.” pro- 
and 
Now look at Rubéns on the splendid dappled white horse in 
“The Fox and Wolf Hunt.” His first wife, Isabel Brant, |i 
his right hand. She carries her falcon balanced on her wrist s on 
, his 
wings spread out in excitement. We feel that Rubens and his 
horse together are directing every movement in the hunt. | That 
horse has all the alertness of the trained dogs and is just as|/eager 
in overcoming brute force as men are. In fact we are so [fasci- 
nated with his beauty and intelligence that the cruel sport is al- 
most forgotten in our interest in him and his master. 
Rubens painted a number of hunting scenes, and alwalys he 
manages the hunt with the skill of a master. The confusion of 
the rough-and-tumble fight between the wild beasts and the ae 
dogs, and men in Rubens’ pictures seems to untangle itself nder 
his glorious color and skilful arrangement. This is a picture 
you must see. When you go to New York City never fail t

THE NIGHT WATCH

  little children living in Amsterdam were playing at the (): time, more than two hundred and fifty years ago, two

some Spanish soldiers near-by talking together. They beg 
understand that the men were making some kind of plans neard

some one about it at once. Very quietly they crept away 
where the men were, then ran for their lives to the town hall. from 
The 
Civic Guard were having a banquet there. Rembrandt has pajinted 
the scene just as the little girl, in the center of the group has 
finished her story. The men are making ready to meet the ihisee 
Some have on their armor, some are polishing their guns, 
have their drums, and all are full of excitement. 
When the painting was to be put in the new Ryks some 
Mu-

for the picture. What do you think the authorities did? 
stupid men cut a piece off from each side of the picture to fit it

The men who had money at the time Rembrandt painted the 
picture were angry because the artist would not make portraits as 
they wanted them. They ignored Rembrandt, and he became very 
poor and died unknown. To-day those rich men are forgotten 
and Rembrandt is known the world over.

  THE MELON EATERS 
BARTOLOME EsTEBAN MurRILLO (1618-1682) 
HEN the Spanish artist Murillo was a young painter 
\ \) he was very poor and hardly knew where to (get 
enough to eat. He would go to the market-place 
and set up his easel and rapidly paint the scenes around him. 
The people who came to the market to buy and sell saw these 
pictures and bought them for a mere pittance. 
Often beggar boys, who were everywhere in the market snatch- 
ing fruits and other eatables from the stalls, would pose for him 
as they hid in some corner to eat their stolen dainties. These 
beggar-boy pictures that Murillo sold for a song to keep his soul 
and body together began to attract attention until finally they 
were looked upon as the greatest pictures Murillo ever painted. 
People outside of Spain, Murillo’s native country, bought them 
until to-day scarcely a beggar-boy picture of his is found in Spain. 
This picture of “The Melon Eaters” is known far and wide as 
a great masterpiece, and yet the boys were little rag-a-muffins, the 
pests of the market people. Murillo knew the joys and sorrows 
of those boys because he too at that time was very poor and hans 
and no one was giving him a helping hand. Do you suppose that 
when he was famous as a painter he ever saw those boys? I think 
so, for he was greatly beloved by his townspeople of Seville. 
They probably came to his studio many times. Murillo painited 
many religious pictures for the churches of Seville.

  THE MUSES 
GriuLto Romano (1492-1546) 
of Raphael’s, has left us this beautiful picture of them danc- 
ing with Apollo, their cousin. The Muses were /|the 
daughters of Zeus (Jove or Jupiter), and Memory. These loyely 
girls also come to every home to help care for the new baby. 
The Greek names of the Muses are rather hard to pronounce, 
but you will want to call them by name. Then, too, each girl’s 
name in Greek letters is just below where she dances. Now begin 
at the left of the circle. The first one, Calliope, stands for nar- 
rative poetry; No. 2, Clio, is history; No. 3, Erato, is love-poetry; 
No. 4, Melpomene, is tragedy; No. 5, Terpsichore, is dance tnd 
song. Now comes Apollo with his quiver full of arrows. Hee is 
the god of the hunt and twin brother to Diana, the goddess of hunt; 
also he is god of music and poetry. No. 6 is Polyhymnia, muse of 
hymn-music; No. 7, Euterpe, is song poetry; No. 8, Thalia, is 
comedy, and No. 9, Urania, muse of astronomy. 
Athene gave the Muses the winged horse, Pegasus. But “9 [= sure you have heard of the Muses. Romano, a pupil 
and alas! one of the poets became very poor and sold Pegasus to 
a farmer. He was fastened to the plow, but he could not plow 
through the hard earth. His spirit was broken and his body jwas 
weak. The angry farmer tried to make him work, but how could 
he when he had no courage? But just then a beautiful youth 
came and asked the farmer to let him try the horse. Of course 
the man was glad to have any one help get the plowing done. [The 
young man petted the horse and slyly unfastened the harness ai he 
patted him. He mounted upon his back and Pegasus rose in| the 
air, and away they both went, Pegasus and Mercury. The farmer 
looked on with amazement. How could a good-for-nothing hiorse 
that could not plow do such a wonderful thing as fly?

  “COME, ABIDE WITH US” 
Fra GIOVANNI ANGELICO (1387-1455) 
EARLY two thousand years ago two men were walking 
\ | together along a dusty road in Palestine. They talked 
earnestly as they walked along of a great event that |had 
happened. A man called Jesus, the Christ, had been cruc fied 
and buried, but after three days he was not found in the tomb. 
As the men talked, a traveler joined them and asked: 
“What is it ye talk about and are sad?” 
And the men asked if he were a stranger in Jerusalem and 
not know the things that had come to pass. 
The stranger said, ‘““What things?” 
Then the men told him of Jesus of Nazareth, which was ee 
phet mighty in deed and word before God and all the pe 
And they said that they had all hoped He was the mighty 
who was to save the world but that He had been killed. 
Then the stranger, who was Jesus himself, but the men did did 
ple. 
one 
not 
know Him, began to tell them the story of all things about him- 
self. ' Still they did not know Him, and as they came to the village 
of Emmaus and the stranger made as though He would have gone 
further, the men said, ‘‘Come, abide with us.” 
This picture, showing the men inviting the stranger, was 
painted by Fra Angelico for the Dominican monastery in Florence, 
Italy. You will find it over the entrance of San Marco, where it 
welcomes every stranger who comes. 
Fra Angelico was so kind and gentle and helpful that his com- 
panions called him “Angel Brother”; in Italian, “Fra Angeli 
38 bo.”

  THE BUTTERY 
Pieter DE Hoocu (1632?—1681) 
Usually you can tell his pictures by the checked or plaid 
floors. The floors in the homes in Holland are mostly 
made of squares of black and white marble. Did you ever see a 
cuter little girl than this one in the picture? She has come for her 
pitcher of milk. Her mother went to the “‘buttery” for it: a buttery 
is a place for keeping casks and barrels and bottles. We can see 
one end of the cask or barrel under the window in the buttery. 
Now look into the next room and see the chair on a little platform. 
That platform is quite common in the Dutch home and is probably 
the place where mother or grandmother sits to read or sew by the 
window. What a beautiful day it must be out of doors to make 
the rooms so cheerful and bright! Hooch loved the sunshine and 
used it to brighten every home he painted. The sunshine on the 
checked floors makes his pictures sing with joy and happiness. 
We can find very little about the life of the “Dutch little |mas- 
ters,” yet the pictures they have left us are among our greatest 
treasures: just little home scenes that you and I know about. 
It is said that de Hooch often put in his people after he i fin- P= DE HOOCH is a Dutch artist you are going to love. 
  
ished painting his picture. In one picture he has added a girl] near 
a fireplace to make the picture more balanced. We know that she 
was added after the picture was made, for we can see the plaid 
floor through her dress where the paint was too thin to cover the 
original floor. Such little things tell us something of the method 
of work of the Dutch painters.

THE CORONATION OF THE VIRGIN 
SANDRO BorriceLii (1446-1510) 
HE children who are holding the book and ink-bottle in 
this picture, “The Coronation of the Virgin,” lived| four 
hundred years ago. ‘Their names are Giovanni and Giulio 
de’ Medici. Botticelli, the artist, knew them well for he was 
born and brought up in Florence and used to spend a great! deal 
of time at the Medici Palace. 
The boys were cousins. Giulio, the younger, was left a 
phan when a wee child and his uncle, Lorenzo the Magnith 
adopted him and had him brought up with his own son eal las 
The boys were nearly the same age and grew up to be grea or- 
cent, 
and 
good men. Both of them were popes of Rome. The older} boy, 
Giovanni, was Pope Leo X and Giulio Pope Clement VII. 
Now look at the picture again. The Madonna is readin g to 
her little son, Jesus, ‘““The Magnificat,” that beautiful song [from 
Luke, Chap. I, v. 46-56, sung so often in our churches. Let us 
repeat the song together: 
My soul doth magnify the Lord, 
And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Savior. 
For He hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: 
For, behold, from henceforth, all generations shall call me blessed. 
For He that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is His name. 
And His mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation. 
He hath shewed strength with his arm; 
He hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts 
He hath put down the mighty from their seats, 
And exalted them of low degree. 
He hath filled the hungry with good things; 
And the rich he hath sent empty away. 
He hath holpen his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy; 
As He spake to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.

OU see these wolves were once the old women gossips of 
the town, the story says; and when these women were un- 
kind in what they said about people the Fates—I have 
told you another story about the Fates—the Fates to punish 
them turned them into wolves. The Wolf Charmer, who really is 
the old gypsy who killed the black cat of the village witch goes 
out into the night. The owl calls the wolves to attack the gypsy. 
But the gypsy knew the old women before they were turne 
wolves so he calls them by name: “Kate, Anne, and Bec!” 
soon they follow him down the narrow path between the

imaginary.” He never finished the pictures nor carried ont his 
plan of making these books for children. I am giving you

THE OLD WOMAN CUTTING HER NAILS 
REMBRANDT VAN RIJN (1607?-1669) 
O artist in all history had a sadder life than Rembrandt. 
| \ | It was sad because the people of Amsterdam were stupid 
and too blind to know that a great man was living among 
them. Rembrandt could paint wonderful portraits, and the rich 
people wanted their portraits painted. At first all went well. The 
rich flocked to his studio and Rembrandt made marvelous like- 
nesses. Then the guilds of the great commercial houses wanted 
pictures for their halls. They came to Rembrandt for these pic- 
tures, but thinking that their money had bought the great artist 
body and soul, they began to tell him how he should make |the 
pictures that each one might have equal prominence in| it. 
Naturally Rembrandt would not be bought off with money. His 
art was bigger than gold. The picture that was really the turning 
point in his life was “The Night Watch.” I wish you wduld 
look at the picture again. You see the men away back in |the 
picture were jealous that they were not put in the front row. |All 
they cared for was to have a fine portrait of themselves and Rem- 
brandt was only interested in making a great picture. 
Rembrandt went on painting but no one bought his pictures. 
Many sorrows came to him. It was when the world had for- 
saken him that he painted “The Old Woman Cutting he 
Nails.” Now you can understand why Rembrandt could paint 
an old woman with human sympathy. We could love that old 
woman because the unkindness of the world made her more ten- 
der and true to suffering humanity. She is the old grandmother 
we would go to if we were in trouble.

  THE SPINNER 
NicoLages Mass (1632-1693) 
l | HIS old woman is spinning flax. Have you ever seen a 
flax wheel? When you go to Holland try to visit Dord- 
recht, and if possible, go into a real Dutch home. There 
you may see some one, the grandmother maybe, spinning flax; 
then you will know that this picture is an actual scene. 
Nicolaes Maes, who painted the picture, was born in Dor- 
drecht or Dort. This city is said to be the oldest city in| the 
Netherlands; it was founded in the tenth century. An old woman 
spinning was a familiar scene to Maes. Now look at this spinner 
closely. She will not mind, for she is too intent on picking up 
a thread, possibly a broken or a knotted one. Maes saw a picture 
in the old woman’s dull red dress and bright red sleeves. | He 
liked the brown wheel and the yellow floor and the beautiful bit 
of blue cloth thrown over the wheel-base. Then he saw how 
beautifully the white kerchief and apron and wall caught) the 
light. He saw the helpfulness of the rugged old hand, worn|and 
scarred as it was, yet patient and firm in repairing a mistake. 
Maes’s “The Spinner” and Rembrandt’s “The Old Woman 
Cutting her Nails” make the tasks of every-day life very human. 
We in America owe much to these old Dutch women and to the 
artists who have made them live for us. | 
This picture of “The Spinner” is only sixteen and one fourth 
inches high and thirteen inches wide, yet that old woman at) her 
spinning-wheel is as much a real person in the room where} she 
hangs on the wall as she was when Maes painted her, nearly three 
hundred years ago. I want you to love these little Dutch pictures; 
they are so honest and true and tell us about real people and |real 
things, and they make us feel that beauty is everywhere. Now 
look at your grandmother as she mends your stockings and see 
how beautiful she is with the light on her dear old face and hair.

ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON 
ViITTORE CaRFACCIO (1440?-1522)

told of him is his killing the dragon. Once upon 
St. George was going through Palestine on horseback w S' GEORGE, a noble youth of Cappadocia, was 
  one of 
always 
a time 
hen he 
came to the City of Beirut. There he found a beautiful young girl 
in royal dress weeping outside the walls of the city. W 
asked her why she was crying, she told him that a terrible 
lived in the marshes near the city. And to keep him from 
ing every one in the city, each day two young girls must 
to him. These young girls were chosen by lot, and this d hen he

ay she,     Cleodolinda, the king’s daughter, must be eaten by the dragon. 
St. George told her not to be afraid for he would destroy the 
dragon. But she cried: 
“OQ noble youth, tarry not here, lest thou perish with me! but 
fly, I beseech thee!” St. George answered: 
“God forbid that I should fly! I will lift my hand against the 
loathly thing, and will deliver thee through the power a 
Christ!” 
Then St. George, rushed at the dragon and thrust his sp f Jesus 
ar into 
his mouth and conquered him. He then took the young girl’s 
mantle and bound the beast, and she led him into the city to her 
father. That day twenty thousand people of the city were baptized. 
As time went on the name of St. George became ver great. 
From the time that Richard I—the Lion-Hearted—placed his 
army under the protection of St. George the saint became the 
highest order of knighthood in Great Britain, was founde

THE SONG OF THE LARK 
JuLEs ADOLPHE BRrETON (1827-1906) 
Up with me! up with me into the clouds! 
For thy song, Lark, is strong; 
Up with me, up with me into the clouds! 
Singing, singing, 
With clouds and sky above thee ringing, 
Lift me, guide me till I find 
That spot which seems so to thy mind! 
Worpswortst 
: AN you not almost hear this girl singing? The sun is 
just coming up. The lark is rising in the sky,| singing! 
The girl has come out to work in the fields; 4 peasant 
girl. Barefooted, barehanded, she stands straight like a soldier 
of work with her head lifted to drink in the morning air as she 
sings. 
One morning early I was driving through the country roads 
in the south of England when larks began to rise from 
where the workmen were, just like this lark from the Fr the fields

do not understand their language.” 
Millet’s work is often called “the poems of the earth.”

ST. CECILIA 
RAPHAEL SANzIO (1483-1520) 
ID you know that St. Cecilia invented the organ 
wonderful musical instrument in our churches? 
cilia was born in Rome sixteen hundred years that 
Ce- 
ago. 
She was a beautiful young girl who loved music and composed 
many hymns. The organ she dedicated to God’svservice. 
When Cecilia was married, her husband, a rich nobleman was 
converted and baptized. He knelt by the side of Cecilia, and an 
angel crowned them with crowns made from roses which bloomed 
in paradise. The first thing Valerian asked was that his br’ 
who was a heathen, might be converted too. They sent fo} ther, 
r the 
brother, and when he came and found the room filled with the 
sweet fragrance of roses, though it was not the rose season, 
he too became a Christian. then 
The people of Rome were very unkind to Cecilia and Valerian 
and his brother because they preached the story of Jesus, the 
Christ. At last they killed them. St. Cecilia is the guardian 
saint of music and is always shown in art with the organ, a$ you 
see in this picture by Raphael. The man standing at the left of 
the picture with his hand up to his face is St. Paul. This is the 
most famous picture of St. Paul. Raphael shows the io 
listening to the heavenly choir while the earthly instrumen| 
music have fallen at Cecilia’s feet broken and out of tune.

HELENA FOURMENT RUBENS AND HER 
SON AND DAUGHTER 
Peter Pau, RuBens (1577-1640) 
and Daughter” was really painted to honor the boy. |It 
has always been the custom in Europe to pay special at- 
tention to the boys in the home and keep the girls very much in the 
background. It is very easy to see how pert the little Albert Ru- 
bens is, and how subdued and meek is his sister. The boy has the 
“Lord of Creation” air that would not be good for him |in 
America. We love the picture, for Rubens, the father, shows jus 
plainly the old idea that the boy rules the home. Naturally the 
father would know the traits of his own children but not always 
would he allow us to know them too. 
Rubens was so wonderful as an artist, as a man to settle 
quarrels, and as a beautiful gentleman that all Europe did him 
honor. He was sent to see the ruling powers in England, |in 
Spain, in Italy, and in France. Each ruler entertained him : a T= picture of “Helena Fourment Rubens and Her Son 
royal guest, and Rubens painted masterpieces for each in return. 
His paintings were the wonder of the age. It is said that his fiel- 
low-artists looked with jealous eyes at his flesh tints, and that fall 
painters since have been in despair trying to equal him. He left 
hundreds of pictures and hundreds of sketches. The sketches 
alone are bringing many hundreds of times their weight in gold.

  THE HARP OF THE WINDS 
Homer Martin (1836-1897) 
BOUT a dozen years ago Europe began to wonder if 
A America had any art worth considering. She eo 
us to send samples of our paintings that her critics might 
judge of our work. Among the pictures selected was Homer Mar- 
tin’s “The Harp of the Winds.” At once Europe saw that an 
American artist had painted a masterpiece. 
This scene is on the River Seine, a short distance from P, pris. 
Was anything ever more simple? Slender willow-trees almost 
leafless, bare rocks with a few scrubby bushes, a tiny vi 
sheltered in a curve of the river—what is there to sugge lage 
pt a 
picture? And yet something grips us. We seem to be at the be- 
ginnings of creation. Nature is confiding in us. We are hear- 
ing the winds play on the harp to the listening river. See 
lovingly the water mirrors those harp strings all sparkly ia 
gold and green! I wonder if these willows make a harp 
lyre with their tall stalks reaching to the sky? Do you ren 
ber how, when Mercury found a tortoise, he took the shell 
made holes on both sides and strung nine strings across it 
for each Muse—and gave it to Apollo? I think this Harp o 
Winds has nine strings in memory of Mercury’s lyre.

he did. Remember that the bad men in i nd were 
determined to find something that Jesus, the Christ, ha

they sent one in authority to question him. 
But Jesus said, “‘Bring me a penny, that I may see it.” 
they brought him a penny. done

And 
And Jesus said, “Whose is this image and superscription?” 
And the man was forced to say, ‘‘Czsar’s.”” 
Then Jesus made that famous reply that people use so often to- 
day: ‘‘Render to Cesar the things that are Cesar’s, and to God the 
things that are God’s.” 
the penny belonged to Cesar, the Roman emperor. It had 
portrait on it and Cesar’s demands written on it. Look ca Titian shows the moment when the tax-gatherer must cr that

  THE MAIDS OF HONOR 
Drieco RopRIGUEZ DE SILVA ¥ VELASQUEZ (1599-1660) 
about the little princes and princesses of Spain in the time 
of Philip IV, about the middle of the sixteenth century. i 
made many portraits of these children, especially of the litt 
Princess Margarita. 
One day when Velasquez was painting a portrait of Philip IV 
the king’s little daughter Margarita came into the room attended 
by her maids of honor and a splendid dog. ‘The king was so de- 
lighted with the little group that he told Velasquez to make 
a picture of them just as they stood there before him. Now ldok 
at the picture and you will see in the looking-glass at the back! of 
the room the reflection of the king and the queen. At the ealsel 
stands Velasquez, the artist, with his palette and brushes. The 
wee fair-haired princess is the center of the group. The strange- 
looking little women, her maids of honor, are dwarfs. And see 
what a magnificent fellow the dog is, lying so contentedly on the 
floor right in front of us. 
When the picture was finished, and the people went into see| it, 
many of them asked, “‘Where is the picture?” The little Margarita 
and her maids are so alive and those people standing around seem 
so real that no one thought they could be painted on canvas. 
Velasquez made such wonderfully real likenesses that some one 
told this story of one: One day the King came to Velasquez’s 
studio and seeing, as he supposed, one of his admirals whom) he 
had sent to take a command a few days before, he spoke angrily: 
“What! still here? Did I not command you to depart? Why 
have you not obeyed?” Of course the admiral did not answer, and 
then the king found that he had been angry at a portrait. ibe it had not been for Velasquez we should know very little

  ST. FRANCIS PREACHING TO THE BIRDS 
Giorro pi BoNDONE (1266?-1337) 
NE time more than six hundred years ago St. Francis 
preached the dearest sermon to “My Sisters the Birds” 
that you ever heard. He said to them as they lifted their 
little heads to listen to his words: 
“Ye are beholden unto God your Creator, and always end in 
every place it is your duty to praise him! Ye are bounden to him 
for the element of the air which he has deputed to you foreyer- 
more. You sow not, neither do you reap. God feeds you tnd 
gives you the streams and fountains for your thirst. He gives 
you the mountains and the valleys for your refuge, tall trees 
wherein to make your nests, and inasmuch as you neither spin mor 
reap God clothes you and your children, hence ye should love 
your Creator greatly, and therefore beware, my sisters, of the sins 
of ingratitude, and ever strive to praise God.” 
St. Francis then made the sign of the Cross and sent the birds 
north, south, east, and west to carry the story of the Cross to all 
mankind. 
When Giotto, who painted this picture of “St. Francis Predch- 
ing to the Birds,” was a little boy, he took care of his father’s 
sheep in the fields. One day a noted painter, Cimabue, found 
Giotto drawing a sheep on a flat rock with colored stones. ‘The 
picture of the sheep was so lifelike that the great man asked |the 
boy, Giotto, to go with him and become an artist. He went, and 
one day years afterward the pope sent to Giotto for a sampleé of 
his work.. Giotto sent him a big round O. It pleased the pope 
to find a man so original, and he gave Giotto many orders for pic- 
tures. To-day the saying is ‘Round as Giotto’s O.”

Chardin’s color was so wonderful that one of his artist friends 
cried out: “O Chardin! it is not white, red, or black that you 
grind to powder on your palette; it is the air and the light that|you

Chardin’s pictures are as beautiful and bright to-day as they 
were when he painted them.

THE LAST SUPPER 
Lronarpo pA VINCI (1452-1519) 
Vinci painted them four hundred years ago. Leonardo spent 
months among the men of Milan, Italy, looking into their 
faces and talking with them. When he began to paint “The Last 
Supper” he had gathered men together so like these twelve disciples 
that we feel we can know them as Jesus knew them. For three 
years those men of old walked with Jesus and talked with him as 
they went up and down Palestine; and at last, on that leeuteladl 
night, they met with Him in the upper chamber to eat with Him 
the Last Supper. Those disciples did not know that it was|the 
last meal they would eat with Jesus before he was hung on|the 
cross. : 
We shall begin in the center of the table and name the disciples 
as Leonardo has them in the picture. First is the Savior. At his 
left is James with his arms spread out in distress; back of oe is 
Thomas with his finger uplifted; then Philip rising with his hand 
on his heart; next Matthew, his arms pointing to the Savior while 
he turns toward the two near the end; next to him is Thaddeus; 
and then Simon. On the other side of Jesus sits John, the beloved 
disciple. His hands are folded and his eyes are cast down. Next 
to John is Judas, the betrayer; he holds the bag clutched in his 
right hand and near him is the overturned salt cellar. Leaning 
back of Judas is Peter with one hand on John’s shoulder; next to 
Peter is Andrew; then James, the less, laying one hand on Peter’s 
arm. At the end of the table is Bartholomew, who has risen rest- 
ing his hands on the table. These men are all asking, “Is it I?” 
For Jesus had said, ‘‘He it is to whom I give a sop.” I WANT you to know the disciples of Jesus just as Leonardo da

  SIR GALAHAD 
Georce FrepERIcK Watts (1818-1904) 
F all the stories of King Arthur and his Knights of the 
() Round Table none is so strange as that of Sir Galahad. 
Its beginning is in the upper chamber at the Last Supper 
with Jesus and his disciples. Legend says that the cup used by 
our Savior at the Last Supper was the Holy Grail. Joseph |of 
Arimathea, who bought the cup from Pontius Pilate, used it|to 
catch the blood that flowed from the pierced side of our Lord. 
The cup, or Holy Grail, was kept in the Convent of the Holy Grail 
by the descendants of Joseph of Arimathea. 
The cup had marvelous powers in the hands of a perfect knight. 
Centuries passed and no perfect knight came to claim the Holy 
Grail. Then King Arthur founded the Knights of the Round 
Table. One seat at the round table was always vacant waiting 
for the sinless youth. Many tried to sit in the ‘“‘seat perilous,” jas 
it was called, but the seat let each one down to disappear forever. 
At last an old man—Joseph of Arimathea himself—brought a 
boy and seated him in the vacant chair. The knights were fright. 
ened but the boy sat unharmed and above the seat appeared the 
words: 
THIS. 1S THE SEAT OF GALAHAD 
King Arthur knighted him and sent him forth to find the Holy 
Grail. Years went by and awful trials and temptations came |to 
Sir Galahad. He did not yield to the bad things that came, but 
kept looking for the Holy Grail. At last he held the cross before 
his face to keep off his tormentors when before his eyes he saw the 
cup, and the power of the Holy Grail came to him. 
This picture of Sir Galahad in Eton College, England, hangs 
in the chapel opposite the entrance door where each boy passes in 
on his way to morning and evening prayers.

  THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE AND : 
HER CHILD 
Sir JosHua ReyNnoitps (1723-1792) 
IR JOSHUA REYNOLDS ought to be called “the painter 
S of little girls.” No artist ever painted a larger number) of 
little girls. And no artist ever knew better than he how to 
get the confidence of children, boys or girls. 
One time a little boy in London was to carry a flag in a pro eS= 
sion. What do you think he did? He went to Sir Joshua Rey- 
nolds, the artist whom no one dared to interrupt, and asked him 
if he would paint a flag for him. This pleased the great man. 
When the boy proudly displayed his flag, every one asked: 
“Where did you get such a wonderful flag?” 
‘You can guess how proud the boy was to say, “Sir Joshua Rey- 
nolds painted it for me!” 
This picture of “The Duchess of Devonshire and her Child” 
is one of the greatest pictures Sir Joshua ever painted. The 
original painting is now in the magnificent country seat of the D 
of Devonshire at Chatsworth, England. Sir Joshua had a wa 
making his pictures sparkle and glisten that was unknown to o uke

he saw one of the eyes move. He was horrified to find that it re; 
was moving down on the cheek. He grabbed the picture and 
into a cold room and then worked the eye back in place.

pictures glitter and, alas, the glitter would not last.

ST. AGNES AND HER LAMB 
ANDREA DEL SARTO (1486-1531) 
NE of the most beautiful pictures of “St. Agnes and her 
() lamb” was painted by Andrea del Sarto,—‘‘Andrea the 
faultless,” as he was called. It is in the cathedral at 
Pisa. 
St. Agnes was a Roman girl who lived three hundred years after 
the birth of Jesus. Her father and mother were reels but 
their little daughter became a Christian when a mere child} She 
did not tell her parents that she loved Jesus, but when she refused 
to worship idols they knew that she had become a disciple] of the 
Master Christ. This made them so angry that they handed her 
over to the Roman rulers to be punished. ‘These wicked men tried 
in every way to persuade Agnes to bow down to their gods made of 
wood and stone. When she would not bow down to them they 
tried to force her to worship the idols. 
They gave her over to the soldiers and ordered them to take her 
clothes away, but immediately her hair grew and covered nb and 
angels came and gave her a shining white garment. She even re- 
fused to marry the son of the Roman magistrate. The son hae 
that he could compel her to consent to the marriage after she was 
persecuted, but he was struck blind when he tried to see her. 
When St. Agnes saw what great sorrow came to the home of the 
young nobleman because he was blind, she prayed for him and his 
eyesight came again. His father was so thankful that he pleaded 
for her life, but the people said, 
“She is a sorceress: she must die.” Then they tried to burn her, 
but the flames burned her tormentors and did her no athe At 
last she was killed with a sword. She is always represented with 
a lamb. 
Michael Angelo wrote to Raphael about Andrea del} Sarto: 
“There is a little fellow in Florence who, if he were employed as 
you are upon great works, would make it hot for you.”

  WHISTLER’S MOTHER 
James Appotr MCNEILL WHISTLER (1834-1903) 
HE story about Whistler and his mother is rather a sad 
He went to Europe when he was a young painter and one, 
told 
his mother as he started that he would come home to| her 
when he had made a success. But he never made a succes$ in 
money. He painted this picture of his mother and for twenty years 
tried to sell it. He offered it to his own country—the United 
States—for five hundred dollars. We were so stupid that we) did 
not know that the picture was a masterpiece and that no amount of 
money could buy it later on. But the people of Paris began to 
feel that Whistler, the American artist, was a great master, and the 
city bought the picture, “Whistler’s Mother.” Of course we can 
never own the picture now, although it is an American mother, 
unless the French people should give it to us. But we do not de- 
serve it, do we? 
After a number of years Whistler’s mother went to Europe to 
make a home for her wonderful son. She died in Chelsea, and to- 
day the mother and son are side by side in the_little churchyard of

  ST. CHRISTOPHER 
TITIAN, OR T1zIANO VECELLI (1477-1576) 
( Mei ety or Offero, was born in Palestine in the 
third century. He was a giant in size but ignorant and 
poor. He felt that he could not work for any one who 
was afraid of any one else. He wandered over the country and at 
last he came to a powerful king and offered to work for him. The 
king thought it very fine to have a giant for a servant. One day 
Offero stood by the king’s side while a minstrel sang a song about 
Satan. Every time the name of Satan was spoken the king crossed 
himself. Offero was puzzled, for he never had heard of Satan, nor 
of Jesus. When he found that the king was afraid of Satan, Of- 
fero went to find the man the king was afraid of. 
Offero found Satan and became his servant. But as they went 
through the land Offero saw that Satan always went away around 
the little shrines. Offero asked Satan why he did that. Satan 
said he did not like to come near the cross where was the crucified 
One. Then Offero knew that he was afraid of Jesus. 
He went out to find Jesus. At last an old hermit told Offero to 
go to a river where people were often drowned and to carry every 
one across on his back, and that maybe he would find Jesus. Of- 
fero built himself a hut and spent years carrying people over the 
stream and no one was drowned. One stormy night Offero thought 
he heard a child’s voice calling him. He went out two or three 
times. At last the child appeared and asked Offero to carry him 
over. Offero started. The storm grew worse and the water rose 
high and the child grew very, very heavy. When Offero set the 
child down, he said, “I feel as though I had carried the whole 
world!” The child answered: 
“Offero, you have carried the maker of the world. I am Jesus, 
whom you have sought. You shall be called Christ-Offero—the 
Christ-bearer—from now on.”

    THE BLUE BOY 
THomas GAINSBOROUGH (1727-1788) 
a child. He often entertained his companions by draw- 
ing pictures for them while they read the lessons to him. 
One morning Thomas got up with the sun and went out into the 
garden to sketch. There was in the garden a wonderful pear- 
tree full of ripe pears, and the pears had been disappearing very 
mysteriously. While Thomas was making his drawings he saw a 
man’s face appear suddenly above the stone wall. He quickly 
made a sketch of the face, and frightened the man before he could 
get away with the fruit. At the breakfast-table the young artist 
told his father what he had done and showed him the sketch. His 
father knew the man and sent for him. When the man was ac- 
cused of stealing the pears he denied it, but when he was shown the 
picture Thomas had made of him he confessed that he had taken 
the pears. 
Artists, like all of us, want to lay down rules for every one to 
follow who is doing their same kind of work. Sir Joshua Rey- 
nolds said, “The masses of light in a picture ought to be always of 
a warm, mellow colour—yellow, red, or yellowish white; and the 
blue, the grey, or green colours should be kept almost entirely out 
of the masses.” /Gainsborough did not agree with him. To show 
Sir Joshua that he was wrong Gainsborough painted pictures in 
blue and green. The famous “Blue Boy” alone proved that he 
was right. The boy has on a blue satin suit and he stands out-of- 
doors in green grass with green foliage and blue sky around him. 
When Sir Joshua saw Gainsborough’s blue-green pictures he said 
frankly, “I cannot think how he produces his effects.”’ 
These two men were never good friends yet when Gains- 
borough was near death Sir Joshua Reynolds came to his bedside, 
and when Gainsborough died Reynolds was one of the pall-bearers.

  THE SLEEPING GIRL 
JAN VAN DER MEER or DELFT (1632-1675) 
painters were called “little masters,” simply because they 
painted small pictures for the homes. For the homes! The 
Dutch wanted pictures to hang on their walls; pictures they could 
live with. Now what do you think of the “Sleeping Girl’? Do 
you know I could live with that picture and feel that I always had 
something to make me happy? It is so homy. See how comfort- 
able the girl is! Of course a good healthy girl has no business 
to be sleeping in the daytime, but we can forgive her now that van 
der Meer has caught her asleep and let us see her. Then look at 
that wonderful rug! Was ever anything so soft and velvety? 
If we knew about rugs we might tell its name and maybe its age. 
Van der Meer had a way of catching people without their know- 
ing it. He seems to have cut a piece out of the wall where he 
peeped in and painted what he saw. We are glad the girl left the 
door open into another room so that we can see the table and 
pictures and part of the window-frame. I think these things are 
reflected in a looking-glass. 
Van der Meer painted only about forty pictures, and eight of 
those are in the United States. They are among our greatest art 
treasures, [= you to know and love the Dutch pictures. The

  ST. ANTONY AND THE CHRIST-CHILD 
BARTHOLOME EsTEBAN MurILLo (1618-1682) 
ANY very curious legends are told of St. Antony of 
M Padua, who died in 1231. He was a close friend of 
St. Francis (see “St. Francis and his Birds,” page 76). 
One story says that one time he was preaching about the Savior 
when the child Jesus came and sat on his open Bible. It is this 
story that Murillo painted his picture to illustrate. Again and 
again Murillo has shown us St. Antony with the Christ-child, but 
never more beautifully than here. This is one of Murillo’s great- 
est religious pictures. 
Another story is told of St. Antony. One day he was preaching 
the funeral sermon of a rich young man when he exclaimed: 
“His heart is buried in his treasure-chest; go seek it there and 
you will find it.” 
Sure enough when the friends of the rich young man opened the 
treasure-chest there was the heart, and no heart was found in the 
young man’s dead body.

  KING LEAR 
Epwin AusTIN ABBEY (1852-1911) 
V | HE story of “King Lear” is one of the most pitiful of 
Shakespeare’s play. It is about the thanklessness of chil- 
dren to a father. Old King Lear had three daughters— 
Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. He loved these daughters dearly 
and he believed that they loved him. As he grew old in life he 
thought he would divide his kingdom and property among them 
equally; then there would be no trouble about his wealth after he 
was dead. Of course he expected to make his home with them in 
turn as long as he lived. Naturally he went to Goneril, the eldest 
daughter, first. Very soon he found that he was not wanted. She 
had the money—her father’s money—but why should she be 
troubled with her old father? He then went to Regan, his second 
child, but she too refused to make a home for him. The third 
daughter, Cordelia, loved her father dearly and wanted him to 
live with her that she might care for him in his old age. By a 
strange mishap the old father thought that Cordelia, his beloved 
child, was false to him. He wandered off on the heath in a fear- 
ful storm and at last found shelter in a hut where he thinks even 
his faithful dogs are against him. He cries out pitifully: 
The little dogs and all, 
Tray, Blanche and Sweetheart, see they bark at me. 
Abbey has painted the scene when the old king is leaving heart- 
broken, for he thinks Cordelia, the child he loves best, is deserting 
him. Cordelia, knowing how false her sisters are, is saying: 
I know you what you are; 
And, like a sister, am most loath to call 
Your faults as they are named. Love well our father. 
Abbey’s story of “The Holy Grail” in the Boston Library is one 
of America’s great series of paintings for wall decoration.

SUNSET IN THE WOODS 
Georce InNEss (1825-1894) 
' X Y HENEVER you can, I want you to find out what the 
painter says about his own pictures. We feel very 
glad that George Inness told us about “Sunset in the 
Woods.” He said in 1891: ‘The material for my picture was 
taken from a sketch made near Hastings, on the Hudson, New | 
York, twenty years ago. This picture was commenced seven years 
ago, but until last winter I had not obtained any idea equal to the 
impression received on the spot. The idea is to express an effect 
of light in the woods at sunset.” 
What a wonderful glow he has on those trees beyond the big rock 
away back in the picture. And see the light on the trunk of the 
big tree near us. I believe the light is gradually disappearing 
as we look. Somehow we feel the birds are twittering as they go to 
bed and the flowers are nodding their heads, they are so sleepy. 
Soon it will be dark and the owl will screech and the night insects 
will buzz. Come, we must go home or we cannot see our way!

PREFACE 
“For two centuries Germany has been the classical land 
of pedagogy,” says Compayré ; if we admit this, it is not 
surprising to find the Germans ahead of us in educational 
theory. 
In England, it has been the fashion to deprecate educa- 
tional theory, though it cannot be denied that our practical 
ability in the schoolroom bears a favourable comparison 
with the practical ability of teachers of other nations. 
Our educational text-books, in the past, have fre- 
quently been full of practical details, but lacking in guiding 
principles. 
We are beginning to atone for our past neglect of 
educational theory, and to recognise that |a study ot 
principles and ideals of education is of greater import- 
ance than a study of the external devices employed by 
the teacher to make the child acquire knowledge,/, “The 
subject taught is secondary to the manner of teaching,” 
and the question for the teacher is not, “What does the 
child know?” but, “ What is his moral worth?” 
Ethics and psychology, and their bearing upon teaching, 
are receiving increased attention in our training courses 
for teachers ; it seems probable, therefore, that the writings 
of Herbart and his followers will be more studied in Eng- 
land than has been the case hitherto. Herbart believed 
v 
 
-P-A-G-E-6
vi PREFACE 
  
that the scientific basis of education was to be found in 
ethics and psychology, and his system, which aims at de- 
veloping character, and at the same time at providing 
teachers with principles for selecting, arranging, connecting, 
and teaching the ordinary subjects of the schoolroom, is 
worthy of our attention. 
I have attempted in this little book to sketch simply and 
clearly some of Herbart’s ideas on education, and to apply 
them to English primary schools. I have dedicated the 
book to the students, who helped me to work out the 
practical experiments in teaching herein described. 
My warmest thanks are due to Professor Rein, of Jena, 
not only for writing the Introduction to the book, but 
also for much personal help and kindness in directing my 
studies, and in enabling me to see the Herbartian Methods 
worked out in German Schools. I am indebted to Mr. 
Arthur Sidgwick for the translation of Dr. Rein’s Intro- 
duction.

INTRODUCTION 
By DR. W. REIN 
ALL teachers have a natural anxiety to establish a system 
of instruction such as will develop the powers and feel- 
ings of the mind. But they are often unable to see clearly 
what lines to adopt, in order to attain, in dealing with the 
young, the end which they somewhat imperfectly discern. 
They: frequently rely on the pufinence of their own per- 
accordingly ines cropere forehead on 1 of fi their i instruction. 
Personality, no doubt, is of the highest importance, , if the 
teacher possesses the qualities necessary for true education. 
But even the best natural gifts can be still further de- 
veloped and improved by systematic reflection, and study 
of the theory of education and its value in practice. For 
this purpose books are a welcome aid, to lead the thought- 
ful teacher through the intricate detail of instruction, and, 
above all, to show him how mechanical methods can be 
avoided, and teaching take its true place in true education. 
The present work will undoubtedly render this service 
to English teachers. It introduces them to the problems 
of educational teaching, and supplies a potent stimulus to 
systematic thought on the best method of instruction, while 
it presents an independent estimate of the results attained 
by methodical work since the days of Comenius, Pestalozzi,

and Herbart. It is possible that in many quarters this 
attempt may be regarded with a certain scepticism, and 
it may appear a bold and futile undertaking to transplant 
Herbartian theories to English soil; but in any case it is 
- an interesting experiment, which cannot fail to lead to 
profitable results. The questions of curriculum and educa- 
tional method are so difficult that it is an advantage to 
study them from different sides. It will be clear that their 
solution, as attempted on Herbartian principles, deserves 
serious consideration, so far as it seems adapted to make 
the teaching in our schools really fruitful for the young. 
In any case, we must make up our minds to get rid of the 
assumption that the first object is to cram the learner’s 
mind with the maximum amount of knowledge to be re- 
produced in examination. The higher aims must be clearly 
recognised, which are these:(to awaken the activity of 
the faculties, to—_form—the—mental_and_moral_judgment, 
and to give a genial warmth to-instruction, which quickens 
into life the noblest growths of genuine human culture. 
We welcome the present work as a valuable aid to the 
thoughtful teacher, who is not content with mechanical 
routine, but is resolved to undertake and pursue his pro- 
fessional task in the spirit of an artist, We hope that 
the book may be warmly received by all who really care 
for the instruction and education of the young.

“Obviously, the free enjoyment of life demands not only the 
noble, but also the pleasant, for happiness consists of these two.”— 
ARISTOTLE. 
“‘Dumb yearnings, hidden appetites, are ours ; 
And they must have their food. Our childhood sits,

“« Every philosopher of the present must go through Kant, and every 
pedagogue through Pestalozzi and Herbart.”—REIN. 
“* Pestalozzi, seized and developed by the philosophic thought of our 
times, must be studied in Herbart.”—-MaGER. 
(“The teacher . . . creates his own school. To him who hears 
| the true artist’s call to education, the small dull space in which he 
at first perhaps feels himself confined soon becomes so bright and 
large, that he discovers the whole of education therein, with all its 
motives and needs; the satisfaction of which is truly a work im- 
—_measurable.”—HERBART. 
“The aim of education is, in truth, always an ideal aim, for it 
contemplates the completion of a man—the realisation in each man of 
what each has it in him to become. If a teacher has not an ideal aim, 
he had better take to shopkeeping at once ; he will there, doubtless, 
find an ideal within his capacity.” —LauRIg. 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
CHAPTER I 
AIM AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION 
a Tue problems of education are more interesting 
es perhaps in the present day than at any other 
period in the world’s history. The democratic 
ideal, which is a development of the Christian idea that all 
men are equal before God, demands that education should 
be the common inheritance of humanity. The old idea, 
that education is the exclusive possession of the rich 
and wellborn, has passed away, but with more generous. 
ideals many new complications have arisen. / 
When learning was an expensive luxury, people prized it 
because they paid for it, and because it was unobtainable 
by the majority. Now, it is as common as the air we 
breathe and the water we drink, and, moreover, no option 
is left to the parent, for the law compels him to send 
his child to school: but the prevalence of much sluggish 
indifference and ignorance concerning the need of school 
learning shows that the democratic Christian ideal is far 
from realization. 
In the exclusive days the problem of education was 
considered from an exclusive standpoint, and reformers like 
Locke and Rousseau took into account only the difficulty 
of dealing with one pupil. Their method was to shut up 
their solitary pupil, away from the contaminating influences 
of the world, to provide him with a tutor who was a marvel  
-P-A-G-E-12
———————er ll ae 
2 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
of discretion and wisdom, and to show how under these 
circumstances they might work out their ideal of education. 
Re tak, Pestalozzi sought to reform education on 
Problem more generous lines. He aimed at the re- 
generation of mankind. He lived for years among beggars, 
in order to learn “how to make beggars live like men.” 
He dealt with the poor and outcast, and strove by means 
of education to give these neglected children self-respect ; 
and to raise them from moral degradation. 
Pestalozzi’s problem is ours. We do not deal with an 
exclusive few, but with the thousands of children from 
the mean streets and dark alleys of our great cities, with 
the children from the factory-towns of the North of England 
and the mining districts of the South of Wales, with the 
children from scattered villages and from fishing hamlets. 
Many indirect influences are at work to cause the wealthy 
and middle classes to educate their children, but, now that 
education is a common _ inheritance, we must_endeavour to 
arouse a deep and vital interest in. knowledge for its own 
“sake, We hear many murmurs of discontent. The people 
who pay rates grumble at the expense of our schools, the 
parents who are deprived of the fruits of their children’s 
labour during their school-years grumble at the injustice of 
it, and those who expect the schools to work miracles in 
our midst grumble at the uselessness and folly of attempt- 
ing to educate everybody. We are told that our methods 
are mechanical, that the knowledge we wish to impart has 
no lasting influence on the children, who forget in one year 
what they have laboured to learn in six, and that blank 
ignorance is better than conceited incapacity. Some of 
these pessimistic accusations may be true. We are dealing 
 
-P-A-G-E-13
    AIM AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION 3 
  
with human children, human teachers, and human managers, 
under human conditions. Our means of education are often 
faulty and ill-considered, and the results are naturally im- 
perfect. 
Be The difficulties are great. Large classes with 
secrete atl insufficient staff of teachers are too common 
to need comment. Moreover, the timetable 
is becoming more crowded. Singing, drawing, manual 
training, painting, gymnastics, cooking, chemistry, jostle 
each other for places in the curriculum. How can the 
jaded teacher, battling with a large class and half a dozen 
subjects, find time and energy for thinking out methods ? 
It is a difficult matter ; yet the method must be also con- 
sidered. In the face of so much confusion, we need more 
urgently, than we ever needed before, a scientific guide to 
show us what to teach, and how to teach it. 
Before we discuss these points, however, we must con- 
sider why we educate children. 
the Aims of A Study of some of the educational systems. 
Education. of the past shows us that children have always) | 
been educated for what has been considered the most / 
“important affairs of life. 
~The Greeks excelled in Art and War: hence their edu- 
cation was mainly physical. 
The Romans wished to produce Soldiers and Statesmen : 
therefore Military exercises, the Twelve Tables of Roman 
law, and oratory were studied. 
“~The chief aim of education in the Middle Ages was to 
fit people for the life to come : hence it was almost wholly 
religious i in charactery 
~ What i is our + educational aim now? We sometimes try  
-P-A-G-E-14
—————————— 
4 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  to distinguish between Humanistic and Scientific education, 
and to say the aim of the former is to cultivate the mind, 
while the latter furthers utilitarian ends. It is also custom- 
ary to speak of teaching certain subjects because they are 
said “to train the faculties.” There are other aims of a 
lower nature. We educate children because we wish them 
tg suceed in life, to pass examinations, to_gain_scholar- 
ships, or to hold their own with their fellows. These are 
the individual aims of individual parents, but most parents 
would readily admit that moral training was their chief aim 
in their child’s education. ~ = 
The State concerns itself with the education of its child- 
ren in order to further the welfare of the nation. Depravity 
and ignorance are dangerous to the community, while intel- 
ligence and virtue are helpful to it. If children are wisely 
taught, they may become intelligent and good men and 
women, and thus add to the honour and safety of the 
nation. 
The general aim which inspires most of our reforming 
measures is usually a_moral one, and, in spite of the 
many secondary aims which may be brought forward in 
answer to the question, ‘“ Why do we educate children?” 
the broad, general answer upon which we all agree is, “In 
orderto make them better human_beings.” This is com- 
prehensive and idealistic enough to-begin-with. + 
taeatstie Aim Great educators from Plato downwards have

Pestalozzi’s aim was idealistic; he wished to regenerate 
mankind, and he set himself to win the hearts of his <a 
neglected little orphans, in order to appeal to their higher 
selves. Pestalozzi was a passionate reformer, with a great
-P-A-G-E-15

heart aglow with love and sympathy, and, like most other 
devoted enthusiasts, he did not trouble himself to base his 
educational plans upon a scientific theory. His wonderful 
intuition taught him what to do, and he did it. Pestalozzi 
inspired Herbart to formulate and attempt to solve some 
of the‘educational problems around him. 
Herbart_based_his-educational theories upon ethics.and 
psychology. He and his followers answer some of the 
questions which perplex us in the present day in connexion 
with our school difficulties. 
Herbart’s Aim  FLerbart_lays down definitely at the outset 
of Eaneation’ that the one supreme aim of education_is_the 
development of moral character, He deduces this aim 
Clearly and~sharply from his system of ethics, which is 
based upon this principle of Kant— 
“There is nothing in the whole world, or indeed out 
of it, which can be taken without limitation as good, 
except the good will.” \ 
Education must help to form this good will in the 
child, ‘and Herbart shows us how all the activities of 
the school are to be devoted to this end. His aim is to 
make moral ideas the ruling forces ‘in the lives of his 
pupils. These ideas are to sway the pupil completely, to 
penetrate into his disposition, to give him a right grip of 
life, and to determine his actions. 
The moral culture given in the school helps to form 
moral ideas in the child’s mind, and these ideas influence 
the child’s will and actions. 
“Instruction which makes for character” is one of the . 
commonplaces among the followers of Herbart. This 
means that the highest aim of all instruction is ethical, cee at a is z 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
      6 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
inasmuch_as_its primary importance is _in_developing cha- 
racter. The teacher is to be guided, in choosing what 
the child shall learn, by the thoughts contained in the 
studies. Mere formal studies do not directly influence 
character—hence are of secondary importance, 
The subject-matter of all the studies is to be considered 
first, so that the child’s mind may be filled with worthy 
and useful ideas, 
The self-activity of the child is to be satisfied and his 
interest awakened, so that he may work and think with 
love and delight. 
True instruction aims at giving the child studies with a 
worthy content, which arouse his interest and self-activity. 
The ideas derived through instruction form in the child’s 
mind what the Herbartians call the circle of thought. 
ee tye is impossible in a little work of this kind 
ee to enter completely into Herbart’s principles. 
I shall merely try to show the practical bearing 
of three points. 
We have seen that with Herbart the aim of education 
is to develop moral character, and. this is the outcome of 
his ethical conclusion. The three chief doctrines based 
upon his psychology show us how to reach this Aim :— 
1. How to choose subject-matter for instruction. 
2. How to connect it. 
3. How to present it to the children. ) 2 3 - 
I. Selection of Subject-Matter. This is guided by 
Interest and what the Herbartians call the Theory of 
the Culture Epochs. 
II. The Connexion of Studies. This is based upon the 
Theory of Concentration.   
-P-A-G-E-17
  AIM AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION 7 
  
III. The Method of Imparting Knowledge. This is 
based upon the Theory of the Five Formal Steps of 
Instruction. 
1. Selection of Subject-matter, 
The child’s_.i es_and_ capacities are to be 
used as guides in selecting what to teach it. We are fairly 
familiar with this from Froebel’s point of view, and we 
know how the gifts and occupations were devised to suit 
the natural instincts of the child. Herbart considers the 
child from the culture-historic point of view. e says that d cpa le fess 
the little child possesses the same circle of ideas as those Ree ee aEEnEEEEEaE eel 
of our remote ancestors, and that it passes through various 
stages of culturé during its development from infancy to 
maturi y. Hence the ideas whic accord with the child’s 
taste are likely to be found in the fairy tales which have 
Seen Randed-down from remote ages. Each school-year 
should earespond to a sage of devel ment thro’ which 
put ‘before the child to study is to be taken from the stage 
‘of development in the world’s history which corresponds 
to ie Ghids cele af ideas. ‘The theory of the Culture 
Epochs serves as a rough guide for the selection of 
“material. The actual portions selected_ ool studies

theirusefuness CS 
2—~Lhe-Connexion of Studies. 
Froebel aimed at unity in the child’s studies, and so 
should every thoughtful teacher. 
We all feel that waste of thought and energy result from 
isolating one subject of instruction from another, and many. 
of us realize the importance of associating the ideas | gained rh RO ee eee 
   
-P-A-G-E-18
HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
    
in one subject with the related ideas gained in another. 
Most of us can recall our pleasure at discovering in our 
childhood such facts as that the river Nile of the story of 
Moses was identical with the river Nile in the map of 
Africa. It gave us the kind of intellectual joy we feel 
later when cosmos begins to shape itself out of the chaos 
of one’s thoughts. 
~Herbart based his theory of the concentration of studies 
upon psychological grounds. His followers — especially 
Prof. Rein—have made it one of the leading principles in 
their application of Herbartian methods. He associates it 
closely with the aim of education. 
ao It is the aim of concentration to closely associate related 
ideas, thereby securing that unity in the circle of thought 
which gives personal character stability and strength. 
The centre of this scheme of concentration is what the 
Herbartians call the ‘“Gesinnungs-stoff” (material which 
develops character). This material is obviously the Hu- 
manities, History, Literature, and Art. 
3. The Method of Imparting Knowledge. 
Before we can attempt to teach anything to children, we 
must know how ideas grow in their minds. Herbart and 
his followers studied the mental processes by which chil- 
dren take in ideas, and, with thése-laws-to guide them, 
» 4 they worked out the theory of the Five Formal Steps. 
We often talk of our particular methods of teaching, as 
though the mind could acquire-knowledge in a dozen differ- 
ent ways and the teacher had the privilege of choosing 
in which way his pupil should get his ideas. There—is--~” 
only one true method, and that corresponds to the laws 
according to which the child’s mind works. The old way 
   
-P-A-G-E-19
    
    AIM AND GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATION 9G 
  
was to make children learn formulas, definitions and rules, 
and repeat them by rote. They learnt words in this way, 
often mere words with no ideas attached to them, and to 
use words without understanding them is “an intellectual 
immorality. he only way in which children can acquire 
idéas is by following the universal Jaw by which all dis

expansion of this principle.

teachers clearly recognise what to teach, and how to teach 
it, so that the instruction shall influence in the right direc- 
ion the character of the children in our schools, the word 
education, which we now use loosely, will acquire a real 
and living meaning. 
Archdeacon Wilson, in his recent charge, May, 1898, 
expresses the different meaning education has for those 
who are interested in fostering it. ‘Part of the price we 
pay for democracy is, that a subject like education gets 
largely into the hands of people who have of necessity an 
extremely limited and erroneous idea of what it means. 
They think of education in terms of its instrumentalities, 
the buildings, apparatus, staff, qualifications of teachers, 
and the money they pay for it.) That is something ; that is 
the knowledge of a clerk. Or, they may think of it as 
organization and discipline and results; as the knowledge 
of so many rules of arithmetic, and of so many text-books
-P-A-G-E-20
\ 
  10 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
on history, and geography, and grammar, and mechanics. 
That is something too; it is the knowledge of an organizing 
master, a specialist in his way. Or, they think of it as a 
proselytising and feeding organization in connection with 
their church or their chapel. That is the thought of a 
sectarian. : 
“But if education is thought of as the result in character ; 
in usefulness, inventiveness, resource; in good manners, 
straightforwardness, trustworthiness ; in self-control, rever- 
ence, piety ; then there are but few who connect cause and 
effect, or believe in any such connection as a guide to the 
educator.” 
/ The “result in character” is exactly what the Herbartians 
aim at. They recognise that the worth of an individual 
depends not upon his knowledge, but upon his power of 
willing rightly, and the school instruction is to them an 
.important factor in training the child’s will.

    **To be wearisome is the cardinal sin of instruction.” —HERBART. 
«© Whoever holds fast to knowledge, and seeks to extend it, is inter- 
ested in it.” —HERBART. 
“‘The aim of instruction is not the production of a many-sided 
knowledge, but of a many-sided interest.”—Rrin, 
«* When interest has been fully developed, it must always combine 
pleasure, facility and the satisfaction of a need. We see again that 
in all exertions, power and pleasure are secured to interest. It does 
not feel the burden of difficulties, but often seems to sport with them.” 
-—ZILLER. 3 
“Interest means, in general, that species of mental activity which 
instruction must create, but which has no place in mere knowledge. 
For knowledge may be a store which a man may entirely dispense 
with, and yet be no other than before.” —HERBART.

CHAPTER II 
INTEREST AND ITS BEARING UPON INSTRUCTION 
Mr. STELLING’s method of instructing Tom Tulliver was 
not successful if viewed in the light of modern methods; 
he failed absolutely in interesting his pupil. ‘You feel 
no interest in what you’re doing, sir,” Mr. Stelling would 
say, and the reproach was painfully true. Tom’s trouble 
was, that he was not interested in the things Mr. Stelling 
wished him to be. He was not stupid, nor was he without 
interests. ‘He never found any difficulty in discerning 
a pointer from a setter, when once he had been told the - 
distinction, and his perceptive powers were not at all de- 
ficient. . . . Tom could predict with accuracy what 
number of horses were cantering behind him, he could’ 
throw a stone right into the centre of a given ripple, he 
could guess to a fraction how many lengths of his stick it 
would take to reach across the playground, and could draw 
almost perfect squares on his slate without any measure- 
ment. But Mr. Stelling took no note of these things; he 
only observed that Tom’s faculties failed him before the 
abstractions hideously symbolised to him in the pages of 
the Eton Grammar, and that he was in a state bordering 
on idiocy with regard to the demonstration that two given 
triangles must be equal—though he could discern with great 
promptitude and certainty the fact that they were equal.”

Tom had plenty of interests, but Latin Grammar and 
Euclid were not among them, and as Mr. Stelling con- 
sidered these the “only basis of solid instruction,” Tom 
fared badly. 
Perhaps in more modern times even Mr. Stelling would 
have learned that it is the business of the teacher to make the 
aoe pupil interested in his.work. It isa commonplace 
ences! among us in these days, that the teacher_must 
make the acquisition of facts interesting, but there 
is nothing absolutely new under the sun, and we find Plato 
praising the Egyptians for their practice of teaching arith- 
metic by means of games, and Erasmus admiring the in- 
genuity of “the ancients,” who he said “moulded tooth- 
some dainties in the form of letters, and thus, as it were, 
made children swallow the alphabet,” and Quintilian re- 
commending teachers to teach the alphabet by means of 
letters in ivory which children take pleasure “in seeing, 
handling and naming,” and Rabelais causing his pupil to 
play. with cards after dinner and to learn “a thousand 
pretty tricks all grounded on arithmetic,” and Locke ad- 
vising that the child should play with ivory balls on which 
were pasted the letters of the alphabet, and so learn them. 
It is true that it is easier to preach reforms than to 
practise them, and we might give instances of school- 
masters before Mr. Stelling, and perhaps even after, who 
ignored these gentler means of making the child love his 
book. 
A historian! records, “There is no other difference 
except that the rods in the fifteenth century are twice as

long as those in the fourteenth.” ‘Day and night,” said 
an abbot to Saint Anselm, “we do not cease to chastise 
the children confided to our care, and they grow worse 
and worse”; and later we find Montaigne complaining 
bitterly of the harshness of his schooldays. ‘‘ Instead of 
tempting and alluring children to letters by apt and gentle 
ways, our pedants do in truth present nothing but rods, 
ferules, horrors, and cruelty. . . . A pretty way this 
to tempt these tender and timorous souls to love their 
book, with a furious countenance and a rod in the hand.” ‘ 
releases The long reign of tyranny in the schoolroom 
interest, is now happily over, few teachers dream of 
thrashing knowledge into children: the modern endea- 
vour is to make study easy and pleasant. Arouse the 
child’s interest and he will learn without difficulty, is our 
maxim. Therefore teachers procure pictures and models, 
and invent devices, in order to sugar the facts, as it were, 
so that they may be swallowed without distaste on the part 
of the child. Again, it is common to cultivate a fictitious 
interest by bribing the children to acquire facts. We pro- 
mise rewards, prizes, scholarships and other distinctions, 
and the ambition of the pupil is aroused, which is strong 
enough to sustain his interest in his studies, in the hope of 
obtaining these honours for himself. This kind of interest 
is not true interest. To be interested means to love the 
subject and to pursue it for its own sake ; but we have got 
into the way of speaking of interest in connexion with 
teaching as though it were merely a means to an end, instead 
of an end in itself. 
The teacher considers interest a means of 
eae helping the child to acquire facts, and, when
-P-A-G-E-26
  16 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
that end is attained, he usually congratulates himself on the 
success of the means employed; he trusts that the know- 
ledge may remain, though he knows the interest has fled. 
~Herbart demands-a-higher_kind_of interest.._He_reverses_ 
the_usual 1 mode of looking at the matter_and says, “ The 
knowledge must serve to develop the interest, Learning _ 
may y pass a away, but but the interest_must remain throughout 
ife,” 
The acquisition of facts is of less importance during the 
child’s school-life, than the acquisition of interest in the 
world and in mankind. Therefore we cannot test educa- 
tion by the amount of knowledge a child has gained. The 
accuracy and number of the facts which enable young 
people to pass examinations are not a true measurement of 
their powers. If we could calculate the vitality and variety 
of the interests which have come into a child’s life by 
reason of his school instruction, we should be able to judge 
more truly of the value of his education. 
We want to train human beings, and to do this, it is more 
essential to give them right interests than to make them 
learn many facts out of books. 
  This view by no means disparages the value 
Eppeata apoc! of knowledge; for, after all, interest in a sub- 
ae ject is largely a matter of knowledge properly 
related: if the mind contains ideas clearly arranged and 
logically connected on any given subject, this is a favour- 
able condition for the growth of interest in that subject. 
Tom Tulliver might have had more interest in his Latin 
Grammar if he had known “how there came to be such a 
thing as Latin on this earth ;” and that there had existed a 
people “who bought and sold sheep and oxen,” who built 
 
-P-A-G-E-27
  INTEREST AND ITS BEARING UPON INSTRUCTION 17 
walls and fortifications, and went to war with each other, 
through the medium of this language. His interest in 
. Euclid might have been keener if he had understood that a 
man named Euclid had once used these perplexing problems 
for purposes of actual measurement. 
Indirect Herbart distinguishes between indirect and 
Interest. direct interest. Indirect interest leads us to 
pursue some course not for its own sake, but in order to 
gain some advantage, ¢.g. a good place on the examina- 
tion-list, a prize, a scholarship, or an advantageous position 
in life. “Alas!” says Goethe, “for that kind of activity 
which makes us impatient for the end, instead of rejoicing 
by the way.” 
“The more indirect interest predominates,” says Herbart, 
“the more it leads to one-sidedness if not egotism. The 
egotist is interested in things in so far as they bring him 
an advantage or a disadvantage. The one-sided person 
has a tendency towards egotism—it may be partly uncon- 
scious—for he considers everything in its relation to the 
narrow circle in which he lives and thinks.” 
mie Direct interest works from pure motives: 
Taterest. the pleasure which arises from disinterested 
devotion to the subject is reward enough in itself. 
The kind of interest Herbart demands must be direct, 
many-sided, and well-balanced, He distinguishes between 
many-sided and manifold; the latter he describes as a 
“dabbling in many things.” The manifold interest may 
embrace many disconnected ideas, but the many-sided 
interest he compares to the sides of a triangle; for those 
three sides are clearly distinguished from each other, yet 
they form one harmonious whole.

It is impossible in this little work to give a complete 
idea of what the Herbartians mean by interest. To ex- 
plain it fully would mean a thorough discussion of many of 
Herbart’s doctrines. To understand something of its 
importance we must consider Herbart’s view of the mind 
and the ideas it contains. 
Herbert's View One of the favourite problems which philoso- 
efMind.  phers have been trying for centuries to explain 
is the connexion between mind and ideas. 
They usually begin with the mind and ask how it makes 
ideas. Herbart considers ideas and shows how they 
make the mind. 
He says concerning the mind, “It has no innate natural 
talents nor faculties whatever, either for the purpose of 
receiving or for the purpose of producing. It is therefore 
no fabula rasa in the sense that impressions foreign to 
itself may be made upon it; moreover, in the sense in- 
dicated by Leibnitz, it is not a substance which includes 
in itself original activity. 
It has originally neither concepts, nor feelings, nor 
desires. It knows nothing of itself, and nothing of other 
things; also in it lie no forms of perception and thought, 
no laws of willing and action, and not even a remote 
predisposition to any of these. 
The simple nature of the soul is totally unknown and 
forever remains so,” 1 
—Jaeas quicxenea Originally the mind seems of little account ; 
dgcipine it knows nothing, wills nothing, and does 
Wied Action. nothing, until ideas are presented to it and 
  
! Herbart’s Lehrbuch 2ur Psychologie, translated by M. K. Smith.
-P-A-G-E-29
  INTEREST AND ITS BEARING UPON INSTRUCTION 19 
then it becomes an active force. The mind has no power 
of itself to will and to act, for the activity of the will is 
dependent upon the mass of thoughts which make up the 
ideas and with these are intimately connected feelings and 
desires. Willed action, then, depends upon the ideas, 
but all ideas do not produce willed action. The ideas 
may be dull and lifeless; they may only represent a 
dormant store of facts; in this case they cannot give rise 
to activity of will. 
But the ideas may become vitalised by means of inter- 
est, and in this condition they become capable of willed 
action. 
We now see that ideas of goodness may develop into 
ethical conduct, if the interest is strong and abiding. 
“ sestructionana ‘2Nstruction must aim at training the thoughts 
Interest. of the child by means of interest, in order that 
they may he capable of willing, and of willing rightly. 
If the teacher cannot arouse this interest, he will not be 
able to make the school studies morally influence the 
mind of the child. 
\ fst divides interest into two great classes, each of 
hich has three subdivisions. ———_9___—

6. Religious. 
1. Empirical Interest. This is the result of knowledge 
gained by experience and observation. The concrete 
illustrations, object lessons, Kindergarten work, etc., of  
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
our lower classes are aimed at the satisfaction of this 
interest. The Germans in their outdoor observations 
in garden, forest and meadow attempt to satisfy this 
interest very thoroughly. What we call the cultivation 
of the senses is merely satisfaction of the empirical inter- 
est. The young child’s interest is largely empirical. 
2. Speculative Interest. When the child shows a desire 
to pass from mere observation of things to the investigation 
of causes, he exhibits speculative interest. We appeal 
to this interest when we require children to consider the 
reasons of things, and when we lead them to look beyond 
individual cases to generalisations, and to perceive the 
rational connexion between groups of facts or ideas. The 
speculative interest develops later than the empirical 
interest. 
3. esthetic Interest. This interest is stirred by a con- 
templation of the beautiful, the good, and the true. A 
noble action, a sunset flush, an exquisite flower, a beautiful 
poem or picture, arouses lofty emotions in us. 
All teachers have seen a child’s eyes glow with pleasure 
when a fine action is related to him, or when he catches 
the music of a few lines of a beautiful poem. It is to 
gratify this interest that we endeavour to make the school- 
room beautiful with pictures, flowers, and artistic colours. 
I remember watching a number of little girls from the 
dark alleys of a big town walk past the teacher’s desk on 
their way out of school, and turn their eyes with pleasure 
to a blue jar of yellow daffoldils. The schoolroom was 
dingy, but this one bowl of flowers awakened the esthetic 
interest in a hundred little breasts. 
4. The Sympathetic Interest is aroused by the sorrows 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  INTEREST AND ITS BEARING UPON INSTRUCTION 21 
  
and joys of others; it was this feeling that Paul preached 
when he said, “Rejoice with them that rejoice, weep with 
them that weep” (Romans xii. 15). In the family life the 
child’s feeling for mother, father, brothers and sisters, 
fosters this interest first. Later, in the Kindergarten and 
Infants’ School, this feeling is encouraged. 
5. Zhe Social Interest is the feeling of sympathy ex- 
tended beyond the family. In school the child must feel 
himself a part of a community, and must realise his respon- 
sibilities to others. ‘Pluck, endurance, fairness, good 
temper, and energy are the result of school games, the 
learning to give way to others, to be useful, unselfish, 
courteous, to be genial, to take the rough and tumble of 
the world as it comes—to bear the burdens of others,—the 
playing for your own side and not your own bat, the 
training in responsibility that comes from a position in the 
school.” All these are instances of the training of social 
interests which the school affords. 
6. The Religious Interest is not confined to the Scripture 
lessons and prayers in school. All the various duties and 
responsibilities of school life may foster this interest. 
“This spiritual education may come more or less from 
the chance intercourse of school life, from the conversations 
of friends, . . . from the life of those around.” 
The child must become aware of his spiritual nature 
sooner or later. “There is in all of us that mysterious 
spiritual power that whispers to us in a voice we can 
scarcely hear amid the din and bustle of our daily life; 
1 Archdeacon Wilson.

  22 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
it is a voice that speaks to us not of this world and its 
struggles and prizes, but of a wholly different world—of 
heaven, of the ideal, of God.” These are the essential and 
most vital interests which Life presents to us, and hence 
it is a complete recognition of the needs of the child’s 
whole nature that Herbart demands of teachers when he 
insists on the importance of interest in his system of 
Education. “Interest,” he says, “is an expression of our 
whole interest in the world and in humanity.”
-P-A-G-E-33

-P-A-G-E-34
  “The child of six or seven may, without exaggeration, be said to 
come to school from home, the fields and the streets, with his mind 
full of the elements of every department of knowledge. He is already 
a walking miniature encyclopzedia. We are much mistaken if we think 
his mind is waiting for us before it begins to work. It is chockful of 
judgments. 
‘©The teacher’s main business is to take the chaotic child-synthesis 
to pieces, make clear what is confused and build on the foundations 
thus laid. But the teacher never leaves behind him the ordinary ex- 
periences of child-life ; he simply interprets and extends them. It is 
daily life which gives material, and the school which gives interpreta- 
tion, direction and form. Life and the school should be in continual 
reciprocity—never disjoined.”—Laurix, Jnstitutes of Education. 
“Experience and intercourse are the two constant teachers of men.” 
—HERBART. 
“From Nature man attains to knowledge through experience, and to 
sympathy through intercourse.” —HERBART. 
‘‘The parents’ teaching is the kernel of wisdom, and the school- 
master’s business is to make a husk over it.” —PESTALOZZI. 
‘*The proper study for man is his surroundings. So long as he 
knows himself only on the physical side, he must study himself 
through his relations to things, that is his childhood task ; when he 
begins to feel his moral being, he must study himself through his 
relations to men ; that is his life work.” —RoussEAU.

CHAPTER III 
EXPERIENCE—INTERCOURSE—INSTRUCTION 
Formative INTEREST is the aim of all instruction. The 
Tatuenees. child has to be interested in the world and 
in humanity. That is true education, but the instruc- 
tion he receives at school is only one factor in this edu- 
cation. There are other influences at work in forming 
him. 
cnia’szarty During the first years of his life, the little 
Eaperiences. child stores up a vast number of ideas. Jean 
Paul Richter says that the child learns more in the first 
three years of his life than the young man during his 
three years at the University. The infant learns to dis- 
tinguish light from darkness, to recognise sounds, to dis- 
tinguish colours, it touches objects and discovers that they 
are hard, soft, rough or smooth: all these experiences are 
the result of the gratification of his empirical interest. Dr. 
Karl Lange says in his work on Apperception, “It is, in 
fact, astounding what a relatively immense crowd of ideas 
a human being gains in the first years. He gets acquainted 
with the thousand things of home, street, garden, field, 
wood, the wonders of the heavens, the manifold events 
of nature, the land and the people of the neighbourhood, 
and learns to call them by name; he learns to use a great 
part of the vocabulary of his mother-tongue, and its most 
important forms of word and sentence, he learns to think 
25 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  20 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
in the vernacular.” These ideas acquired in early life are 
some of the most important a human being possesses ; they 
are the strongest and most permanent. 
chia'szary But the child’s observations upon the outer 
Intercourse. world are not enough to develop his whole 
nature. They give him knowledge of external things, but 
they fail to touch his emotional nature. 
The child is a social being ; he is sensitive to expressions 
of affection. He soon learns to love and trust his mother, 
and later to extend this love and trust to other members 
of the family. ‘The intimate intercourse of the child with 
father, mother, brothers and sisters easily gives rise to the 
feelings of affection and to benevolence in its preliminary 
form directed toward particular persons only. The social 
intercourse with playmates and others of the same age gives 
rise to sympathy in sorrow and in joy, the feeling of justice 
and of fairness. The helplessness and need that make the 
child run continually to his parents, produce the feeling of 
dependence, of respect and reverence for authority.” 
Herbart calls these two original sources of knowledge, 
Experience and Intercourse. Experience gives the child 
knowledge of the world he lives in, and Intercourse gives 
him ideas respecting his relations to mankind. 
These two influences, Experience and Intercourse, are at 
work long before the teacher steps in with definite instruc- 
tion, and they remain the “constant teachers” of mankind. 
These two influences are important factors in 
Thtcreouets, education but they are insufficient. We cannot sufficient. . :

and Intercourse only bring the child into contact with the

monuments man has left behind him, some 
of the noblest stories of human life and most elevated 
thoughts and beautiful fancies of men and women. 
Again, Experience and Intercourse are insufficient be- 
cause the natural surroundings of a child make up an 
exceedingly limited circle, and, if he depended solely upon 
his personal knowledge for all the ideas he possessed, he 
would become narrow-minded and one-sided. When a 
child has gained a clear notion of a river, having actually 
studied in detail the river nearest his own home, he can 
form an idea of what the Thames, the Ganges, or the 
Amazon, is like, through descriptions, pictures, and maps. 
A great deal of knowledge comes to us through the ex- 
periences of others, who have written accounts of what 
they have seen which we accept on their authority. 
If we relied upon personal intercourse for all the know- 
ledge of mankind, we should probably not fall so short as 
in the realm of Experience, for humanity is the same all 
the world over, and the feelings of our relations and friends 
are more or less like those of the whole of humanity ; but 
we want to extend our Intercourse into other ages and 
nations, and we must again depend upon the records of 
others to supply this knowledge. 's

patience with real human beings. Thus, he derives real 
ideas from original sources. As Herbart says, ‘From 
Nature man attains to knowledge through experience, and 
to sympathy through intercourse.” 
Work of Instruction is a third factor in education ; 
Tastruction. “this is in the hands of the teacher. The teacher 
comes before the young child in his earliest school year; 
he knows that the mind of the child has been actively 
assimilating ideas for years, and he must consider what 
part he is to play in making use of these ideas. 
The teacher must examine the stores of ideas in the 
child’s mind in order that he may—(1) Arrange it; (2) 
Correct it ; (3) Supplement it. 
The child has a wealth of ideas, but they 
were acquired without system and _ without 
order. It is the part of the teacher to talk naturally and 
quietly to the child about the things which interest him. 
The child will readily respond, as the teacher stimulates 
him to collect his masses of ideas and to arrange them 
in an orderly fashion. 
The mental content of the child’s mind, as Lange says, 
“consists of vivid ideas acquired during the most impres- 
sionable years of his life,” and these ideas ought to stand 
in the closest relation to his later culture. 
It is for the teacher “to reach down with regulative hand 
into those quiet, private thoughts and feelings of the child 
in which lie his ego and his whole future, that they may 
rise above the threshold of consciousness and communi- 
cate understanding, clearness, warmth and life to instruc- (1) Arrangement. 
tion.” 
The original ideas of the child, when arranged and put 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
EXPERIENCE—INTERCOURSE—INSTRUCTION 29 
  
in order, are to form the foundation of the new knowledge 
which the teacher brings later. 
The child’s ideas are often incorrect be- 
cause he fixes his attention upon the most 
striking characteristics of an object and entirely disregards 
other details. Again, imagination plays a large part in 
a child’s observations; he sees in many cases what he 
fancies he is going to see, and he is entirely convinced 
afterwards that he has seen it. Again, a child’s ideas are 
so hazy and limited that he is often incapable of judging 
correctly of what he has seen, Hence the experiences of 
children require to be carefully examined and revised by 
the teacher. > (2) Correction. 
The child’s ideas are often incomplete. 
Lange points out that the very strength and 
vitality of a child’s knowledge is a cause of its imperfection. 
The child is one-sided; his range of vision is limited; it 
only covers a few fields; therefore, though his perceptions 
may be strong they are incomplete. “The gaps left by 
intercourse in the little sphere of feeling, and those left 
by experience in the large circle of knowledge, are almost 
equally great, and in the former as well as the latter, com- 
pletion by instruction must be welcome ” (HERBART). 
re ae are apt to magnify the influence ot 
ee Instruction and to consider it the chief factor 
in education, The child and the natural 
contents of his mind are overlooked, and instead of find- 
ing out what thoughts and ideas already exist in his 
mind, and correcting, arranging and adding to them, the 
teacher often endeavours to force upon the child a mass 
of uninteresting facts which have no connexion with the 8) Completion. 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
30 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
child’s mental life, and hence are unintelligible and un- 
interesting to him. 
Herbart points out that in every child there 
exists a circle of thought which he has acquired 
from Experience and from Intercourse. 
This circle of thought is to be extended by Instruction. 
This leads to a consideration of the subjects usually in- 
cluded in our school courses under the name of Instruction. 
Why do we teach Arithmetic, Grammar, Drawing, 
French, Chemistry ? 
Often the answer would be that these sub- 
sees jects are laid down in the Code, or are required 
in the examination. But even Codes and ex- 
aminations are supposed to be guided by some logical 
principle in their selection of subjects to be studied. 
Certain subjects are supposed to have value in the train- 
ing of the child’s mental powers. Object-lessons are said 
to train the observing powers. History trains judgment. 
Arithmetic trains the powers of logical thinking. Literature 
refines the mind. Drawing trains the hand to skill and the 
eye to accuracy, and so on. Here we see that each subject Circle of ‘Thought. 
  is selected on account of some special virtue of its own, 
and a place is found for it on the school time-table. In 
this method of selecting studies there is a danger of over- 
crowding the time-table and of overburdening the child’s 
mind by giving him an amount of superficial information 
on many topics, because each seems to have very special 
reasons for being included. The problem which all 
thoughtful teachers are trying to solve is not How many 
things can I teach the child? but What kind of knowledge 
is worth most to the child?
-P-A-G-E-41
  EXPERIENCE—INTERCOURSE—INSTRUCTION 31 
  
The relative value of studies is beginning to 
exercise many teacher’s minds. The discussion 
usually takes the form of a consideration of the merits of 
languages and science. 
Mr. Herbert Spencer considers the question 
in his essay on Education. He reasons that 
it is well to give the child the knowledge that will help 
him to keep healthy, to make a living and to do his duty 
to his family and the State. Scientific Knowledge pro- 
motes these ends—therefore Scientific Knowledge is of 
most value in education : this is his conclusion. He would 
admit Art, Music and Literature, if time permitted, to fill 
up the leisure portions of life pleasantly. He considers 
what is useful to be of chief importance, and would devote 
the school activities to utilitarian ends. 
The Herbartians consider the whole nature of the child, 
particularly emphasizing the moral development. Relative value of Studies. 
Spencer's View. 
  The Hebartian — ees a z perience which he gains from his environment,   
and Intercourse which he gains from his human relations. 
“Experience refers to the domain of Nature ; Intercourse 
to that of human life.” Instruction comes in to broaden 
and enlarge both these sources of mental life. Instruction, 
therefore, follows two chief lines. It enlarges actual human 
intercourse by means of an ideal intercourse” with men 
and women in poetry, history and literature. (It widens 
the child’s experience of Nature by leading him to observe, 
to collect and to experiment.

These two directions fuse in the general education 
furnished in the schools. All the subjects to be studied 
belong to either of these two groups which direct the 
instruction to be given. 
Prof. Rein and his school consider the 
"undies Humanistic group the more important, because predominate. 
these studies deal with life, develop sympathy, 
and are calculated to directly help on the aim of education, 
the building up of moral character. ‘‘ This conclusion,” he 
says, ‘is by no means intended to express an undervalua- 
tion of any of the single subjects, but it aims at a correct 
proportionment of the amount which they may contribute 
to the formation of the youthful mind and character.” 
We are now in a position to sketch a general plan of the 
Instruction which is to supplement Intercourse and Ex- 
perience.

“An analysis of the elements of culture shows us that 
the work of mankind is directed on the one hand to the

the other hand to the investigation of nature. Accordingly

under the phrases—life of nature and life of mankind.” 1

THE SELECTION OF HISTORICAL MATERIAL AS DETERMINED 
BY THE CULTURE EPOCHS 
History Teaching LHE teaching of History in England, at any 
imEngland.” rate in the primary schools, is on a low level. 
History is still an optional subject, and the statistics in 
the Blue Books for 1896 show that less than one-sixth of 
the schools throughout the country attempt to teach it as 
a class-subject. 
It is curious that in a country where the right of voting 
is almost universal for men, we make no attempt to 
enhance the value of the vote by giving the voter an in- 
telligent knowledge of the past history of his own country. 
Mr. Herbert Spencer considers that history ought to 
“illustrate the right principles of political action,” but he 
complains that our school histories fail in this purpose. 
“Read them, if you like, for amusement,” he says, “but 
do not flatter yourself they are instructive.” 
History Teaching 20 the primary schools in France, History

All the children who pass through them receive a clear 
outline of the history of their own country in its relation 
to other countriés, as well as a few sketches of the striking 
events of Grecian and Roman History, and some general 
account of Eastern civilizations. In the German schools, 
particularly in those professing Herbartian principles, the 
value of History is fully recognised. 
To the Herbartians, History is pre-eminent among the 
school studies. History taken in its broadest sense in-

History in

of instruction, because it is considered of 
primary importance in moulding the character and in 
stimulating interest. 
History records the deeds of human beings, their aspira- 
tions, motives, actions, triumphs and failures; it shows 
the relations of individuals to each other, to society, and 
to the State. The noblest thoughts of human beings are 
stored up in Literature, and man’s sense of beauty finds 
expression in Art, in Music and in Architecture. 
Beet * \We cannot be interested in things unless 
Sepenl pom we understand them, and we cannot understand 
things as they are, unless we know how they 
came to be so; therefore we must study the past in order 
to comprehend the present. This comprehension will 
help us to realize modern civilization, and to face our 
responsibilities as intelligently as possible. It always 
costs more trouble to do things intelligently than to 
follow an unintelligent routine, and in the teaching of 
History, as in other affairs of life, it is easier to follow 
beaten tracks than to find out the best. 
ns History teaching often becomes mere lists 
Pate of dates and dreary outlines. These have no 
influence upon the child’s life; they do not 
put before him ideals of conduct and help to form his 
character. Certainly, a knowledge of dates and accurate 
information concerning the names of all the leaders in a 
battle and the exact terms of treaties help children to 
pass examinations, and the school to procure satisfactory 
Government grants. These temporal benefits pass away,

however, and leave the child very much as they found 
him ; but true History teaching may powerfully influence 
his whole life, and every one must admit that it is not 
what a child knows, but what he becomes that is of chief 
importance. 
ease Bishop Butler recognized this when, in a 
more sermon preached more than one hundred and Importance 
than fifty years ago on behalf of London Charity Information. 
Schools, he said: ‘Of education, information 
itself is really the least part.” 
Our modern examination system seems to point to a 
contrary opinion being held, but its chief raison d’étre is 
that it is easy to work, for information is readily tested, 
while the qualities which make up character are not, 
Montaigne regarded history as a means of moral training, 
and Locke held that “as nothing teaches, so nething de- 
lights more than history.” 
je heii Dr. Arnold placed a high value ori the use of 
View. History in education, and Mathew Arnold pays 
a tribute to his father’s life and teaching. / 
‘* And through thee, I believe f 
In the noble and great who are gong.” 
True History teaching should place beffre all the child- 
ren in the country some of these noble anjd great men, and 
so help to raise them to a higher moral a 
More than fifty years ago Dr. Arnold sketched a scheme 
for the teaching of History. It is so yauch in accord with 
the Herbartian method that I mention/it here. 
Sete He would have young children taught through 
imeaching pictures taken from the Bible, from Roman, ‘Histo.

to form the text of graphic and simple stories. Any one 
who has watched the eager interest of young children over 
pictures and their stories will realize how much can be done 
for them in this way. Recently I have been observing 
two bright twin-boys of six years. Every morning as soon 
as it was light they came to my room with two great 
volumes of Shakespeare, and asked for the stories of Cesar, 
Shylock, Ariel, and Macbeth from the pictures. The 
Shakespeare stories and Robinson Crusoe form their world 
of romance at present. 
Dr. Arnold would give the boys of the middle forms of 
a school vivid and lively sketches from the histories of 
Greece, Rome and England. He says that the main pur- 
pose of these studies is to excite interest and to stimulate 
a desire | for further knowledge. In the upper forms he 
requires that the boys should study some first-rate historian. 
The Herbartians in working out their scheme for History 
teaching seem to agree in sentiment with Bishop Butler, 
Montaigne, and Locke, and in practice with Dr. Arnold. 
\\ Stories from English History predominate too Predominance ° * : :

especially, no attempt is made to enlighten the children

that of the Jews } and Bible teaching is given under special 
conditions without relation to any other subject. 
The responsibility of selecting suitable historical narra- 
tive for children which lies upon the teacher is great. A 
whole world of histary lies behind us and the child is heir 
to it. The Herbartijans are guided by the following con- 
siderations in their chbice :—

  THE SELECTION OF HISTORICAL MATERIAL 39 
  
Firstly, the selected matter must suit the Child’s Taste. « oe . : 
———child’s taste and capacity, for the mind takes in 
nothing that does not suit it, and true interest is awakened 
only when an appetite is created. 
Secondly, the narrative should present some 
inspiring example, or contain some ethical 
truth. It was Butler who defined History as “ philosophy 
teaching by examples,” and the Herbartians would make 
History teaching a series of Object-lessons in Morals. 
In considering the comparative suitability of the histories 
of Jack the Giant Killer, the Black Prince, and Mr. Glad- 
stone, for a child of five years of age, nobody but a Grad- 
grind would hesitate in choosing the first. 
y Jack, as a hero, accords most with the child’s § ‘The Remote is : 
+ Attractive to taste and understanding, because Jack belongs 
Me to the same stage of culture as the child. A Ss 
slight experience of children soon teaches us that they are 
psychically nearer to remote ages than the present: there- 
fore, we do not attempt to put complicated froblema of 
modern life before the young child. We know that the 
present rests upon the past, and only by a knowledge of 
the past does the present become intelligible.

ment. The policeman, the postman, the Lord 
Mayor’s Show, the Queen’s birthday, a regiment of soldiers, 
are familiar sights in the child’s life. These may be taken 
as object-lessons, and the child will gain some idea of civic 
authorities, the State and its defenders, long before it is pre- 
pared to study these matters at all thoroughly. The child 
is interested in his environment: therefore he must receive

simple explanations of it. It is, however, a mistake to 
confine the child exclusively to his environment, and to 
refuse to gratify his natural tastes with stories of earlier 
ages. ‘I don’t want my children to know what a party of 
tomfools in steel coats did a thousand years ago,” said an 
eminent statesman, “but I do want them to know the 
clauses in the last Beer Bill—that is practical knowledge.” 
So he substituted Parliamentary Documents for Histories 
in his nursery and schoolroom. He valued facts and 
ignored the ethical value of History. As Carlyle tells us, 
“Great men taken up in any way are profitable com- 
pany. We cannot look, however imperfectly, upon a 
great man without gaining something by him. He is the 
living light fountain, which it is good and pleasant to 
be near.”

you hate Mer basins?” said a bright little girl to her 
aunt the other day. She was learning by heart long lists 
of river-basins, and she had never been made to observe a 
real one; hence she hated river-basins, just as children 
who are required to learn by heart collects, psalms and 
chapters of the Bible as Sunday tasks, hate them. It 
striking human examples of goodness, courage, truth 
and falsehood from the pages of the Bible or profane 
history are put before children, they form their own 
moral judgments very readily and often with surprising 
correctness. 
Some of the finest examples of teaching are to be found 
in the Gospels. The «ttention of the common people was

which the race has passed through in its development

appeal to the understanding of the child, or Jouch the 
springs of his intellect, or pourtray to him hical rela- 
tions capable of claiming his attention, ond¥should be 
mindful of these epochs.” 
Dr. Rein in his Outlines of Pedagogics points out that 
“this idea of the analogy between individual and general 
development of humanity is a common possession of the 
best intellects. He quotes a number of authorities in 
    support of this theory. 
Mr. Herbert Spencer lays down as one ot 
the guiding principles of instruction that “ the 
education of the child must accord ‘both in mode and 
arrangement with the education of mankind considered 
historically, in other words the genésis of knowledge in 
the individual must follow the same’ course as the genesis 
of knowledge in the race.” Spencer's View.

The theory of the Culture Epochs is sug- Theory of . : : 
culture Epochsa gestive, and in a general way guides many 
rae tamane teachers, half unconsciously it may be, in their 
= selection of suitable subject-matter for children; 
but the Herbartians go further, and define the successive 
stages as the Primitive, the Hunting, the Pastoral and 
so on. Ziller, who was one of the chief expounders of 
Herbart’s doctrines, expresses himself clearly and confi- 
dently on this theory. He says: “The mental development 
of the child corresponds in general to the chief phases in 
the development of the people or of mankind. The mind- 
development of the child, therefore, cannot be better 
furthered than when he receives his mental nourishment 
from the general development of culture as it is laid down 
in literatlre and history. Every pupil should accordingly 
pass sucdisively through each of the chief epochs of the 
general m@ tal development of mankind suitable to his 
stage of adWancement”; therefore the material of instruc- 
tion “should be drawn from the thought material of that 
stage of historical development in culture which runs 
parallel with the present mental state of the pupil.” The 
Herbartians consider that History is real character-forming _ 
material, and place it as the centre of all the subjects to be 
studied ; the other subjects group themselves around it and 
are in some measure subordinated to it.   
Humanistic material.” These sections are arranged in pro-

various stages of culture in the child during the eight years 
of his school life—from the age of six to that of fourteen. 
The history of the Jewish nation and the rise of Chris- 
tianity are in Herbartian schools studied historically side 
by side with secular history. The following is a specimen 
sketch of the historical material, from Biblical and general 
sources, which forms the core of instruction in such a 
school.

other subjects studied in connexion with this character- 
forming material, will be found in a later chapter.

They are the subjects which receive the best attention of 
the most skilled teachers in the school. A stranger who ee Ps ° wishes to hear some of the school teaching is invariably 
asked to attend the Bible and History lessons. Some of 
the best Scripture lessons I have ever listened to were 
given in Herbartian schools. It will be noticed that in the 
first and second school years there is no definite Bible 
teaching. It is believed that the child is not yet in the 
stage of culture capable of duly appreciating it. The child 
is in the myth-making age, and its tastes must be gratified 
by fairy tales and stories of the struggles of primitive man. 
But Bible teaching is not wholly neglected in the lower 
classes. The school life is closely associated with the 
home life and the Church life. The Church festivals— 
Christmas, Easter and Whitsuntide — are very carefully 
observed. The children learn suitable hymns, and hear 
stories of the chief events in the life of Christ in connexion 
with these festivals. But the definite systematic instruc- 
tion is reserved until the child is of an age to begin to 
appreciate it. :

of the British nation up to the present time. These events

given to the children. A scheme of Sacred History similar 
to that in use in the German schools could be used advan- 
tageously side by side with the secular history. Patriarchs, 
Judges, Kings, the life of Christ, the Apostles, the growth 
of the Christian Church, taught systematically year by year, 
would help the child clearly to establish the Christian 
ideal, and to understand its significance in the history of 
the Crusades, the idea which animated the early colonists 
who, like Columbus, wished to carry Christianity to heathen 
nations, the Pilgrim Fathers, and the strifes in connexion 
with the Reformation. After such a history course in the 
school life, every child would know a little of the forma- 
tive influences of some of the great nations of the world. 
The founding of Troy, and the stories of Helen, Achilles, 
and Ulysses would at any rate teach him that the Greeks 
had existed. The Founding of Rome and Julius Cesar, 
Alaric and the Fall of Rome, would leave the impression of 
the rise and fall of a powerful nation. 
A careful study of the history of the Jews and the rise 
of Christianity and its later struggles, amplified by lessons 
on the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, would cer- 
tainly show how powerfully Christianity affected the history 
of mankind, and a bold sketch of the men and events 
which made the British nation would help the children to 
become worthy citizens. The manner in which Literature 
and the other subjects are grouped around history is con- 
sidered in another chapter. [

tmagination ot We have seen that the young child is in 
et the myth-making age; therefore he is pro- 
foundly interested in fairy tales, because they appeal to 
his imagination, and depict strongly, humanely, and 
vividly the relations of human beings to each other. 
“His mental state is very like that of primitive people, 
who attribute life and feeling to material objects and in- 
vest all things with human and divine qualities.”1 The 
child has a lively imagination, he delights in personi- 
fication, His dramatic instincts lead him to invent all 
kinds of scenes in which he himself is an actor ; he repre- 
sents all kinds of objects to himself after his own image, 
and he enters into conversations with imaginary animals

and inanimate things. Nothing is too exalted to enter 
into the fancies of children. Says Wordsworth : 
‘*Oh! give us once again the wishing cap 
Of Fortunatus, and the invisible coat 
Of Jack the Giant Killer, Robin Hood, 
And Sabra in the forest with St. George ! 
The child, whose love is here, at least doth reap 
One precious gain, that he forgets himself.” 
Colonel Parker says: ‘The liveliest conscious activity 
of a child is fancy; the little creator creates his own 
world, and lives, moves, and has his being in it. All 
history proves this; myths, parables, fairy tales, have 
made children and childish peoples happy throughout the 
Poetical Valueor 28S: Myths and fairy tales are the sure 
FairyTales’ sions of the upturning of the hearts of the 
little ones to God. The proper function of fancy in intel- 
lectual life is spirituality. Spiritual truths are hidden in 
the precious honey of stories.” 
“Fairy tales prepare the child to appreciate poetry, and 
the human element in them satisfies his historic instinct.” 4 
Fairy tales are not falsehoods, and the child who is 
amused or frightened by them is not deceived for an in- 
stant. Stories are the ideal, something truer than actual 
truth ; the triumph of the good, the beautiful, the true.”

and in bad taste, should be avoided. Simple, chaste, and 
naive the stories may be, but not sentimental. The Child is Akin 
patra = The people in fairy tales accord with the 
casual, inconsequent manner in which a child 
thinks. Kings, queens, and courts are represented with 
charming simplicity. No half-and-half measures, no hesi- 
tating over motives, disturb the beautiful directness of the 
actions of these fairyland personages. They are good 
or bad, and they marry princesses or have their heads cut 
off accordingly. The giants are big, wicked, and woefully 
stupid; the valiant mortals who attack them are good, 
brave, and quick-quitted, and they always win. This 
satisfies poetical justice. Life in fairyland has its trials, 
but it is exciting and full of compensations. “In general, 
the people think and feel altogether like children. Just 
as the child knows only good and bad people in his inter- 
course, according to the sympathy or antipathy which they 
inspire in him, so also in the fairy tales the persons are 
either good or bad. In them the impatient feeling of jus- 
tice, so characteristic of young people, is always satisfied.” +

terial in the first school year, when the child is six years 
of 2 of age. age. Prof. Rein, o of Jena, and others, have selected a 
series of fairy tales suitable for this stage, and have also 
worked out the method of dealing with these stories in 
class, and shown how the other subjects are connected 
with them.? “The Town Musicians of Bremen,” “Snow 
White and Rose Red,” “The Wolf and the Fox,” “The

Wren King and the Bear,” are among the stories chosen. 
The choice of the tales depend, in some measure, upon the 
Igeality in which the child lives, so that the home surround- ings may be interwoven with the thread of the story. 
mo zthieal Vain, “Lhe_Herbartians emphasize the ethical value 
ofRairy Tales. of the fairy tale. Ziller puts the case clearly 
in summing up the “use of fairy tales. He says: ‘These 
tales being poetical are better suited than anything else to 
the earliest stage of the child’s individuality, when imagin- 
ation, which needs cultivation because in it all higher 
aspirations are rooted, is strongest. They are not limited 
by time or space, for they are often without the names of 
persons or places. The child lives in them beyond the 
limits of the material, makes the dead living, puts a soul 
into the soulless, and has intercourse with the whole world 
as his equal. This has no bad influence on him, for the 
tales contain, besides their subjective view of things, a 
number of objective, esthetic, and ethical ideas and prin- 
ciples consonant with reason. They serve especially to 
exercise the ethical judgment, as the tales open out a large 
field where many true and simple cases come before the 
child, upon which he can decide easily, quickly, and 
clearly.” 
The method of presenting the story in the 
senting the Fury German schools is to divide it into sections, 
each of which contains one or two striking 
points, and to discuss each section with the children, 
encouraging them to add their experiences and suggestions 
to the discussion. Thus in the story of Hiihnchen und 
Hiihnchen, after the two had spent the day on the hills 
where the nuts grew, they were disinclined to walk home.
-P-A-G-E-67
  HUMANISTIC STUDIES 57 
“Why?” “Perhaps they were tired,” cries one boy, “or 
lazy ” suggests a second, “or ate too many nuts,” suggests 
another. ‘They may have become too proud to walk,” is 
a fourth speculation. ‘In any case they decide to drive,” 
declares the teacher, “ but where can they get a carriage?” 
“Make one,” is the prompt reply. ‘‘How?” ‘They can 
cut down trees.” “They might find some iron.” “My 
brother made a carriage out of an old chair.” ‘“ My father 
can make a wheelbarrow.” “They could make a carriage 
out of a beer barrel,” are the remarks and suggestions in 
reply to this query. 
“Well,” resumes the teacher, “they made their carriage 
out of nut-shells.” A ripple of laughter went round the 
class at this announcement, and an eager discussion began. 
“T can make a butterfly carriage out of walnut shells,” 
declared one freckled-faced mite. ‘Cocoanut shells are 
bigger than walnut shells.” “What a lot of shells they 
would want!” ‘Did they gum them all together?” were 
some of the remarks made. When the story has been 
discussed in this way—and it often takes several days to 
get through one story—the teacher reads it slowly and 
distinctly in the words of the author. There is no watering 
down the literature to suit the children ; they are taken to 
the original source at once, in order to accustom them to 
a good style. 
esta: These lessons on the story are language 
Zesson; lessons, inasmuch as the children contribute 
more than the teacher to the discussion. They express 
their own thoughts in their own simple language. This is 
corrected, and in the frequent recapitulations the children 
are required to narrate the whole story in their own words.

Dramatictustinets heir dramatic instincts are appealed to by 
appesledto. their being required to act the story. There is 
no preparation, no apparatus. This acting is very simple 
and quite impromptu. Two or three children are called 
out. One is Hiihnchen, another is Hahnchen, a third 
represents the duck. ‘But where is the carriage?” “TI 
know,” cries a small boy, and he turns a chair upside down. 
The pointer is the whip, and the table the inn, and so they 
go on inventing the dialogue and acting the story with 
great seriousness and evident enjoyment. The drawing 
lessons are delightful. The children make rough sketches 
to illustrate objects or incidents in the story. The duck, 
the pin, and the needle, the egg which the duck laid, and so 
on. Songs are selected which bear upon the home life or 
es. a school work. All the festivals of Church and 
ee earth civil life are observed, and hymns and patri- 
otic songs are learned and sung. Christmas 
is, of course, associated with the story of the Child

general festivities,

festival. Sedantag is a day given up to pro- 
cessions, sports and games in the meadows. All the chil- 
dren assemble in the school in the morning, and sing 
thanksgiving and patriotic songs, recite war ballads, and 
hear an address on the victory. The games are organized 
in the meadows, and all the girls are dressed in white, with 
garlands in their hair, while the boys wear a sash. They 
are refreshed in the intervals of the games, not with tea and 
buns, but white beer and bread-and-sausage. The last-

named national dainty is cooked out of doors under the 
trees on huge gridirons, and clouds of blue smoke are 
emitted in the process, which hang over the meadows and 
become a part of one’s memory of a Sedan school festival. 
In the second school-year the children are 
seven years old. The literary material given 
to them at this stage is Aobimson Crusoe. Rousseau was 
one of the first to recognise the educational value of 
Robinson Crusoe; and Ziller was the first to give it a re- 
cognised place in a systematic plan of instruction. The 
imagination of the child has been fostered by the fairy tale ; 
it must still be kept lively, but its activity must be limited, 
and the child must be led into the realm of the possible. 
aiaeaan ae Rousseau exclaims that he hates books. 
Robinson Crusee«e They only teach us to talk about what we 
do rot understand.” He makes an exception, however, in 
favour of Robinson Crusoe. He considers it sufficient for 
Emile’s entire library. “It shall be the text on which all 
our discussions of natural science shall be only commen- 
taries.”1 He would have his pupil carried away by the 
story, he should play Robinson Crusoe, and go through all 
the experiences for himself. 
Ziller shows how Robinson Crusoe takes the child back 
into prehistoric times, when man, through many obstacles, 
made himself master of nature. The child learns in the 
story of Robinson Crusoe to realize those early times and 
the value of simple inventions. He gains his first insight 
into the history of invention and culture. Robinson must 
build his own house, find his own food, make his own Robinson Crusoe.

rude pottery, and his own simple clothes. With these 
Relation between incidents are closely associated a wealth of 
Robinson and txe Material in elementary geography, natural 
pace science, drawing and observation. All this 
helps to make the story valuable for school purposes. 
The method of presenting the story follows that of the 
fairy tales. Some details of these lessons are given later. 
Ageotuerto Lhe Herbartians give the children heroic 
Sagas. —_ sagas as the literary material in the third school- 
year. Herbart declared in favour of Greek sagas; but as 
Germany is rich in heroic stories, the German sagas are 
usually preferred in German schools. William Morris says 
that the story of the Volsungs is the great national saga of 
the North, and he would have it to be to our race what the 
tale of Troy was to the Greeks. It may become a part of 
our school material for a later generation when it is more 
accessible for school purposes. 
The German Sagas tell of the heroes of the 
“Minton German people. The child soon becomes 
NativeSags8 familiar with them. They speak his language 
and live in his land. ‘These bold heroes into whose 
world of thought and deed he has already been introduced 
by the stories of the neighbourhood, the castle ruins grey 
with age, the knights’ armour and weapons, popular belief 
and legend.”! These heroes “still live on in the mouth 
and hearts of the German people.” 
“The Saga treads earthly ways more than 
withistorical the fairy tale, and turns with preference to 
Mewes human figures and deeds, as it connects its 
  
1 Lange,
-P-A-G-E-71
    HUMANISTIC STUDIES 61 
  
tales with definite persons and places, and not seldom 
mingles with these some real historical facts, and so it 
forms the natural transition from the fairy tale to history.” 
One cannot help being impressed by the 
influence of the Thuringian Sagas on the lives 
of the children. Ludwig is a very real person to them, and 
the Wartburg, Rudelsburg, Freiburg, and other castles in 
the country excite their profoundest interest. “Have you 
no Ludwig in England?” a little boy asked me as he re- 
counted to me deeds of his hero during a walk to the 
Wartburg. “ Aren’t you sorry you haven’t a Ludwig?” he 
persisted. I wondered to how many English children 
Alfred ing Arthur were such real personages, 
Herbart insisted that stories from the clas- 
Mine intuance of / sical age of childhood among the Greeks 
“et furnished fit mental food for children. “ Give 
them an ‘interesting story,” he writes, “rich in incidents, 
relationships, characters, strictly in accordance with psycho- 
logical truth not beyond the feelings and ideas of children ; 
make no effort to depict the worst or best, only let a faint 
half-unconscious moral tact secure that the interest of the 
action tends away from the bad towards the good, the just 
and the right, then you will see how the child’s attention is 
fixed on it, how it seeks to discover the truth and think 
over all sides of the matter.” 
Such a story, he says, must “carry on its face the stamp 
of human greatness,” for children readily distinguish the 
commonplace. The boy of eight wishes to be a man; his 
outlook extends beyond all stories written to children. 
“Present to the boy, therefore, such men as he himself 
would like to be, Such you will certainly not find near Thuringian Sagas.
-P-A-G-E-72
    62 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
at hand, for the boy’s ideal of the man corresponds to 
nothing which has grown up under the influence of our 
present culture.” 
This ideal personality, Herbart says, is to be Method of < : 
ca ee found in Greek stories, and he commends us to 
the history of Achilles and Ulysses. 
The method of teaching the Sagas is the same in the 
main as in the fairy tales. The following is an outline of a 
lesson I heard on Ludwig at Altenburg : 
The teacher stated the aim of the lesson thus: ‘“ Why 
was Landgraf Ludwig named the Springer ?” 
As the lesson developed the boys sat fascinated with 
interest. At the first halting place the points were summed 
up: 
1. Ludwig had committed a sin. 
2. The Kaiser had thrown him in prison. 
3. He was destined to die. 
He was imprisoned in the castle called Giebichenstein, 
situated on a high rock, below which the river Saale flowed. 
He was closely watched. Then followed a vivid account of 
the cunning he employed to deceive his keepers,—how he 
wrapped himself up in many clothes and threw himself from 
the tower into the river below ; how he escaped on a white 
horse, and how later he built a church to expiate his sin. 
I afterwards visited the castle near Halle and the church 
in company with school children, and I was again thrilled 
by accounts of the famous leap. 
A Saga reading-book is used which contains the sub- 
stance of the stories simply written in good German, A 
general reading-book is also used; this contains prose and 
poetical selections which are read in connexion with the

History and Natural Science and geographical descriptions. 
The Bible is also read in school. The rough sketching, be-

Stories. draw towers, gateways, bridges, and castles, 
Sometimes they draw a whole series of pictures to illustrate 
the story. These are not accurate or finished productions, 
but they are often vivid. The story of Ludwig and the 
poor pedlar was illustrated by a boy of eight, who showed 
them to me with keen interest. The market place at Eisen- 
ach, Ludwig on his steed attended by a crowd of knights, 
the winding path up to the Wartburg and the castle in the 
distance, the pedlar with his pack, were all depicted and ex- 
plained to me by the boy. 
aoe The lessons in the mother tongue consist of 
Lessons. the forming of sentences, and continual practice 
in speaking correctly in continuous narrative. All the 
lessons in the lower classes appear to be language lessons 
more or less. The geography lessons and the school 
excursions and journey are closely connected with the 
sagas. This point is discussed in the next chapter. 
pice After the child has studied the stories of his 
Sees. own district, he rises to the National Saga, the 
Wibelungenlied ; Siegfried, and Gundrun become his heroes. 
These stories are used as the historical material, and are 
read ina simple prose reading-book, while poems such as 
Uhland’s “Siegfried’s Sword” are read and learnt in con- 
nexion with them. The geography studied in connexion 
with these Siegfried stories is the Rhine and Danube. 
ee “The most useful exercise of imagination,” 
History. says Professor Blackie, “is when it buckles
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
itself to realities.” In the fifth school-year the child, 
having passed through the myth-making age and the age 
of heroic romance, is confronted with real history. He 
studies the lives of Otto the Great, Charlemagne, Alfred 
the Great, and other famous characters “‘ who incarnate the 
history which they create.” 
These stories are presented to the children in vivid 
pictures. The teacher’s language needs colour, in order to 
bring before the child’s imagination the very men them- 
selves. 
The child has now reached the age of reality, and his 
further studies are taken from the pages of history. 
In the sixth, seventh, and eighth school-years he gets a 
good outline of the history of his own country, as well as 
some general idea of striking events and persons in other 
lands. In the Karolinen Schule in Eisenach I found that 
the girls studied the Elizabethan Age, Louis XIV. and XV., 
The French Revolution, Napoleon I., France and Italy in 
the Nineteenth Century, and a little Oriental History. 
The Reading lessons tend to supplement and 
add interest to the historical studies. The use 
of the school reading-book is described in Das dritte 
Schuljahr by Herr Pickel, one of the teachers in the Uses of Reading- 
Books in School, 
Eisenach school. He says the function of the reading, 
book “is to prepare for, deepen, and bring into a connected 
whole the various sections of the general instruction. It 
should, for example, embrace in history, literary products 
rising out of a period and about it, through which a glance 
is opened into the varying culture of bygone days, namely, 
historical saga, poems, simple historical narratives from the 
original sources, and, besides these, descriptions of events
-P-A-G-E-75
HUMANISTIC STUDIES 65 
  
(historical pictures), such as serve both as connecting-links 
for the instruction and as models of narrative style. For 
the geography and MVarurkunde it should contain descrip- 
tions complete in themselves and beautiful, including 
suitable poems so far as these can be provided by our 
literature.” 
The Reading-books in the German schools form a valu- 
able connecting link between the various school studies 
and the home life and environment of the children. 
Special Reading. | Special Reading-books are prepared for special 
Books. districts ; therefore the historical associations and 
geographical peculiarities of the child’s own neighbourhood 
are introduced. The importance of giving children infor- 
mation of their own surroundings cannot be too strongly 
emphasized. In the reading: books used in Thuringia are to 
be found “‘ The Jena Church,” ‘The Battlefield of Jena,” 
“The Thuringian Forest,” “The Wartburg,” “The Saale,” ! 
“ Eisenach,” ‘ Luther,” “The Erl-King,”? selections from 
Schiller’s Song of the Bell.8 Stories of the great men of 
Weimar and of Goethe and Schiller are very suitably placed 
in these Reading-books. 
Stirring ballads by great writers, which serve 
to intensify the historical narratives, are also 
read and committed to memory. Germany is rich in such 
ballads, and they form an essential part ot school Reading- 
books. ‘‘Siegfried’s Sword,” “ Barbarossa,” “ Arminius,’ 
“Charlemagne,” ‘“ King Otto I.,” “ Gundrun’s Lament,” are 
examples of such poems. Ballads.

The best German patriotic songs are always to be found

It is hardly necessary to mention that the Reading-books 
are not read straight through. Portions are carefully 
selected which bear upon the other lessons. 
The point I particularly wish to emphasize 
vee Relation here is the value of logical sequence and the 
otises ‘relations of ideas. ‘The Herbartians endeav- 
our to give what they call “educative instruction” by 
awakening thoughts and groups of thoughts in the pupils’ 
minds in connected order. One idea is linked to its 
natural companion, and new ideas are grasped and linked 
to the group to which they ought to belong. 
Hence the child learns “to know by wholes,” 
Miueas, but it’ as Plato says, and in time he comes to regard 
Meet Be? the world not as a few groups of scattered 
events, but as a harmonious unit. It is the low stage of 
intelligence that supposes objects to exist in independent 
groups; the trained and thoughtful mind sees relations. 
We know that the human mind has a natural tendency 
to unify its knowledge, but it is unreasonable to thrust 
all kinds of disconnected facts haphazard upon unformed 
childish minds, and to expect them to arrange these facts 
logically. 
Many of our school Reading-books contain excellent 
literary and historical matter, but we too often neglect 
sequence and points of relation in our use of them.

ain Regard to one finds, and the children read straight on

the world’s progress. If the development of the child 
is the aim which is to rule our school curriculum, we 
must consider the sequence of events and the relation-

We spend a large portion of time in our 
Wes readiag primary schools in requiring children to read 
literary selections, much of which seems wasted 
effort, for rarely do the children acquire either the power 
of reading aloud intelligibly, or a taste for good literature. 
Bs A recent circular from the Educational De- 
arate or partment calls attention to the slovenly enun- 
Thought. cjation and the monotonous intonation in the 
reading of school children, and the enormous increase of 
late years in scrappy and worthless publications ot the 
Tit-bits and Scraps type indicates that though our grow- 
ing and adult population can read, the taste for ephe- 
meral and even pernicious literature is increasing at an 
alarming rate. 
The chief aim of the reading lessons in our primary 
schools is too frequently to get through so many reading- 
books in an allotted time. When the teacher has defined 
some of the unfamiliar words in the passage and made a 
few impatient observations on neglected aspirates, and re- 
quired the children to read through the whole piece simul- 
taneously and breathlessly, and a few children have read 
individually, often in an inaudible or slovenly manner, the 
lesson is supposed to be concluded satisfactorily. 
That the reading of literature in school has 
uence high moral influence is a matter that the 
Scheel. teacher rarely considers. Matthew Arnold was 
constantly emphasizing this. He says, “The reading 
lessons should be used not only to secure the bare power 
of reading—a most valuable power . . . but they should 
be made to contribute to the opening of the soul and 
imagination.”

7O HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
It is admirable that a child should be able to read a 
passage of /Judius Cesar or a ballad of Macaulay clearly 
and distinctly, but it is more admirable if he be able to 
feel and appreciate them. 
“To be incapable of a feeling of poetry,” says Words- 
worth, “in my sense of the word, is to be without love 
of human nature and reverence for God.” 
ae At is not my intention to discuss the 
paeee tare difficulties of teaching reading; I merely 
wish to suggest how a love of literature 
may be fostered. Local interest, careful selection 
of stirring ballads, and beautiful descriptions, associated 
with other studies, clear comprehension of the subject, 
and proper treatment of the reading material have much 
to do with arousing interest in the lessons, 
The selection and proper treatment of good literary 
material are of the profoundest importance in our school 
instruction. Upon this depends the child’s interest in the 
world and in humanity, which he will seek to gratify in 
after-life by reading real literature. 
To be able to read with sustained pleasure 
tsNeceryin such works as Hypatia, Julius Cesar, Ivanhoe, 
Eesiaparvctate’ or Romola, requires a certain amount of pre- 
ert liminary training, combined with some classic, 
historic, and geographic interest, and those who have 
listened to stories of the Greeks, the Goths, the Romans, 
the Saxons, and the Florentines, will read with satisfaction 
and comprehension, because they ‘can relate the incidents 
with previous knowledge and locate the events in the 
progress of the world,

Uterature periods in the world’s history of thought are 
massed together chronologically as groups of 
mountains. Children will readily draw such charts. They 
may take the form of rivers, trees, chains, as the faney 
dictates. No reading or literature lessons should be 
permitted to take place without such a chart drawn upon

We have briefly considered the first group Connexion 4 < a 
between Of subjects, and it now remains to us to 
Natural Science consider the second group, and discover how 
Reet may be arranged with reference to the 
first group in order to obtain points of connexion. The 
idea prevails among some teachers that history is a 
distinct study, having no connexion with geography, and 
that a child can learn geography in junior classes and 
history in senior classes. Geography and history are 
natural companions, and should be studied side by side. 
Compayré says, “The history of France is the soul of 
the country and the natural geography is its body.” 
Geography teaching is on a fairly respectable footing in 
our primary schools, Mr. Bain tells us “that geography, 
after arithmetic, is the study that is most advanced in 
respect of method.” 
stuay oronna’s Lhe method generally recognised in our 
Environment. schools follows the principles laid down by

Reclus more or less thoroughly. “We must always take 
as a starting-point what the child sees; but does he see 
nothing more than the school and his village? He sees 
also the infinite heaven, the sun, stars, and moon. He 
sees the storms, the clouds, the rain, the distant horizon, 
the mountains, the hills, the downs, or simple undulations, 
and trees and shrubs. This is real geography, and to 
learn it the child has not to go beyond the things which 
surround him, and which are exhibited to him in their 
infinite variety.” We know that the child’s mind is full 
of ideas which he has gained at home, in the streets, 
fields, and lanes, by means of experience. The instruc- 
tion which the teacher must bring to enlarge the child’s 
store of experiences should be taken from the same 
source, the surroundings of the child. ‘The child on 
entering school,” says Lange, “ has mastered only a limited 
part of his surroundings, and many of his home observa- 
tions need clearing up and sifting; we lead him back 
into the old familiar world in which he has hitherto lived, 
and which is dear to him. We teach him to know it 
better, and to make him more familiar with it we develop 
a knowledge of his home environment.” 
ee The Heimatkunde or study of the home 
pcuecsiba surroundings which one finds in the lower 
classes in the German schools, is a true in- 
troduction to real geography. Heimatkunde is a com- 
prehensive word. It includes the plants of the garden, 
the trees and creatures of the forest, the industries of the 
village or town, and the agricultural products, as well as 
a very careful study of the hills, valleys, rivers and 
streams in the immediate neighbourhood. These Heimat-
-P-A-G-E-87
  NATURAL SCIENCE STUDIES 75 
  
kunde lessons correspond to our object lessons, with 
the difference that there is much more active observation 
on the part of the German child, and the lessons 
frequently take place out of doors, in the garden, the 
forest, or meadow, by the river, on the hill, or in the 
valley. Only those things which come under the child’s 
personal observation are studied. Lessons, for instance, 
on the papyrus reed or the kangaroo would be 
hana poets excluded as being beyond the child’s experi- 
febearoit ence, ‘The proper time to teach these would 
be when the child was studying Egypt and Australia. If 
a menagerie visited the town or village, and the children 
were able to make their own observations on the lion 
and elephant, lessons on these animals would be suitable 
and necessary. 
It is not uncommon in English schools to find general 
subjects such as ‘ Trees,” “A bunch of spring flowers,” 
included in a list of object lessons. Lange especially warns 
teachers against general discussions on the “seasons,” 
“ garden,” “forest,” etc., and points out that they should 
rather start with a definite “ mountain,’ pond, or river of 
the neighbourhood, and always return to it, if thereby “ ob- 
scured and unsettled ideas can be lifted into clearness.” 
“Not the general, but only the particular, the special, the 
individual, can be an object of these Heimatkunde lessons. 
The child studies the class-room and school- 
ba eactens and buildings first; he measures doors, windows, 
wage desks, and floor-space, and develops plans of 
these observations on the blackboard with the teachers. 
The school garden and playground are next studied. The 
garden affords an ample field of investigation. The vine

which climbs around the window, the cherry trees, the rose 
bush, the lilies of the valley which the children brought 
from the forest and planted themselves, the swallows, the 
butterflies, the snails, and the caterpillars all offer an in- 
finite variety of materials for Nature study. They learn 
to observe the sun, and the shadows it casts at various 
times of the day, they make daily observations on the 
weather. With a simple rain-gauge they measure the 
rainfall. They keep caterpillars, and watch their various 
transformations. They bring frog-spawn from the nearest 
pond, and observe how tadpoles and frogs develop. Later 
they extend their observations to the entire town, and 
map out its chief streets and buildings. They make many 
excursions into the forest, fields, and meadows. They 
watch the farmer sowing seeds in spring, and the harvesting 
in the autumn. They observe the crops, and distinguish 
between the kinds of vetches and clover. They count the 
grains of corn on a single ear, and consider the kinds 
of beet-root from which sugar is made. 
— Several excursions of. this kind are well fixed 
Observations. on my memory. With a class of little girls 
of seven, who were making observations with their teacher, 
I crossed the stream which ran near the school, climbed 
the hill on the opposite side of the valley, and here watched 
them as they pointed out the school, the church, the gas- 
works, the flour-mill, the chief streets, and several of the 
homes of the children. In the class-room afterwards I 
watched them day by day as they related their experiences 
and developed a plan of their observations on the black- 
board with their teachers. Again, with a class of boys 
from Jena, I climbed the Salgenberg and watched the boys

make observations on the sun, indicate the points of the 
compass and point out the river Saale flowing through 
the valley, its right and left bank, and discuss its course. 
They pointed out two smaller valleys—the Miihlthal and 
Gemdenthal—and the streams which ran through them, and 
the chief heights of the neighbourhood. Later I saw these 
boys making a large clay model in the school of these 
observations. 
“This home instruction demands therefore a wandering 
through the home neighbourhood in all directions ; it re- 
quires of the child a continued observation of what is and 
what transpires in its surroundings. This kind of instruc- 
tion would completely miss its purpose if, instead of the 
objects themselves, it were to present merely pictures, such 
as are so popular in the pictorial lessons of our schools, 
or if it were to attempt to overcome the deficiencies of the 
child’s perception through scattered descriptions borrowed 
from a text-book, and through the mere word of the 
teacher.” 
The child ‘must see and hear and observe with his 
senses the things the perception of which he is to share; 
and since in general “things do not come to the children,” 
says Lange, ‘the school has to take the children to the 
things.” 
The English teacher has not yet learned to do this 
successfully. We believe too entirely in class-room studies 
and knowledge which can be neatly put down on an ex- 
amination paper, to waste much time on giving the children 
opportunities to learn from their own observation and 
experience. When the German child has carefully studied 
his own district, he takes wider flights. The school journey
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
comes in and furnishes him with more extended fields for 
observation, 
Be eect The aim of the school journey is to give 
feumey. the child an outlook beyond his home environ- 
ment. I have accompanied the boys on several school 
journeys in and around the Thiiringian Forest, and this 
district is certainly a rich harvest for such journeys, with 
its miles of pine and beech woods, its winding valleys, 
wooded hills, ruined castles, and mountain heights. Op- 
portunities of studying plant and animal life, and of gaining 
concrete ideas of valleys, rivers, quarries, and mountains, 
are numerous. Its historical associations are also rich, 
the Thiiringian Sagas, the Crusades, and Luther have left 
many memories, and Goethe and Schiller have left behind 
them many literary associations. 
Geography helps to make history real to the 
Relitoryana children. On the Landgrafenberg, a height 
eae: Jabove Jena, where Napoleon’s armies gained 
a victory in 1806, I have heard a wonderfully lucid history 
lesson. The direction of the valleys, and the course of the 
river, the position of the forests, and height and slope of 
the hills all show why certain armies stayed in certain 
places, why they took certain directions, and why they 
fought the battle where they d'd. 
The school journey begins with the third school year— 
when the child is about eight years of age—and is con- 
tinued until the eighth school year. I will sketch one 
or two in which I have taken part. Recently I accom- 
panied a party of little boys of the third school year on 
their first school journey. They were studying the Thiirin- 
gian Sagas and the geography of Thiiringia. The pre-

tributaries in a distant district. Castles which Ludwig had 
built were to be visited. A cathedral at Naumburg was 
to be studied. The boys had observed and drawn round- 
arched and pointed-arched church doors and windows, and 
various kinds of towers from churches and castles in and 
near Jena, so they had some ideas on castles and churches 
to help them to understand those we were to study during 
the journey. We were to visit salt-springs, and sugar 
factories, and to examine a peculiar kind of beet-root which 
was used in making sugar, and which did not grow in the 
boys’ own neighbourhood. Vineyards and sandstone quar- 
ries were also to be visited—these were also unfamiliar to 
the children in their own district. Each child had a simple

nira schoo. We rambled for three days, sleeping at quaint

We saw the Saale broader and more imposing than in the 
home district, and we studied the confluence where the 
Ilm joined it. We climbed to the Saaleck, a ruined tower 
built on an eminence and commanding a wide view of the 
Saale and the valleys. We heard how it was built by the 
bold German knights a thousand years ago to keep off the 
invading Slavonic tribes who came down upon the country. 
We sang war songs and national Thiiringian songs. We 
examined autumn berries, found green frogs, brown lizards, 
and curious moths. We rested in beech woods and 
watched the squirrels; we pelted each other with horse- 
chestnuts ; we visited the salt springs and other places of 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
80 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
interest in the town of Késen; we studied the cathedral at 
Naumburg, its doors, windows, towers, its choirs, crypt and 
statues ; we compared an ancient gateway with a gateway 
in Jena, and we slept in a rambling old inn at Freiburg. 
Next day we examined Freiburg Castle in detail, wandered 
through the valley by the river Unstrut, studied a stone 
quarry, sat by the wayside and tasted the different kinds of 
beet-root, passed through the vineyards, and made many 
other discoveries and observations. The boys were keen 
and appreciative; and when they returned home brown 
and sturdy, they had many personal experiences and 
observations, which were referred to and supplemented in 
the class-room during the school work. The school 
journey is also considered valuable on the grounds that it 
enlarges the boys’ intercourse with his fellows. He meets 
strangers, and learns how to behave towards them, It 
also affords the masters an opportunity of getting to know 
and study the character of individual boys under natural 
conditions when the restraint of the school routine is 
removed. 
Journey of ith A Journey of six days with the boys of the 
School¥ear. fifth school-year in the Bavarian Highlands 
(Rhoéngebirge) was a valuable experience. 
The boys were studying the life of Boniface together, 
with the geography of the Rhdngebirge. We studied 
the formation of rocks, the direction of rivers, the roads 
and railways. We climbed two or three mountains. We 
visited the cathedral at Fulda, and saw the statue and 
grave of Boniface. We spent a night in a monastery on the 
Kreuzberg. We were present at a Roman Catholic proces- 
sion and festival at Wiistensachsen. We went into a coal
-P-A-G-E-93

mine; we visited wood-carving workshops; we saw the 
processes of pipe-making, of sheep-shearing and wool- 
weaving. We had many opportunities of making com- 
parisons between the unfruitful nature of the soil in these 
high regions ani the rich land in the Jena valley. We com- 
pared plants, rocks, the houses of the people, and the 
churches. Jena is a Protestant district, and this was a 
Roman Catholic neighbourhood, therefore the boys were 
much interested in the differences they found in the 
churches, The long marches through beautiful country, 
the beech woods, the primitive meals, the kindly entertain- 
ment by the monks, and the many adventures which befel 
us, will ever remain in my memory. The cost was trifling, 
but the accommodation was often exceedingly simple. 
Sometimes the boys slept on straw beds ; but, in spite of 
privations, all the boys were well and happy when we re- 
turned to Jena singing home songs. That the journey 
had been beneficial in enriching the boys’ minds no one 
could doubt who witnessed the lessons afterwards, and 
watched their intelligent appreciation and eager replies when 
allusions were made in the lessons to their experiences 
gathered on the journey. 
Enough has been said to show how the instruction in 
school aims at increasing the child’s experience and inter- 
course during his school life. Other school journeys asso- 
ciated with the life of Luther, and connected with the Harz 
Mountains and the battlefields near Leipsic, are referred to 
in the time table. This sketch serves to show how close 
the connexion may be between history and geography, 
and how real both these studies are made to the child- 
ren,

Our land is as rich as any in the world in

Be in the form of beautiful churches, old castles,

bourhood. 
Luther, Ludwig, and Boniface are realities to the German 
child. He has seen the ink-stains on the table where 
Luther translated the Bible, and the church door on which 
he fixed his famous propositions. He has stood in the 
castles which Ludwig built to defend his land; and he has 
seen the grave of Boniface. He has identified himself, as it 
were, with the heroes of his country. 
English Materials OUr Arthur, Alfred, Richard the Lion-hearted, 
for School Journey: and Cranmer might become a part of the life 
of every English child if we gave history the position it 
merits in our primary schools. How the stories of Alfred 
and Hereward would inspire the children who lived within 
a school-journey distance of the Vale of the White Horse 
and Ely if these districts were properly used to make history 
a living reality to the children. How vivid and life-like 
would be the impressions of a Roman town, if the children 
of Hampshire, Berkshire, and Oxfordshire were taken to 
Silchester to see the mosaic pavements, pottery, Roman 
houses, bricks, and Roman wall; and how eager would be 
their interest in the story of Julius Cesar, and later in 
Shakespeare’s play, after their concrete experiences of a 
Roman town at Silchester. One can imagine a fascinating 
study of the Elizabethan period and Shakespeare in con- 
nexion with a journey through Warwickshire, visiting 
Kenilworth, Stratford, and Warwick. 1 “What a wealth of

material London, and many other English towns offer. 
Starting from the mere names of London streets, with which 
a London child is, or can be made familiar, a skilful teacher 
can help him to people them with the life of the past, and 
by descriptions, and pictures, and visits to different spots, 
can bring Roman, Saxon, Norman, and Elizabethan London 
in succession before him. The crowded Walbrook and 
Fleet Street become once more the little rivers falling into 
the Thames, and the three streams the eastern, western and 
southern boundaries and protections of the first British 
settlement ; a wild moor, now Moorfields, its northern boun- 
dary, and beyond a vast forest, stretching far away to the 
northward, the remains of which are to be seen at Epping. 
In some such way a child may get an idea of the first set- 
tlements of our forefathers, and learn how from barren 
marsh, dense forests, and clay-built huts, the-city of five 
million people has grown.” 
Impressive and eloquent stories are told by old walls, 
buildings, and even names. They lead the child back to 
the times of his ancestors. 
Connexions be. Lhe relations between history, and geography

subjects can ever be dissociated.

in the workshop, where they make wooden and cardboard 
models of churches and castles they have visited. In the 
workshop, also, the boys model in clay pieces of ornamenta- 
tion from church doorways, arches, and windows. These 
are afterwards cast in plaster of Paris, and used to illustrate 
the history lessons. 
A glance at the time table will show that the 
arithmetic is very similar to our own, but much 
simpler, on account of the Decimal System which is em- 
ployed in money, weights and measures. 
In the lower classes the arithmetic lessons are very Arithmetic. 
thorough, and the advance is very slow. 
The work is almost entirely oral throughout the school. 
The practice of giving problems, and causing the children to 
work them individually on slates or paper, I have never 
seen employed in German schools. The master propounds 
the problem—it has usually some practical application to 
the other work—and the boys work it out on the black- 
board. They proceed very slowly, step by step, and every 
point is made clear to them. There is much more discus- 
sion in the arithmetic classes than ever I saw in English 
schools. The master says very little. A lifting of the eye- 
brows, or a single word of encouragement or dissent is 
sufficient. The boys state the difficulty, and unravel it 
for themselves,

THE ASSOCIATION OF STUDIES AND THE IMPORTANCE OF 
THOUGHT STUDIES 
oe Tue theory of the culture-epochs gives us 
Studiesto help in a general way in the selection of suit- 
able historical matter to put before children. 
The next point to be considered is the association of the 
subjects which the child studies. 
They should be arranged so as to throw light upon 
each other, and this may be done by establishing among 
them a series of close relationships. We do not wish the 
children to acquire a number of loose facts, but we wish 
to give them a “framework whereon to group the facts 
and ideas” they will gain in after life by reading and by 
experience. Hence from the child’s earliest years it is 
desirable that order and unity should prevail in the child’s 
studies. 
This idea of establishing relationships among the school 
studies in order to obtain cohesion and unity of thought 
is not new.

Some time before the lessons took place peas and beans 
were put into saucers of water and allowed to sprout. 
The children watched the process, and examined the 
sprouted peas and beans in the Object lessons. 
Reading, writing, and spelling are usually 
wens acheas considered formal studies of a distasteful 
‘eantni nature. “The children love stories and paint- 
ing, but they hate spelling and reading,” said a teacher of 
an infant school to me recently. 
We must learn to recognise more clearly that reading, 
writing, and speliing are not evds in themselves, but only 
means to an end. We read because we want to get at 
ideas, we write because we wish to express them, and we 
use figures when we wish to calculate. It is only in school 
that any one is required to read merely to pronounce

words, to write and speak simply to compose sentences, 
and to reckon with figures which stand for nothing. 
Reading, writing, spelling, and figures may be made in- 
strumental to thought from the very beginning. 
Pe Bes are examples of sentences composed 
ig eae Eesreseet by children during the Pea lessons. They were 
required to examine the sprouting peas and 
beans, and express their observations in language. 
“This bean is large. It has been in water. Beans 
grow larger in water. The skin is thin. I took the skin 
from my bean, and I found a little sprout inside. To- 
day we planted our beans in a pot.” 
The sentences were printed on the blackboard by the 
teacher and used as a reading-lesson. Afterwards the 
children wrote them on their slates. 
The sentences are the result of the children’s own obser- 
vations, therefore they represent a natural science lesson ; 
but inasmuch as they are expressions of the children’s 
thought they are a language lesson. 
Ideas tateress he interest of the children was naturally 
Cnlldren. very keen in these exercises. They experi- 
enced the same satisfaction which sometimes animates 
maturer minds in using language and writing to express 
their own thoughts and ideas.

ing larger numbers were worked on slates.

“My apple is round, it has a stalk. The skin is green 
and rosy. Inside are eight pippins. The pippins 
are brown and smooth. We must not eat the core 
of the apple.” 
The general opinion of teachers who have Co-ordination . . 
saves time and attempted to co-ordinate the school studies adds interest. : 
shows that not only are time and effort econ- 
omised by so doing, but that the quality of the work is 
better because the child has opportunity for mental activity 
at each step. 
The formal studies, mere mechanical reading, Dreariness of ‘Sze is . 
unrelieved Formal writing and arithmetic, have for many years Studies. ss * 
been the fetish of our primary schools. To 
work sums with mechanical accuracy, to make no mistakes 
in dictation, and to read without stumbling over new words 
when the inspector comes, this has been in many instances 
the whole duty of the child. Children readily accept the 
ideal the teacher sets up before them, but it is not their 
fault if that ideal be paltry and poor. Children on the 
whole are good and docile if they are reasonably treated, 
and the history of our primary schools for the last twenty- 
five years has shown astonishing results in neatness of 
writing, and mechanical accuracy in arithmetic. Children 
imitate readily, and as a rule they prefer to do as they are 
told when subjected to the discipline of a big primary 
school ; hence it is not surprising that apparently excellent 
results have been attained.

Lack of Interest But the test of knowledge is the use that is 
inieaming’ “made of it in after life. We are told that 
many thousands of children that have passed through our 
schools have no taste for reading, that in many instances 
they forget all they learned during their school years, and 
hence the school training has made little or no impression 
on their lives. If these complaints be true, there is cer- 
tainly something lacking in our system. 
Undue Worship of LOO frequently it creates a distaste for 
Formal Studies. Jearning in the pupil. This is partly because 
the mere formal studies are held in high esteem while 
thought studies are of secondary importance. 
If you can read, write and do sums the whole world of 
knowledge lies before you, is the commonly accepted belief, 
and the child is kept drilling at these studies until his life 
becomes wearisome to him. But the mere discipline of 
drudging at these tasks is valuable for the child, it is urged. 
He must learn to accept disagreeable duties ; it is a salutary 
training for life. 
The child will get training enough in life’s hardships 
without educational stumbling-blocks being put in his way. 
“We shall some day learn that when a boy cracks a nut 
he does so because there may be a kernel in it, not because 
the shell is hard,” says Dr. McMurray. 
Formal studies Formal studies are essential ; we do not wish

Thought Studies. their place; they “are the second, not the 
first.” If we can set before children worthy ideals, and 
stimulate in them a healthy appetite for learning and books, 
we must do so, and not sicken them with the dry husks 
before they reach the grain within.
-P-A-G-E-112
  100 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
Literature is often served up to children in the form 
of learning notes, “picking out” nouns and verbs, and 
parsing and analysis. “I hate Wordsworth,” a girl of 
fourteen said to me very emphatically. On enquiring into 
the cause of her hatred, I found that she had parsed and 
analysed “The Brothers,” and she never wanted to see 
it again. 
Geography often becomes a dreary series of lists of 
names of capes, bays, rivers, and mountains, and History 
a dismal outline of dates, kings, and battles. We must 
give the children more than mere bony skeletons of facts, 
we must endow them with thought, life, and vitality. The 
teacher who drags out weary days on routine’s treadmill 
will never be able to make the school studies “ full rich, 
throbbing with the life of the world.” Nor will the teacher 
who pins his faith to text-books and examination tests be 
able to arouse the child’s interest in the wonders of the 
world around him, and to impress upon him the “ moral 
significance of human history.”

  ‘€ All instruction should graft the most essential parts of its subject 
firmly into the very being of the human mind; then join on the less 
essential gradually, but uninterruptedly, to the most essential, and main- 
tain all parts of the subject in one living, proportionate whole.” — 
PESTALOZzI. 
“Facts and ideas have a real and useful influence over the mind 
only when the mind systematizes and co-ordinates them with other 
facts and ideas as they are produced.” —GuYON. 
“Pour water rapidly into a vessel with a narrow neck, and little 
enters ; pour slowly and but little at a time, and the vessel is finally 
filled.”—QuINTILIAN, 
“ The true object of intellectual education is to instil, with the least 
possible effort, the greatest number of generous and fruitful ideas.”— 
Guyon. 
** When one finds in certain courses of study, history of the Middle 
Ages, reading from Herodotus, geography of America, and German 
literature since Lessing, side by side, one ought to be glad if the 
youth does not trouble himself about these things, but withdrawing 
his interest, devotes his energies to something else.” —REIN. 
“Link the teaching of the new with facts already known with 
which the new has a real relation of likeness or unlikeness, so that 
the growth of knowledge may be an organic growth.” —LauRIE,

CONCENTRATION OF STUDIES 
As we have seen, the association of studies is /  Herbartian Z i |, Concentration no new idea, but it has remained for the Her- of Studies. . . . . os 
: bartians to work it out in detail and put it into 
practicé throughout the entire school course. In their 
scheme for the Concentration of Studies, those studies 
which require mental activity on the part of the child 
predominate, while the mere formal studies are second- 
ary. The latter, however, are not neglected, though they 
are not unduly worshipped. What the Herbartians call 
Concentration is concerned with the natural Natural Rela- : : . : 
tions Exist be- relations which exist between the various 2 tween Studies. : : 
studies. There are many natural connexions 
between literature and history, history and geography, 
geography and natural science, natural science and ma- 
thematics; moreover, drawing and architecture can be 
used to intensify the interest in history and literature, and 
singing can serve to stimulate this interest, while geometry 
can helpte-elreidate geography and natural science. 
That these natural relations exist every reasonable teacher 
will admit, but we rarely attempt to reckon with them in 
arranging our school courses. 
The Herbartians insist on bringing out all possible 
natural relationships in their schemes of study. 
103 H
-P-A-G-E-116
  104. HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACUING 
Psychology shows that isolated ideas are 
macale feebly impressed and easily forgotten, because 
ee they are ‘ writ in water” as it were and cannot 
endure. Therefore isolated facts taught in an inconsequent 
fashion have no lasting influence on the mind of the child. 
Again, the child must make a new effort each time to take 
in a totally new idea, and the difficulty of doing this 
entails waste of energy, and results very often in his only 
half understanding the new matter. These vague ideas 
half understood are easily obliterated. We are all ready 
to admit that a small amount of knowledge closely 
articulated and thoroughly understood is worth more 
than a large amount loosely related and only half under- 
stood, yet teachers rarely arrange the subjects so 
that they shall bear upon and throw light upon each 
other. 
It is not uncommon to find such incon- 
asi ss sted gruities in a school time-table as the following— 
Soe: History of Wellington, Geography of China, 
Reading, Drake’s Voyages, Literature, Ju/ius Cesar, and 
Science Lessons on Artesian Wells. The children study 
all these at the same time, and disharmony of thought must 
prevail. It is the duty of the teacher, says Dr. Rein, to 
convert such a confusa varietas lectionum into an ordinata 
vartetas. 
are “All conceivable expedients should be de- 
Relgn. _ vised in order that energy may be economised 
and intensity in the results of instruction be attained 
through unity in the foundations, association of related 
materials, and the combination of mutually complemen- 
tary elements.”

One readily sees various advantages in con- Concentration . . : *

ae true, permanent interest, memory is strength- 
ened, and a logical memory is developed, and the pressure 
of an overwhelming number of subjects is taken off the 
time-table. 
Concentration will help us to proportion our subjects 
according to natural relationships existing between them 
and to get rid of quantities of irrelevant subject-matter 
which text-books are constantly offering. The Herbartians 
urge the concentration of school studies on ethical and 
psychological grounds.

character decides promptly and resolutely because there 
are many close connexions between the ideas in his mind ; 
but if his mental content were made up of loose and 
unattached experiences, he would find it impossible to 
call them properly together in order to arrive at a de- 
cision. 
“As soon as we admit that it is largely ideas control 
conduct, says Dr. McMurray, . . . we see the necessity 
of great unity among one’s ideas in order to secure safe, 
consistent, and firm action.” ‘The educator,” says Prof. 
Rein, ‘must endeavour to collect the spiritual forces of 
the pupil in order that they shall not be dissipated, but 
through their concentration may take effect in an energetic 
and powerful activity. No moral character is conceivable 
without such concentration of forces.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
Peahabeial To understand the psychological grounds, we 
ne must remember that the Herbartians believe 
that the contents of the mind are not original ; 
the individual brings with him tendencies and dispositions, 
but the mind to begin with has no original activity. 
“The ego! is not an original but a developing entity ; 
hence it is also a changeable being.” ‘The mind is a 
self-active, concentrated force,” which is ever striving after 
unity. Its tendency is to simplify and unify all the various 
ideas which it gains from experience and intercourse. In- 
struction must step in and assist in this unification, for we 
overestimate the “constructive activity” of the young 
mind if we assume that it is capable of establishing all con- 
nexions unaided. Even in grown men and women the 
concentrative powers of the mind are not strong enough to 
produce unity of consciousness. 
“Unity of consciousness is the primitive foundation of 
character,” therefore ‘instruction must be directed towards 
establishing this foundation.” Heterogeneous ideas and 
disconnected thoughts are obstacles in the way of forming 
unity in the child’s mind. One of the most important 
duties, therefore, the school has to fulfil, is to bring all the 
child’s experiences into close relationship, to connect the 
home-life and school-life with the child’s studies, so that 
harmony and unity may result. 
Having decided that studies are to be con- 
perce centrated, the question before us is how to do 
Concentration: it, Much discussion has arisen around this 
point, which we cannot enter upon here. Ziller’s method

  CRONCENTATION OF STUDIES 107 
  
of concentration is usually adopted by the Herbartians. 
The core or centre of instruction is chosen from the 
material which has the greatest ethical content. This con- 
centrating centre, therefore, around which all other studies 
are to be grouped, and with which they are to be co- 
ordinated, musf/be the humanistic material—history, litera- 
ture and art. Tite educate the ideas on humanity, they 
train the judgment, morality, and taste, the religious 
sentiment, and the individual and social sympathies. ) This 
centre, which the Germans call Gestnnungs-stoff, or material 
for training character, is pre-eminent in the course of 
instruction; the other subjects are subordinate, inasmuch 
as they follow its lead, I will first give some details from 
German time-tables showing Concentrating Schemes, and 
then give particulars concerning some experiments worked 
out with English children.

  “The good school is everywhere the same, whether it be moderately 
large as the grammar school, or far-reaching as the high school and 
college, or as small and narrow as the elementary and village school. 
It always nourishes the same interests ; it always leads to thinking as 
well as observation ; it always points to the beautiful in the world and 
the sublime above it; it always awakens sympathetic participation for 
domestic and civic weal and woe.”—HERBART. 
“Tf a pupil of the elementary school by the time he is twelve years 
old is able to acquire both complete skill, as well as proper emphasis in 
reading . . . and gains in his fourteenth year a proper hand- 
writing, he has done well enough, that is as regards reading and 
writing. However the development of his conceptions, the broadening 
of his mental range through the geography of the country and the topo- 
graphy of the region where he lives, together with knowledge of the 
natural products and the intercourse of men that live there ; exercises 
in mental arithmetic and measuring of lines and planes, vivacity of 
religious feelings, and the entire preparation for the entrance in the 
church community—all this sets the elementary school a great task, be- 
side which it cannot think of merely teaching reading and writing as 
rapidly as possible.” — HERBART. 
“*The true worth of instruction—that is to say its vitalizing in- 
fluence on the scholar’s mind—depends less than is commonly supposed 
upon the particular subject through which the mind is approached, 
and more upon the stimulative method in which the mind is roused. 
School curricula, no doubt, need to be in some cases extended, and in 
others restricted, as regards the number of subjects to be taught to the 
particular scholar at the same time. But it is, after all, not so much 
in the remodelling of curricula as in the improvement of methods . . . 
that educational progress must in future consist.”—Royal Commission 
on Secondary Education.

The children entered completely into Robinson’s life, and 
appreciated all his difficulties, and were eager to suggest 
means of overcoming them. 
Under ordinary conditions the story of Robinson Crusoe 
would be the leading feature in the work of a whole year. 
Our series lasted about six weeks, and we only had the 
children occasionally. In comparing the English children 
with the German classes I have seen studying Robinson 
Crusoe, I was convinced that the eagerness and interest was | 
as keen among the children here as in the German schools. 
I was sorry I could not continue the adventures of Robin- 
son further. One easily sees what a wealth of material there 
is in the further development of the story. 
Robinson’s discovery of corn, and of fire, his attempts at 
making pottery, his clothing, his little farm, offer endless 
matter for familiar discussions with the children. 
THE SPANISH ARMADA CONCENTRATION SCHEME, 
Stanparp VI. 
These lessons were given by seven students during one 
term, to a class of boys and girls in Standard VI., whose 
ages varied from 12 to 14 years. The same students had 
given the series of Columbus lessons mentioned in a later 
chapter to the same class the previous term. In choos- 
ing this particular period we considered its fitness not only 
from an ethical standpoint, but whether it had sufficient 
literary material connected with it, and whether it afforded 
us scope in the Natural Science direction. We considered 
the subject itself, the defeat of the Spanish Armada, an 
excellent topic to put before English children. The period 
is one of the most glorious in English history, both with
-P-A-G-E-127
CONCENTRATED SCHEMES 15 
  
regard to national achievement and individual effort. The 
exploits of Drake and his fellows illustrate that spirit of 
daring which has always characterised English sailors, and 
the sentiment of patriotism which it is always desirable to 
encourage in the child is admirably fostered in this aspect 
of the Elizabethan age. It may be enforced by example 
as well as by precept in the story of the self-sacrifice of 
private individuals, and in the loyalty which caused the 
English Roman Catholics to put their duty to their country 
before their religion. 
The literature around the subject is no less interesting. 
Macaulay’s fragment forms a stimulating introduction to 
the story of the fight. Tennyson’s ballad, “ The Revenge,” 
though not concerned with the Armada itself, treating in 
fact of a later incident, is eminently suitable for incorpora- 
tion into the scheme. Its hero had fought with distin- 
guished success against the Armada, and the exploit 
described in the poem is one of the most daring ever 
performed even in that adventurous age. In the region 
of prose there is even more suitable material. The account 
of Drake’s voyages in Hak/uyt, the description of the 
famous game of bowls in Westward Ho/ and the picture 
of the fight in Mr. Froude’s History, are all excellent read- 
ing material.

A great many interesting details were brought 
out in the drawing lessons, Sword hilts, 
shields, pikes, the naval standard of England, the 
Spanish flag, and the various kinds of beacons used, 
were described and drawn. 
A contrast was made between a Spanish galleon and an 
English war-ship of the sixteenth century. These were 
afterwards sketched on the blackboard, and the children 
were required to copy them. 
The Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, colonies of 
Spain, Spain, the Netherlands, the coast line 
and kinds of rocks of England, the beacon heights, the 
English Channel, the Bay of Biscay, Currents, Winds and 
Storms, were some of the subjects included in the scheme. 
The students made a huge reliet map in clay of Western 
Europe, including the British Isles, Spain, France, and por- 
tions of the Netherlands. This model was used constantly 
throughout all the lessons. The mountains of the British 
Isles were all marked, and in the lesson on Beacon Fires a

The Beacon Fires. 
The Composition of Flame. 
Lighthouses. 
Telegraph Communication, 
The development from the rude stacks of wood used in 
primitive beacons to the pole and iron-brander, containing 
a tar-barrel, was sketched. This led to a comparison with 
modern methods— Lighthouses, and Telegraphic Communi- 
cation. Lessons on the Nature of Flame, the Luminosity 
of Flame, and the Safety Lamp were also given. These 
lessons involved many experiments which were performed 
with the children. 
This subject necessarily follows a logical 
sequence of its own, but as mathematics pre- 
sents the formal side of Natural Science, connections are 
constantly occurring. In working out problems of latitude, 
for example, figures are required. The children in the 
present instance are interested in the doings of Drake, and 
their interest is increased if they are required to make the 
same kind of calculations that the statesmen and navigators 
would have to make in Drake’s day. It may be urged that 
these questions are not practical, but the calculations which 
Drake and his men had to make every day are more prac- 
tical than the problems concerning the impersonal A and 
B, so familiar to the arithmetic student. 
The state papers of the Armada period give a fund of 
information concerning the manning of the ships, the rate 
of pay of the men, the necessary provisions, the prices of 
the food, the variations of diet, “Meat days” and “ Fish 
days,” also details concerning the weight of the guns, the 
amount of shot necessary, and the size of the ships. To Arithmetic. 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  120 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
make actual calculations from these details is a valuable 
exercise in itself, but it is rendered more so when these 
calculations are compared with similar details of the pre- 
sent day. 
The rule of proportion is the stage in arithmetic at which 
the children have arrived, therefore suitable comparisons 
can be easily made of relative prices, sizes of ships, and 
rates of sailing. These facts become more striking if the 
teacher presents like calculations concerning a modern war 
ship. 
The following are some of the examples worked. The 
figures are actually taken from the State papers of the 
time :— 
“It the cost of provisions for one day for the 240 men 
in The Revenge was £8 55., how much would it cost for the 
420 men of the Ark?” 
“Tf the wages of a sailor were 42s. for three months, 
how much would he receive for five months ? 
The Armada will not aid the child in learning Propor- 
tion. The only way to master the rule will be to take it as 
pure mathematics and proceed according to the “law of 
successive clearness.” But the children may be led to a 
general rule in Arithmetic by having their curiosity 
aroused as to the way of performing calculations quite 
likely to be required in ordinary life; and these lessons 
formed an interesting introduction to a discussion of 
ratios mathematically treated.

“Strange as the arrangement of instruction according to the formal 
steps may appear at first sight, yet it is by no means entirely new. It 
asserts itself in every good lesson in a greater or less degree, only, the

entire process of learning, but rather upon a certain instinct of tact, 
which he has acquired by long experience, the reasonableness of which, 
however, he is unable todemonstrate. . . . Every step in the lesson is 
exactly prescribed by psychological laws solidly established. A highly 
important matter, which previously had been left to the care of a feel- 
ing of happy tact, has, by one stroke, been brought into such clearness, 
that it is capable of illuminating the entire method of instruction.”

  CHAPTER X a 
PRESENTATION OF MATTER. THE THEORY OF THE 
FIVE FORMAL STEPS 
Herbert's WE have considered the selection and articula- 
ec tion of subject matter, we must now discuss 
the method of presenting it to the child’s mind. Know- 
ledge must pass through certain stages before the mind can __ 
clearly apprehend and assimilate it. These stages are 
called by the Herbartians the “five formal steps.” 
According to Herbart these steps are,—

Association.

mate Prof. Rein and others have developed Her- 
Steps, art’s ideas, and put them into practice in 
the schools. 
Rein sums up the five steps as follows,— 
_1._ Preparation (Vorbereitung). 
2. Presentation (Darbietung). 
3. Association (Verkniipfung). 
4. Formulation, or Generalization (Zusammenfassung). 
&: “Application (Anwendung). 
1237
-P-A-G-E-136
  124 LE ee PRINCIPLES OF FEACHING 
  
These steps are not new. Many experienced teacher” 
will say they only indicate the natural method of teaching. 
They are natural because each stage follows definite 
psychological laws. 
Bisciios The material in each school subject is7 
containinga mapped out into a number of convenient 
‘sections, each of which is called a Method 
Whole (Einheit) because, it contains one clear general 
truth. In working through the stages of the lesson the 
pupils arrive at this truth for themselves. In formal gram- 
mar and arithmetic the general truth is a definition or a 
tule, and can often be reached in one lesson of reasonable’ 
length. , In history, language, and geography, the general 
truth may have an ethical or political signification, and 
it may require several lessons to arrive at it. , Therefore, it 
is impossible to give isolated and unrelated lessons. I 
have heard a teacher dispatch the Spanish Armada in one 
lesson of twenty minutes. 
Her notes were neatly written “out and arranged under 
three headings,— 
(a) Causes. 
(2) Action. 
(6) Results. 
She spent five minutes on each of these heads, and sh 
carefully kept a whole five minutes for Recapitulation. 
Her lesson was said to be a success, and in so far as she 
selected a few meagre but striking facts, arranged them _ 
neatly, and got through them quickly, and made all the 
children sit still the while ; perhaps it was, but the less said ~ 
about the influence of such a lesson on the minds of wee 
children the better. - 5

peginwitn par Most thoughtful teachers agree generally that _ 
ticulars and lead inni ith_indi culsrsantes’ the method of beginning a_lesson with indivi-_ 
seneral truth. dual notions and leading up to a generalization   
is the true method. 
"From the particular to the general,” ‘“ From the simple 
to the complex,” “From the concrete to the abstract,” 
“From the percept to the concept,” are commonplaces 
to all students who have glanced through the pages 
of any work on the theory of teaching. It is now 
recognised that the older method of teaching, which 
consisted of stating rules and definitions, to be com- 
mitted to memory, was putting the cart before the horse. 
Children have great facility in using words and repeating 
propositions that formulate knowledge, and the teacher 
is constantly deceived. Herbert Spencer expresses this 
forcibly. “General _formulas_which_men_have devised       
to express groups of details, and which have sever- 
ally simplified their conceptions by uniting many facts 
into one fact, they have supposed must simplify the con- 
ception of a child also. They have forgotten that a 
generalisation is simple only in comparison with thé whole 
mass _of particular truths it comprehends; that it is more 
complex than any one of these truths taken singly; that 
only after many of these single truths have been acquired, 
does the generalization ease the memory and help the 
reason ; afd that, to a mind not possessing these single 
truths, it is necessarily a mystery.” Qur theory of the five _ 
formal steps follows the approved method, _it_presents — 
many facts, and’ finally unites them into one fact.

The_aim_is_stated_because the child_must—clearly know _ 
what he is going to do. The_method of introducing 
the lesson by a series of mysterious questions only con- 
fuses the child, and often puts him on the wrong track. 
An Inspector of Training Colleges once told me of a 
young man who, in introducing a lesson on the powers 
of the magnet, proceeded to throw small iron nails about 
the room, He then asked his class how he was to find 
them, and appeared annoyed when they gave him the very 
obvious reply, “Get a candle.” He expected them to say, 
“Get a magnet”; and as they did not realize his expecta- 
tions his lesson suffered. 
~Again,.a_clear statement of the aim arouses in the child 
expectation, which is : is a fave a_fayourable condition for promoting _ 
real intere interest ; it iealson tends to drive out of the child’s mind 
irrelevant ideas, and bring into prominence all relevant 
ideas connected with the subject. ‘‘ We shall now consider 
the dealings of England and Spain with the Netherlands,” 
clearly stated at the beginning of the lesson, brings up 
the child’s ideas connected with England, Spain, and the 
Netherlands > 
The children are identified with the teacher in the search 
for knowledge when the aim is well stated, and their co-op- 
eration and activity is enlisted in the problem before them. 
Zona 1 The first § step is Preparation ; here the child’s_ 
i Sy mind is prepared to receive the new matter. ) 
Our knowledge depends as much upon what is within us— 
as upon what is without us; hence the teacher’s labours in 
forcing new knowledge from without are wasted, unless 
the related ideas and the attitude of the minds before him 
are favourable to the receftion of the new.  
-P-A-G-E-139
PRESENTATION OF MATTER 129 
  
In History, Literature and Geography lessons the matter 
is related by the teacher, or developed by means of a 
series of skilful questions. The latter calls for more skill 
on the part of the teacher and more thought on the part of 
the child. The pupil is not told what Philip of Spain did 
in certain circumstances, but he is asked what Philip was 
likely to do. 
In Grammar and Arithmetic, examples are considered 
which lead up to the definition or rule we are aiming at. _~ 
In an Object lesson, the object is put before thild 
and he is directed how to examine it. The 
presented in Science and Mathematics, and 
pupils work through the experiments or cal tions to- 
gether which lead them to establish their law 
tion. 
One thing at a time is the rulin, 
part of the lesson.’ The whole cannot be given to the 
“pupil in_a mass, else he would gain only a misty general 
impression, which is valueless. Single points must be a 
presented, mastered, reflected upon, _and_summed up and 
stated by the pupils before another point is touched upon. 
What the Herbartians call the law of successive clearness 
demands that the matter be divided into “small logically 
connected sections” and tle children shall concentrate 
their undivided attention pon each of these sections 
separately, and reflect upon. each point until it is mastered. 
As Lazarus says: “Thinking requires time, it is therefore      
    
   
a great pedagogical mistake if teachers—as is now gener- 
ally done—urge their pupils to answer rapidly, and praise 
those who immediately have an answer ready. This causes 
everything to be lowered to a mere effort of mechanical

memory. The pupil must have time for individual contem- 
plation, for deep and energetic thought-labour.” 
In the first lesson on Flame, the presentation was ar- 
arranged in three divisions:

The general recapitulation of the whole. 
A flame consists of two cones, the outer cone consists of 
burning gas and is hot, the inn®r cone consists of unburned 
gas and is comparatively cool. 
When the whole has been studied, an entire recapitula- 
tion is required from the pupils in their own words, for 
knowledge is not a possession unless it can be expressed in 
the words of the owner. A fair amount of drilling is 
required to fix the facts in the ‘children’s minds. The 
necessity of this kind of drill was recognised by the Jesuits 
4

as seen in their favourite maxim, ‘‘Repetitio mater 
studiorum.” 
At the end of the second step we have completed the 
first psychological process, that of apperception, but only 
half the task of teaching is done. We must rise from the 
individual to the general. With the third step we begin 
the process of abstraction. Certain facts are fixed in the 
child’s mind, and from these facts we must rise to the law 
or cause which governs them, without this our lesson is 
meaningless, for “ percepts without concepts are blind.” 
cas The facts are given, and the teacher proceeds 
2H / to_discuss_them with the children, and_to 
_compare and contrast them with known facts in order to 
‘Jead the pupils to form the general truth for themselves. 
¢ All teachers are familiar with the kind of questions which 
lead the children to grasp the definition of an_adjective or   
  rule in arithmetic, 
In a series of lessons on the Victoria Cross, after the 
» student had described the Cross and told the story of 
Rorke’s Drift, she associated the story with that of General 
Gordon, and led the pupils to see the grandeur of forgetting 
oneself in doing one’s duty. 
Now we Now we come ‘o _the generalization; for Step 
agueratin language is necessary to to help t to_fix_and sym- 
ee the general truth the child-has been able 
to reach. In the Victoria Cross lessons, the children were Steet eo St . . 
all ready to suggest such generalizations as “We must 
face danger for the sake of duty.” After listening to 
various formulations from the children, the teacher said 
they all had grasped the right idea, but she would give 
it to them in the words of an English poet : 
  
NINA 
©  
-P-A-G-E-142
132 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
*‘Not once or twice in our rough island-story, 
The path of duty was the way of glory.” 
This summed up precisely what she had intended to 
convey in the lessons. She wrote the lines on the 
blackboard, and the children learned them. In this step 
the law, truth, or rule, having been clearly brought out 
by skilful questions, it is formulated in such a way that 
the whole group of details is expressed in this formulation. 
“Unless we formulate thought to ourselves in words, we 
are not, strictly speaking, thinking, but only striving to 
think, struggling with thought,—‘ licking,’ as Montaigne 
says, ‘ the formless embryo.’ ” 
After the formula is obtained the fifth step 
enn) demands that it should be applied. We have 
arrived at our rule or principle, and the child 
must apply it. As Dr. Radestock says, “Children cannot 
be taught by maxims, which continually slip from their 
strengthen ‘them in doing by unwearied practice, whenever 
the opportunity offers, and, if possible, create opportunities 
therefor.” 
After the formulation. 2n the Victoria Cross lessons, the 
boys were asked to give instances in the ordinary school- 
boy life where woithy deeds might be done for the sake 
of duty; the instances given were numerous and _in- 
teresting. The Victoria Cross lessons formed material 
for many a stimulating reference or association in later 
lessons.

ideas as rapidly as they are acquired, to go from the 
particular to_the general, and back again from the general 
to the particular, to traverse his circle of ideas from a 
given standpoint in all directions, and to make use of the. 
results reached for the solution of moral, theoretical, and _ 
practical_questions.”. In this way the child’s stock of 
ideas may be harmoniously blended, and his knowledge 
  becomes a reliable personal possession. 
These are the five steps through which every worthy 
piece of knowledge must pass before it becomes a part 
of the child’s mental furniture. 
It is obvious that with young children we cannot seek 
to generalize’ too broadly. Their instruction must often 
end with the acquisition of facts, for “their perceptions 
are neither sufficiently numerous nor complete to be basis 
of generalizations; therefore the process of abstraction as 
a whole is impossible to them.” 
I append a lesson worked through these five steps. It 
was prepared and given to a class of boys by one of the 
students of the Manchester Training College :— 
THE PRINCIPLE OF THE INCLINED PLANE. 
Boys r3years of age. 
Apparaius.—(1) Fwo planes, one smooth japanned and 
one rough wood. 
(2) Light glass balls about 1 oz. each for 
weights. 
(3) Small spring balance weighing up to 
402. 
(4) Small adjusted pulley.
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
Aim.—How does an inclined plane lessen the weight of 
an object? 
(i.) Preparation.— 
Problem, see-saw : go lbs. 120 lbs. 
boy. \ boy. 
How can the weight of the two boys be adjusted ? 
Lead the boys to see the connexion between lengths and 
forces. 
(ii). Presentation.— 
1. Take the smooth plane and require a boy to measure 
the height it is raised—3} inches. 
The whole class enter this in their note-books in a 
column entitled “ Height of plane.” 
2. A second boy weighs the two glass balls, resting on 
the plane at this height. 
All enter the weight in a column in their note-books 
entitled ‘“ Force.” 
These experiments are continued with new heights. 
Thus :—

Weight =} length of plane. 
Force =} of weight. 
3. Why glass balls and a polished board are used ? 
Try experiments with the rougher board and show the 
effects of friction. 
(iti.) Association.—Comparison of the plane used in the 
lesson, with instances furnished by the boys themselves ; 
such as Drayman’s ladder. 
Sloping roads. 
Heavy furniture raised into a second storey window. 
Elicit the advantage of the incline, and compare with 
figures noted down, and show exactly what we mean when 
we say, “The incline is so much.” 
(iv.) Formulation.—Encourage the boys to express the 
idea as a rule, and accept the best attempt. 
(v.) Application —Give problems to be worked out, e.g. : 
A man’s strength in pushing is only equal to 120 lbs., he 
has to roll a cask of 240 lbs. upon a lurry 4 ft. from the 
ground. What is the shortest plank he can use, etc. ? 
The question of the formal steps is fully dealt with in a 
book written by Charles and Frank McMurray, entitled 
The Method of the Recitation, published in Bloomington, 
Illinois, U.S.A. ‘This chapter is inadequate as a discussion 
of the whole problem, and readers are recommended to 
read more fully on the subject. Wiget’s Dée formalen

to enter into its deep waters; or, if any have done so, they 
have merely kept along its coasts, fearful of departing from 
them. The waves of this ocean, although they roll as high

as mountains, yet maintain themselves without breaking ; 
for if they broke, it would be impossible for ship to plough 
them.” 
Why were men so afraid of a voyage west? What was 
needed in order to attempt it ?

  LESSONS WORKED OUT 143 
  
(iii.) Association.—Summarise the various routes. Com- 
pare their difficulties. Draw out that the land journeys 
were veal difficulties ; the objection to the long sea voyage 
were fears of imaginary things, which would disappear with 
experience. So lead up to the Formulation. 
(iv.) Formulation.—The best way of getting to India was 
by sea, if men could be found to attempt it.

across the Atlantic and discovered land in the west. 
This lesson is to be taken chiefly from the Journal of 
Columbus, illustrated by map of the Atlantic.

For whose benefit would it be? To what place did he 
think he was going? What had he to guide him?

(t) To get honours for himself and his descendants.
-P-A-G-E-157
LESSONS WORKED OUT 147 
  
(2) To convert the barbarian kings and princes to his 
faith. 
II. His intentions for the voyage :— 
(1) To note what happened from day to day, and 
describe it at night in his Journal, and so “to 
forget sleep.” 
(2) To work at the business of navigation all day. 
(3) To prepare a new chart showing all seas and lands, 
What does this show us about his character. 
III. Incidents of the voyage.

Why should he do this? Let the children give their

An indefinite number of lessons might still be given 
relating future discoveries, expansions of power, and settle- 
ment, etc. This would depend on the time to be devoted 
to the scheme, and the precise scope of the aim. The dis- 
covery has been followed out far enough to admit of a 
conclusion being suggested. 
Lesson VI. Aim.—Results of Columbus’ discovery, and 
what we may learn from it.

efforts of the discoverers, and their 
importance. 
ii, Presentation :— 
I. Development of the Discovery.

naturally spread to the mainland. Which parts 
would be settled first? When would people first

East? Then what would they call their dis- 
covery? (New World.) 
II. Effects on Europe. 
Question on—1. Material use of the discovery. 
2. Effect on men’s minds. 
3. Special effect on Spain and the other 
western countries of Europe. Show 
how future rivalries were natural. 
Connect with the Hiawatha lessons—‘ All the land was 
full of people . . . speaking many tongues.” What does 
this show? 
III. Effect on the natives :— 
Connect with Hiawatha’s Vision. 
In what state did Hiawatha see his countrymen? Present 
state of American Indians. 
How did Columbus treat the natives? 
His good intentions and aspirations afterwards obscured 
by too great zeal. 
[Let the children grasp the tragic side to the great dis- 
covery. | 
These results more concisely put may be taken as the 
Formulation. It seems, however, desirable that, considering 
the age of the children, the hero of the discovery, rather 
than its political importance, should be dwelt upon in con- 
clusion as a means of conveying ethical teaching. 
iii. Association :— Bring out, by questioning, the qualities 
shown by Columbus in his great work. 
(a) Courage, enterprise, curiosity. 
(4) Patience in working out his plans, and waiting for 
their fulfilment.
-P-A-G-E-161
  LESSONS WORKED OUT 151 
  
(c) Hard work and faith in carrying out his plans, and 
forbearance with his weaker followers. 
[Let the class give instances of these, noting the three 
periods of Columbus’ life treated of. Now com- 
pare with other great men, explorers, etc. Alex- 
ander (in some aspects) in his Eastern settlements, 
Julius Czesar, in Gaul, may be employed. Moses 
(Columbus’ own comparison). Read passage 
from the Journal again]. 
Analogy seen in—Waiting patiently. 
Faith in Mission. 
Forbearance with followers. 
Both leading people to a “‘ Promised Land.” 
Great results from each. 
iv. Yormulation :—This should be obtained from the 
class after summing up the points in the Association, and 
noting what kind of men have shown such qualities. 
When condensed it may read: A great work requires a 
hero who will give his life to it. 
Application. — Longfellow’s verse, “ Lives of great men,” 
etc., may be used as an illustration, Draw out the per- 
sonal lessons to be learned. Let the children talk about 
what they would like to be, and help them to notice. 
(1) Benefit to ourselves in admiring and learning about 
great men.

Tue RorunpDIty OF THE EaRrTH. 
General Aim.—Did Columbus form his plans correctly ? 
I. Preparation.—Why was he forming plans? He 
wanted to get to India. 
In what direction does India lie with regard to Europe? 
It lies East. 
Why did he sail West? He had heard from Greek and 
Arabian books, and he knew from his own observations, 
that land lay West. He thought the earth must be a 
sphere. 
II. Presentation.—Columbus had also been told by a 
clever man named Toscanelli that the earth was round. 
Extract from letter to Martius enclosed to Toscanelli’s 
tetter. Columbus by Toscanelli. 
“T have already spoken with you respecting a shorter 
way to the place of spices, than that which you take by 
Guinea by means of maritime navigation. The most serene 
king now seeks from me some statement, or rather a 
demonstration to the eye by which the slightly learned 
may take in and understand that way. I know this can 
be shown from the spherical shape of the earth, yet to 
make the comprehension of it easier, and to facilitate the 
work, I have determined to show that way by means of a 
sailing chart.” 
(Simple sketch of chart sketched on blackboard. Coasts, 
islands, and calling-stations pointed out.) 
ae “You must not be surprised if I call the 
Continued. parts West when they usually call them East, 
because to those always sailing West, those parts are found 
by navigation on the under side of the earth. But if by

land and by the upper side, they will always be found to 
the East.” 
Explanation and illustrations of this by means of a large 
globe of the earth. 
ia “I perceive your magnificent and grand 
Tetter. desire to navigate from the parts of the East to 
the West, in the way that was set forth in the letter that I 
sent you, and which will be better demonstrated on a round 
sphere. It pleases me much that I should be well under- 
stood, for the said voyage is not only possible, but it is true 
and certain to be honourable, and to yield incalculable 
profit and very great fame among all Christians. But you 
cannot know this save through experience and practice as 
T have had, in the form of most copious and good and true 
information from distinguished men of great learning, who 
have come from the said parts.” 
Recapitulation—Toscanelli believed the earth to be a 
sphere. 
Lesson II. 4im.—Was Toscanelli right in thinking the 
earth is a sphere ? 
Preparation.—Require the pupils to give the reasons of 
Columbus and Toscanelli for thinking the earth was a 
sphere. 
Let them quote from their literature Tennyson’s “ Colum- 
bus,” the lines— 
“ Could it be 
That trees grew downward, rain fell upward, men 
Walk’d like the fly on ceilings?”

Presentation.—(a) Roughly sketch curved surfaces on 
blackboard. 
   Observations.—Objects on a curved surface (Fig. 1) are 
hidden from each other, or partly hidden as in Fig. 2. 
Sketch. —(b) Showing that the body of the ship dis- 
appears first. 
  Observations.— 
1. The whole of the near ships are visible. 
2. Only the masts of the distant ships are visible. 
Recapitulation.— The surface of the earth is curved, 
hence the hull of ships disappear first in the distance. 
(c) Show map of the world and trace the course of 
Magellan’s voyage made in 1520. Magellan sailed west, 
round the South of America, across the Pacific to Asia, 
and thence back again to Europe. 
Recapitulation.—The earth must be round in one 
direction or Magellan could not sail round it. 
(2d) The Earth's Shadow.—This is sometimes cast upon 
the moon and it is always round.

   CYLINDER. SHADOWS CAST BY A CYLINDER, 
   Suapows cast By A Disc, 
The shadow cast by a sphere is always round. Tnese 
shadows are illustrated by a candle, a white sheet of 
paper, and the three bodies—cylinder, disc, and sphere. 
Recapitulation.—The shadow cast by a sphere is always 
round, the shadows cast by a cylinder and disc are 
various. 
III. Association.—Sum up the evidence and discuss it. 
(a) Objects disappear from sight on curved surfaces. 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
(4) The masts of ships remain visible when the hull has 
disappeared from view, hence earth is curved. 
(c) Magellan sailed round the earth, hence it is round in 
one direction. 
(2) The earth always casts a round shadow, hence it is 
a sphere. 
Compare and associate these conclusions, and lead the 
pupils to the generalization. 
IV. Generalization—The earth is a sphere, therefore 
Columbus and Toscanelli were right. 
Later the class studied the geography of America and the 
West Indian Islands. 
MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY. 
A series of lessons on the measurements of the earth, 
its motions, its position with regard to the Sun, Latitude, 
Longitude, use of Ships’ Compass, use of Sextant Chrono- 
meter, Maps, Charts, form suitable lessons in connexion 
with Columbus. The simple charts and instruments he 
used are compared with the instruments in use in the 
present day, and his slight astronomical, mathematical, and 
geographical knowledge compared with the fuller know- 
ledge of our own times. 
Aim.—How can a sea captain or a sailor find the posi- 
tion of his ship at sea?

Il. Presentation—(a) Light a candle and hold an 
orange on a knitting-needle before it so that the light falls 
on it. 
Half of it is in the full glare and half in the shade. 
  The candle represents the sun, the orange the earth. 
The part in the glare represents daylight, the part in the 
shade night. 
Which part is having noon? The part exactly opposite 
the light. 
Cause the orange to rotate, and the pupils will observe 
that various parts of the earth have noon at different times, 
Recapitulate—Various parts of the earth have noon at 
different times, 
(4) Mark the meridian of Greenwich, and cause the 
orange to revolve as the earth revolves on its axis, and 
require the pupils to notice whether the eastern or western 
portion has its noon first. 
Recapitulate.—Places West of Greenwich have their noon 
later than places East of Greenwich.

(c) Exact difference in time.—If it takes the earth 24 
hours to rotate through the 360 degrees, how long will 
it take the earth to rotate through 1 degree? 
24 brs (r44o'min. | minutes. 360 360 
Recapitulation—One degree of longitude is equal to four 
minutes in time. 
(d) What will be the time at Bordeaux when it is 12 
o’clock at Greenwich ? 
Position of Bordeaux, West of Greenwich (refer to the 
map). Being West it will have its noon later than Green- 
wich. 
Bordeaux is 1° West of Greenwich, therefore it will be 
11.56 at Bordeaux when it is 12 o’clock at Greenwich. 
Problems.—What time is it at Genoa when it is 12 
o'clock at London ? 
What time is it at New York when it is 12 o’clock at 
Greenwich ? 
What time is it at Greenwich when it is 4 o’clock at 
Bombay ? 
(e) Examine places near the same meridian. 
Examples found on the map by pupils :— 
London and Timbucktu. 
Pekin and Perth in Australia, 
Berlin and Capetown. 
Recapitulation.—Places on the same meridian have noon 
at the same time. 
General recapitulation of the matter in presentation.

observing the altitude of the sun, use of Chronometer and 
Sextant. 
How can we discover the time of a certain place? By 
knowing the longitude. 
How can a sailor find the longitude? By knowing the 
Greenwich time and comparing with the ship’s time. 
How can a sailor know the Greenwich time? By con- 
sulting a chronometer. 
How can he find the ship’s time? By observing the 
altitude of the sun. 
Why is a knowledge of longitude not enough to fix the 
position of the ship? Longitude only shows how far the 
ship is East or West of a given point. Pekin and Perth in 
Australia are in the same longitude. 
What fixes its position North or South of Equator? 
Latitude. 
How does the sailor find his latitude? By discovering 
the sun’s altitude, and by consulting a Nautical Almanack. 
Having found his longitude and latitude what must he do 
further? Consult his chart or map. 
IV. Generalization.—The exact position of a ship may 
be discovered by obtaining a correct observation of the 
longitude and latitude, and finding the exact point on a 
map or chart. 
Application.—A& number of problems bearing upon a 
knowledge of latitude, longitude, and arithmetic were 
given to be solved.

NATURAL SCIENCE. 
Ocean Currents. 
Aim.—How were the objects, which made Columbus 
decide there was land to the West, carried to the Eastern 
Atlantic? 
Preparation.—Why did Columbus sail West? He hoped 
to find land. Why did he think there was land westward ? 
Various objects had been found in the Eastern Atlantic 
which he thought had drifted from the West. Mention the 
objects. (a) Pieces of carved wood were found by a 
Portuguese pilot in the seas west of Portugal. (4) Reeds 
and trees were cast up on the western shores of the Azores. 
(c) The bodies of two men of an unknown race drifted on 
to the island of Flores. 
Require the pupils to quote from their literature Tenny- 
son’s “Columbus,” lines indicating the approach of land. 
«* Still westward, and the weedy seas—at length 
The landbird, and the branch with berries on it, 
The carven staff.” 
Had Columbus any other reason for thinking there was 
land westward ? 
He had read accounts of it in old books, 
Recapitulation of Preparation. 
Presentation.—1. How were these objects carried? By 
the waves? Possibly, but not very likely. The motion of 
the waves is an up and down motion, which does not 
carry objects far. 
Illustrations.—(a) Throw a match or cork into a large 
vessel of water. Disturb the water in order to produce a

wave-like motion, and require children to observe that the 
objects only move up and down. 
(6) Take a long piece of stout cord, attach it to a hook 
in the wall, and by a sudden movement make it form of a 
series of undulating waves, thus: 
I ws areata 
Keep it in motion by moving the end, and show that the 
motion is simply an up and down motion. 
(c) Refer to a field of wheat in the wind. It has the 
appearance of a series of waves, whereas there is only the 
up and down motion. 
Recapitulation—The simple wave-motion is an up and 
down motion. 
2, The objects might have been carried by ships. That 
is not likely. The Atlantic was unexplored, except around 
the coasts. 
Think of the river Mersey at Old Trafford, and the 
canal opposite to it. Now suppose we threw a block of 
wood into each, which would move the more quickly? 
The block in the river Mersey. Why? Because a river 
has a natural current, which a canal has not. 
Can you think of anything in the ocean similar to rivers 
on land? Currents. 
Then if the objects got into a current, they might very 
easily be carried a long distance. 
Compare in a very elementary way a land river and an 
ocean current, and distinguish between them. 
Recapitulation.—The objects may have been carried by 
ocean currents.

Lesson II. Adm.—How are ocean currents caused ? 
Preparation.—How were the objects probably carried to 
the Eastern Atlantic ? 
Recapitulate the previous Lesson. 
Presentation. — Apparatus required: Flasks, beakers, 
small pair of bellows, a marble, a cork and piece of slate 
pencil, bunsen burner, ice, small pieces of blotting paper, 
map on Mercator’s projections, vessel of water. 
1. Experiments.—(a) Blow steadily over the surface of 
the water with the bellows. What happens to the water? 
It moves. What makes it move? The wind from the 
bellows. Therefore, wind blowing over the water of the 
ocean causes it to move. 
(4) Blow in sudden gusts over the surface of the water. 
It still moves, but in jerks; no current could be caused by 
it, therefore the wind must blow steadily in order to pro- 
duce a current. 
Blow steadily, but in different directions, The water 
moves, but no current could be produced this way. 
Recapitulate—The wind must blow steadily, continuously, 
and in ove direction only to produce a current, 
a marble, 
a slate pencil, 
a cork, 
a piece of wood, 
one after another into the water. What happens? The 
marble and slate pencil sink, the cork and piece of wood 2. Experiments.—Drop 
float. (Recapitulate—Some objects float on water and 
some sink). 
3. Experiment.—A flask of water filled up to a certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
LESSONS WORKED OUT 163 
mark was weighed at the beginning of the lesson. It 
weighed 1 lb. This flask was heated and is now shown. 
Children observe that the water has risen higher than the 
mark. How much will it weigh? Pour water out until 
it again stands at the mark. How much does it weigh 
now? Less than r Ib. 
What can you infer about heated water ? 
What will happen if heated water is put into a flask of 
cold water ? 
Recapitulation—Heated water occupies more space, and 
is lighter than cold water. 
4. Experiments.—Sketch diagram, showing flask of water 
with a lamp underneath. 
Children will readily state that the water at the bottom 
will become heated and rise to the top of the flask, and 
the colder water at the top will sink down to take its place. 
Show actual experiment with tiny pieces of blotting-paper 
in the bottom of the flask. The blotting-paper rises to the 
top as the water becomes heated. 
Put a piece of ice at the top of the water. The pieces 
of blotting-paper gradually sink, 
Recapitulation—Currents are caused in the flask by 
having water at different temperatures. 
Association.—Refer to the ocean. Show that winds blow 
steadily, continuously, and in one direction in certain parts 
of the ocean. 
Refer also to the inequalities of temperature at the 
Equator and the Poles. 
By a series of questions lead the children to the Formu- 
lation. 
Formulation—The objects Columbus saw were carried

by ocean currents, which are caused by winds and by the 
unequal heating of the water. 
Application.—Refer to a map and point out the North 
Equatorial Current, caused by the North-east Trade Wind, 
and the South Equatorial Current, produced by the South- 
east Trade Wind. Require children to draw diagrams of 
these. Refer to map, and draw attention to the Gulf 
Stream and Polar under-currents, caused by inequality of 
temperature. Require children to draw diagrams. 
(The Association may require a whole lesson, and the 
Application may require two lessons, to work through it 
thoroughly.) 
Tue CHoIce oF Paris. 
(Story for children six years old.) 
Aim.—How a Prince had to choose one of three gifts— 
to be very great, or very wise, or to have the most beauti- 
ful lady in the world for his wife. 
Preparation.—What people are very great? 
What would the Prince have been called if he had 
chosen that gift ? 
Why do some people want to be very wise? 
Which gift seems the most pleasant ? 
Could avy one offer such gifts? How it came about. 
Presentation— 
I. The Banquet of the Gods. 
Once upon a time all the gods and goddesses went to a 
wedding feast. They wanted every one to be very happy 
and kind to every one else; but there was one goddess, 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
LESSONS WORKED OUT 165 
  
called the “Goddess of Discord,” who was always stirring 
up quarrels. 
Would she be wanted at the feast ? 
What might they do to keep her away? 
Take the children’s suggestions. 
But she found out about the feast, and how would she 
feel then ? 
So she came to the banquet-hall, without being invited, 
bent upon making the others quarrel; and she brought 
with her a golden apple, with these words on it, “ For the 
most beautiful.” Then she threw it upon the table among 
the gods and goddesses. 
What would happen now ? 
Who would want it ? 
Could they all have it ? 
Whose fault had caused all the quarrel ? 
Il. How Paris was made the Umpire. 
Now there were three goddesses who had the most claim 
to the golden apple. 
One was Juno, the Queen of Heaven, the wife of 
Jupiter; the second was Minerva, the Goddess of Wis- 
dom ; and the third was Venus, the Goddess of Beauty. 
Show pictures, etc., of the three goddesses. 
Why did Juno think she ought to have the apple ? 
Why did Minerva think so? (She said that wisdom was 
the most beautiful thing.) 
Why did Venus claim it ? 
None of them would give way, so what would they have 
to do? 
There was a beautiful young shepherd called Paris, 
living on a mountain. He was a king’s son, but the shep-
-P-A-G-E-176
  166 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
herds had brought him up, and he was so beautiful that he 
was fixed upon to choose among the three goddesses. 
How would he be able to see them ? 
III. Zhe Choice of Paris. 
One day the goddesses came to Paris’s mountain, Mount 
Ida, so that he might judge among them, and give the 
golden apple to the one he chose. 
But the goddesses were all so eager for the apple, that 
they would do anything to get it. 
What might each one do to make Paris choose her? 
Now Juno was the queen of the gods and goddesses, 
Which gift would she offer ? 
Show how she might make Paris a great king. 
What would Minerva offer ? 
Venus was the Goddess of Beauty. What could she 
give? Paris was very beautiful already. She promised 
him the most beautifui wife. 
Discuss the three offered gifts, showing what each meant. 
Which should Paris have chosen ? 
Yet he threw the golden apple to Venus, choosing her 
gift. Then Juno and Minerva went away in great anger, 
and were no longer friends to Paris. And Venus helped 
him to get the most beautiful lady in the world for his 
wife ; but she was already married to a Greek king. 
What would Paris have to do? How would the Greeks 
feel? Show how this led to a great war. Had Paris 
really chosen well ? 
Association.—Compare with Solomon’s choice of wisdom, 
in order to lead up to the Formulation that it is better to 
be wise and good than to have all that we wish for, how- 
ever beautiful. i

Application.—Let the children see how the lesson can 
be applied to their own circumstances, and to other stories. 
Rosinson Crusoe. 
Ain.—How did Robinson make his house ? 
Preparation.—Where did Robinson keep his things? In 
atent. Why was that not safe? When the rain came, he 
would get wet. Wild beasts could get at him. Savages 
might easily find him. 
What could he make a house of? He could cut down 
trees and get wood. He might build one with stones. He 
might dig a hole in the earth. He might find a cave. 
What must be his first care? To keep himself safe from 
wild beasts and savages. 
Then what would be the best kind of a house? A hole 
covered over with trees, or a cave covered over with sea- 
weed. 
Presentation.—\. Robinson takes a walk and looks for 
a good place, and after a while he finds a cave, which he 
thinks will do. What kind of a cave must it be? 
1. It must be large, because it has to hold all his things. 
2. It must be dry. 
3. It must be well sheltered to keep out the rain. 
4. It must face the sun to give him light and warmth. 
5. It must be covered with weeds or trees in order to 
hide it. 
6. It must be high up and safe from wild beasts. 
(All these answers were received from the children.) 
What harm would the rain do? 
The rain would wet him and give himacold. The rain 
would spoil his biscuits and gunpowder. 
M 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
168 HERBARTIAN PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
  
ecapitulation.—Robinson found a cave which was large, 
dry, well-sheltered, sunny in the mornings, and hidden by 
trees. } 
II. What would Robinson do first? 
He would move all his things out of the tent. Yes, that 
took him several days; then he moved the tent, for he 
wished to put it up near his cave to form a kind of sum- 
mer-house. 
How do you think he began to make his house? 
Perhaps he made a fireplace, perhaps he made furniture, 
perhaps he made a garden. 
No; he did not do any of these things; he began 
with making a fence because he wanted to be quite shut 
in and quite safe ; and there was a beautiful piece of green 
grass around his cave which he wished to enclose as a 
yard. 
How do you think he made the fence? 
He might make it of posts of wood. Of bushes, of 
stones. 
He wanted to have a very strong fence in order that no 
savage men or wild beasts could get in, so he made a bank 
all round his yard first of earth and stones; then he got 
strong trees and placed them around. He twisted ropes 
and branches in and out to strengthen it, and after several 
days’ hard work he had made a strong high fence. 
Recapitulate. 
III. Now what would Robinson make next ? 
A door, a gate. 
He did not make either ; he thought it would be safer 
without. How could he get out and in? He could climb  
-P-A-G-E-179
  LESSONS WORKED OUT 169 
  
the fence. That would be difficult. He could make a 
ladder, 
Yes ; he made a rope ladder, and when he went outside 
the fence he hid the ladder, and when he came inside he 
took it with him into the cave. 
Recapitulate. 
This is one of the lessons on Robinson. It is impos- 
sible to go through the five steps in one lesson. The 
formulation the teacher had in mind was “God helps those 
who help themselves,” and after a series of lessons which 
depicted Robinson bravely overcoming difficulties, she ar- 
rived at this maxim. 
After this lesson the model was made. The teacher 
built up the rocks to form the cave, and the children 
twisted the fence of sticks and soft branches. They also 
made the ladder of string, and afterwards made the cabin 
which was described in the succeeding lesson. 
A series of object-lessons on the dwellings of man were 
interesting at this stage. It was pointed out that Robinson 
had lived in a house, a ship, and in a tree when he was 
first shipwrecked. Afterwards he lived in a tent and in 
acave. This led to lessons on tent-dwelling people and 
cave-dwelling people. The children’s knowledge of Bible 
was utilized in describing the people who dwelt in tents,

The rule of Proportion in connection with the Armada 
Series. 
Problem stated.—If the cost of provisions, for one day, 
for the 240 men in the “Revenge” was £8 55. od., how 
much would it cost for the 420 men of the “ Ark”? 
As these figures were actually taken from the State 
papers of the time of the Armada, the children showed 
the keenest interest in the Arithmetic. It became a living 
reality to them. 
Preparation.— Question as to how to obtain result. We 
might find how much one man cost per day, and multiply 
by 420; but this is a long, round-about method. 
Give the different steps in working. 
1. Compare numbers of the two crews. 
240 compared with 420. 
Children point out that 
240=4 x 60, while 420=7 x 60 
<. 420=14 of 240; 
or, 240=# of 420. 
2. Make the sum needed as many times as large for the 
second crew as it is increased above the first crew, é.e.— 
If 240 men cost £8 55. od.,

Lxamples,—1. A small strip of paper divided so that the 
smaller part is + of the whole, or the larger part 4. 
2. A large strip similarly divided. 
Require the children to notice that we have equal frac- 
tions in both cases. : 
Also illustrate with two sets of cubes. 
Keep the two sets of cubes before the class, and by 
means of questioning and observation cause them to state 
that, though the numbers vary, the relation remains the 
same. 
Point out that the statement of the children, ‘“ that one 
number remains as many times as great as the other, as 
before,” is clumsy, and introduce the word ratio and show 
its meaning. 
Recapitulation.—Ratio=the comparison of two numbers 
as to their size. 
Association.—Lead the children, by skilful questioning, 
to correct their former statement of the mode of working 
the problem. 
Formulation.—Lead the children to formulate the new 
method of working themselves. 
1. Compare the numbers of the two crews, and see what 
is the ratio between them. 
2. Make the ratio between the first sum and the second 
sum the same as the ratio between the first crew and the 
second crew. 
Statement of these ratios :— 
240 £8 55. od. 
420 £14 8s. gd. 
Application.—W ork the following :—

If the cost of provisions for the crew were £33 0s. od. 
for 4 days, how much would it be for 10 days? 
N.B.—When the rule was mastered, other problems re- 
lating to details of the Spanish Armada served as an appli- 
cation of the rule. The children were living, as it were, 
in the time of the Spanish Armada, and naturally all details 
relating to the period interested them. 
Drawinc Lesson. 
This lesson is merely the application of a previous 
History lesson on English and Spanish Ships. 
Lrsson I,—A Spanish Ship. 
Aim.—We are going to draw a Spanish ship. 
Preparation.—Draw from children the differences be- 
tween Spanish and English ships. 
Spanish ships were lofty, heavy, and hard to manage; 
they were rowed by slaves. They did not carry many 
cannon, and they had more soldiers on board than sailors, 
The English ships were as a rule smaller, more con- 
venient, could move quicker, they carried more cannon, 
and they had more sailors than soldiers on board. 
Directions,—The most important lines must be drawn 
first in fine, free, bold outline. 
I. Zines.—First, the central vertical line for the centre 
of mainmast. 
Second, the chief horizontal line. 
Third, the central line of the stern. 
Teacher draws these on the blackboard, and children 
work them the same time in their drawing books.

APPENDIX 
HISTORIC SKETCH OF THE GROWTH OF 
HERBART’S INFLUENCE IN GERMANY 
Joun Friepericu Hersart was born at Oldenburg in 
1776. He died at Géttingen in_1841. At the age of 
eighteen he went to the University of Jena to study law. 
At this period Jena was the centre of German philosophic 
thought, and the young Herbart, following his natural 
inclinations, neglected his law studies and became an 
enthusiastic follower of Fichte, who had succeeded Rhein- 
hold to the chair of philosophy in the Jena University. 
During his second year of university life Herbart rejected 
the idealism of Fichte, and in his criticism of Schelling, 
written about this time, he lays the foundation of his own 
future philosophy. “I seek to determine a human being,” 
he says, “ by the laws of his reason and nature, and to give 
him that which will enable him to make something of him- 
self.” 
He left Jena after three years, without completing his 
course, and became a private tutor to three boys in a Swiss 
family. While thus employed, he conceived some of the 
fundamental principles of his educational theories. 
In 1799 he visited Pestalozzi in his school at Burgdorf, 
and was profoundly impressed by the old man’s methods 
and aim. ‘TI have long held,” he wrote, “that the sole 
188 N  
-P-A-G-E-194
  184 APPENDIX 
  
and genuine root of instruction is a feeling of clear compre- 
hension. A perfect regularity in the sequence of studies, 
adapted to all requirements, was to me the ideal, which I 
looked upon as the omnipresent means of securing to all 
instruction its true efficacy. It was the discovery of this 
sequence, of this arrangement and co-ordination of what 
was to be learned contemporaneously and what consecu- 
tively, which formed, as I understand it, Pestalozzi’s chief 
aim. His method is at least so far correct, that it;rejected 
harmful superfluities.) Its laconic brevity is its most essen- 
tial merit. No useless word was heard in the school; thus 
the train of understanding was never interrupted. The 
teacher spoke steadily to the children, the wrong letters 
were immediately rubbed off the slate, so the child could 
never linger over his mistakes. There was no deviation 
from the true course, therefore every moment was one of 
progress.” ; 
After resigning his tutorship in 1799, Herbart spent two 
years in Bremen reading philosophy, in order to qualify 
himself for a university chair. 
Some of the earliest of his writings bear upon educational 
questions. In 1802 he published his essay on Pestalozzi’s 
new work, How Gertrude Teaches Her Children (Wie Ger- 
trud ihre Kinder lehrt); and later, Pestalozzi’s Idea of an 
ABC of Observation (Pestalozsi’s Idee eines A BC der 
Anschauung). The latter invested the ideas of Pestalozzi 
with a more scientific form than the great Swiss educator 
could give them himself. 
In 1802 Herbart went to Gottingen as a privat-docent in 
pedagogy, and began to lecture on ethics, philosophy and 
pedagogy. His lectures were so brilliant that soon the
-P-A-G-E-195
APPENDIX 185 
       He published 
Gdttingen period. 
In 1804 the second ‘edition of Pestalozzi’s Idea of an 
ABC of Observation appes red, to which was added Zhe 
Moral Revelation of the W. orlas the Chief Work of Educa- 
tion (Die aesthetische Darstellungder Welt als das Haupt- 
geschift der Erziehung). The main thought i in_this work is_ 
that_the teacher _ can_reveal_to—the-pupils, through the 
medium of the ordinary branches of school instruction and 
school experience, the moral relations between the individual 
and hi his fellows, and by y these means "develop in the child a 
moral in insight and good disposition. In the same year he 
also ‘published his Stand dpoint for. Judging Pestalozai’s Methot 
of Instruction (Standpunkt der Beurtheilung der Pestalozzt- 
schen Unterrichtsmethode). Two years later appeared his 
chief educational work, General Pedagogics (Allgemeine 
Pidagogik), and later appeared Chief Points of Metaphysics, 
and Chief Points of Logic (Hauptpunkte der Metaphystk, 
and Hauptpunkte der Logik). 
In 1808 he published his General Practical Philosophy 
(Aligemeine praktische Philosophie). 
In 1809 Herbart was called to Kénigsberg to occupy the 
chair formerly held by Kant. ‘How happy I was,” he 
writes, “to receive the offer of this most renowned chair number of important books during his 
  of philosophy, the place which, when a boy, I ‘longed for in” 
reverential ‘dreams, as I studied the works of the sage of 
Kénigsberg.” 
Herbart held that in « education “theory and practice 
.shovld_go together” ; “and in Konigsberg he was able to  
-P-A-G-E-196
186 APPENDIX 
  
establish a “Seminar” and practice-school in~connection 
with his lectures. He writes: “I had th€ lectures on 
education very much at heart. \ But e 
merely taught; it must be demonstra 
      cation cannot be 
ed and practised, ) I 
long ago conceived the idea of teaching a small number 
of selected boys myself, for anhour daily, in the presence 
of some young men acquainted with my pedagogy, who will 
attempt in my place and under my eye to carry on what 
I have begun. Gradually in this way teachers may be 
trained, whose methods must be perfected by mutual 
observation and exchange of experience. Since a plan 
of instruction is worthless without teachers, and moreover 
such teachers as are inspired by the spirit of the plan and 
skilled in the use of the method, perhaps a small experi- 
maental school such as I propose will be the best preparation 
for future and more extended movements.” The little 
practice-school thus established continued to exist for 
nearly a quarter of a century. The actual teaching in the 
school was always done by five or six young men, who were 
studying philosophy and pedagogy in the University. The 
relations between Herbart and these young teachers were 
friendly and intimate. He directed and criticised their 
work, and every year each teacher was required to write 
a report of his educational experiences and observations. 
This little school was the first of its kind established in 
connection with theoretical lectures in a German university. 
The example Herbart set of combining practice with theory 
has been followed by several of his adherents in various 
German universities. 
Psychology occupied Herbart during his K6nigsberg 
period. Pestalozzi, whose wonderful intuition and great 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
APPENDIX 187 
  
heart inspired him in teaching, failed to express himself in 
exact words for the guidance of others less gifted than 
himself, Again, in Pestalozzi’s day there was no psycho- 
logy upon which he could base his pedagogical system. 
It remained for Herbart to develop a psychology, and to 
apply it to the practical problems of teaching. Professor 
James Ward, of Cambridge, says: “For exactness and 
penetration of thought, Herbart is quite on a level with 
Hume and Kant. We are most indebted to him for the 
enormous advance psychology has been enabled to make.” 
Among Herbart’s psychological works are his System of 
Psychology, and his Text-Book of Psychology, compiled from 
his lectures. His chief psychological work, Psychology as a 
Science Founded upon Experience, Metaphysics and Mathe- 
matics, appeared in 1824-5. 
Herbart returned to Gottingen in 1833, after twenty-four 
years of active work in Ko6nigsberg. During his second 
period in Géttingen, he published one important educa- 
tional work, Outline of Pedagogical Lectures (Umriss piida- 
gogischer Vorlesungen), but his time was chiefly occupied in 
preparing and giving lectures. 
He died in 1841. He is buried in Gottingen. The 
marble cross marking his grave bears the inscription: 
“To penetrate the sacred depths of Truth, 
To strive in joyful hope for human weal 
Was his life’s aim ; 
Now his free spirit hath the perfect light, 
Here rests his mortal frame.” !

The K6nigsberg ‘‘ Seminar” was closed when 
Pe etertewas Herbart withdrew from the University, but 
the master’s spirit lived, and still lives, among 
his disciples. 
The two early pioneers, who have carried Herbart’s 
theories into practice in German schools, were Karl Stoy 
and Tuiskon Ziller. 
The Pedagogical “Seminar” of the University of Jena, 
under Dr. Rein, is the most active centre of Herbartian 
thought; at the present time, therefore, it may be in- 
teresting to trace its history. In 1836 Brzoska, one of 
Herbart’s former teachers at Kdénigsberg, published a 
pamphlet in Jena entitled, Zhe Necessity for a Peda- 
gogical “ Seminar” in the University. (Die Nothwendigheit 
pidagogischer Seminare auf der Universitit.) This pam- 
phlet attracted considerable attention, but the death of 
the author arrested the further development of the move- 
ment. 
Karl Stoy, who had studied and taught under Herbart 
at Konigsberg, and was full of enthusiasm for the further- 
ing of Herbart’s educational principles, came to Jena as 
privat-docent in 1842. He had proved his ability as a 
practical teacher, having previously worked in Bender’s 
Educational Institute at Weinheim. He formed an educa- 
tional society among his students, and revived the interest 
in the establishment of a Pedagogical “Seminar” which 
Brzoska’s pamphlet had excited. Dr. Stoy was made 
professor of pedagogy at the University, and he established 
a “Seminar” and practice-school in connection with his 
work, 
During forty years, with the exception of some time
-P-A-G-E-199
APPENDIX 189 
  
spent in Heidelberg, Stoy continued his labours in Jena. 
His “Seminar” became a centre of pedagogical thought, 
and an inspiration to many who were afterwards famous 
for their educational work. 
Stoy wrote many pedagogical books: School and Life 
(Schule und Leben), Home Pedagogy (Hauspddagogik), 
House and School Government (Haus und Schulpolizet), 
Organization of Training Colleges (Organization des Lehrer- 
seminars), and Home Geography and Language Teaching 
(Heimatskunde und Sprachunterricht). Wis chief work is 
his Encyclopedia of Pedagogics. 
Stoy seized and vigorously expounded Herbart’s doc- 
trines, and he applied them chiefly to the work of primary 
schools, but he contributed little in the way of new ideas. 
He accepted Herbart’s psychology and ethics as the 
foundation of his educational system. He believed that 
the idea of historical development served as a guide for 
the selection of humanistic studies, and he held that the 
theory of the formal steps was the rational method ot 
imparting knowledge, but he rejected the fairy tales and 
Robinson Crusoe, which other followers of Herbart con- 
sider to be the chief humanistic studies in the child’s 
early years, and he refused to accept the scheme of con- 
centration worked out by Ziller and others. On the death 
of Stoy, in 1885, Dr. Wilhelm Rein was called to the chair 
of pedagogy at Jena. 
Tuiskon Ziller (1817-1883), after having studied phil- 
ology at Leipsic, became a teacher in a secondary school 
at Meiningen. His experience as a teacher awakened in 
him a love for educational questions. He returned to 
Leipsic to qualify as Privat-docent in law, but his natural  
-P-A-G-E-200
190 APPENDIX 
inclinations led him, in 1856, to publish an essay, Zntvo- 
auction to General Pedagogy (Hinleitung in die allgemeine 
Padagogik). 
This was followed by a treatise on Zhe Government of 
Children (Die Regierung der Kinder). 
This work called public attention to educational prob- 
lems, and, with the help of sympathetic supporters, he 
established a “Seminar” and practice-school in Leipsic, 
similar to that of Herbart in K6nigsberg, and as professor 
of pedagogy directed the work of the students.  Ziller’s 
great work, Basis of the Doctrine of Instruction as a Moral 
Force (Grundlegung zur Lehre vom ersichenden Unterricht) 
was published in 1865. 
This book roused considerable interest in Herbart, and 
led to the formation of a society for the study of Scientific 
Pedagogy. This society later consisted of hundreds of 
members in various parts of Germany, who formed them- 
selves into local branches for the purpose of discussing 
educational questions from a Herbartian point of view. 
Ziller’s later works were Lectures on General Pedagogy 
(Vorlesungen iiber allgemeine Padagogik) and General Philo- 
sophical Ethics (Allgemeine philosophische Ethik).  Ziller 
died in 1883, and the Pedagogical “Seminar” at Leipsic 
came to an end. 
Ziller was profoundly influenced by Herbart, and un- 
doubtedly his fundamental principles are entirely in accord 
with those of his master ; but he was a bold and original 
thinker, and he gave a free and independent interpretation 
to many of Herbart’s ideas, which evoked the hostility of 
the more conservative of Herbart’s adherents.  Ziller’s 
three questions are :— 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
APPENDIX 191 
  
How is the subject-matter of the school studies to be 
selected ? 
How are the studies to be connected ? 
What is the true method of instruction? 
And the educational principles which underlie the solu- 
tion of these questions are purely Herbartian. Ziller be- 
lieved in the moral training of the child through instruction 
in the ordinary school subjects, and in the idea that the 
natural contents of the child’s mind derived from his 
experience and intercourse and school instruction, furnish 
the only reliable guide to the selection and arrangement 
of his school studies, and in the necessity of developing 
in the child a permanent, far-reaching, and direct interest 
in the world and in humanity. 
The freedom which Ziller allowed himself in applying 
Herbart’s principles to the selection of subject-matter, and 
his method of connecting the subjects of study, were re- 
garded with displeasure by the rigid followers of Herbart. 
Stoy wrote: “I have nothing to do with Ziller novelties. 
I look upon them as harmful exaggerations.” 
A year after the death of Stoy Dr. Wilhelm Rein was 
called to the chair of pedagogy in Jena. Professor Rein 
had studied pedagogy under Stoy in Jena, and under Ziller 
in Leipsic ; afterwards he taught in Ziller’s practice-school, 
and later he became Director of the Normal School at 
Eisenach. Under Dr. Rein’s inspiring guidance interest 
in educational problems has been steadily increasing, and 
at the present time his Seminar in Jena is the most famous 
in Europe. 
Of the seven hundred students at the Jena University 
one-tenth are enrolled under Dr. Rein. These students  
-P-A-G-E-202
192 APPENDIX 
  
are of all nationalities; even Japan is occasionally repre- 
sented. 
Prof. Rein is the real head of both the “Seminar” and 
practice-school, and there is a headmaster of the school 
who advises and criticises in the absence of the professor. 
Prof. Rein spends some time daily in the school, visiting 
the various classes and offering “suggestive and effective 
criticism” to the students. An American student thus 
describes his educational principles: ‘The 8 years’ course 
of study used in the practice-school has been worked out 
in detail by Prof. Rein in accordance with his interpretation 
of the principles laid down by Herbart and developed 
by Ziller. The basis of this pedagogy is Herbart’s ethics 
and psychology. Herbart’s ethics, as presented by Pro- 
fessor Rein, is chiefly modern Christian socialism ; in his 
lectures on psychology he presents a pedagogical appli- 
cation to the principles of psychology as developed by the 
followers of Herbart, Professor Wundt of Leipsic, and 
Professor Ziehen of Jena.” 
The entire course of study is published in a set of eight 
volumes entitled, Zheory and Practice of Instruction in the 
Primary School (the eight school years), (Zheorte und 
Praxis des Volkschulunterrichtes—die acht Schuljahren). 
These books were written by Dr. Rein and two of his 
colleagues. The first volume contains, as an introduction, 
Dr. Rein’s general pedagogical principles. 
The pedagogical “Seminar” is an organic part of the 
University, and receives an annual stipend from the State. 
The members of the ‘‘Seminar” may be of three 
kinds :— 
I. Merely visiting students who attend the lectures of
-P-A-G-E-203
API'ENDIX 193 
  
the professor, and listen to any lessons they chose to hear 
in the practice-school. 
II. Special members, who are expected to attend lectures 
and school classes, and to take an active part in the criti- 
cism of lessons, arranging school excursions, writing reports, 
ete, 
ILI. Ordinary members, who participate in the entire 
activity of the Seminary, and in addition undertake to 
teach a subject in the school, for not less than a term, 
under the direction of the class teacher. 
The three weekly meetings, which must be attended by 
all members of the “Seminar,’ are the Theoretikum 
Pratikum, and Conference. 
The first is a meeting conducted by the professor, de- 
voted to the discussion of special educational questions 
which have arisen in the school during the week. 
The Pratikum is a specimen lesson given by a student 
as a typical illustration of his method, in the presence of his 
fellow-students, the teachers of the school, and the professor. 
The Conference is a meeting held under the direction of 
the professor to discuss and criticise the student’s lesson. 
The student is allowed to criticise himself first, after which 
an appointed critic gives a thorough criticism of the lesson ; 
then disputed points are discussed. The American student 
before quoted, in describing one of these Conferences, 
writes : “ After the questions have been argued an hour or 
more under Professor Rein’s constant direction, he sum- 
marizes the results, often adds points which have been 
overlooked, and, along with candid and wholesome advice 
to the student under criticism, he passes his generally very 
just verdict upon the lesson. Criticism is Professor Rein’s
-P-A-G-E-204

194. APPENDIX 
  
strong point. Faults do not escape him, and he suggests 
their causes and remedies. The system of pedagogy he 
has studied and developed during twenty years of school 
work is his guide in solving questions of theory, and the 
ideal teacher he has in mind is the criterion he applies to 
practice. Those students who go through the whole ordeal 
of the Seminar find it sufficiently terrible; never is it a 
joke, though at times it has its humour.” 
When the serious business of the Conference is over, 
the evening ends in a truly German fashion with toasts and 
songs. My friend goes on to describe a student’s toast to 
Dr. Rein. “He responds with a short, happy speech, 
which elicits cheer after cheer, until a word, directing 
thought to the earnestness of the life of a teacher, hushes 
his hearers into that silence which reigns when the inner- 
most soul pays homage to the power touching it. Depart- 
ing, he bids the assembly ‘good-night,’ to which the 
students respond by respectfully rising. There is not one 
of them who has not profited by the professor’s concrete 
example as a critic. He operates with such expertness, 
giving his convincing reason for every slash of his knife, 
as he cuts away false practice, that the patient quite forgets 
the pain of the incisions, while gratefully anticipating the 
assured relief. The professor is a sincere man, who loves 
an honest word more than gold, who goes far out of his 
way to show others their path. He has the genius of 
being a simple man.” 
Dr. Rein has written a Jarge number of educational 
works. 
His Outlines of Pedagogics (Padagogik im Grundriss), 
of which there is an English translation, contains a sketch 
of his educational principles.

Herbartian thought has considerably influenced the 
teaching in the schools of Middle Germany. In Eisenach 
there is an excellent school and training college conducted 
on Herbartian lines by Direktor Ackermann. I spent some 
weeks in this school two years ago. There were 241 pupils 
in the school and 31 students in the training college. The 
school has nine classes; in the ninth are little girls of six years 
of age, and in the first are girls of fifteen and sixteen years.

At Altenburg there is a thoroughly Herbartian High 
School for Girls directed by Dr. Karl Juste. There is 
also a large mixed primary school of one thousand chil- 
dren which is entirely Herbartian in character. Rektor 
Ufer is the director of this school. He is the author of an 
illuminating little work Jntroduction to Herbart (Vorschule 
der Padigogik Herbarts), Some of the finest Scripture and 
history lessons I have ever heard were given by Rektor 
Ufer and Dr. Juste in the Altenburg schools. In Weimar, 
Gotha, Karlsruhe, and other parts of Germany, and in 
Chur in Switzerland, there are Herbartian training colleges. 
The Frankische Stiftung at Halle is profoundly in- 
fluenced by Herbartian thought. Dr. Frick, the former 
Direktor, applied the Herbartian principles to secondary 
education in the various schools under his contro!. An 
interesting example of a country Herbartian school is the 
one in Blankenhaim under Rektor Scholz, author of Zhe

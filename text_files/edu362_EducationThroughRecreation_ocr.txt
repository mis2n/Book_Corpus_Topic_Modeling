  EDUCATION THROUGH 
RECREATION 
EXcELLENT EQUIPMENT FOR RECREATION 
No principle in home life or school life has re- 
ceived more universal recognition among English- 
speaking people than that expressed in the old 
saying, “All work and no play makes Jack a dull 
boy.” Following the example of the earliest 
school systems of America, Cleveland long ago 
made provision for the play of the pupils. 
More than 10 years ago Cleveland organized 
a department of physical training in which plays 
and games had a prominent place. At the 
entrance of one of the offices in the Administra- 
tion Building of the Board of Education is a 
significant sign: 
Director 
Medical Inspection 
Physical Training 
Play 
Moreover, Cleveland has organized a division 
devoted to the ‘‘schoolroom and indoor recrea- 
tion” of the pupils of the first four grades that 
is nearly unique among school systems. 
11
-P-A-G-E-12
  Thus physical equipment and supervision for 
recreation have been more definitely and sys- 
tematically included in the plans of school ad- 
ministration in Cleveland than is usual else- 
where. What is more, the city has invested 
large sums of money in providing recreational 
facilities for the pupils. The school yards sur- 
pass in size, equipment, and adaptability for 
play those of most of our large cities. Forty- 
six of the school buildings have two playrooms 
apiece, 18 others one playroom; 44 have gym- 
nasiums; seven have space prepared for swim- 
ming pools, two of which are installed; 94 have 
regular auditoriums, or else use the lower hall 
for auditorium purposes, the total combined 
seating capacity being 43,797; and 25 of the 
school yards are provided with playground equip- 
ment. The total playground area is 4,716,997 
square feet, or more than 108 acres. (Foramore 
detailed statement of equipment, see Table 1 on 
page 24.) 
INTEREST IN SUMMER PLAYGROUNDS 
Since 1913 the School Board, under the general 
supervision of the Medical Inspector, has con- 
ducted public Play Centers for the children of 
the city, on the theory that organized play is 
a valuable means of education. The Medical 
12
-P-A-G-E-13
  Inspector is also Director of Physical Educa- 
tion. For the purpose of efficiency and econ- 
omy of administration, the activities variously 
called Summer Manual Training, School Gar- 
dens, and Play Centers were united. Half ahun- 
dred trained graduate playleaders are employed 
to organize and conduct the games, athletics, 
folk dances, and numerous clubs. Among the 
clubs may be mentioned the Nature Club, the 
Sewing Club, the Hammer and Nail Club, the 
Cardboard Club, the Story Telling Club, and 
the Dramatic Club. 
Some idea of the scope of the work may be 
gathered from the fact that during the summer 
season of 1915, 18 playgrounds were in opera- 
tion for 49 days from the last week of June till 
the first week of September. Approximately 
10,000 children were enrolled. The average 
daily attendance was 3,334 for all playgrounds, 
or 222 for each. There were in all 163,366 
separate visits to playgrounds. There were a 
few more boys than girls. The total operating 
expense for the year was a little over $5,000, 
which means that the cost per child was under 
three and a half cents per visit, or about fifty 
cents per child for the entire summer. 
It is clear from this brief summary of facts 
that the children of Cleveland like to play in 
well-equipped playgrounds under trained leader- 
13  
-P-A-G-E-14
ship. Capably directed work of this kind is per- 
haps as valuable as anything the City School 
Administration does for the children under its 
guidance, and the results that are bound to 
flow from it are highly beneficial. It would be 
very unfortunate for both the children and the 
city if, for any reason, this energetic beginning 
were not to be followed up with enthusiasm 
and intelligence. 
Recreation Facirities ONty Partiy Usep 
The most natural and historically the first use 
of the recreational facilities in the schools was 
at recess. Nominally, 15 minutes during each 
morning session is allowed for recess through 
all the grades. As a matter of fact, the morn- 
ing recess is often omitted, or regularly done 
away with, at the discretion of the principal. 
In such cases it is customary to dismiss earlier, 
the school session being shortened by the extent 
of time supposed to be gained by omitting the 
recess. The afternoon recess of former genera- 
tions has entirely disappeared from the upper 
four grades of the elementary schools. 
The recess in Cleveland is used in the tradi- 
tional manner for the ‘‘blowing off of steam.” 
On the physical side, such a recess is certainly 
worth while. But this conception of the re- 
14
-P-A-G-E-15
  
cess is quite inadequate under the present inter- 
pretation of the educational value and social 
significance of children’s play. ; 
The playground provides almost the only 
possible opportunity for sociability and demo- 
cratic relationships of a school class. The school- 
room is ill adapted to serve as a laboratory of 
citizenship or for the practice of democracy. 
Schoolroom management is established on an 
almost purely autocratic basis. The teacher is 
much more like a ruler on a throne than like a 
president or a parent. Unless other satisfactory 
provision is made, then, from the standpoint 
of preparation for citizenship, the recess can no 
more safely be omitted from the school pro- 
gram than can the study of American history. 
While recesses in Cleveland are generally 
unorganized and lack method, they are some- 
times used for the purpose of practising for 
the physical tests conducted by the Department 
of Physical Training, and classes of the lower 
grades use the school playgrounds to some ex- 
tent in playing games suggested by the Depart- 
ment of Schoolroom and Indoor Recreation. 
In some cases principals encourage these games 
at recess. 
Under conditions attending recesses that are 
unorganized and that lack method children do 
nevertheless play games, but there is a vast 
15
-P-A-G-E-16
ee eee ope 
deal of informal, sometimes anti-social, and | 
relatively valueless romping and scuffling, and 
the recess becomes a period not of genuine social 
increase, but rather of social leakage. 
ScHootRoom AND InDooR RECREATION 
In the first four grades, periods of “‘rest and 
recreation” are given several times daily. 
These play periods do not come at regular 
intervals, but at the discretion of the grade 
teacher. They are from two to five minutes in 
length. The activities of these periods are ex- 
clusively formal games as distinguished from 
plays, such as climbing, swinging, tetering, 
playing in the sand, doll play, and the like. 
Primarily the purpose of these periods is for 
rest and recreation, but the games are chosen 
with some regard for their correlation with 
school subjects and for mental development. 
The games are methodically taught to the chil- 
dren by the Supervisor of Schoolroom’and In- 
door Recreation, or by the teacher of physical 
training or the grade teacher, under the direc- 
tion of the supervisor. They are classified, 
and used according to classification, as Active, 
Quiet, Games Correlated with School Subjects, 
and Rhythmic. The following are typical illus- 
trations of games used: 
16 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
Active Games 
Circle Bean Bag (passing bean bags) 
Jumping the Brook (running around the 
room and jumping over two chalk lines 
on the floor) 
Stepping Stones (stepping or hopping from 
one circle to another chalked on the 
floor) 
Jumping over Stick (running in single file 
and jumping over stick) 
Jumping over Seats (hands on the desks and 
jumping over seats) 
Circle Seat Relay (running down the aisle 
circling the rear seat) 
Squirrel in a Tree (adaptation of ‘‘Puss in 
the Corner’’) 
Quiet Games and Games Correlated with School 
Subjects 
Visualizing brief lists of words on the board 
Identifying child by his voice 
Finding a hidden object, as eraser 
Memorizing, from quick observation, articles 
of clothing worn by classmates 
Memorizing picture from quick observation; 
describing picture, each child repeating 
what has been said and adding a word 
Adding or multiplying number of taps made 
with pointer on the floor 
Spelling game, children standing in line and 
holding letters in the right order 
2 17
-P-A-G-E-18
Rhythmic Games 
Children’s Polka 
Thread the Needle 
Shoemaker Dance 
I See You 
Klap Dance 
Did You Ever See a Lassie 
Other simple singing games and folk dances 
Valuable and desirable as the indoor play 
periods may be, they are not a complete substi- 
tute for outdoor play during the school session. 
When the recreational activities of children are 
transferred from outdoors to indoors their value 
is lessened through: 
. Loss of fresh air 
. Lack of sunshine 
. Restriction of space and full freedom of 
activity 
. Diminished pleasure 
. Narrowed range of activities 
. Extreme brevity of the period 
. Dust raised by the running and jumping NOP Whe 
The spontaneous play of children is now gen- 
erally recognized as the expression of such fun- 
damental human instincts as hunting, fighting, 
creating, nurturing, imitating, etc. All out-of- 
doors is none too large to provide the needed 
stimuli to these instincts, and every unneces- 
sary narrowing down of environment denatu- 
rizes by so much the essentials in child play.

Furthermore, the natural plays of children of 
the earlier grades are activities prompted by 
instincts which are expressed, not so much in 
formal games as in informal plays, according to 
the distinction mentioned before. 
Priayerounps Inte Most or YEAR 
‘Pupils will not be allowed to . . . remain 
on or revisit the premises after dismissal of the 
school, except by special permission of the prin- 
cipal of the building.” So read the Rules of 
the Board of Education. Whether under the 
circumstances this is a wise rule or not, it 
suggests disuse of the school playgrounds, and 
generally, though happily not universally, the 
suggestion is taken and children are accustomed 
to leaving the school premises out of their minds 
in their hours of leisure, and to substituting 
the street, the vacant lot, the back yard, and the 
moving-picture show instead. 
Another great “unwelcome” is the playground 
apparatus entirely denuded during the school 
year, all except the bare frames being put away 
in storage. As if to add to the gloom of the 
bare appearance of the playground, one sees 
the worn and empty sand-bins, from which the 
children, as one principal reported, had “carried 
away the remaining sand in tin cans and pails 
19 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  that they might play with it at home.” Un- 
thinkable as ‘‘stripped apparatus” is in the 
vacation school period, it is really more pathetic 
and inconsistent in term time, when the freedom 
of activity is curtailed and there is even greater 
need than in vacation time to invite children 
from sedentary to active occupation. 
Many Gymnasiums UNEQUIPPED 
Twenty-five out of 31 gymnasiums in the ele- 
mentary schools lack equipment. An un- 
equipped gymnasium is essentially an addi- 
tional playroom. It fails in the quality which 
is supposed to distinguish it. It is somewhat 
like a house without furniture, or a shop with- 
out machinery. Data are lacking as to exact 
use made of the gymnasiums, but so far as 
available they indicate that many of the gym- 
nasiums are comparatively little used. It was 
not until several members of the Survey Staff 
had made over a thousand classroom visits, 
covering all the schools of the city, that they 
found one gymnasium being used for gymnastic 
purposes. 
Swimmine Poots UNFINISHED OR UNUSED 
Swimming is perhaps the best of all exercises 
for bringing the fundamental muscle groups into 
exhilarating and vigorous activity. By some 
20
-P-A-G-E-23
  Stripped apparatus at the Brownell School
-P-A-G-E-24

-P-A-G-E-25
  authorities it is claimed to be the most quickly 
recuperative of all sports. But swimming has 
mental and spiritual values also. The boy or 
girl who learns to swim has gained an element 
of confidence, a consciousness of achievement, 
a broader courage, or, as William James might 
say, an added chamber to the soul. The Greeks 
said of a truly ignorant man, ‘‘He can neither 
swim nor read.” Significantly, several of our 
best known institutions of learning and some 
public schools have made ability to swim a 
requirement for a diploma. 
Cleveland has wonderful natural facilities for 
swimming. But natural facilities alone are not 
sufficient for the universal acquirement of swim- 
ming, except among primitive peoples. The 
Board of Education started to move in the 
right direction and then halted. The physical 
structure of seven or more schools provides 
space for swimming pools, but: in only two 
instances have the pools been completed and 
put in actual operation. In one case the jani- 
tor, with a commendable sense of social respon- 
sibility, permitted boys to swim on Saturday. 
And, yes, the pool had been used by the teachers. 
‘‘For some reason this year,’’ said the principal, 
“our teachers are fresher and more courageous 
and amiable than ever before at this time of the 
year. I do not know how to account for it, 
21 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
  unless it is because they have had great times 
going into the swimming pool.”

Reports from 3308 public school pupils in Cleve-

88 per cent of the girls over eight years of age 
in the elementary school cannot swim 
77 per cent of the girls in the high schools 
cannot swim 
45 per cent of the boys over eight in the ele-

34 per cent of the boys in the high school

  The age at which children learn to swim is 
significant: 
41 per cent of all boys and girls who could 
swim had learned by their 10th year 
65 per cent had learned by their 12th year 
94 per cent had learned by their 14th year.

  The ideal time of life for instruction in swim- 
ming is between the ages of eight and 12. No 
pupil of sound physical body should leave the 
elementary school unable to swim. Existing 
pools should be run to their full capacity, even 
many hours a day if necessary to accommodate 
all; and new pools should be added or lake 
baths substituted, until Cleveland is fully 
equipped to teach swimming universally to 
school children.

ATHLETIC TRAINING IN HigH AND ELEMENTARY 
ScHOOLS 
Athletics constitutes a regular division of the 
course in physical training for high school boys. 
All participation in athletics and all instruction 
or coaching for such participation are subject 
to the supervision of the Educational Depart- 
ment. All professionalism is forbidden and coach- 
ing by regular teachers only is permitted. 
For the control of athletic games in the high 
schools there exists a Senate consisting of the 
Superintendent of Schools, the Assistant Super- 
27
-P-A-G-E-32
  intendent in charge of Physical Training, and 
the high school principals. This Senate makes 
rules and regulations governing the conduct of 
inter-scholastic games. There is also a Games 
Committee for each branch of inter-scholastic 
sports, consisting of the Supervisor of Physical 
Training and a faculty member from each high 
school, nominated by the principal. 
Table 2 shows the range of athletic activities 
among high school boys for 1914-15.

The great disparity in the number of teams 
in the various high schools will be noticed, as 
well as the fact that in the technical schools, 
in which there is a larger element of motor 
28
-P-A-G-E-33
  
training in the school work, are found the 
larger number of teams. If there is any differ- 
ence in the need of participation in active sports 
as between academic and technical schools, the 
academic school has the greater need. 
The extent of participation of high school 
girls in athletics is indicated by Table 3.

ATHLETIC Tests VERSUS ATHLETIC GAMES 
In the elementary schools practically no games 
or athletics are conducted either between dif- 
ferent schools or between classes in the same 
school. As a substitute, athletic tests for the 
boys are held. The schools compete for first 
place on the basis of the percentage of the 
29 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
number of boys passing the tests. The tests 
are conducted on the school playgrounds and 
are in charge of the teachers of physical train- 
  ing. Boys in the upper four grades only are 
eligible. The tests are as follows: 
Fifth Grade Minimum limit 
Standing broad jump 5 ft. 4 in. 
Chinning 4 times 
50-yard dash 84 seconds 
Sith Grade 
Two standing broad 
jumps 11 ft. 2 in. 
Chinning 4 times 
50-yard dash 82 seconds 
Seventh Grade 
Two standing broad 
jumps 12 ft. 
Chinning 6 times 
50-yard dash 8 seconds 
Eighth Grade 
Three standing broad 
jumps 18 ft. 6 in. 
Chinning 5 times 
50-yard dash 72 seconds 
The method of scoring is as follows: 
“One point shall be scored by equaling or 
exceeding the limit indicated. 
‘The standing of a school in a test shall be 
determined by dividing the sum of points so

scored by the number of boys enrolled in the 
respective grades. 
“The District Trophy will be awarded to the 
school making the highest percentage in its re- 
spective district. 
“The City Trophy will be held for one year 
by the school attaining the highest percentage.” 
The attainment of a standard of athletic 
ability as called for in these tests is most de- 
sirable and the general aims and purposes of the 
tests are highly commendable. But as a sub- 
stitute for athletic games they fall short in sev- 
eral particulars. They lack the full stimulus 
of personal competition. A boy runs against 
time. The immediate, instinctive spur of a run- 
ning mate or competitor is lacking and the 
powers of the runner are not stretched to their 
full limits, even when he may think he is doing 
his best. 
The standards are, for some boys, easily 
within their power of attainment and they are 
conscious that they need not exert themselves 
to the limit.. There is no incentive to make a 
supreme effort or to acquire a surplus of ability. 
The spiritual value of competition in which boys 
of this period are absolutely engrossed is the 
maximum of effort which it calls forth. In the 
majority of cases the chief difference between 
men in the presence of a crisis lies in the relative 
31
-P-A-G-E-38
  capacity for extreme effort. This capacity 
is part of one’s character. Competition is an 
essential in the moral training of children of 
these grades of the elementary schools, for with- 
out it few, if any, will ever reach a maximum 
of development of the will and capacity to try. 
Again, the jump, the pull-up, and the run- 
ning, conducted as tests, do not have the ele- 
ment of sudden crisis so frequent in such games 
as baseball and the like, which requires that all 
the physical, mental, and moral powers of the 
players converge in one supreme effort to meet 
the crisis. Here is educational ‘‘stuff” for chil- 
dren not found today in the schoolroom or 
school studies, nor in athletic tests either. 
Under ordinary city conditions there is no other 
way whereby our children may be saved in this 
matter than by athletic games. 
Harpy GAMES IN THE ELEMENTARY GRADES 
Organization of teams and games in the ele- 
mentary schools is essential because there is 
no clear-cut division between the elementary 
school and the high school with respect to 
adolescent needs and interests.* Dr. C. Ward 
Crampton, Director of Physical Education in

ADOLESCENT Boys IN THE GRADES AND HicH 
ScHOOLS 
There were then, in the elementary schools of 
Cleveland, in the second semester of 1914-15, 
approximately 3439 post-pubescent or adoles- 
cent boys, and 3651 adolescent boys in all 
the high schools for the corresponding date, or 
nearly as many mature boys in the elementary 
grades as in all the high schools put together. 
But if we add, as we should, the number of 
pubescent boys to the number of post-pubescent 
boys in each class of school, we find there were 
6025 pubescent and adolescent boys in the 
34

-P-A-G-E-43
elementary schools as against 4142 in all the 
high schools, or 45 per cent more pubescent 
and adolescent boys in the elementary grades 
than in all the high schools combined. 
If we are to advocate athletic games on the 
ground of adolescent needs and interests, the 
need for such games is as great in the elementary 
schools as in the high schools, and to confine 
them to high schools is an inconsistency in the 
administration of educational opportunities. 
This is in agreement with a more general con- 
clusion made by Professor A. J. Inglis* after 
a study of age-grade distribution in more than 
25 cities. He says that any attempt to make 
a sharp differentiation between elementary and 
secondary education at any one period is quite 
unjustifiable. 
Again, practice in hardy games ought to 
begin before the age when most pupils enter 
the high school. The pre-pubescent years 
from 10 to 12 are, for the majority of boys, 
especially favorable for the beginning of ath- 
letic interest and skill. If participation is 
delayed beyond the elementary school period, 
sufficient interest and skill for personal partici- 
pation in later years are far less likely to be 
developed. 
* Dr. Alexander J. Inglis, ‘A Fundamental Problem in the 
Reorganization of the High School,’’ The School Review, Vol. 
XXIII, No. 5. 
35 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
Organization of teams and games in the 
elementary schools is essential also because 
there exists no other agency in the community 
capable of general organization and conduct of 
games for children of elementary school ages. 
Left to the street or vacant lot, the organiza- 
tion serves the few rather than the many, and 
the type is that of the gang rather than that of 
the team. And the matter should not be post- 
poned till the high school period, for the major- 
ity of school boys never reach the high school. 
But they do become citizens. 
Therefore, the organization of inter-group 
school games in a democratic country is a 
fundamental duty and unavoidable responsi- 
bility of the educational system. 
Some OBJECTIONS TO INTER-SCHOLASTIC 
GAMES 
Stress has been laid upon games between groups 
or classes in the same school. But inter-school 
games have their place also. Objection is made 
to inter-scholastic games in elementary schools 
on the ground that they engender ill feelings 
and jealousies between principals or teachers. 
This can result only in cases of entire miscon- 
ception of the purpose and aim of inter-scholastic 
games. If the general welfare is not worth the 
36 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  price of loss of individual glory in the mind of 
any principal or teacher, what hope is there 
from such leadership in civic ideals? If a man 
love his precinct more than his city, the breath 
of citizenship is not in him and he would indeed 
be a blind leader of children. It is the lack of 
this very point of view that inter-scholastic 
games, conducted for the cause of education, 
can so well bring about that is the cause of the 
whole trouble. The supposed failure discloses 
the necessity for the continuation of such games. 
A second objection often made is that inter- 
scholastic games give occasion for rowdyism. 
In some cities teachers have been mobbed. 
This objection discloses the fact that elemen- 
tary school boys have arrived at the age of 
mob action and have not yet attained either 
self-control or a sense of social duty. Inter- 
scholastic games are needed to educate our 
children along these very lines. Here also fail- 
ure points to the need of continuing. These 
games are the very opportunities for the 
development of control in times of stress. 
Neighborhood jealousies, race prejudices, mob 
violence, perhaps wars, exist largely because in 
the education of children and youth the in- 
stincts and emotions under stress have not been 
brought under the control of the will and the 
reason. It is notable that where inter-institu- 
37  
-P-A-G-E-46
  tion or inter-community games are rare, con- 
trol, justice, and courtesies between opposing 
factions are rare; and where such games are 
most frequent, the best order prevails. 
A third objection frequently advanced is 
that inter-school games in elementary schools 
get boys ‘‘on the cheering-line”’ altogether too 
soon. This objection suggests a neglect in the 
matter of organization of teams and games in 
the elementary schools rather than a bad result 
of inter-school games. Inter-school games need 
not in the least, and never should, interfere 
with general participation in games. No boy 
who has been gripped by the joy of active 
games and who has opportunity for playing 
them will voluntarily abandon playing for the 
sake of joining the cheering-line. Here again 
the difficulty lies in the misconception of the 
aims and purposes of inter- and intra-school 
games. Under proper management each should 
supplement and stimulate the other. 
Games AssIGNED TO GRADES 
A good list of games is issued by the Depart- 
ment of Physical Training for use in grades 
three to eight. These are classified under three 
heads, namely, Song Games, Room Games, 
and Playground Games. Valuable and desir- 
38
-P-A-G-E-47
    
able as these games are, it will nevertheless be 
evident, even to the casual observer, that Song 
Games lack some of the essential elements of 
training which have been suggested above. 
It is equally evident that Room Games, such as 
Zig Zag Bean Bag and other bean-bag games, 
Blackboard Relay Race, Going to Jerusalem, 
and the like, cannot take the place of the more 
vigorous athletic games for pupils 10 to 14 
(not to say 15 or 16) years of age. While the 
Playground Games come nearer supplying the 
elements needed, even these fall short of what 
is desirable. They consist very largely of 
games of tag, and the simpler games played 
with an inflated ball. Not one of these, by 
any stretch of the imagination, could be con- 
ceived as holding such wide-spread interest 
as do our great national games, which boys of 
grammar school age universally admire and 
attempt. The Playground Games hold about 
the same relation to the national games that 
tether-ball does to tennis. 
Athletic games in a very few years greatly 
influenced 100,000 Filipinos in departing from 
the ghastly custom of head hunting. But Song 
Games, Room Games, and Playground Games of 
the kind mentioned could never have converted 
Filipinos from head hunting, nor can they con- 
vert or restrain from hoodlumism, from ‘‘bum- 
39
-P-A-G-E-48
  ming,” from ‘“‘rushing the drunks,” from street 
fighting, and from other undesirable gang activi- 
ties, the boys who begin to participate in these 
things long before the elementary school age is 
passed and the high school age is reached. 
CLEVELAND SCHOOLS AND SoctaL ACTIVITIES 
Of course, all school activities are, in a sense, 
social activities. By social activities is meant 
the out-of-school activities conducted in school 
buildings, such as receptions, parties, club, or 
society meetings, and the like. Complete data 
of such activities are not available for this 
report. In general, it may be said that the 
school buildings of Cleveland are not at present 
commonly utilized for such social activities. 
WHAT ONE HIGH SCHOOL DID DURING THE 
YEAR 1914-15 
First Year Puptls— 
Freshman reception given by the Faculty 
to the parents of first year pupils and to the 
first year pupils. 
Second Year Puptls— 
No social functions. 
Third Year Pupils— 
Boys’ society of about 30 members met once 
a week for debating. Girls’ literary society of 
40
-P-A-G-E-49
about 40 members met once a week. Meet- 
ings were of literary nature, sometimes social. 
The Girls’ Society entertained the Boys’ Society 
once with a spread and afternoon dance. Then 
the Boys’ Society gave a dance for the girls. 
About 70 pupils attended these functions. 
The junior class gave an afternoon dance to 
the senior class and 150 to 200 pupils attended. 
Fourth Year Pupils 
Boys’ society of about 25 members met once 
a week for debate. Girls’ literary society of 
about 50 members met once a week. Meetings 
were of a literary nature, sometimes social. An 
occasional meeting was open for non-members. 
The Girls’ Society gave a spread and after- 
noon dance to the members of the foot-ball team. 
About 100 were present. 
The Girls’ Society and the Boys’ Society en- 
tertained each other in turn with a spread or 
afternoon dance. The Girls’ Society gave a 
reception to its former members among the 
school alumne. 
The senior class had an evening dancing 
party, attended by about 200. The senior class 
gave an afternoon dance to the junior class. 
Between 100 and 200 were present. The senior 
class gave a luncheon to the faculty. About 
200 attended. 
41  
-P-A-G-E-50
  In General— 
The principal of the school, once every year, 
gives a banquet to foot-ball teams and to the 
men of the faculty. The school societies have 
faculty members who are present at the meet- 
ings. 
Membership in the girls’ societies is on the 
basis of scholarship. In the boys’ societies any 
member of the class is eligible for membership. 
Teachers are always present at the spreads 
and dances given at school.

Tuer Conpuct or ScHoot RECREATION 
Supervising officers, teachers, and employees 
concerned in the administration of recreation 
in the schools include practically the whole 
43  
-P-A-G-E-52
    public school corps from the superintendent 
to the custodians. The organization of this 
corps for the conduct of recreation is, naturally 
enough, rather loose and indefinite, since play 
and recreation are conducted more or less in- 
dependently by several different departments. 
While the duties of the various members of the 
corps are definite, their inter-relations and re- 
sponsibilities to one another are not. 
The diagram on page 45 shows some conflict- 
ing lines of the relationship and some duplica- 
tions of responsibilities. 
It will be seen from the diagram that there is 
no supervisor of the plays and games of the 
kindergarten. The games of the first two grades 
are both taught and supervised by the Super- 
visor of Schoolroom and Indoor Recreation, 
who is independent of the Director of Physical 
Education. Games are taught in the third 
and fourth grades by the Supervisor of School- 
room and Indoor Recreation; by the teachers 
of physical training, who are answerable to 
the Supervisor of Physical Training; and by 
the grade teachers, who are answerable to the 
Supervisor of Schoolroom and Indoor Recrea- 
tion. The Supervisor of Physical Training has 
no supervision over the kindergarten, or the first 
and second grades, and divided responsibility 
for games in the third and fourth grades. The

RECREATIONAL INFLUENCE OF SCHOOLS OUT 
oF ScHoot Hours 
Since the play and recreation of children and 
youth have come to be thought of by the pub- 
lic as social problems, we discover in this matter 
of recreation additional emphasis on the fact 
that the fundamental reason for the existence 
of our school system is its supposed influence 
on out-of- and after-school life. Does the rec- 
reational leadership of the school continue be- 
yond the regular school hours? 
The idleness and emptiness of the recrea- 
tional facilities during out-of-school hours have 
already been suggested. Children generally are 
not invited or attracted to school yards for 
play, but rather are left to the attractions of the 
street, vacant lot, show, and park, where they 
do not practise the things of the school. 
Through the generous co-operation of a num- 
ber of elementary school principals in Cleveland 
it was possible to get careful data on how and 
46
-P-A-G-E-55
  
where 915 children spent their time on a pleas- 
ant Saturday and following Sunday in June. 
From these diaries, which accounted for the 
full 24 hours of each day, it appeared that during

How 915 children spent their spare time on two pleas-

the two days each child spent on the average 
spare time as shown in the diagram on this 
page. 
In connection with what was said above re- 
47 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  
garding the failure of the assigned school games 
to grip school children, it is of interest to note 
that the games assigned to the grades were 
rarely mentioned by the children in these diaries. 
So far as could be determined the relative time 
spent by children in playing games included in 
the school lists and in other plays during the 
two days may be represented by the following 
illustrations:

A Puay CEnsus oF CLEVELAND PUPILS 
A play census, taken June 23, 1913, under the 
direction of the Chief Medical Inspector and

CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THIS CENSUS 
1. That just at the age (under 15) when play 
and activity are the fundamental requirements 
for proper growth and development 41 per cent 
of the children seen were doing nothing. The boy 
without play is father to the man without a job. 
2. Fifty-one per cent of all the children seen 
were in the streets, in the midst of all the 
traffic, dirt, and heat, and in an environment 
conducive to just the wrong kind of play: 
3. That only six per cent of the children seen 
4 49  
-P-A-G-E-58
  were on vacant lots despite the fact that in 
most of the districts vacant lots were available 
as play spaces. A place to play does not solve 
the problem: there must be a play leader. 
4. That even though 36 playgrounds were 
open and 16 of them with apparatus up, only 
1869, or 11 per cent, of the children seen within 
four blocks of a playground were playing on 
playgrounds. Last Friday 6488 children played 
on playgrounds. 
5. That of the 7358 children reported to have 
been playing, 3171 were reported to have been 
playing by doing some of the following things: 
fighting, teasing, pitching pennies, shooting 
craps, stealing apples, ‘roughing a peddler,” 
chasing chickens, tying can to dog, etc., but 
most of them were reported to have been ‘‘just 
fooling” —not playing anything in particular. 
6. We need more and better playgrounds and 
a better trained leadership. 
THE RECREATIONAL INTERESTS OF CLEVELAND 
PuPiis 
That the play interests of children and youth 
answer to deep-seated needs and are essential 
for fullest development and education is now 
so universally admitted that only the mere 
statement is here necessary. It is also evi- 
dent that these play interests are the prototypes 
50
-P-A-G-E-59
of the great lines of human interest, endeavor, 
and achievement represented in adult life and 
in educational work today. 
Let us consider a few of these interests with 
relation to their educational and social signifi- 
cance. These include the universal passion 
for and admiration of achievement in physical 
activity, bodily skill, and prowess in active 
plays, games, and sports. They have the same 
roots as those interests which once determined 
a race’s supremacy and inspired all song and 
story. They are fundamentally related to physi- 
cal vigor and health, and in the field of physical 
education are paramount in importance. 
Among the great games to which these inter- 
ests lead is baseball. The physically sound 
American boy who never plays baseball is los- 
ing an important element in his education. 
Seventy-five per cent of elementary school 
boys over eight years of age in a large Cleve- 
land school play baseball; 25 per cent do 
not. Eighty-three per cent over 10 years of 
age play; 17 per cent do not. The percentage 
for elementary school boys over 10 who play 
baseball! may seem high, and yet if there are 
even as many as 17 physically sound boys in 
every hundred, from 10 to 15 years of age, who 
never play baseball, it is certainly unfortunate, 
to say the least.

There is another aspect of the matter to be con- 
sidered. Baseball is as much social as physical. 
Boys should not only play baseball, but they 
should play on well-organized teams. Scrub 
baseball is not the real thing. A scrub team 
has scarcely half the social value of a regular 
team. Forty-one per cent of elementary school 
boys who play say they play on a “regular 
nine,” a rather higher percentage than one 
would expect to find except under a loose inter- 
pretation of what constitutes a ‘‘regular nine.” 
Forty per cent of the players over 10 belong 
to “‘regular teams.” 
The conditions under which boys play ball 
are important. For one elementary school boy 
who practises on the school premises and three 
who practise in the park, six practise in the 
street, and 18 in vacant lots.

Among high school boys the story is not very 
different. Ninety per cent of the boys play 
baseball, but only 26 per cent of the players 
are organized; seven per cent practise on the 
streets, eight per cent on school property, 42 
per cent in vacant lots, and 43 per cent in parks. 
Rather unusual opportunities exist in Cleve- 
land for attending good baseball games. Sev- 
enty-seven per cent of the elementary school 
boys attend ball games as spectators. Ninety- 
one per cent of these go to the parks to see the 
games, and 84 per cent of them go as often as 
once a week. 
It will be remembered that one objection 
advanced against inter-school games is the sup- 
posed tendency to put boys on the cheering-line 
too soon. It seems that this has been accom- 
plished to an unusual degree in the absence of 
inter-school games, and it is a fair question to 
raise whether the organization of elementary 
school ball players would not really greatly re- 
duce this substitution of rooting for playing. 
Eighty-four per cent of high school boys go to 
baseball games; 97 per cent of these go to games 
in the parks; and 52 per cent go as often as 
once a week. It would appear from this that 
elementary school boys without the privilege of 
inter-school games are found ‘‘on the cheering- 
line”’ at ball games even oftener than high school 
53

    boys, whose schools participate in inter-school

BASEBALL FOR GIRLS 
But Cleveland school girls as well as boys play 
baseball. Although girls play a modified game, 
the number participating is of much interest. 
Of the elementary school girls over eight years 
of age 30 per cent, and of high school girls 
66 per cent, play some form of baseball. This 
high percentage for high school girls is probably 
due to the influence of the school in the organ- 
ization of indoor baseball teams for high school 
girls. It should be noted that in Cleveland it 
is quite customary for both girls and boys to 
play indoor baseball out-of-doors. 
Thirty-five per cent of elementary school girls 
play on the streets, two per cent in the parks, 
and 63 per cent in vacant lots. None reported 
playing on school premises. 
54
-P-A-G-E-63
The high school girls are more fortunate. 
Ninety-one per cent play on school premises, 
seven per cent play in vacant lots, two per cent 
in the parks, and none in the streets. 
This does not seem quite fair to elementary 
school girls. Physically and socially there could 
hardly be a better game for girls from 10 to 
12 years of age than modified baseball, and 
if begun at that age, it continues as desirable 
when they are older. It is rather generally 
considered that girls are inferior to boys in 
team spirit and the ethics of sportsmanship. 
But when girls have adequate opportunity, 
they prove as susceptible to the moral and 
social influence of group games as do boys. 
The importance of group games for elementary 
school girls can scarcely be overemphasized. 
The elementary schools of Cleveland contribute 
little in this particular to the play life of their 
girl pupils, although the high schools contribute 
much to the group games of girls. One would 
think the school yards, at least, might be avail- 
able always for the play of elementary school 
girls. About 11 per cent of the elementary 
school girls who play, and 24 per cent of the 
high school girls who play, belong to ‘‘regular 
teams.”

BASKET-BALL 
The disparity of opportunity for elementary 
school girls and high school girls is more evident 
when we come to consider the game of basket- 
ball. While decidedly inferior in many re- 
spects to baseball, basket-ball has an undeniable 
place in our educational system. Nine per cent 
of the elementary school girls over 10 years of 
age play basket-ball, while 40 per cent of the 
high school girls play. Over 99 per cent of the 
high school girls who reported place of practise 
do their practising on school premises, while 
very few of the elementary school girls practise 
there.

boys, one plays in the school yard, while three 
play in the park and 18 play in the street 
and vacant lot. Two high school boys practise 
on school property, three in the park, and four 
in vacant lots and on the street. 
WHEN THE SCHOOL SHOULD CATCH THE Boy 
On the whole, it may be said that the influence 
of the school is deplorably slight in the matter 
of the hardy group games for elementary school 
boys, and it should be emphatically stated over 
and over again that it is in the elementary school 
period that the school can catch the great 
majority of boys. The street does not wait for 
the high school age—it gets them far younger. 
The gang does not wait—it is right on hand 
at the ages of eight or 10, and grips very 
hard before the high school age. Nature does 
not wait—emotion, impulses, capacities, oppor- 
tunities, all come in overwhelming array long 
before the high school doors open for the rela- 
tively few who enter. Why should the school 
despise despatch, ignore opportunity, and neg- 
lect so completely in this matter the boys and 
girls who pass so young beyond its influence to 
the burdens of a wage-earning life?

  If public school teachers were to take an 
interest in the out-of-school play and recrea- 
tion of their pupils, somewhat as they now do 
with respect to their reading, the “diaries” 
might tell a different story. Most girls would be 
greatly benefited by tennis. A teacher might 
be as instrumental in getting a girl pupil inter- 
ested in tennis as in getting her interested in 
Scott. The school might arouse unprecedented 
interest among pupils as to the use of park 
facilities for tennis, to mention one activity only.

  Tue SoctaL VALUE OF RECREATION 
The lack of opportunities for genuine social 
expression and practice of democracy under 
conventional school methods of recreation has 
been previously suggested. Besides the active 
physical games which have been mentioned 
(which are also eminently social) we should 
consider here specifically societies, clubs, and 
other social activities of pupils to which the 
school may lend itself. 
Earty APPEARANCE OF THE GANG INSTINCT 
Many do not realize how early in life children 
tend to join the gang. Sheldon’s study of the 
institutional activities of American children 
showed that the most common age of members 
of the predatory gang was from 10 to 14 years, 
culminating at about 11 or 12. Inherently the 
gang is all right, but the misled gang is all 
wrong. In ‘‘Boyhood and Lawlessness”’ the 
author, after speaking of the feuds among the 
West Side boys of New York, says: ‘‘Gang 
fighting, in fact, as practised in this neighbor- 
hood, is conducive to neither manliness, honor, 
courage, nor self-respect. The strength of the 
boy is the strength of the gang, and under its 
protection unspeakable horrors take place for 
which it is impossible to place responsibility. 
5 65
-P-A-G-E-76
  Rumors of boys being stabbed, shot, clubbed, 
maimed, and killed are current everywhere, 
and there is good reason to believe that many 
of them are true. Such things are, of course, 
never mentioned to strangers, and residents 
learn of them only by chance conversation. 
The moment that any definite questions are 
asked, the boys become reticent and change the 
subject. But there can be no doubt that many 
crimes are committed in these blocks which 
never reach the ears of the police, and that a 
considerable proportion of them are due to the 
boy and his gang.

‘And so the word ‘gang’ here has grown to 
be synonymous with the worst side of boy life, 
and the group itself, which might in other sur- 
roundings and under other traditions be a posi- 
tive civic asset, simply adds the irresponsibility 
66
-P-A-G-E-77
of the mob to the recklessness of youth and be- 
comes a force which turns West Side boyhood 
into cowards and savages. As a priest of one 
of the Roman Catholic churches said the other 
day, ‘The social evil may be an important one, 
but the question in this neighborhood is that 
of the gangs.’”

How the undesirable gang experience may 
be headed off by organized clubs and athletic 
games has already been suggested. The social 
activities of clubs, etc., also absorb and divert 
to right channels the same gang interest. Some 
agency or agencies must see that all children 
67

  of ten years and over have opportunity for the 
right exercise of their budding social interests.

Tue Nature INTERESTS 
Children are deeply interested in nature and, 
where opportunity offers, their play interests 
lead them naturally into those realms of knowl- 
edge and activity which are directly related to 
some of the most important fields of human 
interest, endeavor, and achievement today. 
But in modern city life children do not have 
this ready contact with nature under whose in- 
68
-P-A-G-E-79

-P-A-G-E-80
  Animal pets in the Union School summer playground
-P-A-G-E-81
  
fluence the race developed. Unless the com- 
munity, through the school or some other 
agency, exerts itself directly to relieve this 
handicap of city children, the majority must 
forever remain incomplete in development and 
education. Among these nature interests (al- 
though interests rarely, if ever, act alone) we 
may include the nurturing of plants and ani- 
mals, hunting, fishing, love of life in the open, 
camping, and the like. 
Cleveland children, to an unusual extent, 
have gardens. This is due partly to local con- 
ditions, and partly to the school-garden work. 
Seventy-two per cent of boys over eight years 
of age in a large elementary school have gardens, 
and 83 per cent of the girls over eight years of 
age. Sixty-seven per cent of the boys and 65 
per cent of the girls keep animals or pets. 
Among high school boys and girls the nur- 
turing interests of this character seem somewhat 
less strong than among elementary school pupils. 
Fifty-one per cent of the boys have gardens, 
61 per cent of the girls. Thirty-two per cent 
of the boys keep animals or pets, 41 per cent of 
the girls. 
SoctaL VALUE oF NuRTURE INSTINCT 
It would be next to impossible to overempha- 
size the importance of the nurturing instincts 
69
-P-A-G-E-82
  in education. Sympathy doubtless developed 
in man all the more surely and quickly through 
care of animals. The ownership and nurture of 
animals, and especially the planting of fields 
and cultivation of plants, had much to do with 
the development of regard for property rights. 
What a child works over, cares for, and watches 
grow quickens far more than mere possession 
ever can a sense of his own property rights with 
relation to the corresponding rights of others. 
EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF OuTDOOR LIFE 
Fondness for outdoor life, as in hiking, camping, 
hunting, fishing, and marksmanship, is allied 
to interest in skill and prowess in sport and to 
interest in nature. The physical activities and 
the emotional accompaniments of these forms 
of recreation have been beyond all price in the 
development of our national stock. The ratios 
indicated below will suggest to what extent such 
experiences are disappearing from the child- 
hood and youth of the city. Yet “‘the greatest 
scientists, philosophers, artists, and poets of the 
world of all ages have been ready to bear testi- 
mony to the debt they have owed to outdoor 
life.” ‘‘No man is liberally educated who does 
not know as much about nature as he does about 
books.” ‘The school of the woods and hills, 
70
-P-A-G-E-83
  
fields and streams, is that from which our great- 
est thinkers have been graduated.” 
And it may be asserted that some basis of 
common experience is necessary on the part of 
the ordinary run of people for them to appre- 
ciate scientists, philosophers, artists, and poets. 
As Brand Whitlock used to say, it was his ex- 
perience that you couldn’t tell a man anything 
unless he knew it already. A basis of appre- 
ciation and a demand for it on the part of the 
people is an important element in the world’s 
progress and achievement, and the unusual 
man’s contribution to it.

  Schools could easily do much in the matter of 
hiking, and in some places have done much. 
Camping might readily be suggested and as- 
sisted by the school. Hunting in various forms, 
as well as fishing, could be greatly stimulated 
with little more than an intelligent interest in 
these activities shown by the school. 
It is not alone the joy of camping that makes 
it valuable, nor the physical benefits; it is the 
mental, moral, and social influence as well. It 
is doubtful if a child ever grew to complete 
manhood or womanhood who had never come 
in touch with nature in some way comparable 
to that of camping.

Tue Dramatic INTERESTS 
Among the most familiar of the plays of little 
children are the dramatic and imitative plays, 
by which children in make-believe enter into 
almost every occupation and profession of men. 
The dramatic interest is practically universal 
and persists in adult life, and some of our more 
important social and civic problems are related 
to the drama. This dramatic instinct of 
children has in late years been very widely 
used in schools as an aid in teaching reading 
through story acting, lending great charm to the 
reading lessons of young children, and also in 
teaching history and literature. In social 
work the value of dramatic play for children 
and adolescents has been widely recognized 
and utilized. But all this has been hardly a 
drop in the bucket to what the schools might 
accomplish, and local and civic problems, as 
well as educational problems, are pressing home 
to the schools this question of the dramatic 
interests in education. 
Of the more formal use of dramatic play it 
is of interest to note that 30 per cent of the 
boys of the elementary school have taken 
part in shows or plays, and 46 per cent of the 
girls. Among high school pupils the per- 
centages are 46 per cent for boys and 58 per 
cent for girls. 
75
-P-A-G-E-88
  CLEVELAND CHILDREN AT THE MoviEs 
But by far the most striking evidence of the 
dramatic interest is seen in the attendance 
record of pupils at the moving pictures. Sev- 
enty-eight per cent of the boys of the elementary 
school are accustomed to attend the movies, 
and 84 per cent of the girls. These children 
attend, on the average, three times in every 
two weeks. This is more frequent than the 
attendance that has been estimated for the 
general population of New York City—once 
a week; orfor Cleveland—once in every six days. 
Twenty-four per cent of the boys attend the 
vaudeville as well, and 30 per cent of the girls. 
The average number of times the boys and girls 
attend the vaudeville is a little less than once 
a week. Besides, 18 per cent of the boys at- 
tend the regular theater over twice a month, 
and 21 per cent of the girls over once a month. 
Eighty-nine per cent of high school boys are 
accustomed to attend moving pictures, and 
91 per cent of high school girls. The boys go, 
on the average, three times in two weeks, and 
the girls a little oftener than once a week. 
Sixty-seven per cent of the boys attend the 
vaudeville, and 59 per cent of the girls. The 
average attendance of boys and girls is once in 
two weeks. Forty-eight per cent of the boys 
attend the regular theater, and 63 per cent of 
76

the girls. These boys attend nearly twice a 
month, and the girls over once a month.

Tue MIsuUsE OF THE EMOTIONS 
One of the most important things in all ele- 
mentary education is the proper use of the 
emotions, and except possibly in the kinder- 
garten, this is most neglected. It is a serious 
thing that the emotional life of children has 
come to be so largely a matter of the street 
and the moving picture. Everybody knows to 
what great extent the movies appeal to the ele- 
mental emotions of ‘‘blood and sex.”’ Promiscu- 
ous and excessive attendance at the movies and 
the vaudeville without educational guidance 
77 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
    
is a grave menace to the normal, healthy, emo- 
tional life of young people. Competitive games 
and dramatic play are the great correctors of 
wrong influence of the street and the drama. 
At present the Cleveland schools make com- 
paratively little use of the dramatic interests. 
Somehow the social and educational forces of 
the city must control and utilize these interests, 
which are of the greatest educational and social 
significance. 
Tue Constructive INTERESTS 
Constructive or creative play is one of the 
earliest and most universal of the plays of young 
children. Sand, and pies, and blocks are the 
universal passion of little children who have 
access to them. The earlier schools neglected 
the manual arts in favor of writing and cipher- 
ing. More recently manual training has been 
quite generally adopted somewhere in the 
curriculum. Whenever the manual arts have 
been introduced into the school with regard 
to the constructive interests of the children, 
they have been truly recreational as well as 
educational. But often the type of manual 
training and the methods of teaching have been 
determined with too little reference to the 
constructive and allied interests of the pupil.

The work has come too late, or has been too 
formal. Children crudely imitate in their con- 
structive play many adult occupations. Given 
encouragement and opportunity, children zeal- 
ously undertake much constructive work that 
is of genuine educational value. But this con- 
structive work must be of a kind that will appeal 
to the emotions of children. When there is a 
rich emotional background to the occupations, 
however arduous they may be, they are play 
to the child; but without that emotional back- 
ground they are laborious work. Dolls, doll 
houses, toy furniture, kites, boats, toys, pet 
cages, etc., provide the very richest educational 
material for heart and hand and head. The 
illustrations facing pages 78 and 80 illustrate 
educational constructive play conducted in the 
Cleveland summer schools. 
Tue Music INTERESTS 
Twenty-one per cent of elementary school boys 
over eight years of age and 35 per cent of the 
girls play some kind of a musical instrument. 
Only one per cent of the children belong to an 
orchestra or band. Forty-three per cent of the 
boys are fond of singing and 68 per cent of the 
girls. Few of these, however, belong to a sing- 
ing club or musical society. 
79 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
Twenty-eight per cent of high school boys 
confessed to singing and 44 per cent of the girls. 
Of the boys and girls who sing, 20 per cent be- 
long to a singing or musical society. Thirty- 
nine per cent of the boys and 69 per cent of 
the girls play some musical instrument. 
Presumably the schools have considerable 
influence in the matter of singing. At least 
singing is taught in the schools, but the in- 
fluence of the school in creating a love of sing- 
ing may be open to some doubt, when scarcely 
over one high school boy in four sings out of 
school, and less than one-half of the girls. 
It is unfortunate, also, that so few of those 
who play musical instruments are organized 
into bands or orchestras. Of over 500 boys and 
girls in two high schools who play, only eight 
per cent of the boys and four per cent of the 
girls belong to either a band or an orchestra. 
We hear much of the value of co-operative 
play in so-called team games. In an orchestra 
there must be the completest co-operation and 
subordination of self to the whole. The or- 
chestra is one of the easiest types of social activi- 
ties to start and maintain in a school. The 
opening of the school buildings on the west side 
of New York City for the purpose of organizing 
musical bands has done more than all other 
agencies to break up the gangs in that locality,

according to Captain Ormsby, of the police force. 
“In music all races speak a common language,” 
and through it neighborhoods, in which teach- 
ers said it was impossible to do any social work 
because the people were so divided on racial 
lines, have become united. 
EpucaTIONAL INFLUENCES OUTSIDE THE 
ScHOooL 
While the public schools of Cleveland conserve 
and direct some of these interests, they do so 
only in a very limited way, and with inadequate 
method, except in the few instances which have 
been noted. This is not a criticism of the 
Cleveland schools. It is rather a commentary 
on the very general failure of public school sys- 
tems the country over to appreciate the sig- 
nificance of play and recreation, and to con- 
ceive popular education in social, as well as in 
disciplinary aspects, in terms of living as well 
as of preparation for living. The school has 
been self-sufficient, and has ignored or despised 
the external educational factors which, socially 
at least, have been mightier than the school 
itself. It is conceivably the office of the school 
to harmonize, so far as possible, all the in- 
fluences of daily life upon the child. If this 
8 81
-P-A-G-E-98
  necessitates modification of school buildings, 
extension of the school day, the reorganization 
of the curriculum, the problem should be met 
squarely and courageously. 
For a full quarter of a century Cleveland has 
observed in her midst an example of a greatly 
prolonged school day in a private school at- 
tended by many of her boys of the best home 
influences and surroundings. If an eight-hour 
school day has, through so many years, proved 
its success and its desirability for the boys from 
the better homes, it suggests a way of increased 
influence upon public school pupils. The schook 
must somehow stretch itself to reach the boy 
and girl in all those activities in which, to 
them, seem to come the realities of life. 
PLAY AND RECREATION DISTINGUISHED 
Play is nature’s method of effecting growth and 
development. It is, therefore, in a sense as 
essential as food, and may not be regarded 
simply as a means of restoring physical equilib- 
rium after energy has been depleted in some line 
of activity. Play may properly precede rest, 
may tire the child out, and indeed even exhaust 
utterly. The idea contained in recreation is 
rather that of relief from exertion in some other 
82
-P-A-G-E-99
line of activity or work. Play is not always 
recreation in the physiological sense. When 
little children begin to play immediately upon 
waking in the morning, they do so not through 
any need or desire for recreation. Nor do glass 
factory boys, at the end of a long hard day’s 
work—on their feet all the time—rush from 
the factory into a playground to play basket- 
ball because they are impelled by the need of 
physical recuperation. They use the muscles 
that are already tired. They are impelled 
rather by the desire for the full expression of 
their inherent interests and powers. Children 
maintain physical, mental, and social health 
through play; they grow and develop physic- 
ally, mentally, and socially through play. But 
adults, having reached maturity, recreate in the 
physiological sense rather than play in the 
strictly biological sense described above. 
Now the reason for this discussion of the dis- 
tinction between play and recreation lies mainly 
in the fact that all too generally the play of 
children and youth is regarded by the public in 
the way that adults regard their recreation, as 
a pleasant means of restoring physical equilib- 
rium. It cannot be too strongly emphasized 
that the value of play is vastly more than 
that.

Puay as A Matuop 1n Epucation 
The most conspicuous use of play in education 
in the Cleveland schools is, of course, in the 
kindergarten. Here play is not utilized for 
physical relief as in a recess. It is utilized as a 
means to mental and spiritual progress. This 
is not the place to discuss at length the work of 
the Cleveland kindergartens,* but it may be 
urged both upon the kindergartner and upon 
the public that if there is any reason to be found 
in biology, psychology, or other science, for the 
use of play as a method of education. in the 
kindergarten, the same reason holds for the use 
of play in education throughout the whole 
period of child growth and development to 
maturity. This suggests to the kindergartner 
that if play is a desirable means of education, 
the play utilized should conform to the bio- 
logical, psychological, and sociological facts 
that explain its nature and suggest its value, 
and not to any a priori conception not in har- 
mony with those facts. To the public it sug- 
gests that to support an educational method at 
one period of a child’s development and to 
ignore it at the next is most inconsistent and 
irrational. 
There is, however, this excuse, that the kin- 
*See “Measuring the Work of the Public Schools,” by 
Charles H. Judd. 
84
-P-A-G-E-101
  dergarten has evolved, or attempted to evolve, 
a complete system whereby play may be used 
as a means of education within the field of sub- 
ject matter, whereas the rest of the school has 
not. But Froebel himself conceived of play as 
the true means of education for children of ages 
beyond the kindergarten, although he did not 
live to work out his scheme in detail beyond 
that period. In his book, “‘The Education of 
Man,” Froebel is speaking of children of ele- 
mentary school age, even more than of children 
of the kindergarten age. This uncertainty as 
to just what ought to be done in the grades 
beyond the kindergarten is the great impedi- 
ment to the progress of play in education. 
The kindergartner does not know how to relate 
the play of the children of the grades to the 
subject matter, nor do the grade teachers, nor 
does anyone. Yet enough is known, so that 
vastly more than is done might be done. 
Let us consider for a moment the fact that 
the subject matter of the schools is the accumu- 
lation of the social inheritance of the race. 
It has been handed down by tradition, custom, 
records. Inherently it has no more to do with 
the young child of today than with the savage 
infant of ages ago. But the child of today 
comes into the world with an organic heredity, 
vitally related to the subject matter of the 
85 
   
-P-A-G-E-102
  schools in that the subject matter is the record 
of the interests, activities, and achievements 
of the race. Kindred interests, kindred ac- 
tivities, kindred achievements are the inherent 
predispositions of the child. Under any due 
regard for the inherent predispositions of chil- 
dren, subject matter may and does become the 
natural and desirable goal of children’s inter- 
ests, activities and achievements. But the 
efficient method is and must, in the nature of 
the case, always be from interests, activities, 
achievements to subject matter, and not the 
reverse. 
Piay anD Work 
These considerations naturally lead one to 
recall the old-time prejudice (of which not all 
of us are even yet disabused) against play when 
it is considered with relation to the accom- 
plishment of the important and serious things 
of life. The same answer is to be made here as 
in the case of play and subject matter. Play, 
by which is meant the organic predisposition 
towards characteristic human activity, pre- 
ceded work in the race as activities preceded 
subject matter. Man followed in primitive 
ways every line of human activity found in the 
world today under the impulsion of instinctive 
interests long before he ever pursued them as a 
86
-P-A-G-E-103
  conscious work. And because he pursued 
these activities from instinctive interests, his 
activities, in contrast with many work ac- 
tivities today, had a keen, emotional back- 
ground. One easily recognizes the emotional 
element in all such occupations as hunting, 
fishing, fighting, gathering nuts and food, 
searching for herbs, making one’s own hut or 
weapon or decorating the same, weaving wam- 
pum belts, building fires, and the like. 
This emotional accompaniment may and 
does continue with many men of various occu- 
pations and professions today in what is com- 
monly spoken of as ‘‘interest in one’s work.” 
Thus Edison is reported to have said that he 
had never done a day’s work in his life. What 
he meant is perfectly obvious. The presence 
of this emotional element, sometimes called 
“playing the game,’’ does not mean less and 
poorer but more and better work. The prob- 
lem of play versus work in education is to find 
the basis for emotional background in the 
activities. If this can be done, education will 
be more effective, not less, and more rather 
than fewer channels of efficient effort will be 
opened to the pupil. As was said before, sub- 
ject matter in every field of knowledge is the 
natural and logical goal of the child’s instincts, 
interests, and initiative. This does not mean 
87
-P-A-G-E-104
  that laborious effort and drudgery will dis- 
appear. Play is preéminently the field of 
drudgery. In all college life there is nothing 
to match the toilsome drudgery of the foot-ball 
field. The difference between the drudgery 
of work and the drudgery of play lies in the 
background of the emotions, which in play 
makes drudgery a part of the game. Infinite 
pains are taken by the naturalist in his collec- 
tions, notes, observations, comparisons; by the 
scholar in his research; the inventor in his shop; 
the writer in his study; the artist in his studio; 
the foot-ball player in the field; and the child in 
kite-making, sand-play, blocks, and dolls. 
SUMMARY 
1. Cleveland is extraordinarily well equipped 
in plants and in teaching force for the conduct 
and administration of recreation in the public 
schools. Many of these advantages, however, 
are neglected. 
The recesses should not be omitted, and they 
should be organized. This does not imply for- 
mality at recess. It does imply study and or- 
ganization so that the recess may count for the 
most possible, physically and socially. More 
“steam’’ is blown off in a skilfully organized 
than in an unorganized recess, and the social 
value is certainly far greater. 
88
-P-A-G-E-105
Better still, groups might take their recesses 
in rotation: outdoors in pleasant weather, in the 
gymnasium or playroom in unpleasant weather. 
This would increase the value of the recess and 
might be made the means of relieving conges- 
tion. To some extent this has already been 
done. 
2. Schoolroom and indoor recreation should, 
so far as possible, become outdoor recreation. 
The play periods should be longer. The plays 
and games should reflect the deep, instinctive 
interests of children of the ages concerned. 
They should perpetuate the play traditions of 
the nation. The plays and games employed 
should not be devised at the desk—manufactured 
out of whole cloth; they should be the growth 
of generations. 
3. There should be a relatively larger element 
of free play in the kindergarten and lower grades. 
The waste places, between wings of buildings 
and elsewhere, small and at present for the most 
part useless, should be thoughtfully equipped 
for the little tots of the school. With a slight 
expenditure these desert places can be made to 
blossom as the rose educationally and socially, 
to the relief of congestion, to the aid of teachers, 
and to the immeasurable benefit of the children. 
4, The apparatus should be taken from stor- 
age and the school playgrounds made inviting 
89
-P-A-G-E-106
  
to pupils out of school hours. This will neces- 
sitate additional supervision, which should be 
provided. 
5. The swimming pools that have been begun 
should be completed and both swimming pools 
and gymnasiums should be justified by the use 
made of them. 
6. Far more attention should be paid in the 
elementary grades to hardy, organized games. 
There both numbers and needs (even the adoles- 
cent needs) predominate, as compared to the 
high school. InCleveland, schools can do larger 
service with plays and games in the grades than 
in the high schools. It would be better to turn 
the whole corps of physical training teachers 
into the elementary grades and neglect the high 
schools than to practise economy so unequally at 
the expense of the grades as at present. The 
whole system of play and recreation for the 
grades should be revised with reference to edu- 
cational and social aspects. 
7. The general question of the wider use of 
school plants for play and recreation is compli- 
cated by local conditions. But in general it may 
be said that the schools contribute relatively 
little to the social activities of the several neigh- 
borhoods. This subject is considered more ex- 
haustively in the section of the Survey report 
entitled, ‘Educational Extension.” 
90
-P-A-G-E-107
  8. Some reorganization of the educational 
corps should take place with a view to efficient 
administration of play and recreation from a 
broad educational and social standpoint. This 
would lead to a far greater influence of the 
school upon the out-of-school life of the com- 
munity. Through lack of greater influence of 
the school during out-of-school hours, there is a 
great social leakage for which the city must 
pay. 
9. The school is the natural and _ logical 
agency for the safeguarding of the great funda- 
mental interests of children and youth. Each 
year discloses more and more clearly that the 
school is the one institution we have yet con- 
ceived that is best fitted adequately to conserve 
these interests and utilize them for educational 
and social progress. Opportunities that came 
as a matter of course to children a generation 
ago do not come to many children now unless 
they are specifically planned for by some agency 
other than the home. Met wisely by the com- 
munity, this seeming handicap may, in the end, 
result in a great and new-found social strength. 
10. Play is more than recreation. If its edu- 
cational significance is real in the kindergarten 
period, it is real in every subsequent stage of 
growth and development. Rightly conceived, 
play is a most efficient method of education for 
91
-P-A-G-E-108
  life, for work, for social service. The fact that 
we do not yet know how to make full use of play 
in education need not and should not prevent 
the utilization of play, to the full extent to 
which we are prepared, for the tremendous 
social service it can render. 
11. In the Cleveland school system, as in that 
of every large progressive city, there should be— 
a. An officer whose entire time should be de- 
voted to giving a social interpretation to edu- 
cational work, and an educational interpretation 
to social work. He should know the general 
fields of sociology and education, and should 
know intimately the fields of play and recreation. 
He should be to the social functions of the school 
what the Director is to the business manage- 
ment and what the Superintendent of Instruc- 
tion is to the academic work. He should organ- 
ize and utilize the physical properties of the 
school and, so far as practicable, the existing 
educational corps for the directing of the play 
and recreational interests of the pupils and the 
community towards constructive education and 
social progress. 
b. An officer whose function it is to organize 
and direct especially the active plays, games, 
sports, pastimes, and athletics of the system. 
He should have a general knowledge of the 
social and educational aspects of play and recre- 
92
-P-A-G-E-109
  
    ation and a technical knowledge of physical 
training. Cleveland has at present a super- 
visor of physical training having but limited 
authority in the elementary schools and almost 
none in the high schools. 
c. An officer whose function it is to supervise 
the play of young children to eight or nine years 
of age. She should havea thorough training in the 
fundamental principles of the kindergarten plus 
the general social and educational background 
of a thorough knowledge of play and recreation. 
She should be a part of the Division of Physical 
Education and not independent of it as she now 
is in Cleveland. 
d. Besides the officers mentioned above, 
there should be one who is trained to organize 
and direct the almost universal, but greatly 
wasted or misused, dramatic interests; one who 
can utilize similarly the musical interests for 
educational and social progress; one the nature 
and nurturing interests; one the constructive; 
one the esthetic. 
These great lines of human interest and en- 
deavor are replete with recreational as well as 
educational opportunity; they have their place 
as avocations quite as truly as vocations. The 
various official functions mentioned might, of 
course, be delegated to existing officers, and 
sometimes several might be combined in one 
93
-P-A-G-E-110
  person. But educational and recreational prob- 
lems must be seen from each of these angles by 
some one who feels the burden of responsibility. 
Education needs play, and play needs educa- 
tion. The problem of adult recreation is but a 
phase of the problem of the play of children and 
youth.

  PREFACE. 
++ 
Ir is the design of this manual—which is intended mainly 
for the use of the professional dressmaker and apprentice, 
the private student or amateur, and those training as teachers 
—to present, in plain and simple language, the broad ele- 
mentary principles upon which the art of modern dress- 
making is based, and to show how those principles may 
be best applied in practice. 
The writer has devoted herself for many years to the 
study of the subject, and her long and special experience as 
the teacher of large and varied classes, and in the success- 
ful training of many teachers now engaged under the various 
County Councils, has ensured her a sound knowledge of its 
principles and a thorough grasp of their application to 
practical work. The manual, therefore, embodies in brief 
form the methods of working in general use, and which 
have been found by the writer to give the best results, 
whether the aim of the student has been professional, or to 
add to her personal accomplishments and domestic skill; 
and it will, she hopes, be found equally useful to all who are 
engaged in the study and practice of the subject, no matter 
under what system they have gained their knowledge. 
It is the special aim of the writer, in the chapters devoted 
to “ Bodice Making” and “The Gored Skirt,” to set forth

simply, yet intelligibly, those principles which underlie all 
changes of fashion, and to make clear the meaning and 
reasons of the many changes of method in making-up em- 
ployed in turn by the modern dressmaker, and the suitability 
of each method to the special nature of the material selected 
or to some particular feature of the styles in vogue. 
In preparing the manual, the requirements of the 
examinations in dressmaking of the City and Guilds of 
London Institute have been steadily kept in view; and 
candidates will, it is believed, find that the particulars 
detailed in the following pages are set forth with a degree 
of exactness likely to prove helpful to them in their 
preparation. , 
The writer will welcome any communications having for 
their object the improvement of the book.

Tue modern bodice exacts from its maker such skill in 
cutting and careful and exact manipulation in making up as 
probably was never before required for any style of garment 
worn by woman. It must enhance every beautiful line and 
graceful curve of the figure by well-placed seams, must be 
close-fitting at all parts, without being tight enough anywhere 
to interfere with entire freedom of movement in every direc- 
tion ; it must cling to the figure like a well-cut glove, not

only fitting it perfectly when in repose, but following every 
movement almost as the skin does; yet there must not be 
any appearance of undué closeness or strain to offend the 
eye, nor must there be any restraint upon the free action of 
the organs of respiration. 
Modern women have advanced so far beyond their 
mothers as to know that the best effects as regards appear- 
ance are obtained by judicious arrangements of lines and 
curves rather than by “pinching”; and the tightly-laced 
waist is becoming less and less fashionable. It is a question 
whether the dressmaker as a dressmaker feels this altogether 
an improvement, as the waist still has to sit clear and close 
and without a wrinkle: there are styles (and stuffs) when all 
her skill and thought are needed to ensure this. 
The standard modern bodice fastens down the centre of 
the front and extends some inches below the waist. It is 
usually finished as a peak or point at the front (the point 
varying from three to five inches long below the waist), rising 
from it in a graceful curve over the hips. Some styles run 
down to a point at the centre of the back also, whilst others 
have the lower part of the back cut into various fancy 
shapes, each of which has its time of favour in popular 
fancy and then dies away and is seen no more. 
The modern bodice has a great many seams, all so placed 
that they break the width of the body to the eye, at the same 
time adding to its apparent length, and on the skilful placing and manipulating of these seams much of the grace of the fitting depends, it being quite possible to clothe the body in 
a garment that fits closely and yet makes it look thick and ill-proportioned, whilst a more skilfully cut bodice otf thicker material is easier in wear and yet adds to the grace of the wearer’s figure instead of detracting from it 
(see page 49). 
The modern bodice is usually cut by a pattern which embodies in itself all the points of ease, nb ‘ace, and pre- vailing style that go to make up good fitti eth ‘ ing—the old way
-P-A-G-E-16
Bovice Maxine. 3 
of obtaining this was by moulding on the body, or purchas- 
ing a prepared pattern from pattern modellers. 
A large proportion of the modern cutting and fitting 
is done by measure, the cutter measuring the customer and 
drafting (or drawing out) the pattern by using the measures 
according to a certain set of rules called a “ system,” em- 
ploying various appliances to assist in its production— 
sometimes a tailor’s square, sometimes a chart, sometimes 
sectional paper. 
The numerous methods of fitting in use require a separ- 
ate volume for their elucidation ; but by whatever method 
the pattern is produced, whether it is moulded, drafted, or 
simply cut out by eye, it is, when completed, simply a 
bodice pattern, with the usual backs, fronts, etc., and the 
same rules for making-up apply, with very few exceptions — 
to be afterwards noted—to all patterns. * 
In the frontispiece is shown the shape of each piece of 
the straight-cut bodice pattern as usually cut, and the names 
given to the parts. Certain lines are common to all systems, 
and certain marks in addition to the outlines are necessary 
to join, the whole together satisfactorily. These marks are:— 
The waist-line on all pieces; some mark to indicate that side 
of straight side-piece which is to be afterwards joined to the 
front (two small lines are shown on Plate); some guide for 
the position of the wadding in the front, shown by dotted 
lines; a mark on the arm-hole curve to show where the 
inside seam of the sleeve should be placed; the pleat or 
dart to shorten-up the centre of front edge; some guides 
to regulate the position of the sleeve-head fulness, the elbows 
and joining-points of both upper and under sleeve, and such 
style lines on the pattern itself as will be needed to show 
where the trimmings are to be placed—as yoke lines, vest- 
lines, etc. 
* Cutting and fitting by measure is one of the requirements of the City 
and Guilds of London examination syllabus.

4 Tue Evements or Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
A word about derfect systems of cutting, which will do 
away with any necessity for trying-on, may not be out of 
place: every worker hopes to find one, and tries system 
after system in the vain endeavour to do so. If such systems 
were possible, tailors would have discovered them before this; 
the costliness of the material they work upon, and the diffi- 
culty of making alterations upon firm cloth, as compared with 
soft dress materials, would ensure their straining every nerve 
to secure knowledge so very desirable and essential; and the 
really marvellous -fitting without trying-on which is done by 
many dressmakers as well as tailors would seem to declare 
that the knowledge as been secured; but those same tailors 
and dressmakers know that the risk of alteration being re- 
quired has always to be faced, in spite of careful measuring, 
of keeping a pattern bodice at hand to compare with, and of 
the most minute care being taken with every step of the work 
from first to last. It is well for less experienced workers to 
be very careful and painstaking, and not to expect too much 
from the cutting only. Perfect cutting must be followed by 
perfect making-up if everything is to be perfect throughout, 
and such perfection cannot be ensured as a matter of course 
to every worker, whether she is clever and experienced or 
altogether otherwise, simply by the cutting-out. 
The pattern gives one-half of the bodice, from the centre 
of the back to the centre of the front, and, however pro- duced, consists of a certain number of pieces—namely, the back, the curved side-piece, the straight or under-arm side- 
Piece, the front, the upper sleeve, the under sleeve, and the neckband or collar, 
The paper pattern may be prepared with or without turnings. If the latter, it should either be drafted to slightly closer width measures or the fitting-lines cut entirely away, as the width of the wheel in tracing outside a pattern makes a difference, very slight on each seam, but amounting to a very distinct enlargement of size when the bodice is put together, This does not apply to the darts; they should
-P-A-G-E-18
Bovice Maxine. 5 
not be cut out in any case unless the lining is one that 
cannot be traced by wheel or stiletto. 
Two pieces of stuff and lining are cut for each one of 
the pieces of the bodice pattern, and as these must be cut 
from the material in such a way that the right sides of all 
shall be outside and yet each piece shall be in its proper 
place, various rules for placing them on the stuff and 
lining before cutting out have been formulated, to assist in 
giving certainty to the inexperienced and timid, and to econo- 
mise time and material in the work. 
The selection of linings is treated of under “Linings ” 
(page 82), and the mdnner of estimating the quantity re- 
quired under the head “Quantity, Cost, and Price” 
(page 178). Presuming that the selection has been satisfactorily 
made, the work proceeds without interruption. 
Lining is always sold doubled, and on this the pieces of 
the pattern should be placed with all the waist-lines, except 
that of the front, straight across with the weft thread ; 
that of the front should be allowed to take its natural run, 
each part of the sleeve should be placed with the middle, 
from top to elbow, straight down the selvedge way of the 
lining, to throw the wrist ends on the cross (this makes a 
closer fit to the lower part of the arm). Each piece should 
be pinned down before cutting out, care being taken not to 
put the pins across the fitting lines, or in the wheeling out 
they may turn the teeth of the wheel. 
The front itself should be laid about two inches back 
from the selvedge of the lining, and, in cutting out, the 
turnings outside the front should not be shaped, but left 
with the selvedge. The back centre seam turnings should 
also be left unshaped. With these exceptions each piece 
should be cut out with a fair inch of turnings outside each 
outline, Thus placed, all the seam-lines are on the bias 
of the stuff, and yield easily to the stretching down 
process.
-P-A-G-E-19
6 THe Evements or Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
The material should next be cut out. This, like the 
lining, should always be doubled where it is possible to cut 
it so, as the pieces can then be cut in pairs, and thus 
the risk of cutting two pieces of material for the same side 
of the bodice is avoided. If the material is double-width, 
_ ‘it is already folded face to face or back to back ; but if it is 
single-width, the pattern should be planned out on the wrong 
side, the piece cut off, and moved down the length, which 
should be turned over first, to bring it as if folded face to 
face, and the pieces cut double. 
It is not advisable to begin dressmaking on a striped or 
plaid material, and velvet is difficult to manage in several 
respects ; the details will therefore be given as for a plain 
self-coloured serge or cloth, where there is no pattern or pile 
to complicate matters, though there is often a slight “ply” or 
nap on cloth, which must be remembered in the planning out. 
The pieces of lining, with the pattern still pinned to them, 
should be planned out on the stuff by the same rules as they 
were placed on the linmg, and the material cut out round 
the lining. In placing a pattern on lining or material, the 
lengthway of each piece must be placed the same way as 
the selvedge ; in other words, the length of the piece must 
not be laid across the lining or stuff. On the material it is 
advisable, even with reversible stuffs, not to reverse the 
jength of any piece, but to keep all one way, or one part of 
the dress may sheen differently from the others when it 
comes into wear. 
Stripes, plaids, and fancy designs all need careful match- 
ing, varying with the design; velvets and plushes should be 
cut with the pile to smooth upwards. Diagonals and coarse 
twills look better if all the pieces are cut to face the same 
way, and both cloth and satin have a slight nap or ply which 
should smooth downwards. ~ 
Piercing the fitting lines of the pattern through the 
doubled lining only—the stuff being put quite aside—comes 
next in order of working. This is now almost entirely done
-P-A-G-E-20
Bovice Maxine. 9 
by tracing-wheel, which is far more expeditions than the 
old plan of pricking holes half an inch apart with stiletto 
or scissors-point. Respecting the management of the wheel, 
a few words of caution are necessary. Piercing should be 
done slowly, going along with an occasional “backward 
and forward” movement of the hand, that the perforations 
may be clear and distinct below. In wheeling out the 
waist-line the wheel should be put down below it, and 
in wheeling out the length-lines it is necessary to re- 
member that the waist is the smallest part of the pattern. 
In tracing the long bedy-lines there is always the inclination 
to turn the wheel before arriving at the waist, and thus 
make the pieces both slack and short-waisted. Beginners 
should be very careful indeed in this respect, as they can 
increase the waist size of a dress three or four inches 
merely by this small inattention. In tracing each piece it is 
best to begin with the waist-line, cross the hip curve, and 
follow the “spring” or hip-lines to the waist, stop at the 
waist line, and raise the wheel, and then put it down again 
tuside the fitting-line, and continue on to the end of the 
seam. This plan ensures the waist coming out the right 
size. At all other parts the piercing should be ‘on the 
fitting-lines themselves, neither inside nor outside, and the 
only reason for lifting the wheel at the waist is to avoid 
turning it there, which would add a quarter of an inch of 
extra size to every seam. 
The next step is parring the pieces. Each piece of the 
pattern is removed after the piercing has been done, and 
each two pieces of the lining and each two pieces of material 
of the same shape are paired for tacking out. The two 
pieces of material are placed face down on the table, 
and on each one the piece of lining belonging to it face up. 
After pairing, the next step is 7 wad the fronts. Yor 
this good cotton-wool should be used, and the best quality 
is the most satisfactory. White should be used for very 
light dresses, and black or slate for dark ones, The lengta

of cotton-wool should be opened out fully, that there may 
be wool at one side and the skin at the other, and a piece 
cut from it the size and shape of the wadding-space on 
the pattern. The skin side should be laid down on the 
lining, and (from the right side) secured down with minute 
catch-stitches put about two or three inches apart. For 
catch-stitches the needle is put through from the back, 
and then put back through the same place two or three 
times (of course, through both the lining and wool), and 
then fastened off securely. This prevents the wadding 
from moving. Then, with a small pair of scissors (the ends 
of the blades held about an inch apart), the edges of the 
wadding all round the wadding-lines should be thinned, 
picking the wool away and leaving nothing but the skin 
round that part which runs by the arm-hole, and pulling 
and fluffing it softly down at the other edges, not to leave 
a hard ridge to show when the dress is in wear. One thick- 
hess of good white wadding is sufficient for an average 
figure. The darker wools are never so good in quality 
as the white, so with them a little more may be laid on; 
but if moré than one layer of wool is used, each succeeding 
layer should be shorter and narrower than the one below, 
and all the edges carefully “thinned” into it. The skin 
should also be removed from all but the first layer. 
Some workers prefer the wool against the lining and skin 
against the outside stuff; in this case it should be thinned 
off before being put into place. For very loosely woven 
stuffs (such as bop-sacks) it is advisable to cover the wad- 
ding with an extra piece of the stuff to prevent it working 
through, With washing-dresses and those of transparent 
materials the wadding is not put between stuff and lining, 
but is made separately between two shaped pieces of 
sarcenet and tacked round the arm-hole after the dress is 
entirely finished, in much the same way as dress-preservers 
are put in. Many high-class dressmakers wad all dresses in 
this way, and many wearers prefer it to the other. Tailors

wad the lining and secure it down with several rows of 
machine: stitching, following the shape of the arm-hole. 
That the use of wadding in dress bodices is to fill up the 
natural hollows of the figure is not well understood, and 
many avoid its use altogether, under the impression that it 
is a first step down the path where truth ends and falsehood 
” begins. This, however, is not the case. The wadding has 
a definite office, and, rightly used, is infinitely preferable to 
the wrinkles that with many figures form down. from thé 
shoulder unless the bodice is made uncomfortably narrow in 
the chest, which is equally bad for health and appearance. 
Manipulation of the material alone, which can be resorted 
to for all other hollows, must be cautiously used down the 
front of the shoulder, or it will seriously interfere with the 
organs of respiration by contracting the chest, in addition to 
drawing the figure over and establishing a habit of stooping. 
‘The chest should have free scope, and in figures which are 
very hollow down the centre of the shoulder two or even three 
thicknesses of wool may be used with advantage to ensure 
this, and yet keep the outside material smooth. Each 
succeeding layer, however, should be shorter and narrower 
than the last, and the wadding itself should be kept strictly 
within the bounds naturally assigned to it by the formation 
of the figure, and not allowed to spread forward. 
The hollows referred to lie down the front of each 
shoulder and round the front of the arm, where the curve 
of the bust falls away; well-developed figures show no 
hollow at the shoulder, and only some slight falling away at 
the front of the arm. 
On the frontispiece both wadding-lines (marked H for 
hollow figures and F for full ones) are clearly shown, The 
H lines run as high as the turn of the neck, and here the 
wool must be carefully thinned away, or it will show on the 
slope of the shoulders: the good worker will avoid this, 
keeping the pretty natural curve there, which is accomplished 
by stretching, as explained further on.
-P-A-G-E-23
10.0 THe Evements or Mopexn DRESSMAKING. 
The space to be wadded is from two to two and a half 
inches wide across (in the centre of the shoulder), and 
the wadding should be kept from touching the neck curve or 
upper part of the arm-hole near the shoulder-joint, which is 
always bent a little forward in hollow figures, and is really 
one of the limits of the chest hollows. 
The next process is that of éaching out. Each piece of 
lining is already laid on its own piece of material, and 
fastened to it with a couple of pins; it is next to be tacked 
down to it (using thin tacking- cotton, generally white or 
pink) in the pricked outlines. Halfinch to one inch stitches 
may be used on the long, straight lines, but smaller ones 
are necessary round the curves. All the stitches, both 
under and over, should be of equal length, and all the 
marks which were pierced should be tacked out, except, 
of course, the wadding lines, which have been already 
used. 
Expert dressmakers stretch certain parts of the outside 
material a good deal down the length of the bodice, but it is 
unwise for anyone to attempt it until she quite understands 
why and where it is done. It is generally admitted that the 
outside material should be stretched a little to ensure close, 
clear fitting and freedom from wrinkles, as woollen dress stuffs 
are more elastic and yielding than the linings on which they 
are mounted; the stretching also imparts the quality of 
“clingingness” to the bodice; but all materials are not 
equally elastic, and great care must be taken not to im- 
poverish the stuff by stretching too much, or in the wrong 
direction. . 
Tacking out should be done in such a way that the 
lining is left loose or full down the length of the bodice at 
all the hollows of the figure: The positions of the hollows 
-of the figure are clearly indicated by the lines of shading on 
Fig. 1. In addition to those which have been dealt with by 
wadding, we find the turn of the neck, the waist, the front 
edge, and the side-front where the waist rises to the hip.

This last is an awkward place to manage well, even for ex: 
perienced dressmakers. The little seam shown on the 
frontispiece, taken up in the lining only and the material 
smoothed down over it, is the old way; cross boning (2¢., 
putting in a bone on the slant, from the top of the dart to 
the bottom of the side-seam) is a later 
device; but undoubtedly the most 
successful way of dealing with it is by 
cross-cutting the pattern (Ze, shaping 
it) in such a manner as to throw the 
whole of the side-front, from the back 
dart, on the cross of the material. 
Each different system of cutting by 
measure has its own method of pro- 
ducing the cross-cut; it is, however, 
more difficult to handle than the 
standard straight-cut, which is being 
dealt with here, and which serves for 
the short round or pointed bodices 
at present worn. For most figures Fig norte 5 2102, 389

bone, or use the simpler plan of an , to 4y Extra bone in 
extra bone (the casing sewn to the 
lining only) between the seam and back dart. The posi- 
tion of the bone is shown by a firm line on Fig. 1, the 
dotted line indicating that of a cross-bone. The hollow 
of the front edge is dealt with by using the bust-pleat or 
V-dart, either pinning it up in the paper pattern before 
tracing, or sewing it out as a little seam in the lining 
and smoothing the stuff down over it afterwards, By the 
latter plan the seam is almost sure to come in the way of 
a button-hole ; the writer therefore prefers the first plan. It 
is not advisable, for young figures, to cut up the first dart 
of the pattern to make the bust-pleat lie quite flat, as it 
takes away some of the shaping of the front, but it may be

done with advantage for older figures (see page 64). The 
waist is the principal hollow, and the one where most of the 
looseness of lining is required ; but the slight hollows down 
the front of the shoulders which have been already wadded 
have also to be considered, and at the turn of the neck there 
is also. the slight falling-away just. above the collar-bone 
where wrinkles are likely to form. These are all best dealt 
with by fulling the lining to strain the stuff out over it. To 
understand rightly why this is so, we have to remember that 
in covering curves with successive layers of stuff, inward 
curves or hollows (as the waist) require the longest layer 
first, and each successive layer has to be shorter than the 
last (as the hollow gets, in a sense, filled up) if it is to sit 
smoothly and clearly. 
With outward curves (as the bust) the reverse is the 
case, and each succeeding layer should be longer than the 
last, or a sense of constraint and pressure and drawing down 
will be felt, and the outside material will pull up and create 
wrinkles for want of sufficient length to sit clearly. 
An easy, straightforward way of tacking out is to put the 
stuff face down on the table, and on it place the lining 
right side up, pin together in two or three places to prevent 
slipping apart, and tack out in the fitting-lines over the 
edge of the table, or over the hand, or over an old towel- 
rail, using half-inch stitches, working from the top down- 
wards, and returning to the top to start each line. This 
uses up the length of the lining more rapidly than that of 
the stuff, and will make the lining slightly full for the 
material all down the Jength. * 
A workroom plan is to pierce the fitting-lines, place the 
lining face down on the table, with the material right side 
up upon it, smooth the latter out very much and pin down 
here and there, baste all over the surface without regard 
to run of seams, then turn over and tack out in the 
fitting-lines. 
* See Easing, p. gt.
-P-A-G-E-26
Bonice MAKING. 13 
Another workroom plan is to cut carefully stuff and 
lining exactly the same size, place the stuff face downwards 
on the table with the lining upon it, see that all edges 
match exactly, and then draw the lining back a quarter 
of an inch from every edge, pin down by the turnings and 
tack out in the fitting-lines, keeping the fulness of the 
lining inside them, 
This plan has the disadvantage of straining the width 
as well as the length, which is not advisable. As the two 
tensions counteract each other, and so are likely to pull 
the bodice out of shape, and the strain may make the 
stuff give at the seams if the fit is very close and the 
downward stretching has been well done; but the outside 
stuff should never be looser in the width than the lining, 
excepting with horizontal cords. 
The darts should be cut up the centre line to within an 
inch of the points, and the material on the “tongue” between 
them, and also on the side-front (the part of the front that 
comes between the back dart and first seam), stretched 
downwards and backwards in the direction of the dotted 
“cross-boning” line (5 to 5) on Fig. 1. 
All the other body pieces only need easing down 
the length of the waist, the fulness distributed a little 
above and below it, but the greater part close to the waist 
itself, and the rest of each seam tacked over the hand 
or towel-rail to ensure smoothness; the sleeves only 
need slightly straining down the length to make the seams 
lie flat. 
It must be borne in mind by the worker that different 
materials do not possess the same degree of elasticity; 
loosely woven diagonal] serges are better for being well 
stretched, but a hard plain silk or silk velvet will not yield 
a quarter of an inch unless the seams fall on the cross of 
the fabric, From a half to three-quarters of an inch is the 
average amount that ordinary woollens can be stretched, 
and care must be taken in drawing down those seams that

are quite on the straight thread, or an awkward tear may 
result. . . 
Subjoined is a list of materials that require special 
attention to some particular detail when they are being 
tacked to the lining. Different tacking stitches are given 
on page 95. 
Owing to their elasticity, as well as the form of the 
figure, all woollen materials should be slightly stretched 
down the length when they are being tacked out, and the 
tacking may be done in the fitting-lines without detriment 
to the material if ordinary tacking-cotton and fairly fine 
needles are used. This method of tacking out has the 
great advantage of preserving the outline to the most in- 
experienced eye as long as the threads remain in the work, 
and it is therefore invaluable to beginners. Woollens 
woven with a twill are more flexible and stretch more than 
plain ones, and therefore must bé put tighter on the lining ; 
the seams should draw down easily for machining—if they 
need hard stretching the lining is too- full in the Jength, 
and will make the stuff look poor in the seams. 
Open textures, such as woollen canvas or woollen 
grenadine, should be stretched with great caution, lest the 
designs are pulled out of shape, and the yielding qualities 
of crepons should be judged by the firm part, not the 
- créped ones, as if the latter are unduly strained the beauty 
of the fabric is lost. 
Low-class woollen goods are adulterated with cotton 
and other hard, unyielding fibres, or, being often only 
shoddy, are not able to bear much strain. Such goods 
should only. be stretched very little, and that with great 
caution, as they tear easily. Cotton stuffs are harder and 
less yielding than woollen, and should not be stretched 
touch—from a quarter to half an inch down the length is 
sufficient—and twills in cottons, as in woollens, are more 
yielding than plain goods. 
Pile fabrics, whether of cotton or silk—as corduroy,
-P-A-G-E-28
Bonice Maxine. 15 
velveteen, velvet, plush, etc.—do not yield much unless 
cut on the cross, so must not be much stretched, and 
every care must be taken not to spoil the pile ; fine needles 
and sewing silk should be used, and the tacking out done 
in the turnings outside the fitting-lines. 
Soft crepons and crapes of every kind, cotton crape, 
crépe de Chine or soft crape, should be handled lightly 
and not stretched at all. 
Hard mourning crape is seldom used for the whole 
of a fitting garment, but is often laid on as a plastron, 
vest, revers, etc. Jt should be handled with the utmost 
lightness and delicacy of touch; the least degree of 
stretching is bad for its after-wear, and spoils its appear- 
ance at once. 
Plain silk does not stretch much unless on the cross, 
and shows pin and stitch-marks ; it is necessary therefore 
to take the same precautions as for velvet, and to tack 
outside the outline with very fine needle and sewing silk. 
Corded silks, ottomans, poplins, bengalines, etc, come 
under the same head, and should not be made to fit ex- 
tremely close, as the cords, being already pierced by the 
needle in the machining, are ready to fall apart under strain. 
The same applies to all corded fabrics, whether of silk, 
cotton, or wool. 
Twilled silks stretch nearly as much as woollens, but 
split quickly if unduly strained down; therefore they 
should be handled with judgment and caution. 
Net, lace, gauze, muslin, and thin goods generally 
should not be stretched on the lining at all; they are 
seldom made in quite plain styles, as they are too thin 
to keep in shape. : 
The great objection to tacking in the fitting-lines—and 
it és a great objection—is the number of tacking threads at 
every seam to machine over and draw out afterwards. 
Where, however, it is desired to combine the advantages 
of both methods without the disadvantages of either, it is”
-P-A-G-E-29
16 THe Evemenrs or Movern DRsSSMAKING. 
a good plan to tack out and tack together in the fitting- 
lines, using a differently coloured cotton for each process, 
and after trying-on remove the tacking out threads from 
the seams efore machining, leaving only the tacking together 
threads to be drawn out afterwards. In this case the 
fitting-lines of the arm-holes, neck, waist, and front edges 
should be separately tacked out. 
The experienced worker, who knows her lines thoroughly, 
can afford to dispense to a large extent with tacking out, and 
many simply baste out all the pieces to the lining (stretching 
them well over it) and join immediately in the pricked 
fitting-lines, afterwards tacking out all the outlines of neck, 
fronts, arm-holes, waist, etc., to preserve them as long as 
they are required; but the inexperienced worker should 
not attempt this at first, or she will probably spoil the work 
by losing some of the lines or putting the wrong ones 
together, and, not yet having judgment or knowledge by 
which to detect and correct her errors, a hopeless fiasco is 
the usual result of such an attempt. 
After the tacking out comes the joining together of the 
pieces, unless some of the seams are to be corded, in which 
latter case the cording should first be tacked to the lines 
requiring it. 
All seams should be joined by the waist-lines, and 
the pieces put evenly together, neither fulling nor stretch- 
ing beyond what is just necessary to draw the lining (which 
was eased on the stuff in the tacking out) back to its 
own length. All joining should be from the back forward, 
the backmost piece being held towards the worker whilst 
the joining goes on, Each seam should be pinned and then 
tacked together in the fitting lines. 
Tacking together is done with stronger cotton than tack- 
ing out ; a coarse running stitch is the best, and some like to 
make a back-stitch at the waist, to hold the sewing firmly. 
All tacking together should be securely started and 
finished. and should not begin and end at fitting-lines only,
-P-A-G-E-30

but should be carried half an inch into the turnings at 
the ends of every seam. * 
The two backs are put together by the waist- and neck- 
lines, and first pinned and then tacked together in the 
fitting-lines which were previously “tacked out.” If the 
tacking out and joining are done truly the neck curves will 
run together in an unbroken line. Next (the back being 
held to the worker and the curved side-piece away from 
her) the two should be joined together from the waist 
upwards, care being taken to join them evenly, and not 
to stretch the one or ease the other. Plenty of pins 
should be used, and the whole seam pinned together before 
tacking. At the top of this seam the unbroken arm-hole 
curve should begin to form itself again; but if by any 
mischance there should be difference in length at this 
seam, the difference must run out at the arm-hole, unless 
the system of drafting directs the back curve to be slightly 
fulled to the curved side-piece : where this is the case the 
rules of the system should be followed. If this is done, 
the fulling should be placed where it will accommodate 
the shoulder-blade, ze, at the most rounded part of the 
curved side-piece, about two inches below the top of the 
seam, and kept within a space of about two inches below 
that. 
Occasionally corded curved seams are stitched too ; the 
backs are corded, and the curved side-piece then turned 
under exactly in the fitting-line and placed upon it, close 
up to the cord; a line of stitching is carried quite close to 
the edge of the fold—sometimes two or three—instead of 
an inside seam being made in the ordinary manner. 
The small straight side-piece should be joined to the 
slanting side of the curved side-piece, also from the waist 
upwards. The straight side-piece at this seam may happen 
to come about a quarter of an inch short at the arm-hole 
end, unless the lengths have been carefully checked in the 
drafting ; finally, the front should be joined to the straight

side-piece, where the arm-hole line should run on unbroken 
again. 
The back dart should be pinned by the waist-line, the 
back line of it being gently stretched down to make the 
two sides of equal length. It must be first pinned and 
then tacked together. The front dart can be simply folded 
down its centre line and tacked together. Both darts 
should be very gently tapered off at the points, and it is 
easier for the worker to close them before joining the fronts 
to the rest of the bodice. 
The shoulders should be joined at the neck, great 
care being taken to make the whole neck-line run in an 
unbroken curve. Neglect of this precaution will cause the 
front of the bodice to pull to“one side after it is finished. 
Of course, if the neck has been altered in the fitting, the 
worker will be careful to take the altered neck-curves of 
both backs and both fronts when re-joining. 
The sleeve should be put together by the inside seam, 
which must join exactly at inset and bend ; any difference of 
length should run out at the wrist end. The back seam of 
the sleeve should be made to “lie,” that elbow ease may 
be ensured. The sleeve, with the inner seam joined, is 
placed flat on the table, the under-sleeve being uppermost. 
The back fitting-line of the upper (which is considerably 
wider than the under) should be lifted over to meet the back 
fitting-line of the under, a little above the elbow, and the 
two pinned together to the top of the seam and down 
to within half an inch of the elbow; halfway between 
the elbow and the wrist-line, the same “bringing over” 
must be repeated—i.e., the sleeve must be laid flat, and 
the back fitting-line of the upper sleeve brought over to 
meet that of the under. The seam must be pinned down 
to the wrist-line, slightly easing the upper to the under if the 
latter is very narrow and the seam lines are curved (this line 
will probably not run exactly together at the wrist), and 
then pinned up to within half an inch of the elbow,
-P-A-G-E-32
Bovice Maxine. , 1g 
where it will be found that the upper sleeve is now a little too 
long for the under sleeve. This trifle of extra length must 
be gathered and fixed at the elbow into an inch of space, 
the fitting-lines being closed together above and below it. 
If the sleeve is now laid down on the table, it will be 
found that, except for the little fulness at the elbow, it lies 
quite smooth and flat, as if upper and under were the same 
width, and the gathering at the elbow has made a tiny 
bag in which the elbow can move freely. This bag is 
necessary in close-fitting sleeves, and can only be put into 
its proper place by making the sleeve lie. If the sleeve 
is joined down the back seam, without the gathering, there 
will be no elbow ease, and it will not lie flat, but will twist 
from inside to outside in a very ugly way; and if it twists 
when off the arm, it will certainly twist upon it. If the sleeve 
is cut with upper and under of equal width at the elbow (as 
a coat sleeve is cut), the gathering is not needed, as a little 
extra curve on the seam gives the required room for free 
movement; but there should always be a little gathering at 
the elbow with bodice sleeves of the present fashion—ie., 
with narrow under-sleeves, 
Collars have changed very much within the last twenty 
years. At one period the neck-band was simply a narrow 
binding on the cross sewn to the outside of the neck of the 
bodice, turned over, and neatly hemmed along the inside. 
With firm or hard stuffs a lining of soft silk or sarcenet was 
substituted for the piece turned inside, and the bottom edge 
of the outside cross-strip stretched a little to give it curve. 
It was presently found that a strip on the straight, slightly 
curved at top and bottom, would sit better and was less in- 
clined to wrinkle than the crossways strip, especially if it 
had a little stiff muslin tacked between, This class of collar 
is made and set on as follows: The outside material, 
the lining, and the stiffenings—consisting of two thicknesses 
of firm muslin—should all be cut with at least a quarter of 
an inch of turnings all the way round, and laid, lining and
-P-A-G-E-33
20 THe Exements or MopeRN DRESSMAKING. 
material face to face, and the stiffenings on either side of 
them. ‘These four, so arranged, should be machined along 
the top and ends at the distance in from the edges allowed 
by the turnings, the line of sewing pressed, the top edges of 
the turnings slightly snipped and the corners pared away, 
the collar turned right side out and the edges pressed along. 
The collar is now set on to the fitting-line of the neck, using 
the quarter-inch of turnings and beginning from the back 
centre seam (to which the middle of the collar is laid), the 
right side of the collar to the right side of the dress, with 
the collar towards the worker. From the centre the collar 
should be pinned round towards the front, pinning it by the 
neck-curve through outside material and stiffening, and it 
should end just at the fitting-line at front, to do which the 
collar must be put on a little easy for the neck of the dress. 
It should be firmly tacked, and then machined along just in 
the fitting-line, after which the tacking threads are removed, 
the turnings snipped, and the lining of the collar hemmed 
down over the sewing to make all neat. 
The fashion of wearing tailor-made dresses brought 
in the stiff collar. Tailor work is turned out firm and 
smooth, and their collars are lined with three or four 
thicknesses of French canvas, each strip rubbed down with 
a film of soap, and the whole then ironed together. This 
makes an excellent collar-stiffening, as it is firm and smooth 
without being easily cracked. Dressmakers have substituted 
upholsterers’ buckram (a firm, thick, drab canvas, much 
stiffened) for it; but this needs covering if a firm, smooth 
collar is to be made. In common work it is cut to 
size and the outside material tacked over it without any 
further preparation; it makes the outside material look 
very poor if it is well strained over, and soon cuts through 
top and ends. Collar stiffening, woven on a slight curve, 
can now be bought in various widths, and is an excellent 
invention of its kind. Stiff collars are made as follows :-— 
The collar pattern should be drafted with the centre of
-P-A-G-E-34

the back to a fold of the paper, and cut out double and by 
the fitting-lines, It should then be opened and laid on the 
buckram with the back fold to a thread, that the fronts of 
the collar may be equally on the cross, pencilled round, and 
the buckram cut to the fitting-lines. Two pieces of lining, 
muslin, or any thin material are then cut, also to the size 
of the collar without turnings, and put one on each side 
of the buckram, and either tacked or machined through in 
a zigzag line from one end to the other. After this it 
should be ironed under a damp cloth, and slightly curved 
to the shape of the neck and well dried in the ironing. 
Properly done, this gives a collar with the firm substance 
of a starched linen collar, and without the disagreeable 
crackliness of the raw buckram. 
The outside material is cut the same way of the thread 
as any other part of the dress, and a quarter of an inch of 
turnings allowed all round it. This is turned over and 
rough-hemmed down (raw-edged) to the collar at top, bottom, 
and ends, the stitches being taken alternately through the 
lining machined to the buckram, and through the turned- 
over edge of the stuff. The material will require slightly 
snipping to lie easily over the curved-out top edge of the 
collar, and the outside material should be put on tightly 
both in width and length. 
Two hooks are then sewn to the right-hand end, the 
turn being a quarter of an inch under the edge of the collar, 
and two eyes or two silk loops to correspond with the hooks 
on the left-hand end. The eyes are cast over with silk and 
sewn just under the collar-end ; the sewing-on is done to tke 
material turned over and the lining on the buckram, not 
through the buckram itself; and the collar should meet edge 
to edge at the ends when finished. If silk loops are used, 
they should not be put outside the collar-end unless it 
is intended to overlap. They are often worked on the 
extreme end edge instead of either below or above it, and 
are then easier to hook.

A lining of the same silk or sarcenet used for the other 
inside finishing is next prepared ; cut large enough to ease 
a little both in length and depth and to give a good half-inch 
of turnings below. This lining should be either slip-stitched 
or hemmed to the collar along the top and down each end 
to within a quarter of an inch of the bottom, where it should 
be left loose to allow the collar to be freely adjusted to the 
neck-lines. 
When the bodice is tacked together it should be 
measured up across bust and waist, to make sure it has not 
been altered in size there; it is then ready for the first 
trying-on (see page 50). 
The trying-on being satisfactorily completed, the 
necessary alterations (marked or made on one side of the 
bodices only, as explained, page 50) must be transferred to 
the uncorrected half. The workroom plan of transferring 
corrections is as follows : The alteration is marked on each 
side of the defective seam with pins or cotton differing in 
colour from the one used in tacking out. The seams are 
opened and the corrected half of the bodice laid to the cor- 
responding seams of the other half, and pinned to it in the 
original tacking lines, the corrected line is then pinned 
through and tacked out, after which the seams are re-joined 
in the altered lines ready for machining. ‘The machining 
follows, unless the seams are to be stitched by hand—a long 
and tedious process, but the only advisable course to pursue 
if the worker does not possess a machine. Shop-work of 
this kind is unsatisfactory as a rule, and equally so is the 
machining of kind friends, who do not know what careful 
machining a bodice requires, and so slip the lines ; the best 
fitting can be entirely spoilt by such machining, and this 
is particularly to be regretted when great care has been 
taken and much time spent on the previous work of draft- 
ing, tacking out, etc. 
The best sewing-machines are those that run lightly, and 
without noise, that have not many or complicated arrange-

ments for regulating the tension of the thread cither for the 
top or for the shuttle, and do not readily get out of order. 
Treadle machines have two great advantages over those 
worked by hand: they leave the worker’s hands free to guide 
the work under the needle, and the lower wheel, being always 
a large one, gives many more stitches for each movement of 
the foot than the smaller wheel of the hand-machine gives for 
each turn of the hand, thus saving time and labour. 
Each make of sewing-machine must be managed ac- 
cording to the rules issued with it, which are formulated 
according to the principles of its construction ; with these 
each worker should thoroughly familiarise herself, such de- 
tails as the threading, regulation of tension, etc., being also 
peculiar to each make of machine. 
It is, however, a general rule to keep the machine well- 
oiled and clean. Ordinary machine oil should be used for 
the purpose, as olive oil clogs, and ali surplus oil should be 
carefully wiped away before any work is brought near the 
machine. Should it happen that it has run dry or works 
heavily by reason of being clogged, it may be “oiled” with 
paraffin oil and worked briskly for a few minutes, wiped off 
and properly oiled, when it will be found in good working 
order again. 
‘The needle and cotton or silk should be suitable in 
thickness to the material to be sewn, and a blunt needle 
should never be used, as it makes larger holes in the work 
than the thread it carries will fill up. No one would use a 
blunt needle for hand-work, but machine needles are fre- 
quently kept in use for a very long time—sometimes, indeed, 
until attention is drawn to their bluntness by the spoiling of 
a piece of work. The needle should be well-pointed and 
fine, sufficiently large to carry the thread easily, but not 
larger than that. 
Cottons and linens are machined with cotton, high-class 
woollens with silk, ordinary woollens with cotton for the 
seams and machine silk for outside stitching ; velvets, silks,
-P-A-G-E-37
a4 Tue Exvements or Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
etc., with machine silk. The cotton for ordinary woollen 
dresses should be about size No. 40 and unglazed; it should 
match the dress in colour jf possible (though black is often 
used for dark stuffs, claret, myrtle, navy blue, etc.), and be 
smooth, even, and strong. 
Where cotton cannot be matched to bright coloured 
woollens, two shades, one lighter and one darker, can often 
be combined to produce the desired shade. Lighter or 
darker cotton shows very distinctly in the seams. The 
thread on the shuttle bobbin, whether of cotton or silk, 
should be very carefully and evenly wound, and the tension 
of both threads quite equal, or the stitch will not be perfect. 
Some sewing-machines require a finer thread in the shuttle 
than for the needle, and where this is so the finer thread 
must be used or silk substituted for it (as it runs smoothly) ; 
but where a thread of equal size can be used it is distinctly 
preferable, especially for seams, where the strain on the 
thread is equal from both sides. 
Cotton soon looks shabby and loses it first freshness of 
colour, so it is never used for ornamental machine-stitching, 
such as hems, edges, etc., or any part where the stitch is to 
show; silk is correctly used for such outside work on all but 
cotton dresses. 
The silk is very often ‘used either for the needle only or 
the shuttle only (the face of the work being up or down 
accordingly) by economical workers; the tension of both 
threads must,then be very exact, or some of the cotton will 
be brought to the face and so spoil the silk effect. Such 
work is best done with the face of the work up and the silk 
in the needle. Fine sewing-silk should not be used for 
machining ; it is not strong enough to bear strain nor thick 
enough to be ornamental, and is best reserved for slip- 
stitching. Suitable machine silk (costing sixpence the 
quarter-ounce reel) is to be obtained from all good drapers. 
This is beautifully smooth and strong, and does not make a 
bulky seam, Where very effective stitched hems are wanted,
-P-A-G-E-38

button-hole twist may be employed. The size of the stitch 
should be adapted to the thickness of the material, thick 
stuffs needing a longer stitch than thin ones ; it is wise to 
put two scraps of stuff and two of lining together, exactly as 
they would come in a bodice seam, and try the stitch on 
them before commencing on the work itself. Thick stuffs 
need about fourteen stitches to the inch, ordinary beige, 
fould, and stuffs of that class about sixteen ; and bodices of 
thick material should not be machined to fit as closely as 
those of thinner stuff, since the turn of the seams consumes 
a little width, and the bulk of the turnings tends to fill up 
the bodice slightly as well. 
For ordinary work the machining may be started at either 
the top or bottom of the seams, as long as it is all done the 
one way, and the machinist should go slowly and steadily 
along bodice seams, taking particular care to see that the 
needle is fairly on the waist-line before turning; a few 
stitches may be machined straight below it before turning 
without spoiling the fit of the dress—rather it will improve 
it, as it will make the more distinct “ waist” referred to 
on pages 51 and 55. ‘This “waist” should only be made 
on the straight seams at each side of the straight side-piece. 
The points or heads of the dart should be gently tapered 
off. The back curves are best machined with the backs 
down; this necessitates putting the bodice under the 
arm of the machine whilst working, but if it is kept 
smooth and rolled over close to the needle it will not 
be troublesome to do so, Where the tacking together 
is not firmly done, the curves are liable to run apart 
in the machining, and so produce a defect in the after 
fitting-on. 
Curved seams or lines should not be drawn out into a 
straight line whilst they are being machined ; they must be 
allowed to keep their own curved shape as nearly as possible 
whilst passing under the needle, or they are apt to split open 
as soon as they come into wear. (A curve is longer than a
-P-A-G-E-39
26 Tue Evements or Mopexrn DRESSMAKING. 
straight line, both starting and ending at the same point, 
and the straight line of machining consequently does not 
use up so much thread as the curve, and when the bodice is 
put on and the curves drawn back to their own shape the 
thread is too short for them and gives way under the strain. 
Every curve, whether back-curves, sleeve-seams, armholes, 
or faced hems, should be kept its own shape and machined 
slowly, to allow each stitch to be perfectly made, and all 
the length of thread required to be taken up by the work.) 
Cords, repps, and goods of that class require great care 
in the size and sharpness of needles chosen and the degree 
of tightness given to the garment by the machining, as the 
groups of threads composing each cord are loosened by being 
pierced with the needle, and are very ready to split at the 
seams under strain, particularly if sewn with hard cotton. 
Skirt seams should be joined from the top downwards, 
and are considered to run less risk of stretching if the bias 
edge is underneath and the straight one up during the 
process of machining, as explained on page 126. 
Velvet and pile fabrics generally should be machined 
against the pile, as seams so joined show the sewing less, 
and are also less likely to slip away from each other during 
the process. 
The shoulder seams, and one of the straight seams 
under each arm, are not machined unless the worker is an 
experienced one, but are left for possible alterations. 
Comparing and measuring up should follow. When the 
machining is completed the bodice should be folded by the 
back centre-seam, and all seams carefully compared, to 
ascertain that there has not been any unequal taking-in, 
but that the pieces on each side of the dress are still pairs 
both in size and in shape. The run on both sides of each 
seam should be examined, to see that there has not been 
any slipping away of the under-side in the machining, 
and the widths of bust, and waist measured up to make 
sure the size has not been decreased. Any errors are
-P-A-G-E-40

best corrected before the turnings are glazed by the 
pressing. 
The waist should be tight enough to meet with difficulty 
when the machining is completed, and the bodice gently 
but very thoroughly stretched out to make it comfortable 
for the wearer. _This is very necessary for all bodices cut 
by measure, otherwise the waist wears loose in a few days, 
to the annoyance of everyone concerned ; but the stretch- 
ing must be done gently, and corded fabrics or goods of 
that class watched and the stretching stopped if the seams 
begin to show signs of yielding. 
The facking threads should next be removed from all 
the sewn seams. If the stitches are snipped at every few 
inches with the scissors, they will be found to draw out 
easily. With velvet and pile fabrics generally they should 
be drawn through from the face; it does not then injure 
the pile. Care should be taken not to remove them from 
the fitting-lines, or from the neck, waist, design-lines, arm- 
holes, and bottom edges. If by accident they are drawn 
out from any of these parts, they should be immediately 
replaced. 
Neatening the inside seams, and pressing, The edges of 
the turnings should be pared down to a uniform width 
outside the sewing-line, wide enough to keep from curling 
up, but not so wide as to overlap at the waist, At the 
waist of each seam the turnings must be snipped across 
nearly to the sewing-line; the darts are snipped across 
at the waist and opened to within half an inch of the 
top, where they must be snipped across nearly to the 
sewing-line again. (The tiny scrap of dart at the top, 
above this last snip, must be carefully flattened with the 
iron when the seams are pressed ; the other parts of the 
turnings should be neatened in the same way as the other 
Seams, and, to make them neat and prevent them fray- 
ing, the edges of the turnings must be protected in some 
way.)
-P-A-G-E-41
28 Tue Evemenrs or Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
Very common work indeed is pinking them out, or 
machining them down, raw-edged, quite close to the edge; 
but amongst better-class dressmakers only three methods 
are in general. use—binding, overcasting the ‘raw edges, 
or turning in the edges. of stuff and lining, and either 
running down or overcasting them together. 
Of these methods binding is considered the best. Fine 
natrow china or sarcenet ribbon is used; it is creased and 
turned over the edges, and neatly run through all four 
atonce. The binding should be put on “full” or “easy,” 
especially at the waist and a little above and below it; 
and as it is not easy to turn sharp corners with binding, 
‘the turnings are generally scalloped at the waist instead 
of being merely snipped across, and the scallops continued 
the length of the seam. The scallops should be two inches 
long, three-quarters of an inch at the wide part and three- 
eighths at the cuts, and the ends of the turnings should be 
narrowed off at the seam-ends. If the stuff is one that 
frays very much, it is usually roughly overcast before 
binding. 
Overcasting is used for very thick stuffs, or for those 
that fray, and should be close and neat (see page 103). 
Care should be taken not to draw the stitch up tightly, 
orit makes a hard, cord-like ridge which will soon show 
through the outer stuff when the dress is in wear. Curved 
scalloping is not advisable with overcasting, as the stitch 
is best worked on the straight, and scalloping presents every 
variety of “cross” to the needle; the turnings should be 
pared down to three-quarters of an inch or less, and the snip 
at the waist repeated about two inches apart up each seam, 
and the sharp corners of each cut slanted off. With sleeve 
seams the turnings may be slightly narrower—about half an 
inch is best. It will often be found that if the turnings of 
the inside sleeve seams are made narrow-—say three- 
eighths of an inch in width—and the edges held well 
turned over the forefinger during the overcasting (exactly
-P-A-G-E-42
Bovice Maxine, ~ 29 
as little children hold work when they are learning to 
seam or top-sew), the edges will be sufficiently stretched 
to lie nicely to the arm, without a feeling of constraint or 
pressure. 
Turning in edge to edge is used for very thin stuffs, and 
is best for washing-dresses. For this the turnings should 
not be pared down quite so closely as for overcasting, as 
about a quarter-inch is turned in. For bodices to the waist 
only, they can be run along by machine quite close to the 
edge, care being taken that the tension is quite loose 
enough; but it will probably be found to take less time if 
they are run by hand for bodices extending below the 
waist, as the latter need fixing. Hand-sewing on the inside 
edges does not tighten up the length as machining does ; 
such tightening, with any kind of neatening, is a very serious 
defect, as it shortens the length of the seam, and spoils the 
fitting. 
Just at the waist, where the turnings have been cut across, 
they cannot be turned in; they must therefore be overcast 
there with a few strong stitches. Each seam must be 
neatened to lie open when done; there will be, therefore, 
two lengths of neatening to every seam. The back seam of 
the sleeve may be made an exception to this rule if desired, 
or if the stuff is rough, but with plain close sleeves, even 
this is better laid open. Corded curved seams were at one 
time neatened all four edges of the turnings together, and 
the turnings pressed to lie in the curved side-piece, as 
inferior work is still often finished. 
Pressing the seams follows, and this should be done 
patiently, as on it the beauty of the finish largely depends. 
The irons should be neither too hot nor too heavy, and 
both sides of each seam, from the sewing line to the 
neatening, should be well pressed down before any attempt 
is made to open the seams flat, This presses the neatening, 
and saves the risk of it sh »wing through. If the dress is of 
very thick or very springy cloth or serge, a damp cloth
-P-A-G-E-43
30 THe Evemenrs or Moperv DRESSMAKING, 
_ should be laid over the closed seam and the pressing done 
through jit, leaving it slightly damp for the finishing-off, 
After both sides of the closed seam have been pressed, 
each one may be laid open and pressed flat with a coolet 
iron, care being taken not to stretch the length of the 
seam ; and the bust of the dress (each side of the top of 
the darts and a little above them) should be opened, and 
great pains taken to press the extreme tops of the darts 
quite flat out; but the same pains must be taken not to 
stretch the dress at that part either down or across: the 
very end of the iron only should be used there. Inexperi- 
enced pressers are apt to put the whole face of the iron 
down at this part of the bodice, and give it a rapid twist 
round, with the idea of opening it thoroughly; but this 
makes a hollow which the figure does not fill, and it often 
presses in creases that cannot be removed. 
The sleeve seams should be pressed, first closed and 
then open, and a sleeve-board is certainly an advantage. 
Sleeve-boards are narrow enough to go into a sleeve, and 
one end is rounded and wider than the other—sometimes 
the top is flat, sometimes rounded. Different contrivances 
are made use of for this purpose—a small cricket-bat, a 
broom-handle, towel-roller, or a rolling-pin being the favour- 
ites; but care should be taken to cover the paint of bat or 
broomstick, and that the rolling-pin has never been used, 
or the heat will bring off the paint or bring out the grease, 
with disastrous results. Many workers prefer pressing all 
seams open on a rounded surface, as it minimises the 
danger of the edges of the turnings marking through ; and 
here the cricket-bat and broomstick share honours, the 
former having the advantage of a wide and flat base, and 
being consequently firmer, the latter giving greater length, 
and so allowing all the seam to be pressed without constant 
moving. Pressing should always be done on four thick- 
nesses of woollen stuff—sofi cloth, or a blanket covered 
with a piece of close linen or holland—and sleeve- and skirt
-P-A-G-E-44

boards should be similarly covered. The iron should be 
well cleaned, and not too large or heavy. Tailors use a 
narrow iron, which runs along the seams ; dressmakers as a 
rule keep to the old-fashioned flat-iron, a 6- or 8-lb. one 
being usual. 
All fabrics may be ironed in the same way as woollens, 
unless they have a pile, when every care should be taken 
not to flatten it; crepons come under the same head 
as pile fabrics, and should be pressed in the same 
way. The pile may be a cut one, as in velveteen, velvet, 
and plush, or may only be looped, as in terry or frisé 
velvet. 
With these the closed seams should be carefully 
pressed, care being taken thoroughly to flatten the turn- 
ings and neatenings, but not to let the iron touch the line 
of sewing ; if it comes over it, each seam, on the outside, 
will look as if it has been greased. ‘he iron is then to be 
securely placed side upwards on the iron-stand, the seams 
opened and drawn slowly (the same way as the pile runs) 
over the edge of the iron, the outside of the bodice being 
upwards and the turnings down and towards the iron. This 
will open the seams thoroughly without injuring the pile, 
and to prevent the grip of the fingers marking it (though 
the hold should be taken on the turnings only, and not 
over the fitting-lines) good workers place a scrap of the 
velvet—any little cutting will do—pile downwards on the 
pile and hold by it. It is somewhat like clapping two 
hair-brushes together—the fibres fit into each other and 
prevent crushing. Corded seams (of any fabric) should be 
pressed in the same way, unless they are to be neatened 
together, in which case they need not be pressed open 
at all. 
Sometimes two workers hold the seams to be pressed 
—one at each end—whilst one runs the iron along the 
seam thus pressing it, face downwards, in the air. It is 
simply a different way of doing the same thing, but there
-P-A-G-E-45
32 Txe Evaments or MoDERN DRESSMAKING. 
is more strain on the seam and some danger of burning the 
fingers of the other worker. 
Silk glazes and scorches very quickly, and should there- 
fore be pressed in the same way, and with an iron that 
is light in weight and rather cool; indeed, it is a mistake 
to use hot irons for pressing: it is work that needs to be 
slowly and carefully done, and the iron should not be hot 
enough to scorch if a little extra slow pressure is wanted 
at any part. 
Fugitive colours, which change to brown when heat is 
applied to them, ate very terrifying, as it appears that the 
bodice has been scorched and hopelessly spoilt; but if 
the lining has not been scorched it will generally be found 
that the colour comes back when the dress is quite cold. 
Nearly all light blue- greys, stone-colour, lilac, pale helio- 
trope, etc., are likely to prove fugitive in this way, and 
there is one pretty shade of dark-green which turns brown 
in pressing ; it takes three or four hours before the colour 
comes properly back to any of them. It is not advisable 
in dressmaking to cultivate the habit of pressing through 
a damp cloth, as tailors do. The materials worked upon 
in each trade are very different in texture and quality, and 
need handling accordingly. With tailors, whose work is 
largely upon serges, tweeds, and firm woollen cloths, wet 
treatment is best adapted to the requirements of the 
material, and is made one of the special features of their 
work, both in the exquisite finish of all seams and edges, 
and in the skilful manipulation by which they impart 
form to a garment; whilst the large majority of dress 
materials—as cashmere, foulé, ete——are so comparatively 
light and thin that wet treatment injures colour, finish, 
and texture, causing them to draw up and look rough 
and cockled, and entirely destroying the delicate appear- 
ance of the fabric. With these the pressing should neither 
be wet nor heavy; the temptation is to press too much 
rather than too little.

The bone-casings ave now sewn on, but the bones should 
not yet be enclosed in them, and the.sewingin’ of cased 
bones, if they are to be used, should be left till the bodice 
is much nearer completion, as they make it stiff and more 
difficult to handle.* 
fastenings vary with fashion; buttons and button-holes 
are the leading standard. The button-holes are made in 
the right-hand front; the buttons are sewn on the fitting- 
line of the left-hand front. 
The turnings of the right front are trimmed off to 
within half an inch of the fitting-line, and half of this is 
turned over and pressed firmly down; the edge is thus 
turned one-quarter of an inch outside the fitting-line. 
This quarter-inch button-catch is left beyond the ends 
of the button-holes, which are only to come up to the 
fitting-line ; with the small round buttons generally worn 
it is sufficient to prevent them from coming over the 
edges; but where the edges are to be machine-stitched it 
should be wide enough to carry the stitching beyond the 
ends of the holes, or if larger buttons are worn (as on 
bodices fastening at one side, for instance), the width of 
the button-catch beyond the button-hole end should always 
slightly exceed one-half of the diameter of the button, or 
the latter will lie over it. (See page 68.) 
A shaped length of tailors’ linen, one and a quarter 
inches wide, is tacked down the fronts to give firmness ; 
this should be shaped exactly to the front edge without 
turnings, slipped under the quarter-inch turn, and tacked 
down the inside of the bodice over the hand to ensure 
its being easy in the length. 
The turn can be made firm by a row of small rough 
hemming or cross-stitching made close to the edge on the 
inside only, taking up on the needle all but the outside stuff. 
Inferior work is strengthened by a line of machine-stitching,

-P-A-G-E-47
34 THE ELEMENTS OF Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
but that should only be used if all other edges are to be 
stitched as well. 
A facing, either of gros-grain lining silk, firm piece 
sarcenet, or sarcenet ribbon one and a quarter inches 
wide, is next prepared ; if either of the former, it is cut 
about two inches wide, and across the cord, and shaped 
to the front, narrow edges turned in, and the whole neatly 
and firmly hemmed in to the bodice, the work being held 
over the hand to keep the facing easy down the length, 
and the stitches taking up all but the outside material of 
the bodice; a facing of the stuff is sometimes used, and 
is put on in the same way. Sarcenet ribbon has a finished 
woven edge, and does not require turning under, but needs 
extra easing-on at the waist, or it will not lie at its inner 
edge. It will also make some fulness at the inner edge 
over the bust, which must be used up by easing over 
the hand whilst hemming in. If the edges of the bodice 
are to be machine-stitched, all the stitching should 
be done before the facings are hemmed in; such 
stitching of course secures the stiffening of linen into 
place very thoroughly. 
It will be noticed that the bindings, facings, bone- 
casings, and stiffening are to be put in easy down the 
length. It must be remembered that the lining was made 
easy for the outside stuff at the commencement ; that the 
turnings of all seams were snipped at the waist and 
scalloped, to give ease in the length; and that, in fact, 
the rule of longer length for every successive inside layer 
is needed in every detail, if the work is to be satisfactory. 
With the facing under the button-holes it is particularly 
necessary, as if at all tight it will break away from the 
stitches and make the edges wrinkle up. Bodices with 
perfectly straight front edges need the same care—they 
will not set well if the finishings are not easy in the 
length, 
For the left front, or button side, the turnings must

Bopice MAKING. 35 
be pared down neatly about an inch beyond the fitting- 
line ; the lining and stuff are then turned over the shaped 
stiffening of linen in exactly the same way as the button-hole 
front, and tacked down ready for a facing; this will leave 
about an inch of stuff extending beyond the fitting-line, 
which is usually called the button-stand or wrap, and is 
intended to go under the button-holes, and so prevent 
gaping of the fastening edges. With figures that sink 
much at the waist, the button-stand or wrap may be 
snipped across (in the same way as the turnings of the 
body seams); but this is not necessary with ordinary 
figures if the stand is only about an inch or so wide. 
The buttons should be sewn on through the linen, which 
is then covered by the inside facing of silk, cut about 
two inches wide, shaped to follow the curves of the front 
exactly, and also hemmed on to the outer edge and to 
the lining only, just as the button-hole edge is finished ; 
the outside edge of the silk is not sewn down until the 
buttons have been sewn on; and what has been said about 
piece silk or sarcenet, ribbon sarcenet, or a facing of the 
outside stuff, applies here also. Ribbon should be used 
under the buttons if the button side is not to be faced 
under, but is often preferred to linen even when a facing 
is used. 
It is now as well to try on the bodice again, with 
collar tacked on and sleeve tacked in, and see that the 
pressing has not made the fit too slack; and if this proves 
satisfactory, the alteration seams may be machined, 
neatened, pressed, and cased, and the bottom edge turned 
up and fixed, 
The run of the bottom edge has already been settled, 
both in the tacking out and trying-on. The bodice should 
be folded, the waist-lines and each seam pinned together, 
the lower edge pared off, leaving half an inch below the 
turning up line, and the surplus turnings at the end of the 
long seams narrowed away. Some strips of stiff black or
-P-A-G-E-49
360 «Tue Exvemenrs or Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
white muslin (Victoria lawn), one and a half inches wide, 
cut on the cross, and folded unequally, are used to give 
a little firmness to the edge. This is placed with the 
fold of the muslin to the fitting-line, the muslin being cut 
off to lie under the back seam turnings ; great care should 
be taken not to stretch the edge in turning over. It 
should be finely tacked into place at a quarter of an 
inch above the turn. No bone should go below this 
fine tacking-line, and bone-casings should be turned 
up by it. The raw edges are next firmly herring-boned 
down through the muslin to the lining, and the whole is 
finally finished by a length of ribbon or strip of facing 
silk, piece sarcenet, or stuff (an inch and a half wide ; on 
the cross or straight to match the fronts, and slightly eased 
on) being hemmed down, at each edge over all. All joins 
are mitred, and points made firm and flat. The most diffi- 
cult part of the bottom edge finishing is to turn the 
front points so that they fit together, and do not overlap 
when the bodice is finished. On the button front the 
longest part of the point should be fixed just on the 
fitting-line, the edge running short again on the button- 
stand, which goes under the button-hole side of the bodice 
in wear; on the button-hole front it should also be at 
the fitting-line, running short again on the button-catch. 
Care must be taken not to have one point sharp and 
the other blunt ; at the button-hole side, where the turnings 
of front edge and bottom edge coming together are difficult 
to manipulate to the requisite fineness, the turnings need 
carefully trimming down and turning over. The bottom 
edges are generally left tacked up till all the other parts 
of the work are finished. For cased bones this is quite 
necessary, and it is also desirable with bone-casings to 
allow the lower ends of the bones to be secured to the

The method detailed above gives high-class finishing : 
the following methods are also in use :— 
The turnings of the right front are snipped at the 
waist to within half an inch of the fitting-line, and then 
turned under a quarter of an inch outside it. Care should 
be taken that the piece of material and lining turned in 
is as wide or a little wider than the button-holes will be. 
The inner edge of the facing should be turned under and 
hemmed neatly to the lining inside the front, or tacked 
along raw-edged and finished by a narrow binding (china 
ribbon or Paris binding) hemmed along on both sides 
over it. If care has been taken, in turning under, not 
to lose the curve of the front fitting-line, the turnings 
will be found a little too full over the bust; this fulness 
must be “eased in” in hemming down, not laid in one 
flat pleat, and an extra scrap of stuff must be laid under 
the waist (where the snipping has left the turnings open), 
to strengthen it there. The left-hand front has the quantity 
for button-stand allowed as in the preceding method; the 
edge is bound, or stuff and lining are simply turned in 
edge to edge and machined down; the buttons are sewn 
on through a tape or ribbon laid behind the fitting-line to 
strengthen the front. 
With very inferior work, the left-hand front is turned in 
and left loose from the lining, the button-holes being worked 
through it without any further preparation, and being con- 
sidered to hold it sufficiently. Sometimes the loose edges 
are left with their selvedges just as turned in; at others 
they may be found overcast together or bound with narrow 
ribbon, Jacket-makers, used to working on unlined cloth, 
finish dress bodices in this way from force of habit. 
When all the edges are turned, the fronts may be ~ 
marked for button-holes and the holes worked. These 
should be cut exactly by a thread and at equal distances 
apart,* and should all be the same length. They are

sometimes marked with pins, but it is an unsafe and 
not a particularly tidy way of working, as the pins can 
easily get shaken out or misplaced, and are likely to catch 
the thread and scratch the hands of the worker. It is easy 
to mark them with a tape measure and a needie threaded 
with white cotton. One edge of the tape measure should be 
laid close to the fitting-line, and (beginning at the waist) 
stitches should be taken up the other side of it, a scrap of 
stuff being taken on the needle at every three-quarters of 
an inch or less if the button-holes are to be closer together. 
This must be done up to the neck, and then down from the 
waist to the point. This plan gives a row of tacked marks 
all the required distance from each other, and just the 
width of the tape from the fitting-line, which is generally 
a very good length for holes to be used with ordinary 
small buttons, 
After marking and cutting, it is usual to over-cast the 
holes slightly before commencing to work in button-hole 
stitch ; if the material is one likely to fray, running twice 
round (the needle taking up in the second round all the 
spaces it missed in the first) is often substituted ; with very 
loose materials back-stitching may be used in place of both 
running and stranding (see page 112). Either running or 
stitching must be done before the holes are cut, or the 
needle will break out the edges. It is best to mark for the 
sewing-on of the buttons from the holes themselves ; after 
the latter are worked the two fronts should be very carefully 
pinned together, fitting-line to fitting-line, the waist-line, 
ends of points, and neck-curves matched, and (the left fore- 
finger feeling the end of each hole as the marking is done) the 
place for each button marked by a stitch in coloured cotton 
on the left front. The actual sewing-on of the buttons, 
however, should be left to the last, as if they are sewn on 
before the collar they are very much in the way ; but it is 
easier to mark for themi before the collar goes on than later ; 
the stitch-marks remain as long as they are needed.
-P-A-G-E-52

The sleeves should be finished at the wrist end, and the 
cuffs (if they are required) set on, before the sleeves are put 
in. Indeed, at this stage of the work it is necessary to 
consider carefully what had better be done next ; it is very 
desirable that each separate part should be finished as far as 
possible before all are joined together, as the work is kept 
fresher and is easier to handle. The turnings should be 
narrowed off, and the wrist turned by the fitting-line of the 
under sleeve over a folded cross-strip of muslin, just as the 
bottom edge of the bodice is turned, and tacked down. It 
is then finished by a shaped piece of silk or a ribbon being 
hemmed neatly over the turnings and to the lining. 
The sleeve is held inside out whilst facing-up, and the 
work should be held flat at the wrist end—not turned over 
the hand—whilst the silk is being hemmed in, or it will be 
full and puffy against the arm when in wear. The upper 
edge of the facing, which is to be sewn to the lining of the 
sleeve only, should be slightly eased on, thus allowing the 
sleeves to sit better to the arm; it should be shaped from 
a strip on the cross if possible, and the joins made to lie 
in the under sleeve. 
A plain cuff should be made in much the same way 
as a collar, using one thickness of muslin in place of the 
buckram. The lower parts of the sleeve pattern should be 
laid together by the inside seam and the pattern cut by it, 
care being taken to increase the width that it may easily 
go over the end of the sleeve. The pattern thus places 
the seam of the cuff at the back seam of the sleeve, 
which is the least conspicuous place for a perfectly plain 
cuff, The silk and muslin are joined apart, and the seams 
pressed and surplus turnings cut away; the edges of the 
silk are then turned over and herring-boned down to the 
muslin at both top and bottom, a sarcenet lining hemmed 
in, and the whole finished cuff slipped up the finished 
sleeve-end, the lower edge being firmly slip-stitched into 
place. If the upper edge is to be slip-stitched down too,
-P-A-G-E-53
40 Tue Evemenrs or Moparn Dressmaxine. 
the carcenet lining may be omitted; otherwise it is necessary. 
Perfectly plain cuffs, unless of very rich material, are seldom 
used ; they look poor unless finished with cord, trimming 
of some sort, pipings, or a narrow fold set under the edges. 
This gives a perfectly plain sleeve-finish, but at times the 
fashion of ornamenting the end of the sleeve, instead of using 
a cuff, comes into vogue. Buttons and button-holes, hooks 
and eyes, and fancy lacings are all used, and buttons with 
loops of cord or worked loops of silk are also liked for 
close wrists. For buttons and button-holes, or hooks and 
eyes, the sleeve seams are arranged exactly as front edges 
would ‘be for similar fastenings, with the necessary turns 
and wraps; edge-bones, however, being omitted. If the 
fastenings are at the lower end of the inner seam, it is an 
advantage to straighten the fitting-line instead of turning the 
edge to the inward curve, and the extra size put into the 
sleeve can be taken out at the back seam by straightening 
off the curve there also. With hooks and small loops, or 
buttons and large loops, the wrap may be omitted and the 
loops worked quite on the edge of the fold; with loops of 
woven cord, the cord is carried round the wrist as well as up 
the opening, where it is finished off inside. The cord is 
sewn on by overcasting it to the edge of the sleeve ; it must 
be, held “easy,” and not allowed to twist, and it will when 
sewn roll into place and hide the stitching-on. 
The ends of the sleeves are sometimes cut a few inches 
longer than necessary, lined with the trimming silk or velvet 
used on other parts of the dress, and turned over as a cuff, 
either the inner or outer seam being left open to allow it to 
lie easily. This lining-up should be done in exactly the same 
way as described for bell-sleeves, taking care the facing is 
very easy in the length to allow smooth turning-out, and 
snipping the sleeve-turnings across quite close to the fitting- 
line, and turning the cuff up into position before the inner 
edge of the facing is hemmed on, for the same reason. 
Where the sleeve is ornamented with several rows of fine
-P-A-G-E-54

braid round the wrist instead of a cuff, it is usual to join and 
finish the inner seam only, cross back the wrist with a shaped 
piece of stiff muslin loosely tacked on, and machine on all 
the braid before closing the back seam and finishing the 
wrist. It is much the neatest and safest plan, as braid frays 
very rapidly, and is not easily joined to look well on the out- 
side, but it looks very ugly if the braids do not exactly meet 
at the back seam when the latter is closed. 
A plain coat-sleeve differs from the present bodice-sleeve in 
three respects : it is less curved at the inner seam, is cut to 
fit loosely, and upper and under are the same width. Being 
loose-fitting, it does not require such very special provision 
for elbow-room as the close bodice-sleeve ; a slight curve in 
the back seam gives all that is needed without gathering. 
Such sleeves, when in vogue, are often joined up with the 
turnings of the seams to fall between stuff and lining of the 
under sleeve in the same manner as explained for gored skirts 
(Chap. VIL), and this method of joining has also distinct 
advantages for quick work on open-wristed or bell sleeves, 
where flat seams made through would be very unsightly. 
Any of the methods given for skirt seams may be adopted, 
according to the class of work on the bodice. ‘The wrist end 
finishing of an open sleeve must be fine and regular, as it is a 
part that catches the eye. The edges should be finished by 
turning them over and herring-boning. down, and then finely 
slip-stitching a carefully prepared shaped facing of either the 
outside material or the trimming silk to it. If piped cording 
is used, it should be tacked round before the facing is put in, 
in which case the three (sleeve, piping, and lining) may be 
stitched through on the wrong side, pressed, and the facing 
turned over and hemmed up against the lining of the sleeve, 
as the bottom edge of a skirt is finished, though the first 
method gives the flattest and firmest finish. The facing 
should reach up to the elbow, and the seam, if seams are 
needed, should be made where it will show the least ; at the 
inside seam is in this case the least conspicuous place. When
-P-A-G-E-55
42 Tue Evemenrs or Moperw DreEssmaxine. 
the fashion of loose lace or net sleeves worn inside the outer 
dress sleeve prevails, the inside finishing of the latter is not 
so elaborate, a shaped hem of the stuff two or three inches 
deep being used, but a quilling or frill of lace or silk is sewn 
in above it to make an effective finish. Such sleeves, if not 
corded, are bound or more or less elaborately trimmed with 
folds, frills, etc.: a quite plain end would be unsatisfactory 
to the eye. 
After trying on and correcting, the turnings of arm-holes 
and sleeves, should be pared down to a scanty half-inch 
beyond the fitting-line; with broad turnings the worker seems 
to be easing-in more than is actually the case, and great 
disappointment is felt when the sleeve-heads, owing to 
this error, come out poor and contracted. Paring down 
the turnings prevents this. If the sleeves are to be corded- 
in, the cording is tacked to the arm-holes. 
To set in the sleeve, the fitting-line of the sleeve-head should 
be finely drawn up on a drawing-thread to make sleeve 
arm-hole and bodice arm-hole the same size, the thread wound 
tound a pin to keep it firm, and the gathers spread evenly 
into place. The inside seam should be put to the inset mark, 
with the turnings opened or pressed down into the under 
_ Sleeve. The sleeve must be held next to the worker and 
the bodice away from her, and the under sleeve eased round 
to the fitting-lines of the arm-hole as far as the back sleeve 
seam, the turnings of which should also be laid into the 
under sleeve if they are not pressed open. It is now 
necessary to return to the inset and to begin to set-in, 
graduating the fulness of the sleeve-head and easing it to the 
arm-hole as high as the fulness mark (opposite the front of 
the neck-curve, see Plate), and gathering the surplus fulness 
between this and the back fulness mark a little (about half an 
inch) below the shoulder seam, slightly easing it down to 
the back sleeve seam as well, if it is quite a plain sleeve. 
The gathering should be very gently graduated from the 
inset upwards, and again to the back sleeve seam downwards,
-P-A-G-E-56
Bovice Maxine. 43 
most of it being set between the fulness marks. The head 
of the sleeve should be at least two to three inches larger 
than the space it is to fill in the arm-hole, to allow for this 
fulling. Close-fitting linings of full sleeves must be set-in to 
the armi-hole in the same way, after the outside fabric has 
been gathered and fixed to the fitting-lines, or a sense of 
constraint will be felt and the lining will soon tear away at 
the front of the arm. 
The back seam of a close-fitting bodice sleeve with 
narrow under-sides generally falls about half-way between 
the curved back seam of the bodice and the seam below it; 
its exact position varies slightly according to the cut em- 
ployed, but care should be taken with the second sleeve to 
exactly match the position of the back seam as well as of the 
inside one. The two seams should be pinned into place, 
and the setting-in of the second sleeve completed. Tacking 
is not strong enough to hold sleeves well in place for machin- 
ing-in ; they should be run in with cotton or silk the same 
colour as the dress, the tacking-threads removed, and the 
sleeves carefully machined-in, keeping the arm-holes curved 
whilst the machining is being done. If the machinist 
can keep a length of galloon or Paris binding outside the 
seam whilst she is machining, and stitch through one edge 
of it, the other edge can be closely overcast with the turn- 
ings, which will make the arm-holes flat and well-finished ; 
or after the sleeves are machined-in, the binding can be 
hemmed at one edge to the stitching, and the other edge 
overcast with the turnings in the same way. Plain sleeves 
are best back-stitched in by hand, not machined-in, The 
turnings are naturally pushed into the arm-holes by the 
action of putting on the bodice; if turned under the 
shoulder, instead of into the sleeves, they cause the latter 
to lie close to the arm, and to look as if they had been 
insufficiently eased into the arm-holes. 
Setting on the collar follows. The fitting-lines of the 
neck should be pinned together from the back seam, and

the turnings trimmed down to a quarter of an inch in 
depth (this should not be done before the dress is quite 
ready for the collar, as the neck is particularly apt to 
stretch during the making). The bottom edge of the 
collar is then laid just over the fitting-line, and pinned on, 
beginning with the middle of the collar and the centre back 
seam of.the dress, and working forward on each half. The 
right side of the dress and the right side of the collar should 
both be uppermost, and the collar towards the worker, 
that it may in a sense be eased on by the work being held 
slightly over the hand whilst the pins are set in. 
The collar should be slightly larger than the bodice, and 
the latter slightly strained at the turn of the neck (see 2 to 2 
on Fig. 1, page 11); but at this point also the greatest care 
should be taken not to set the collar on in a straight line and 
let the curve of the neck go up inside it, as bad workers 
have a tendency to do. It produces a very annoying misfit, 
; making the bodice rise against the collar at front and back 
as if the dress were too long at those parts, whereas the 
fault is that the neck curve has been turned into a square in 
the setting-on of the collar, The collar ends should just 
come to the front fitting-line, and they should be carefully 
fixed to meet exactly when finished. Setting the extreme 
ends a very little below the neck-curve lines instead of upon 
them must be guarded against. ‘The bottom of the collar ends 
should make a nearly straight line across the front of the 
neck if the upper patt is to sit well; but they are inclined 
to push downwards in. the handling, and the very slightest 
peaking will cause the top ends to overlap. 
After the collar has been pinned on from the outside it 
should be back-stitched firmly on from the inside, the 
stitches being taken through the fitting-line, and only 
through the bodice and the material turned over the 
collar—not through the buckram. The stitches should 
not be large nor tightly drawn up, and the line of sew- 
ing should be absolutely even, or it will show by little
-P-A-G-E-58
Bonice Maxine. 45 
puckerings on the bodice below the collar. The turnings 
should then be snipped a little to free the neck from 
the strain, and the silk lining hemmed down over the 
sewing to make all neat, keeping the depth easy that it 
may not lift the dress against the collar when it comes 
into wear, 
All edges, fronts, arm-holes, neck, etc., should now be 
lightly pressed from the inside; the bones put in and 
fastened into place, and the bottom edge bindings finally 
hemmed up. 
The belt is finished either with hooks and eyes or with a 
buckle. If the former, a hem about an inch deep is turned 
at the left-hand end, two eyes being sewn on the outside 
of this hem. From the eyes the length of the belt is 
measured and turned over with a half-inch hem, on the 
under-side of which two hooks, to correspond with the eyes, 
are placed. If a buckle is used, it is sewn to the left- 
hand end of the belt, which is left about three-quarters of a 
yard long, and the right-hand end neatly mitred to pass 
easily through the buckle. ‘The belt is secured to the turn- 
ings only of the three back seams—the bottom of the band 
being to the waist-line—by rows of small cross-stitching, 
herring-boning, or by one large cross-stitch to each seam ; 
the latter is sometimes prettily done in narrow china ribbon, 
a very coarse needle being used to carry it and pierce the 
belt and turnings. When unstiffened collars were worn, 
hangers were put from shoulder-seam to shoulder-seam, just 
below the collar; but this would crack the buckram of 
stiffened collars, and the practice of putting two hangers, 
one at each shoulder-end, or one at the top of each curved 
seam, has taken its place. 
Preservers should be tacked lightly to the turnings at 
each end, and also by the rounded part of each half; one 
half should be in the sleeve and one in the bodice itself, 
the rubber being against the lining, that the silk, wash- 
leather, or flannel with which the preserver is covered may

come against the body of the wearer and so prevent chill. 
Thin washable preservers may be made of a single thickness 
of wash-leather, bound with china ribbon, and tacked into 
- the bodice in the usual way. The Kleinert dress shields are 
likely to give much satisfaction and comfort to those who 
habitually use preservers, as they do not chili in wear, and 
wash well, neither hardening nor shrinking in the process. 
‘The watch-pocket was at one time an ornamental out- 
side pocket, made of the dress-trimming exactly as a cuff 
would be made, and slip-stitched against the dress just 
‘below the waist. Later, when wearers had tired of the out- 
side pocket, a tiny bag-pocket of silk was used, and dress- 
makers took advantage of the little seam across the waist 
and used it to give turnings for the sewing-in of the pocket. 
At the present time a tiny bag-pocket is hemmed to the 
inside of the right-hand front, just at the bust ; the mouth of 
the pocket is slanted off, and the pocket is sewn in on the 
slant to hold the watch securely. ‘Tiny wash-leather bags, 
such as jewellers use for watches, make excellent watch- 
pockets ; they save scratching and tarnishing, if bound 
with china ribbon are not bulky, and both look and 
wear well. 
Buttons should be sewn on last of all. The sewing-on 
should all be done from the outside of the bodice, through - 
the marks already made from the button-holes, the needle 
taking up a very small piece of the bodice and linen or 
ribbon below it; the silk or sarcenet facing should be 
folded back, that the stitches may not go through. The 
stitches should be as small as possible, not to draw up the 
length or width of the bodice, and each button should be 
stemmed and the fastening-off done in the stemming. Flat 
buttons withstwo or more holes must be sewn on with the 
twist used for the button-holes, and can be sewn on from 
the outside as easily as any other button. Silk, cotton, or 
waxed thread, as preferred, may be used for sewing on any 
other kind of buttons. After the buttons are sewn on, the
-P-A-G-E-60

inner edge of the silk facing is sewn down to cover the 
stitching. 
Light and delicate materials are finished inside with 
white sarcenet or silk for bindings, facings, bone-casings, etc., 
but with durable dark dresses black is used, or the finishings 
are matched to the outside material if possible. In any 
case, the inside finishings should harmonise with both linings 
and outside material in colour, contrasts being considered 
in very bad taste; and where neither can be matched 
and white is too delicate, a neutral tint should be chosen, 
and all the finishings should match, or a very patchy effect - 
results. It adds to the good appearance of the inside of 
the bodice to fan-stitch the bone-casings and cross-stitch 
in the belt with a pretty, bright silk instead of cotton ; 
bright blue or crimson for black or tweeds, gold for brown, 
etc., are distinctly effective.

Iz is an exceedingly difficult thing to say where the seams 
and joinings of the different parts of a bodice should fall 
upon the figure, fashion having more to do with it, unfor- 
tunately, than common-sense—at least so far as collar and 
sleeves go. When sloping shoulders ‘come in,” common- 
sense goes out. 
The natural position for the collar on the figure is just 
above the two little bones that will be found at the front 
of the neck, and low enough at the back not to be affected 
by the movements of the head in bending; this will place 
the line of setting-on just below the joint of head and spine. 
A collar set higher than this is very uncomfortable, and 
wrinkles always form below it. One inch and three-quarters 
at the front and two to two and a half inches at the back is 
the depth of plain collar the ordinary figure can wear with 
comfort. : 
The run of the arm-hole is controlled by the widths of 
the back and chest, the length of side and the slope of 
shoulder for ease and comfort, the seam where the sleeve 
is set in should certainly fall above the joint of arm and
-P-A-G-E-62
TRYING-ON, 49 
shoulder, and from it come down at both back and front, 
curving slightly inwards, to miss the bands of muscle that 
make “hinges” for the arm, and thence curve underneath, 
keeping close to the body and leaving the joints free, that 
all shoulder movements may be made inside the sleeve-head. 
The liking for narrow backs and wide chests has much 
to answer for in the matter of uncomfortable sleeves, as 
bodices so cut draw the elbow too high and drop the inside 
seam, making it hang long and full of wrinkles, and the 
sleeve is blamed when the defect is with the bodice itself. 
The shoulder seams should turn the shoulder sufficiently 
to be quite out of view from the front of the figure ; it is a 
matter of personal taste or fashion to slope them more than 
this. All back seams and curves should slant down towards 
the centre of the back, and front ones (as darts) towards the 
centre of the front. Such slanting seams add to the ap- 
parent length of the body and give an appearance of 
breadth above and slenderness below which is essentially 
becoming to the figure. To assist this effect the waist 
should be kept as low as the shape will permit, and all the 
picces of the bodice should be shaped to cling to it; good 
cutting gives to the figure a much prettier shape than tight- 
lacing does, for what is displaced at one part goes to make 
bulk at another; and the figure below a tightened waist is 
more prominent than is quite pleasing to the eye. 
Vertical seams make the figure look equally thick at all 
parts, and detract considerably from its grace even if it is 
well-proportioned. The careful fitter will remember these 
details, and will give “run of seams” as much attention as 
wrinkling or defective width or length. 
Wrinkles are of two kinds: those that are made by the 
straining apart of the bodice seams owing to the length of 
the tacking stitches, and which consequently will disappear 
when the bodice is machined, and those that come from 
some defect in the fitting of the bodice itself. 
Wrinkles or creases of the former kind generally form 
E

50 THe Exemenrs or Movern DRESSMAKING. 
straight across each piece and can be followed to the tacking 
threads ; they will almost entirely disappear if the seam is 
held tightly and strained from both ends. If carefully 
observed, such wrinkles will be found to be pointed at both 
ends, whilst those arising from defects in fit are pointed at 
one end and blunt at the other, the blunt end indicating the 
fault. The best way of dealing with these is to open the 
seam and smooth the two sides together, pinning them as 
they lie, when the extent and nature of the misfit will show 
itself. Before doing this, however, it would be wise to look 
and see if wide turnings are not the sole cause of the trouble, 
as excessive width or length chiefly causes wrinkles where 
carefully drafted patterns have been used to cut from. Bad 
or unequal joining—such as not making the waist-line run, 
or straining one side and fulling the other—is the most 
usual cause of the more troublesome wrinkles appearing, 
but occasionally they are caused by some peculiarity or dis- 
Proportion. in the figure being fitted, and should be dealt 
with as explained on page 62. 
Lor the first trying-on it is advisable to have the bodice 
wrong side out, as it is hardly possible to gauge the degree of 
looseness if all the turnings are inside. When this has been 
ascertained, it is best to turn it right side out and try it on 
that way also, to make sure the stuff is sufficiently strained 
out to sit smoothly and is free from wrinkles, slips in this 
direction being easier to remedy now than later on. The 
same rules for trying-on apply to the sleeves. 
With full or fancy bodices, that would be crushed by 
trying-on wrong side out, the looseness must be very care- 
fully gauged from the right side ; great care should then be 
taken that the bodice is not filled up with wide turnings 
and that they lie as flat as possible inside it. 
The first step is to pin the front fitting-lines together at 
the neck, joining the neck curves exactly and pinning down 
to the bust, then to lift the bodice up a little at the front 
and pull it well down to the waist behind, or it will seem
-P-A-G-E-64
TRYING-ON. 51 
too long in the front and too short in the back when the 
fronts are brought together ; finally to close the front fitting- 
lines from the bust downward, once or twice lifting the 
bodice to the neck and putting the hand inside and gently 
pushing up the bust that it may not be pressed downward, 
but may fall into the part of the dress designed for it, When 
this is done the fitting of the outlines should be carefully 
gone over in order. It should first be noticed if the waist 
is in line and if the back neck curve is right (neither too 
high nor too low); if the width of the back seems suitable 
to the figure; if the side is the right length, setting well 
down to the waist and high enough under the arm; if the 
curved side-piece sits smoothly and close to the figure at 
waist and arm-hole. The tacking-lines should be taken as 
the guide in these details, not the edges of the turnings, as 
if the latter are broad they will make the dress appear large 
when it really is not so inside the fitting-lines. It is well to 
note if the waist keeps low enough round to the side and 
towards the front, as it is at the two straight seams at each 
side of the straight side-piece that the bad tracing referred 
to (page 7) now shows itself, making the waist of the dress 
short at the sides and much slacker than is required, and it 
often happens, if the waist is too slack in this way, that the 
bodice in the trying-on appears much too tight round the 
hips. Except for middle-aged full figures, however, 
reducing the waist will often give all the hip-room needed ; 
but when the cause and remedy are both so obscure the 
defect is a very worrying one. 
The length of the front down the centre, from the highest 
point of shoulder down over the bust, and at the side between 
the back dart and first seam, should be noted, also the fit 
from the arm-hole upwards over the shoulder, the line of 
the front neck curve, and the width of the chest; a little 
pull at the turnings of the seams under the arms will show 
if the bust and waist are too slack. It must be ascertained 
whether the slackness is due to poor tacking together, as, if
-P-A-G-E-65

the stitches are large and loose, they let the pieces pull apart, 
and the bodice appears Jooser than it really is. With good 
tacking together it should be just slightly slack, as the ma- 
chining tightens it a little. 
The sleeve—also inside out—should be slipped up the 
arm, the inner seam pinned to the inset mark, and the elbow 
drawn into its proper place. The under sleeve is then 
smoothed up under the arm, the turnings turned over and 
length underneath ascertained, and the back seam pinned 
to the fitting-lines of the back to test its length ; finally the 
head of the sleeve is drawn up to see that it will come well 
up to the fitting-lines on the shoulder, and that there is a 
little surplus fulness for gathering and easing. If the outside 
of the collar has been prepared, it also may be tried on, 
the front ends simply tacked into place ; the whole collar can 
then be pressed: down against the dress with the hand to see 
if it comes easily to the fitting-lines. 
With figures that are obviously a little different at one 
side from the other, the trying-on should be done right side 
out, or the alterations will be made on the wrong half of the 
bodice. With such figures the prominence on one side is 
always accompanied by a corresponding depression on the 
other, and the considerate fitter prefers to fill up the hollow 
with cotton-wool, and so render the difference less conspicu- 
ous, rather than tighten one half of the bodice and loosen 
the other, which accentuates painfully all that a judicious and 
kindly worker would naturally endeavour to conceal. 
Experienced workers, who can trust their patterns and 
their knowledge of the figure they are fitting, frequently 
dispense with the first fitting-on altogether. They prepare 
the front edges and make the fastenings, machine and neaten 
all seams but the shoulder seams and one under each arm 
(which are to be left for alteration) ; these are tacked firmly 
together with the turnings outside the bodice instead of inside, 
and all the necessary alterations made upon them. ‘There 
is much to be said in favour of this plan: it keeps the
-P-A-G-E-66
TRYING-ON. 53 
bodice fresher and less handled, and the fit can be very 
closely controlled by the outside turnings. In an ordinary 
way the seams indicated give sufficient margin for half-inch 
alterations; but the method is too severe a test for in- 
experienced workers, especially when they may be dealing 
with figures a little out of the ordinary run, and good turnings 
should be left at neck and shoulders and at the alteration 
seams in all cases where the bodice is the first one cut from 
an untested drafting, or an untested set of measures. 
It is an excellent plan to follow where only one oppor- 
tunity of fitting-on can be relied upon (as with customers 
who live at a distance), and is much used by dressmakers in 
market towns, who prepare the bodice so far and also 
machine-up the inside seam of the sleeve and try on with 
one sleeve tacked into the arm-hole and the collar tacked 
on as well. In an ordinary case, two or even three tryings- 
on are considered necessary. It is well to remember, how- 
ever, that the rule for trying-on and alteration is “seldom and 
little,” and that more misfits are due to too much alteration 
than to any other cause whatever. 
Seams running awry.—Seams running awry in a bodice 
otherwise apparently well-fitting is a very annoying defect, 
which it is often extremely difficult to trace to its real 
cause. It may arise in the first instance from careless 
cutting out, the way of the thread in the lining or material 
of the two backs or the two fronts not running alike. This 
is particularly likely to occur when the pieces are cut singly 
and have had to be carefully contrived out of the material. 
Again, it may be due to unequally stretching the outside 
material in tacking-out, or unequal joining of the seam, one 
side being fulled, the other strained. If due to unequal easing, 
it is more likely to arise from the backs being badly joined 
to the curved side-pieces than to bad joining of the 
centre back seam. Machining one half (either bodice or 
skirt) from the bottom up and the other half from the 
top down may lead to the same defect (this is particularly
-P-A-G-E-67
$4 Tue Erements or Monern DRESSMAKING. 
noticeable with skirt seams), and, as a matter of course, 
careless machining may take in or Jet out the seams 
unequally, and make one half of the bodice quite different 
from the other. 
Unless the lengths of the side seams from the waist 
up to the arm-hole have been perfectly balanced, twisting 
may be caused by joining some pieces from the waist-line 
upwards and others from the arm-hole downwards. Joining 
the neck curves unequally is also a fruitful cause of seams 
running awry. 
The inside seams of sleeves will twist into view if the 
sleeve is not properly joined and the elbow formed, or 
if the length of the seam is too short either above or 
below the inside bend of the arm, or if the seam itself 
is too curved for the arm, or if the deepest part of the 
curve is in the wrong position (either above or below 
the inside bend of the arm instead of upon it), and of 
course if the inside seam is not set in at its proper place 
in the arm-hole it will come into sight; but that would 
be caused by incorrect joining of bodice and sleeve rather 
than by a defect in either, and would only occur if the 
joining points were lost. Skirt seams running awry are 
dealt with on page 151. 
Errors or Lencta.— Bodice foo long-waisted or too short- 
waisted.—lIf the bodice is too long-waisted or too short- 
waisted it should be altered at the shoulders, letting down or 
taking up as may be required, having first ascertained that 
the run of the waist-line is correct. This alteration affects 
the length of side, height of shoulders, and position of neck- 
curves. 
Alterations of length should not be made until the run 
of the waist-line is absolutely correct. The run of the waist- 
line differs with each figure, and controls and is controlled 
py the balance of the garment on the body; with the pre- 
vailing fashions it is a detail of extreme importance to the 
fitter, and must receive her first attention. If the bodice ap-
-P-A-G-E-68
TRYING-ON. 55 
pears too long-waisted it should be drawn up into place and 
the run of the waist-line noted. If it is in place all round 
the waist the alterations can be made at the shoulders (as- 
suming, of course, that the side length is correct) ; but if the 
waist-line runs short at either of the straight side-seams it is a 
matter of defective length balance, and must be remedied by 
opening the faulty seam and allowing the side that appears 
most pulled up to drop below the other ; re-pinning the seam 
as the two sides lie smoothly together. With a short-waisted 
bodice the same method should be followed. The shoulder- 
seams should be opened, the bodice drawn down into place, 
and the run of the waist-line examined; if correct, the 
alterations can be made at the shoulders; otherwise the 
defective seam should be opened, the slope of the waist-line 
altered, and the seam re-joined by the corrected points (see 
page 22). 
The waist-line (defective back balance). —If the back waist- 
line of the bodice is out of place—ze,, if the bodice back is 
too long-waisted or too short-waisted—it should be corrected 
by altering the slope of the waist-line on the straight side- 
piece, raising or lowering it as may be needed, and passing 
the back section (backs and curved side-pieces) up or down 
upon it; joining the original waistline of the curved side- 
piece (slanted side) to the altered waist-line of the straight 
side-piece, and re-marking the arm-hole curve at the right 
depth, using the turnings at the arm-hole to do this. Back 
sections often appear a little short-waisted, owing to de- 
fective Jength-balance, not to a faulty length measurement 
(see neck-lines). 
The neck-lines.—The fitter should make sure that the waist- 
line is well in place before attempting to make length altera- 
tions, particularly before altering the neck-curves. Cutting 
down enlarges the curves, making the neck of the bodice too 
loose for smooth fitting; before altering, it is advisable to 
make sure the waist-line is in its right place, as lowering the 
waist may also lower the neck-curve into correct position
-P-A-G-E-69
56 0 Twe Evemenrs or Mopern Dress axine, 
without other alteration. If, however, the neck-lines are out 
of place, they should be altered by lowering or raising, 
- taking care not to increase the size or alter the position 
of the curves. (See paragraphs below.) 
In any case the front neck-curve should not be cut 
down unless the front length is distinctly too long. If the 
back neck-line lies too high on the figure, it pulls the 
front neck-point upwards, making it appear. too high 
also; but if the line at the back is corrected, and the 
shoulder-seams are rejoined, it will often be found that 
the front neck-curve lies smoothly and does not need 
alteration. 
Back neck-curve too high.—Back length too long above side- 
4ine.—-If the back waistline is in place and the back neck- 
line is too low or too high, the neck-line should be raised 
or lowered to the right position—taking care not to enlarge 
the curve—and the shoulder-line ruled again. In dealing 
with any error in the back length, the side length and 
shoulder slope must be taken into account, and altered to 
correspond if necessary. 
Front neck-curve too high.—Front length too long or too 
short above side-line.—If the front waist-line is in place and 
the front neck-curve is too low or too high, it should be 
altered as at back, taking care not to enlarge the curve. 
Alterations in the front length affect the length of the 
shoulder, the hollow of the arm-hole, and the run of the 
front edge, and possibly the side where the arm-hole curves 
to meet it, 
Errors tn the side length and shoulder slope.—Side too long. 
—If the bodice wrinkles across and sinks in just under the 
arms, the fault is due to the side being too long, and it must 
be remedied by cutting down, lowering the arm-hole curve 
from the chest to a point a couple of inches above the side- 
line at the back. 
Side too short.—If the waist sets well in place and the 
tacking-line of the arm-hole appears too low down (does not
-P-A-G-E-70
TRYING-ON. 57 
rise high enough under the arm), we may be fairly sure that 
the side is too short and needs raising into the under-arm 
turnings, the alteration curving from the chest to a point 
opposite to it on the back of arm-hole. 
Shoulder slope incorrect—The slope of the shoulders and 
length of side bear upon each other. Before altering, it is 
as well to note whether the side itself is too long or too short, 
or only the slope of shoulders incorrect. If there is too 
much slope on the shoulders (making the arm-hole too 
small) the waist-line is lifted out of place, and the neck-line 
pushes up far too high. Letting off the shoulder ends will 
remedy this by allowing the waist to sink into place, the 
fitter using the under-arm turnings to lengthen the side 
if the latter is left too short by the shoulder correction. If, 
on the other hand, the side is lowered or shortened, the 
shoulders may need taking up to fit the upper part of the 
bodice smoothly and closely. It is best, in making arm-hole 
alterations, to open the shoulder seams, and fold the bodice 
flat from centre of back; the alterations can then be more 
accurately marked, transferred, and tacked. 
Errors or Wiptu.—Bust too large or too small.—Tf the 
bodice is too tight or too slack it should be taken in or let 
cut equally (not to destroy the proportion of the pieces) at 
the second. straight seam under each arm (the one between 
the curved side-piece and the straight side-piece). In 
dealing with any errors of width, the back width and the 
chest width must be taken into consideration and altered if 
necessary. 
Back width too narrow.—lf the back is too narrow, the 
width should be increased the required amount into the 
arm-hole turnings, and the shoulder lengthened to agree, 
The front shoulder must be lengthened to correspond. 
Back width too wide.—If the back is too wide it should 
be marked narrower and the arm-hole re-curved inside the 
original fitting-lines ; the shoulder-line re-ruled, correcting 
the slope if needed, Altering the back width affects all the

58 Zwve Eremewrs or Movexn DressmakiNe. 
back of the arm-hole, also the shoulder-slope, and the point 
where the back curved seam comes into the arm-hole. 
Chest too narrow.—If the chest is too narrow, the re- 
quired amount should be marked out: into the arm-hole 
turnings, and the front of arm-hole re-curved from the 
shoulder end to the first under-arm seam; and the inset 
re-marked on the altered curve. Alterations in the width 
of the chest do not affect the shoulder length. If the figure 
is one with a full chest, the correction at the arm-hole may 
not be effective, the alteration may be required as a curve at 
the front edge for ease and comfort. 
Chest too wide—lf the chest is too wide, it should be 
narrowed the required amount at the arm-hole, and the 
inset remarked in the right place. Any alterations on 
shoulders, back width, or chest, make the arm-hole larger 
or smaller, affect the position of inset, and possibly the 
length of the shoulder-line. 
Wrinkles down front of shoulder.—If slanting wrinkles 
appear down the front shoulder the bodice may be too short 
from neck point to inset, in which case (if the side length is 
correct) it will only need letting off in the length a little; 
or the neck curve may be a little too far back and may 
need moving forward. In the latter case, in addition to the 
wrinkles, the bodice will feel tight at the front of the neck. 
Letting out the neck front a little, and re-joining the front 
neck point half an inch down the back shoulder-line, 
filling it up to the original back neck-curve, is the remedy 
here. 
Looseness at inset.—This is due to the natural form of 
the figure at this part, and is accepted as a standing difficulty; 
the usual practice is to gather or pleat the lining at the inset 
curve, and draw the stuff smoothly aczoss it, smoothing it 
out at the first seam or into the dart. (See next paragraph.) 
Slanting wrinkles on side front.—tIf slanting wrinkles 
appear on the side front, the waist-line there (controlled by 
the centre-point measure) may be too low, or the back dart
-P-A-G-E-72
TRYING-ON. 59 
is too small for the figure ; the first seam should be opened, 
and the lines smoothed together; if the centre-point measure 
is too long, the waist-line on the side front will drop below 
the one on the straight side-piece, the hip-spring must then 
be re-curved, and the arm-hole filled up. If the waist-lines 
fall together again the measure is correct, and the wrinkles 
should be smoothed away into the back dart. As this 
draws the arm-hole curve down, the front will need filling up 
a little at the inset curve. If the figure is one hollow down 
the side, a cross-cut pattern should be used in preference to 
a straight-cut one. 
The sleeve-—The inside seam of the sleeve should 
be set in at the turn of the arm-hole curve on the front, 
about an inch above the lowest part of the arm-hole. 
As the position of the inside seam is not subject to 
change of place, it is a more reliable joining-point than 
the back seam, but where it is preferred to rely upon the 
latter it should be set into that part of the curved side- 
piece which comes into the arm-hole, half-way between the 
curved back seam and the one below it. 
If the sleeves are too tight or too loose, all alterations 
should be made at the back seams; they will then only 
affect the fitting-lines of sleeve-head and hollow, which 
can easily be made to run again, The same rule applies 
if the letting-out or taking-in has to be done adove the 
elbow only or defow the elbow only. If slanting wrinkles 
appear across the lower part of the sleeve, accompanied by 
a feeling of constraint and discomfort across the arm, it 
will generally be found that the sleeve has not been joined 
correctly, or that the elbow has not been made to lie, and 
that there is consequently insufficient elbow-room in it. 
Where the workmanship is correct a figure alteration is 
indicated. 
Straining and pulling across at the top of the inside 
seam may arise from quite a number of causes. The 
back of the dress may be too narrow and may be pulling
-P-A-G-E-73
60 we Examents or Movern DRESSMAKING. 
the elbow higher than its proper position on the arm, or 
the elbow may be too short, or the hollow of the under 
sleeve may be too much curved out. Again, the fault 
may be with the inner seam itself, which may he too 
straight for the arm from the inside bend upwards. Some- 
times it is caused by the head of the sleeve not being 
cut high enough or sufficiently rounded to reach up to 
the shoulder easily, or not wide enough just across the 
thickest part of the arm (a very common cause of straining 
across when plain coat-sleeves are worn, and both the back 
and chest of the dress are liked narrow), or by the sleeve- 
head not being well eased to the bodice at the front of the 
arm-hole from the inset upwards. In addition to this list 
of possible causes, the fault may be in the arm-hole of 
the bodice itself, which may be insufficiently hollowed just 
at the inret, or too much hollowed at the top of the curved 
side-piece. The fitter must trace the cause first; the 
necessary remedy will then present itself: widening the 
back and using the sleeve turnings to lower the elbow, 
or altering the position of the latter at the back seam, 
may serve, using the turnings at the top of the under 
sleeve to fill up the hollow if too much curved there, 
or the turnings of the head to give more round and 
height, jetting out the top of the inside seam only, and 
running the lines back to the back seam and up to the 
head if the inside seam is too straight. 
If the elbow only is too long or too short, the easiest 
remedy is to take up or let down at the top of the back 
seam, recurving head and hollow to meet the inset of the 
inside seam. Where this alteration does not correct the fault 
the elbow-gathering may be moved to the extent of half an 
inch up or down the back seam. 
Taking-up or letting-down affects the length and width 
of the sleeve on the arm. 
Neck and collar.—Defects in collar and dress-neck are 
so closely connected that it is difficult to dissociate them.
-P-A-G-E-74
Trvine-on. * 61 
Some of the defects produced by setting-on the collar 
badly have been referred to on page 44; but where the 
neck curve itself is too high, either all the way round 
or at the back only, the most careful setting-on will not 
prevent wrinkling just under the collar. In all cases where 
the neck-line seems too high, or the shape of the curve 
defective, the best and most practical way of dealing with 
the difficulty is to put the collar round the wearer’s neck, 
pin the ends of it together and press it down on the bodice, 
chalking a new fitting-line just below it and setting the 
collar on by this instead of by the imperfect neck-line. 
This should only be done, however, after the neck curves 
have been carefully examined and dealt with as explained 
on page 55. 
If, on the contrary, the neck is too low all the way 
round, an ordinary collar will not fit at all, but will appear 
too small at the lower edge, though large enough at the 
upper one. The best remedy (if there are no available 
turnings to utilise) is to cut a new collar, deeper and much 
more curved than the old one, and which will consequently 
set lower without being looser at the top edge. If the 
dress is too low at the back only, the new collar may be 
cut more curved and deeper at the back only, and must 
be set on rather “easy” across the back of the bodice, 
or the wearer feels as if the head is being dragged forward, 
Where the dress is really too low at the back and right 
at the front, the ordinary collar will press against the front 
of the throat, which in turn will pull the bodice up behind 
and give a feeling of great discomfort. 
If the neck is either too large or too small for the 
wearer, it must be taken in or let out at the front edge 
or the shoulder seams, according to the cut (see page 56). 
If, however, the largeness is due either to a badly- 
formed neck curve or to stretching during the making, 
taking-in or letting-out will not remedy it; for the former 
the plan of finding a new fitting-line by putting the collar
-P-A-G-E-75
62 Tae Examents oF MODERN DRESSMAKING. 
round the neck and chalking below it, as already explained, 
is the best way of finding the required alteration. 
The stretching is more serious and difficult to remedy. 
The best plan is to draw the material gently between the 
fingers alternately the weft way and the warp way of the 
stuff, to endeavour as far as possible to replace the threads 
in their original positions ; if this will not serve, to take out 
a little dart at each side in the lining, just at the turn of the 
neck, and draw the stuff well up over it, fitting it away at 
the neck end of the shoulder seam. 
Some of the causes of the collar overlapping at the front 
ends have already been stated ; but it may also arise from 
the collar being too curved or too straight for the neck of 
the wearer, or the neck-line of the bodice, or from its being 
set on too high at the back for the front curve, or too low 
at the front for the back curve. 
Good workers strain the stuff up and press the lining 
down whilst setting the collar on, to guard against a slight 
fulness of the material showing under the edge after the 
sewing-on has been completed. Should such a fulness 
appear, it indicates that more smoothing-out of the material 
is necessary. 
Differences in figures.—In spite of careful measuring and 
all care in the subsequent processes, the bodice may not fit 
perfectly owing to the lines of the drafting not correspond- 
ing with those of the figure. 
The very upright figure with short back and full bust 
needs a drafting with rounded front edge, a narrow, slightly 
cross-cut side-front, and cross-cut back darts, and may 
need the alterations which are indicated by diagonal 
wrinkles (page 58) if the lines of the pattern are straight 
ones. 
The stooping figure with a slight bust, long and wide 
back, and short and narrow front, needs just the reverse. 
The fronts of the pattern must have small darts, and little 
or no front-edge shaping, whilst the back section must
-P-A-G-E-76
TRYING-ON. 63 
have deep shoulder-blade reduction at the arm-hole as well 
as at the waist of the curved seams. 
If at the curved seam the backs are cut half an inch 
longer than the curved side-pieces, and, from about two 
inches below the top of the seam, the extra length is eased 
in over a space of two to two and a half inches, the backs 
will lie close and easy, especially if, in addition, the back 
shoulder is cut half an inch longer than the front one, and 
is well eased on to it, the front one being strained as 
much as possible during the process, and any little excess 
let off at the arm-hole, and afterwards pared away. 
When plain bodices are in vogue, wadding is a great 
boon to those hollow-shouldered or spare-chested people 
who, without its use, have to choose between untidy and 
unsightly wrinkles down the front shoulders, or a bodice 
painfully tight across the chest from arm to arm. Such 
bodices are often well wadded round the arm-holes and 
down the front shoulder hollow, in preference to stretching- 
out and close fitting. Fashion is, however, usually kind 
enough to give the worker the choice of some kind of full 
front or trimming with which to meet this difficulty. 
The slight figure requires a bodice fitting high at the 
back of the neck, and with the front neck curve (at the turn 
of the neck) well hollowed out. The pattern should be one 
with small waist-reductions and darts and very slight front- 
edge shaping, or it will be too full at the bust. Good fitters 
usually give the fronts more curve than the figure actually 
requires, finding that it improves the appearance, and gives 
ease across the chest; such figures often have the “large 
shoulder.” 
Square-shouldered figures require less slant (or slope) on 
the shoulder-seams than slight ones, and may need these 
letting-off at the arm-hole ends only, whilst the front 
edge, not only because the bust is larger, but because 
the head is set further back on the shoulders, needs far 
more outward slope from neck to bust than that for the slight

64 Tae Evemenrs or Movarn DR&SSMAKING. 
figure, for which the smallest curve between neck and waist 
may suffice. 
All large, matronly figures, whether well or ill formed, 
have short sides and large shoulders, and generally have less 
hollow at the front of the waist than younger, slight figures. 
In trying-on, the fronts may wrinkle across between the darts 
and front edges, as if they are too long, unless they are 
_ either thrown out in the drafting or let out in the fitting for 
about half an inch all the way from the bust to the bottom 
of the bodice. This should be done, of course, without 
altering the shape of the edges, care being taken to preserve 
the run of the lines in every other respect. Such figures also 
require a large cross-seam or dart at the bust, in the lining 
only. Where the bust is inclined to spread away under thc 
arms, the chest of the bodice should be made as wide as 
the figure can carry, and the hollows wadded in such a way 
as to keep the bust as forward as possible; this is helped 
by carrying the bones in the side seams as high as comfort 
will permit. A “cross-cut” pattern is the one most suitable 
to this figure,

Buttons and button-holes are suitable for cottons and 
firm woollens, and are often used for silk, velvet, and other 
firm, rich stuffs, very handsome and costly buttons being 
often chosen in the latter case. For washing-dresses, buttons 
are not simply sewn on, as with those of other material, 
the method described on page 155 being usually adopted. 
Hooks and eyelets are used for full-fronted bodices of 
soft stuffs, whether woollen or silk, also occasionally on 
cotton, though hooks are unsuitable for any material that 
will require washing (see page 155). 
Hooks and eyes, edge to edge, are used for loosely-woven 
stuffs, such as cheviots, hopsacks, or open stuffs that fray 
easily, and are not safe to cut or pierce for button-holes 
or eyelets. (Occasionally the fashion prevails of fastening 
such materials with hooks and eyelets, and buttons are 
sewn down the edge of the right front to simulate a buttoned 
front, imitation button-holes of fine cord being also sewn 
on to make the illusion more complete.) Also for braided 
fronts, where invisible fastenings are required, as with braid- 
ing it is desirable that both sides of the front should meet 
exactly at the centreline of the figure; one front rising 
above the other, as buttoned fronts do, would spoil the 
general effect of the ornamentation. 
Hooks and made loops of silk or thread are used chiefly 
for collar, placket, etc., or where one portion of the dress 
fastens across another, as bodice fronts draped across from 
shoulder to hip, etc. They were at one time the standard 
fastening for silk dresses fastening at the back, as they were 
easier to close than hooks and eyes, but they have now 
fallen almost entirely out of use. 
Lacing is generally used for rich stuffs, such as silk, satin, 
brocade, etc., and also for evening dresses of any material. 
It is the favourite fastening for dresses closing at the back. 
Hooks and loops seem the only possible fastening for 
dresses of lace, grenadine, and all light, gauzy fabrics of the - 
kind, as it hardly seems safe to pierce them for eyelets or
-P-A-G-E-80

holes ; but loops pull back, and do not hold a close-fitting 
plain bodice well together. It is therefore usual to make 
eyelet-holes through the silk backing and lining only, turning 
the lace or grenadine under quite close to them and slip- 
stitching it down. Where this method cannot be adopted, 
loops or eyelet-holes should be used according to the style 
in which the bodice is made ; but wherever it is possible to 
do so, it is best to choose a full soft style and blind-fasten 
the linings firmly beneath, drawing the folds across and 
slightly securing them with the trimming, or an ornamental 
fastening of some kind, such as a bow, pair of clasps, etc. 
Where eyelet-holes are made in very thin, soft fabrics, or 
those inclined to fray, a small eye should be put behind 
each one and the overcasting worked over it; this 
strengthens the holes and prevents them tearing through. 
The arrangement of the front edges for buttons and 
button-holes is detailed on page 33. 
Button-holes for dress-bodices should be round at the 
end where the pull comes and square at the other ; they 
look most complete at the square end if it is finished with 
a little loop or bar worked across it. The loop should be 
free from the bodice and about five stitches long; the purl 
of the stitch should be drawn directly upwards from the 
work, not lying either towards the hole or away from it. 
Several varieties of button-hole stitch are given (page 110), 
any of which may be correctly used. The growing appre- 
ciation of tailor-made garments has created a strong feeling 
for button-holes with an open rounded end, such as tailors 
make ; and with the thicker materials worn during the time 
plain lined skirts have been in vogue, and with the small 
buttons, pear-shaped behind but flat on the face, which 
have been used during the period, they have been found 
necessary, and are now preferred even for buttons with 
long shanks. 
Tailors snip a triangular wedge from the end of the hole

which they keep at the edge, and work over, aiding the 
shaping materially ; but with soft dress stuffs this plan has its 
dangers, and the use of a punch to cut out clearly the scrap 
of hole has much to recommend it. Or a good round-ended 
button-hole of this class can bé made on 
dress stuffs by adopting the following

small bar, as already explained. 
ve The marks for buttons should be twice 
‘§ 4c Round-ended their own diameter apart, this leaving a 
space equal to their own diameter be- 
tween them ; for ordinary small buttons this space is one 
inch or less. _Button-holes must be just a shade longer 
than the diameter of the buttons if the latter are flat, or a 
diameter and a half if they have rounded surfaces, such 
buttons requiring a longer hole to allow them to slip 
through. The width of the button catch should be rather 
more than half the diameter of the button beyond the 
fitting-line (the ends of the holes coming quite to the 
fitting-lines), if the buttons are not to lie over the edge. 
For hooks and eyelet-holes, or hooks and loops, the 
fronts of the bodice are turned exactly as for buttons and 
button-holes, as far as the fitting-lines are concerned, but a 
shaped stiffening of French canvas of the usual width 
is machined several times to the lining before tacking out, 
to make a firm foundation for the eyelet holes or loops that 
are to be worked upon it, the outer edge on the right hand 
front just going beyond the fitting-line. The left-hand front 
is prepared exactly the same as for buttons, with from three-

quarters of an inch to an inch of stand beyond the fitting- 
line, into which the stiffening extends, and the silk facing 
is neatly hemmed in. The eyelet-holes are worked through 
the silk facing ; the loops, if desired, may be worked on 
the stiffening before the facing is hemmed in, that no 
stitch may be visible inside. The right front is turned under 
a guarter-inch outside the fitting-line, but the piece turned 
in is left about an inch wide, and needs slightly fulling at 
the bust and snipping across at the waist to make it lie 
smoothly ; five tiny snips or cuts should give ease without 
leaving a thin place at the waist. The stuff and lining 
turned over should be firmly caught to the lining of 
the front by a kind of rough herring-bone stitch, worked 
from right to left, which is used in dressmaking to 
secure edges that are afterwards to be covered with 
a facing (see page 106) One stitch takes the lining 
only, the next is through the stuff and lining turned over 
and the lining of the front as well, taking up all but the 
outside material, The raw edges being fastened down, the 
hooks are next firmly sewn on through the two little holes 
or rings, and across the shank close to the turn, the stitches 
taking up all but the outside stuff. This latter point is 
essential, as, if only sewn to the stuff and lining turned 
over, they have no pull on the bodice itself, and draw out 
and show between the front edges, instead of drawing them 
closely together. The hooks are sewn with the turn to 
come just to the fitting-lines (quite a quarter of an inch 
under the edge of the front), and being sewn on, the 
sarcenet facing or a ribbon is slipped up over the sewing as 
high as the turn of the hooks, and hemmed closely down. 
The other edge is hemmed to the lining of the front, far 
enough back to cover all the rough sewing, only leaving 
visible as much of the hook as clips into the eye. 
If the lining only of the front is turned over the quarter- 
inch outside the fitting-line, and a fine firm piping cord run 
in the edge and securely fastened at top and bottom, slightly

tight for the length, and then the stuff turned over and the 
front finished as previously explained, it is a distinct im- 
provement to the outside appearance of the bodice, and the 
corded edge, being tightened, sets closely over the ends of 
the hooks and reduces the risk of their gleaming through ; 
if well done, it conceals them entirely. 
High-class workers press apart the two thicknesses of 
wire that-make the hook, and work over all that is visible 
with silk to correspond with the worked over eyes. This is 
only necessary when the fronts of the bodice are quite plain 
and the gleam of the metal is likely to show ; care in setting 
the fastenings well under the edge will save the actual 
necessity for a very laborious piece of work, though, as 
far as appearances go, it is effective. 
Eeyelet-holes are made on the left-hand front, through the 
fitting-line, stiffening, and facing, and should be three- 
quarters of an inch apart, or half an inch if 
O. . very close fastenings are preferred. The holes 
are pierced from the outside with a stiletto, and 
closely overcast with button-hole twist, the 
stitch being firmly drawn up to tighten the edge 
of the hole and keep it well opened and to shape.

mental eyelet-holes are made by first piercing

hole stitch, the purl drawn upwards to make a raised cording 
close to the edge. 
Eyelet-holes for lacing may be as close as half an inch if 
preferred so. 
Loops also are made on the fitting-line, the length of the 
loop the same way as the length of the line, if they are used 
for front fastenings, and the foundation stitches should 
certainly be made on the stiffening, though not neces-

sarily through the facing as well. Loops should be a 
quarter of an inch long, and four strands of silk used for 
the foundation threads, on which the “loop” stitch (see 
page 104) should be closely worked, the twist or purl seing 
drawn to form itself at the outside edge of the loop. Rapid 
workers pass the eye of the needle under the foundation 
strands, as the point is more likely to catch in the material, 
Extra strength and solidity are given to this 
fastening if the first and last stitches of the 
overcasting are made through the material, lining, 
and stiffening as well as over the foundation 
strands, thus relieving the latter of some of the 
strain. If loops are worked on a bodice fastea- 
ing across, a ribbon should be put inside and the 
stitches worked upon it, to relieve the soft dress 
material of the strain, and the length of the loops 
should follow the direction of the line of closing. Fig. GoLoop- 
Fronts fastened with hooks and eyelets or hooks 
and loops are seldom quite plain, but when this is the case 
a bone should be sewn under the loops, or under the stand 
just in front of the eyelets, to keep the edges smooth. 
For hooks and eyes, edge to edge, both fronts should be 
turned exactly by the fitting-lines over a shaped stiffening of 
French canvas one and a quarter inches wide, and put in 
easy in the length, and both edges finished with a silk 
stitching one-eighth of an inch from the edge and a second 
stitching, to make a slot for edge-bones, three-eighths of an 
inch behind the edge stitching. After stitching, the edges 
should be pressed and the bones inserted in each front to 
the height of the dart-line, the edges strained down, and 
the bones sewn in to the inside. Quite an inch of stuff and 
lining is turned under on each front, and rough-hemmed 
down to the lining, and in every respect the right-hand 
front is finished as explained for hooks (see page 69). The 
hooks are sewn on as already explained, the silk facing 
hiding both sewings. If the eyes are worked over, they do

g2 Tue Exemenwrs or Movern Dressmaxine. 
not gleam through and are less likely to come unfastened in 
wear. To do this they are pressed open and the silk 
worked over them as knitters “cast on,” covering the part 
of the eye that shows. The left-hand front has the eyes, 
previously cast over, sewn to it through all but the outside 
stuff, through the rings, and across each side of the eye 
itself; hooks and eyes ate often sewn on alternately, or in 
groups of three. Both fastenings must be a quarter of an 
inch under the edge, to keep the fronts well together—-or, if 
the eyes are brought to the edge, the hooks must be half an 
inch under. A flap or wrap must now be sewn to the 
lining of the left-hand front, to come under the fasten- 
ings when closed, and take the place of the button- 
stand, which cannot be cut in one with the front when 
either hooks and eyes (edge to edge) or lacings are 
used. High-class workers make the wrap of single stuff 
and line it with the sarcenet facing, which is cut wider and 
left open at the inner edge ; the stuff only is stitched along 
by the sewing-on of the eyes, the sarcenet then being hemmed 
down to-the lining to make a complete finish to all. A 
strip of the stuff on the cross, about three or four inches 
wide, makes a neat wrap, as it is thin, and the cross yields 
to the curves of the figure. The two raw edges should be 
placed together, and run or stitched along to the front just 
where the eyes are caught down to it, the sewing taking up 
all but the outside stuf, The sarcenet facing can then be 
placed over the raw edges and the lines of stitching and 
hemmed along, and the other edge hemmed in to the lining 
as before. With thick stuffs the wrap is often of single stuff 
only, and either bound with china ribbon, pinked, or over- 
cast ; its usual width is one inch beyond the bodice edge. 
The chief objection to ordinary hooks and eyes is their 
tendency to come unfastened unless the eyes are overcast ; 
various plans of arranging the fastenings to prevent this are 
in general use, but without any large measure of success. 
Lately, however, 2 good deal of attention has been given to
-P-A-G-E-86
FASTENINGS. 73 
hooks, and several very useful inventions have been brought 
before the public in the way of patent hooks which will.not 
come unfastened. Some of these have a steel spring in the 
turn, and others are bent in such a way that the eye or 
cyelet-hole will not slip from them without firm pressure. 
Hooks in use in dressmaking are: Ordinary—bodice hooks, 
skirt hooks ; patent hooks‘ Duplex” patent hooks (bent 
turn), “Prym’s” patent hooks and eyes (wide base and 
spring in turn), “Nautilus” hooks and eyes (large and 
square, for attaching skirt to bodice), etc. 
For Zacings, both fronts are turned in by the fitting-lines, 
and a row of fine machine-stitching in silk made close to the 
edge (about one-eighth’ of an inch in), over the canvas 
stiffening as described for hooks and eyes edge to edge 
(page 71). The turnings should be cut away to the stitch- 
ing, and a second row of stitching made about a quarter of 
an inch inside the first one. The distance between the two 
rows of stitching should make a slot wide enough to allow a 
length of whalebone or a narrow edge-bone to be easily 
slipped into it, but not wider ; the sarcenet facing is now to 
be hemmed firmly along the first line of machine-stitching, 
and also to the lining of the front as usual. Behind the 
slots for the bones come the eyelet-holes, which are to be 
made exactly opposite each other and half an inch apart. A 
narrow ribbon or Paris binding may be put behind them to 
strengthen them, but it should be tacked very easily down 
the length, especially below the bust. The same caution 
applies to the facing, which should be well fulled on and 
be amply long when the bones are pushed in and the fronts 
strained down to their utmost extent. The eyelet-holes 
must of course be worked through the facing as well as 
through the ribbon, and after they are made the left front is 
finished with a wrap, one of single material on the cross lined 
with sarcenet giving the best finish. 
The bones should be very narrow, rounded at the top 
and slanted for the points, and should have holes pierced
-P-A-G-E-87
44 Tre Evemenrs or Mopern Dress axine. 
through both ends. The upper end should be sewn firmly to 
the inside of the slot by a ‘‘fan” of stitches, and quite an inch 
from the top, if it isan evening bodice, or the edge will stand 
off from the figure ; and high bodices lacing up the whole 
length of the front should be carefully arranged in this par- 
ticular, one and a half inches below the collar not being 
too low for the end of the bone, as if it is the full length 
it presses against the throat, and may do it lasting injury. 
The upper ends being secured, the bones are pressed up 
gently into the slot and the bodice smoothed down over 
them till the fronts are thoroughly well strained down; cach 
lower end is then secured to the inside of the slot, and the 
bodice edge turned up just sufficiently far below it to prevent 
the push of the bone showing. Some workers sew casings for 
the edge-bones to the inside of the lining, instead of machin- 
ing one through lining and stiffening, Slips of thin cane 
are sometimes used instead of bone for edge-bones, and are 
both strong and flexible. Sometimes a second bone is put 
behind the eyelet-holes, making two bones to each front. 
Where the machining through is disliked, stitching by 
hand may be substituted, or the slots may be made in the 
lining and stiffening only and the stuff smoothed over, but 
it is apt to bag off slightly and give an unfinished look to 
the edges if they are untrimmed. 
High bodices are seldom laced quite up to the neck ; it 
is more usual to have some variety of fulness down to the 
bust or a little below it, fastened by hooks and eyelet-holes, 
and the lacing below the bust only. In this case the bones 
should only come as high as the darts, or the upper ends 
will stand off. 
For blind fastenings, whether buttons and button-holes 
or hooks and eyes are used, the outside of each lining front 
should be first faced down with a strip of the outer material, 
about three inches wide, which is laid on the lining, and the 
front fitting-lines tacked through. The inner edges of the 
strips are hemmed or machined down, and the front edges
-P-A-G-E-88
FASTENINGS. 15 
are then turned, faced, and finished for the required fasten- 
ing exactly as if the lining fronts were completely covered 
with stuff, except that the fastenings are farther apart; the 
loose fronts of material are folded or shaped across to 
conceal them. 
Occasionally the outer fronts are also fastened invisibly, 
tiny buttons and button-holes being used. The buttons are 
sewn on the outside of the loose front, which is then turned 
under to allow the button to pass into the hole from the 
outside. When closed, neither buttons nor holes are visible. 
The pull of such blind fastenings would show with close- 
fitting bodices ; they are therefore quite unsuitable for them. 
Edge-to-edge fastenings are less likely to wrinkle and 
draw apart at the waist if a straight line from bust to point 
of bodice is used for the front fitting-lines. The extra size 
can be taken out in the front of the first dart. Great care 
should be taken in trying-on bodices which are to be so 
fastened, as excessive length between bust and waist is the 
chief cause of gaping and drawing apart. 
Patent fasteners are now often used in place of hooks 
and eyes for inferior work, or for light blouse bodices. To 
set them in, the bodice front should be turned in to the line 
as for hooks and eyes and caught down raw-edged. 
The fasteners are then pinned into place—the upper end 
of the edge steels should not come higher than the dart- 
height—below this it should be fixed in exactly like a cased 
bone, holding the bodice edge over the hand and straining it 
out so that the fastener is in a sense eased in the length. 
The hooks and eyes must be fixed to correspond with each 
other, After fixing in, the fasteners are hemmed down at 
both edges if it is a plain bodice, or machined through if 
for a blind fastening. Hook and eye tape is used in much 
the same way. The bodice edges are usually finished with 
edge-bones before the tape is fixed in. 
Spring buttons are used for skirt plackets, but. can 
scarcely yet be included as a standard fastening.

Wit any attempt to wear a very close-fitting unboned bodice, 
it is soon evident that the movements of the arms and 
shoulders lift the waist out of place, and, as there is no 
weight or tension to draw it back again, it remains up, and 
the surplus length thus created forms itself into a mass of 
fine wrinkles across each piece between the seams. The 
stitching of the seams also yields to the strain of the figure, 
as there is no downward strain to counteract it, and every 
stitch draws slightly apart, increasing the wrinkling in the 
same proportion as the lengths of the seams are shortened. 
Bones are used in bodices to obviate this. The use of the 
bones is therefore to keep the length of each seam smooth, 
and to stiffen it slightly, that the waist may remain in its 
tight place and the bodice sit close to the figure without 
wrinkling. They also serve to keep the lower part (some- 
times called the basque) of short (pointed or round) bodices 
from curling up, and, sewn under the buttons, keep the 
fronts smooth and the points of the bodice from rising 
up. They do not, as a rule, improve the appearance of a 
bodice that fits imperfectly, and should not be relied 
upon to remedy defects, which they are more likely to 
accentuate, especially if these take the form of seams sprung 
out sharply from the waist, or badly turned there in the
-P-A-G-E-90

machining. With hooks and eyes (edge to edge) or with 
lacings they stiffen the bodice edges so that they can be 
drawn closely together and set smoothly down the figure, 
instead of drawing apart between each hook and eye or 
each pair of eyelet-holes, as unstiffened edges would do. The 
bone or substitute should be thin, that it may not take up much 
room inside the bodice ; flexible, that it may readily adapt 
itself to the curves of the figure; elastic, that it may not 
be easily bent out of shape, but if turned up will spring 
back again; and above all, strong, fine in grain, and cut 
exactly with the fibre, that it may not easily snap. Brittle 
bones in a bodice are a source of great annoyance. 
Whalebone unites in itself all the good qualities above 
enumerated, and is therefore the standard bone used in 
dressmaking. 
‘There should be a bone-casing on every bodice seam, and 
one (sewn to the lining only and without waist fulness) in each 
side-front, In high-class work a. strong narrow ribbon 
(galloon, silk binding, or for very delicate fabrics good sar- 
cenet ribbon) is made into casings for the bones. These 
should reach about as high as the level of the bust ; it is not 
wise to carry them higher at back or front, where the curves 
of the figure begin to recede ; but, if preferred, they may be 
carried up to within two inches of the side-level on the two 
straight seams under the arms, the ends running down to 
the level of the darts’ height at front and back. The 
end of the ribbon should be turned over and sewn down 
each side for a full inch, thus forming a little pocket, 
against the top of which the bone presses. It is then 
finely herring-boned, cross-stitched, or hemmed down each 
side to the turnings only of the seams, an extra half-inch of 
fulness being allowed in the length, which is to be eased 
on at the waist and for about one and a half inches 
above and below it. The sewing-in should be stopped 
about three-quarters of an inch short of the top-of the 
casing, the pocket being left free, and not fastened to the
-P-A-G-E-91
98 Tue Evements of MovERN DRESSMAKING, 
bodice in any way, and the same at the lower end, 
where an extra half-inch of ribbon is also allowed, which is 
afterwards to be turned up under the end of the bone and 
stitched to it to keep it from pressing down to the edge of the 
bodice and pushing against it. The easings are fulled on a 
little more for hollow-waisted figures. 
If the ribbon is folded exactly down the length and the 
fold pinched along, it assists the worker to keep the centre 
of the casing exactly on the seam; and if any difficulty is 
experienced in regulating the quantity of fulness about the 
waist, the edges of the casings at that part may be whipped 
along and drawn up into the required length first, the 
whipping thread to be drawn out after the sewing is done. 
The rules of extra fulness at the waist and above and below 
it, and of loose ends, must be carried out, whether casings 
or cased bones are used. 
For cased bones, the surplus fulness of the casing should 
be pushed towards the waist and eased on there, and a little 
above and below it. The rest of the casing should be 
cross-stitched, herring-boned, or hemmed down to the seam 
without strain, the bodice being held over the hand to keep 
the bones rounded at the waist whilst the stitching is done. 
This certainly causes the material to get more handling 
than the use of bone-casings, as the latter can be stitched 
in with the bodice lying on the knee or table, the turnings 
only being held in the fingers, whilst with cased bones it is 
necessary*to hold each seam on the hand and strain it. 
With pile fabrics, or those easily crushed or soiled, this is 
a serious consideration, and is, no doubt, the reason why 
cased bones, steels, etc, are considered to belong to an 
inferior class of work. The double casing, too, makes an 
increase of bulk, very slight, but taken into account by 
particular wearers. 
The strips of whalebone require cutting into suitable 
lengths for use (one half inch longer than the casing after 
the latter has been sewn in, which has shortened it to
-P-A-G-E-92
Bones and Bonine. 19 
the extent of the quantity fulled at the waist, and turned 
over at the ends) ; the ends are rounded and scraped smooth, 
and a little hole pierced in each, which is done either 
with the point of a pair of scissors or a large darning 
needle; or, in large establishments, with a punch, which 
stamps out a clear hole; those bought in dozens or sets 
are generally already rounded and pierced. 
The bones being prepared, are slipped up between the 
casing and the seam, the top ends into the little pockets, 
where they are fastened by the “fan” of five or seven 
stitches (shown at page 10g), the half inch of extra length 
left on the bottom of the casing being turned up under each 
bone and securely sewn to it. This presses the length of 
the bone up into that part of the ribbon which has been 
cased at the waist, and slightly rounds it there. They 
should then be gently bent to the shape they will take 
when the bodice is on, the bend being a very little 
above the waist, that it may set the bodice well down as it 
comes to the figure. Some workers adopt the plan of 
soaking the bones in hot water, and shaping them, whilst 
softened, to the curves of the figure’ Either plan prevents 
the seams straining until the bones have shaped them- 
selves to the body of the wearer. The upper and lower 
ends should also be slightly bent inward, to prevent them 
from showing through the outside stuff, as they are apt to 
do if this slight precaution has not been taken. 
The question of deciding between bones or no bones in 
the centre seam of the back and the two curved seams is one 
that continually presents itself in different aspects, owing to 
changes of fashion. Where the back basque of the bodice is 
box-pleated, is full in any way, or has a lapped centre seam, 
and is not sewn together much below the waist, it is usual 
to stop the bones at the waist, or just sufficiently below it to 
keep the seams smooth. 
Many wearers, especially stout ones, find the front points 
of the bodice curl up and stay up in wear; this is remedied
-P-A-G-E-93
80 THe Etements of MovERN DRESSMAKING. 
by sewing a strong piece of elastic to the bone, one end at 
the point and the other end to the bone again, nearly as 
high as the waist. The elastic should be about half an inch 
shorter than the bone, to curve it in a little, and when the 
pressure of the figure comes against it the point is kept 
firmly down. 
For long bodices the bones, whether in casings or 
ready cased, end about three or four inches below the waist, 
and it is essential that the lower ends (as well as the upper) 
should be free from the seam for at least half an inch, to 
prevent the appearance of strain upon it. 
The fact that whalebone is expensive (averaging one 
shilling per yard), and likely to become more so, has led 
to the use of many substitutes, some of which lack one 
or other of the good qualities possessed by whalebone. 
These substitutes are both natural and artificial—includ- 
ing horn, fins, quills, stiffened horse-hair, cane, vegetable 
fibre, vulcanite, steel, platinum, etc.—and are affected in 
various ways, according to their nature, by the natural 
warmth and moisture, Some are softened and lose their 
spring, and the fibres of others separate and fall apart ; un- 
protected steels rust, or rather, this was at one time the risk 
the dressmaker had to face when trying a new invention. 
Great attention is now given to these points by the manu- 
facturers, and lack of spring is the chief defect of all the 
manufactured substitutes. There has arisen of late years the 
idea that two or more narrow strips of bone placed side by 
side in the seam give more spring with less danger of 
breakage than single bones, and these “twin” steels and 
bones are to be obtained both covered and uncovered. Cor- 
rugating the surface is considered to give the same advantage. 
Whalebone or baleine is sold in lengths of from half a yard 
upwards, at from twopence to sixpence per length ; it may 
also be bought ready cased in silk in graduated sets or 
dozens, prices varying with quality. French horn in its 
best qualities is presumably a natural production, and is
-P-A-G-E-94

sold in sets of graduated lengths (seven to ten inches), or 
in dozen-bundles at from sixpence per bundle upwards. It 
can also be bought in half-yard lengths, in light or dark 
colours, at from three-halfpence per length, and in these 
lengths and in the cheaper qualities is manifestly arti- 
ficial. 
Cased steels of various makes (the platinum cased steels 
are included under this head) are now very well made ; they 
are thin and flexible, the ends rounded and protected by 
shields, and the whole cased in double or tubular ribbon 
ready to be sewn in; they are sold in sets graduated in 
lengths, or in bundles of twelve, at prices ranging from 
fourpence-halfpenny per set or bundle upwards ; a little 
more length on the ribbon casing would be an advantage, 
as there is not sufficient to ease it well at the waist. Edge- 
bones (very narrow steels, to be used for the front edges of 
dresses, fastening edge to edge, lacing or otherwise) belong 
to this class, and should be chosen as thin and flexible as 
possible, 
Antarctic bone is a recent invention, and consists of short 
split lengths of whalebone bound together with cotton to 
make a continuous length ; it is sold at from fivepence to 
sixpence the yard. 
Feather-bone is of the same class—quills bound together 
with cotton to make a continuous length also—and is to be 
bought for fourpence-halfpenny the yard. 
Fin-bone is presumably fins similarly prepared, and there 
are also the “ Coraline” dress-stiffener, “ Flexyle,” “‘ Corra- 
bone,” and others too numerous to mention.

Bodice Linings—In a little old-fashioned book on dress- 
making (published in the days when the sewing-machine was 
a thing undreamt of) the writer informs her readers that a 
good strong unbleached linen or holland is the best lining 
for dress bodices; that the backs should be cut on the 
straight and the fronts on the cross, and that the wrist of 
each part of the sleeve, both upper and under, should be 
laid to a thread of the stuff running across from selvedge 
to selvedge. 
The firm holland lining has been largely superseded 
by the sateen-faced, black-backed, twilled silesias now so 
generally used for middle-class dresses. A survival of the 
former flourishes in the form of a thick mingled grey 
lining made of black and white in imitation of linen, and 
known in the trade as an Oxford, which is much favoured 
by the working clases north of the Midlands. It is strong, 
thick, and warm, and does not soon show soil in wear, 
and for these reasons is preferred to slate-coloured silesia 
by our working people, though the latter is said to 
maintain its popularity in the Midlands and the South of 
England.
-P-A-G-E-96
LININGS, 83 
Many tailors use a fine firm linen or fine French canvas 
interlining for dresses which are to be afterwards lined with 
silk, but, so far as general use is concerned, holland or linen 
linings may be said to be quite out of date. 
No doubt coloured linens will always be used for both 
bodice and skirt linings when very open fabrics (of the can- 
vas order) are in fashion ; but there is something naturally 
repugnant about a dark inside to bodice linings, and most 
wearers object to them unless their use is rendered abso- 
lutely necessary by the combined pressure of fashion and 
economy, as, where the latter is not an important item, 
there is always the alternative of a reversible lining (or 
foundation) silk to fall back upon. These, firm glacé or 
soft twilled Surah, may be obtained in a variety of colourings, 
dark on one side and light on the other, but are hardly equal 
to the strain of steady everyday wear, especially where a close 
fit is required. 
Twilled goods can be woven closer, and consequently are 
proportionately stronger in wear than plain ones of equal 
bulk, and this will probably explain why the sateen-finished 
twilled silesia has supplanted the lining of holland. The 
prevailing fashions in dress bodices practically make the 
fitting depend to a large extent on the lining. They make 
it imperative that it shall not be bulky, and that it unites in 
itself the qualities of fineness, firmness, and elasticity in the 
highest degree, as it is to sustain the figure without increas- 
ing its size, and to follow and cling to all its curves and 
hollows ; and yetit must also be well adapted to the outside 
stuff. Firm silk answers all these requirements, but its cost 
prevents it from being generally used. 
A lining which is too firm for the material made up with 
it presses against it and makes it look poor and thin, as 
though it were stretched over wood, and the looseness which 
good tacking-out always allows shows in ugly cracks or 
creases, which are unsightly and soon rub through. By not 
yielding as readily as the. outside stuff, it causes the latter to
-P-A-G-E-97
84 Yur Erements oF MODERN DRESSMAKING. 
bag off instead of allowing it to mould itself to the hollows of 
the figure, thus making it appear too loose for the lining, 
whilst the appearance of the figure itself is quite spoilt 
by the ill-defined outline which the hard unyielding bodice 
presents. 
Cheap slate silesia has this fault, when the buyer 
mistakes stiffness for goodness, and hard white calico is 
often chosen for washing-dresses under the same mistaken 
impression. The hard white calico (very little improved 
by being soaked overnight in cold water) is extremely 
objectionable, as it is hardly possible to drive the needle 
through it, and it is as hard to work upon as it is difficult 
to fit. Scalding improves it, but only a little. 
On the other hand, a lining which is too soft does not 
sustain the figure sufficiently, and allows it to throw most of 
the strain of the fitting on the outside stuff, which, yielding 
in its turn, either loses shape and makes the bodice become 
loose and short-waisted, or splits where the strain is greatest. 
Either of these faults is very serious, and should be carefully 
guarded against, especially when the dress is one for a stout 
figure, or for hard or heavy wear. 
Linen on the cross is firm and flexible, but cuts up very 
extravagantly for bodices with many seams extending below 
the waist, is cold to the wearer in all but summer weather, 
and, unless in very fine qualities, is apt to be bulky. With 
the extremely close fit demanded by the fashions of the day, 
and with the loosely woven materials which grow more and 
more into public favour, there is, too, the danger of the 
light-coloured lining showing itself in tiny flecks in the lines 
of stitching at the seams when the bodice is strained on the 
figure of the wearer. 
The black-backed, sateen-finished twilled silesia is fine, 
yielding enough to follow the curves of the figure, yet 
firm enough to support it. The dark back saves the 
danger of the white specks in the line of seams being 
visible, and the pretty, fancy-patterned inside is pleasing
-P-A-G-E-98
Linines. 85 
to the eye, and shows the slight soii of the making or 
wearing less readily than plain self-coloured lining. In 
addition, it is not hard, but is still firm enough to be used 
satisfactorily with most of the materials in general wear, and 
for all these reasons it is usually chosen for dark-coloured, 
middle-class woollen dresses; and not alone for these, 
but for many others where its use is not considered strictly 
correct. 
Twilled lining silk is firm, smooth, thin, soft, and flexible, 
but has the disadvantage of putting a dark inside to the 
skin, and the greater one of being too expensive for the 
majority of wearers. Silk is accounted the perfection of 
bodice linings, and is properly used for all rich stuffs, such 
as silk, satin, velvet, plush, brocade, etc., though, where 
expense has to be considered, a good black-backed silesia, 
Italian cloth, or mercerised sateen is often made a sub- 
stitute for it, especially with the addition of an inter- 
lining of soft mull muslin to relieve the outside material 
of strain and to add to the softness and richness of its 
appearance, Velveteen is lined in this way. 
Many dressmakers prefer a lining of fine Italian cloth, 
matching the outside stuff in colour, for dresses of silk, 
brocade, etc., for portly middle-aged wearers, consider- 
ing that it unites firmness with softness, and wears better 
than silk. It is certainly very nice for the purpose, but 
it should be chosen fine and of good quality, or it is apt to 
split and to be bulky in the seams. It must be borne in 
mind, however, that Italian cloth is a tailor’s and not a 
dressmaker’s lining, and is only correctly used for tailor- 
made garments with the seams between. A lining of gros- 
grain silk (with the use of which the side-fronts should 
be thrown on the cross) is undoubtedly the best for large 
or stout figures, where expense is not an object of con- 
sideration. 
Sateen, ordinary and mercerised, is very soft, and is more 
suitable for silk blouses or long gowns, where the weight of
-P-A-G-E-99
86 THe Exvements oF MoveERN DRESSMAKING. 
the skirt helps to keep it down, than for plain close-fitting 
bodices ; but dressmakers are compelled to use it largely 
for both bodices and skirts of summer woollens of light 
colour and texture, such as delaines, as the colour of the 
finished dress is very much affected by the lining, which 
shows through; and if the two colours do not match, the 
effect is often disagreeable. Sateen stretches less if it is 
cut the wrong way of the thread, Ze selvedge across 
instead of down. 
The mingled grey Oxford, “whitey-brown” or un- 
bleached calico, and common slate silesia, are the linings 
generally chosen for very common dresses. 
Calico is generally used for servants’ and common print 
or cotton dresses. Thin holland, calico, white silesia, lawn 
cotton cambric or pale sateen to match the material, are all 
used for lining print, sateens, muslins, and for ladies’ and 
children’s washing-dresses generally; light-backed sateen- 
finished twilled silesia, plain, or droché with self-coloured 
designs, for light stuffs; black-backed silesia for dark or 
medium woollens, better qualities being often chosen for 
silk, satin, plush, etc., though the correct lining for high-class 
woollens and all silk fabrics is foundation silk, Selfcoloured 
silesia, sateen, linen or silk to match the outside fabric as 
nearly as possible, should be used for both the bodice and 
skirt linings of open woollen stuffs, such as canvas, etc. 
Transparent rich materials—grenadine, lace, net, chiffon, 
etc.—are mounted on good silk or satin, and are often lined 
with silesia as well when fashion ordains that the style 
chosen shall be perfectly plain and close, and the figure is 
one requiring more strength in the lining than the silk alone 
will give. A less expensive substitute for the silk is to 
mount the lace on sarcenet or chiffon, and make it up on a 
lining of thin sateen or cotton cambric ; both are very thin, 
the two together not making more bulk than an ordinary 
black-backed silesia, and giving for black the combined 
advantages of good black under the lace and a light inside
-P-A-G-E-100
LININGS. 8 
to the bodice. Mourning crape is mounted on either mull 
muslin or domette, however lined; silk is the best lining 
for it. 
It may not be generally known to non-professional dress- 
makers that a firm twilled silk bodice lining with a black 
back is kept by most of the leading drapers. It is twenty- 
two inches wide and costs about two-and-sixpence the 
yard, and, except that the face is silk, might easily be 
taken for a very good black-backed silesia, the patterns 
being of the same class of design and the back blacked in 
the same way. The black back makes it quite unsuitable 
for open or transparent fabrics. It is much to be regretted 
that a good black silk back is not to be obtained, and that 
the insides of dresses of such dainty fabrics must either 
be dark or a second lining (white cambric or sarcenet) used 
inside the silk. 
The new Petanelle fabrics are fine and soft, and are con- 
sidered to be specially suitable for chilly people or those 
inclined to rheumatism or chest complaints; they should 
be used with their own special linings. They are, of course, 
more bulky than cotton or silk linings, but give a soft and 
rich appearance to all stuffs, and may be used with advantage 
for silk and rich fabrics of the class. 
The fitting- or sewing-lines of the pattern are generally 
transferred to the doubled lining by the use of a tracing- 
wheel or stiletto, which thus conveys the outlines to each 
pair of pieces of lining at the same time. Self-coloured plain 
linings show the tracing-wheel marks better than patterned 
ones, and the same holds good of Italian cloth, sateen, and 
calico. Plain silk linings also show the wheel-marks if they 
are carefully followed immediately after wheeling, but they are 
apt to close up quickly, and it is better to pencil them lightly 
over at once. The same may be said of the woollen Jaeger 
linings and of the mingled grey and the unbleached or 
whitey-brown calico, which, as they are preferred by a 
number of wearers, it is not fair to ignore. Inexperienced
-P-A-G-E-101

workers may prefer to cut the pattern down to the fitting- 
lines and pencil round each piece separately. Where this 
is done, care should be taken to cut the fitting-lines quite 
away, especially the lines of the darts, and the arm-hole and 
neck curves, or the marks fall inside the darts and above 
the neck, and inside the arm-hole curves instead of upon 
them, whilst pencilling outside the body-lines instead of 
upon them adds considerably to the bust and waist size 
of the bodice. 
Skirt Linings—The selection of good lining plays a 
very important part in the satisfactory turning out of a 
skirt. It should be firm and closely woven, that it may 
not drop in the length when the weight of the bottom 
finishings and trimmings is placed upon it, or split or give 
way under it; it should be inclined to hang outwards 
instead of falling in to the feet and twisting itself among 
the folds of the underskirts; smooth, to slip down easily 
over the skirts and stay so; fine, that it may not rub 
through the soft outside material, or impoverish its appear- 
ance by harshness of outline in the seams ; supple, to bear 
being held in the hand when the skirt is lifted in walking, 
and yet to spring back without showing marks of crushing 
when the skirt is dropped again; durable, to stand wear. 
Above all, it should be light in weight and neither heating 
nor chilling to the wearer, and should be good enough in 
quality to keep its colour fairly well. The lining is usually 
chosen as close in colour to the outside material as possible. 
Silk—rustling glacé, or twilled foundation—is the lining 
par excellence for skirts, but is too expensive even in the 
poorer qualities for general use ; those matérials that most 
resemble it in sound and hang are the favourite substitutes. 
Alpaca is a material that slips down easily, that hangs out 
well without stiffness, and that is fairly durable in wear, and 
it may be regarded as the standard foundation material for 
middle-class woollen dresses; its chief fault is its liability 
to split. Taffeta comes after the alpaca for strength, firm
-P-A-G-E-102
LInInes. 89 
coloured linen and soft-finish linenette are both excellent, 
and varieties of silkette (cottons finished to look and feel like 
silk) are also very nice, and all are in general use; whilst 
those who choose the mingled grey for bodice lining are 
likely to prefer black glazed lining for the skirt. 
Sateen is very soft, and should only be used for washing- 
dresses (with stiffened facings) or in conjunction with 
flounces, ruches, or some other full bottom-edge trimmings ; 
for, as a rule, though a hard lining is objectionable in a skirt, 
a soft one is more so, as it drops in at the feet and impedes 
free movement, and is therefore neither graceful. nor com- 
fortable. Soft linings are, however, generally used for 
foundation skirts under draperies, where their softness allows 
them to drop close and so give the maximum of effect to 
the draperies with the minimum of bulk. For such. skirts 
sateen is the favourite foundation material, 
Italian cloth is a good lining for silk or velvet when 
not made in the seams. ‘These rich fabrics are often 
interlined with mull muslin; trained silk skirts are fre- 
quently interlined with domette, which gives them a full 
rich flow, and adds materially to the beauty of both the 
style and the material. Velvet or velveteen should never 
be lined with anything that will rub in the slightest degree, 
or the pile will be loosened and the fabric gradually im- 
poverished from the back. Polonaise, a mixture of silk and 
cotton, which has the appearance of a soft dull silk with a 
distinct serge-like twill, is very much used as a skirt-lining 
for rich materials. 
Skirt linings should in all cases be cut the same way of 
the stuff as the outside material, and when the two are of 
different widths the question of cutting without waste is 
sure to arise. This must be arranged at the time according 
to the respective widths, the material being always cut first 
and the lining shaped to it; and it will often be found ad- 
vantageous to cut the lengths of lining and join them before 
shaping, as there is less handling of the biassed seams and
-P-A-G-E-103
90 «Tae Exremenrs or Movern DressmaKinxe. 
less chance of stretching them. As the curves of the 
figure below the waist are outward, extra length in the 
lining is not needed; but the pressure of the knees in 
walking or sitting is forward, and it is therefore usual 
to cut the linings of skirts a little wider than the outside 
material, half an inch to each gore or about two inches 
on the whole skirt width. Beyond this, what has been 
said about bodice linings for transparent materials holds 
good for skirts. 
Beetling—one of the processes of finishing cottons, 
during which they are beaten by heavy wooden mallets— 
flattens the threads and makes the fabric thinner and closer, 
consequently more pliable in fitting and silky to the touch ; 
beetled plain linings generally show a marking like a slight 
water-waving on the surface. Bodice linings are almost 
invariably beetled. 
Firm crinoline muslins (checked or corded) are used for 
interlinings when the fashion of wide flowing skirts prevails, 
or they may be the only lining used for skirts of light 
materials, Fine French canvas is used in the same way, 
and no doubt horse-hair or hair-cloth will be pressed into 
such service when a very full effect is desired.

Eastnc is so closely associated with sewing that it comes 
naturally under the head of the present chapter. It is, 
strictly speaking, a process or 2 manner of holding the work 
whilst it is being pinned or sewn, but is so often used 
in dressmaking that it calls for a few words of special 
description. 
It is sometimes necessary, either to ensure room for free 
movement or to obtain a certain outside effect at some part 
of the work, to join two parts or lengths in such a way that 
the longer one shall be worked up into the length of the 
shorter one without showing a gathering or visible drawing- 
up. To attain this, the seam is held with the longer length 
towards the worker and the shorter one beneath it and away 
from her, and the work while in progress is held over the 
hand, or, in the case of seams, over the end of the left 
forefinger instead of flat upon it, Each stitch put into work 
so held takes up more of the upper portion than of the 
under, and so uses up the extra length very readily, and, 
where the turn over with the forefinger is not quite suffi- 
cient, as with the highest part of the sleeve-head, a little

92. Lue Eremenrs or Movern DRESSMAKING. 
push with the left thumb as the needle is taking up the 
stitch still further fulls or eases the longer length against 
the shorter one, and so helps on to the desired effect. 
Sleeves and collar at the joining seams should look raised 
above the bodice itself, therefore upper sleeves are always 
well eased in and collars slightly eased on, and the effect is 
assisted if the turnings are neatened and laid under that 
side of the seam which is to appear most raised: thus 
arm-hole turnings are laid in the sleeve, neck turnings in 
the collar. : 
The sewing which has to be done in good dressmaking 
differs very largely in one important respect from that done 
in white work: the stitches very seldom show through on 
the right side. 
Underclothing is constantly being washed whilst in use, 
and all the sewing put into it needs the first essential of 
durability. Close and small stitching is rendered absolutely 
necessary, as in the various stages of washing, drying, and 
ironing the seams and hems are beaten, rubbed, shaken, 
and, in a sense, roughly handled, and large or loose stitches 
would break and allow raw edges to come out, which in turn 
would fray or tear across, and soon put an end to the use- 
fulness of the garment. The fine work put into the seams 
and the careful double-turning of all raw edges is absolutely 
necessary with washing-garments, and this, together with the 
necessity for making all seams very flat (as they are to lie 
close to the body and the garments themselves are unlined), 
makes it almost impossible to avoid showing the stitches 
through to the right side. In white work this is admitted 
and accepted, but in dressmaking the reverse is the case, 
and every endeavour is made to keep the stitching out of 
sight unless it is used in a distinctly ornamental manner. 
Tn all such work as hemming-up bindings and facings 
the lining only is taken up on the needle, the stitching never 
showing through the outside stuff, and this no doubt has 
gradually led up to the feeling that stitching showing through
-P-A-G-E-106
STITCHES. 93 
is a mark of inferior work, and is to be avoided wherever it 
is possible. The fact that coloured silk or cotton must be 
used for stitching woollen stuffs, and the difficulty of match- 
ing them exactly, have no doubt a great deal to do with 
this; also, at all events, slip-stitching is now the dress- 
maker's stitch far excellence, and is used by her in all its 
variations, far better finishing being ensured by its use than 
in any other way. 
For instance, if the lining of two revers is machined 
to each on the wrong side, and then turned over, the edgcs 
are thick and clumsy, the stuff and facing hold apart, and it 
is very doubtful if both points will come out from the ordeal 
exactly the same size and shape; but if an interlining of 
muslin or other stiffening is cut exactly to the shape and size 
required, and the material is tacked smoothly and firmly 
down over it ; if all the points, corners, and curves are care- 
fully made and matched and the whole pressed, and then 
the lining (also turned to shape and size, and tacked firmly 
down and pressed before it is joined to the revers) is slip- 
stitched on, the likelihood of the worker having to undo and 
do over again any portion of the work’is reduced, and a far 
more finished effect results. With any piece of work on 
which both sides have to show equally—as the edges of a 
Medici collar or Zouave—pressing on either side after 
finishing would show a line of glaze round the edge, 
and here again the value of slip-stitching makes itself 
apparent. 
What has been said on page 23 about the choice of 
needles and thread for the machine applies with the same 
force to the selection of needles and thread for hand-work. 
The needles should be smooth and well-finished—rather 
short where the sewing is to be done one stitch at a time, 
but long where several stitches at a time are taken up on 
the needle—the cotton or silk smooth and firm, but not 
glazed; very fine silk is used for slip-stitching, and dull 
crape-cotton for sewing mourning crape. The length of

thread may be broken from the reel, but should always be 
cut from the work ; breaking weakens the fastening-off, and 
biting-off is nearly as bad, and adds the objection of marking 
the work with the moisture of breath and lips. All the 
stitching in dressmaking is expected to be neat, regular, 
and secure, but it is not done, as a rule, quite so finely as 
for white work ; fourteen to sixteen stitches to the inch being 
the range. 
If the stitches are all small, close, and regular, the work 
would be called fine; if large, but still well-spaced and 
regular, it would be considered coarse but neat. If the 
stitches are irregular in size and set in at different angles, 
some lying quite down and some quite upright; or if stitches 
of various lengths follow each other without regularity or 
order, some taking one edge only of the two portions to be 
joined and some the other, and the tension on the thread is 
unequal, some parts being drawn quite tightly and the 
others left loose, and so on, it is decidedly bad work, even 
if the stitches themselves are all small. Cool, smooth hands, 
.and the habit of touching and holding lightly, are as 
essential to good work as fine stitching, and a fair rate of 
speed is needed if

covered ; as a rule, the stitch is as Jarge as the needle will 
take up. With large surfaces (as deep kiltings or pleats) a 
long straw or darning-needle may be advantageously used to 
cover the ground quickly. 
Tacking is generally worked from right to left, but the 
worker would vary this according to circumstances, going 
forward, upwards or downwards, as seems most advisable, 
Basting may be used in any direction as required, but 
is generally worked backwards. 
Machine-stitching, stitching, back-stitching, run-and- 
back-stitch, seaming, run-and-fell, are all employed for 
joining lengths to- 
gether or making 
seams, Back- 
stitching was used 
for the bodice and 
run-and-back- 
stitch for the skirt 
seams before ma- 
chine-stitching 
took the place of 
both (hence the old-fashioned dressmaker’s rule of short 
needle for bodice and long for skirt). Seaming (Fig. 11) 
was occasionally employed for bodice seams, but only where 
selyedges were joined, and was then worked very minutely; 
it is now principally used for fixing the skirt to the belt. 
Run-and-fell is seldom used in dressmaking unless for 
foundation skirt seams. Machine-stitching is dealt with on 
page 29, and, properly worked, is a very close, strong stitch, 
making firm, even seams, that can be pressed to a degree 
of flatness impossible to obtain with hand-stitched seams, 
unless in thick, soft materials. 
Stitching (Fig. 12) is used to ornament finished edges, 
whilst at the same time giving them firmness. We are all 
familiar with the description, “ Every stitch is like a pearl” ; 
and that is exactly how stitching should look. In white

work the rule is two threads backward from where the stitch 
last came out and four forward, the rule leaving two threads 
uncovered be 
tween each stitch 
and the next. In 
dressmaking it is 
not possible to 
count the threads; 
the rule of six- 
teen stitches to the inch is therefore substituted for it. 
Back-stitching (Fig. 13) is very closely akin to stitching ; 
the rule is, however, two threads backward and two forward, 
thus making the stitches follow each other without any 
spaces between. It is the firmest stitch used in dress- 
making, and should be absolutely even and regular, both 
in size and in the 
tension given to 
Back-stitching the silk in drawing 
. out the needle, if 
a perfect seam is 
to result. With 
back - stitching 
(and in a less 
degree with stitching) the chief defect to be guarded against 
is easing the upper material to the under one, which can 
easily be done evenly if the work is held very carefully and 
kept flat on the forefinger, if the stuff is thick and the 
needle put into the work at a slant, as it will then 
naturally take up more of the upper than of the under 
material. In stitching or back-stitching thick cloths tailors 
guard against this by putting the needle in straight down 
from the face, drawing it through, and putting it in again 
straight through from the back, instead of making the 
stitch by passing the needle through both thicknesses of 
stuff at once in the ordinary manner; and though this is 
not specially necessary in dressmaking, it should be borne

in mind if very thick cloth is being worked upon. Back- 
stitching and stitching are both usually worked from right 
to left, but the former was occasionally worked backwards 
when joining skirt gores by hand (see page 126), the stitch 
being often given in old manuals on sewing as a variety of 
back-stitch. 
Running (Fig. 14) is not a strong stitch, and would 
not be wisely used for any seams that have to bear strain, 
unless in conjunc- 
TTT “=F 7" tion with felling, 
i or for French 
{ seam, It covers 
NC Runnin space very rapidly, 
Fig. te however, and is 
therefore used for 
many kinds of joining, and in inferior work for protect- 
ing edges in place of hemming. For running, the two 
edges to be joined are put together and the needle “r 
or shaken along through both, taking up a number | ‘of 
stitches at a time which are all of equal length on both 
sides of the work. For gathering, the needle should not 
be taken out of the work at all, the stitches being passed 
back over the eye as they are made; but for running long 
skirt seams this would crinkle the material at the line of 
sewing more than is advisable, and it would roughen and 
weaken the thread to draw it through a long length ; the 
needle is therefore drawn through, and the line of running 
smoothed on the thread at each needleful of stitches, the 
needle being usually put back again with a back-stitch 
to strengthen the seam and prevent drawing up. Skirt 
seams were mostly joined in this way before the invention 
of the sewing-machine, and long needles were preferred 
by the workers as enabling them to cover the lengths more 
quickly. Care should be taken, in making a join by running, 
that the upper material is not eased against the under,* and 
* See Back-Stitching, p. 97.
-P-A-G-E-112
STITCHES. 99 
that the stitches really join the two lengths to be united. 
With too rapid workers the needle may occasionally miss the 
under material, taking the top one only, and this no doubt 
gave rise to the saying that badly-made seams were joined 
with “hot needle and burning thread.” Running is worked 
from right to left ; but if pile fabrics are run by hand, the 
worker, after running the seam down, should return up 
the length, taking up all the spaces she had missed in 
going down, to close the pile and prevent the seam 
showing. 
The needle “runs” through the work in making the 
seam, but the material can also be “run” or drawn up 
on the running-thread ; this stitch is therefore the one 
used for ordinary gathering. 
Gathering, gauging, shirring (Figs. 15, 16, 17) are 
used for drawing up the waists of skirts (often the back- 
breadths only) ee into a shorter : —s given space, also 
for making 
flounces and many 
varieties of orna- 
mental fulness on 
both bodices and skirts. Gathering is, like running, 
worked from right to left, and the stitch is similar. The 
tule of gathering by thread is, take two, miss four; but 
this is very little used in dressmaking unless a uniform 
grooved or fluted effect is desired, the ordinary running 
stitch of equal length on both sides being as general. 
When straight (ungored) skirts were in vogue, and six 
or seven breadths of material had to be “stocked” or 
set into the waist-belt, the value of the correct gathering 
stitch was very apparent. The stitch, longer on the face 
than on the back, draws the material up into distinct 
ridges, making it much easier for the worker to dispose 
of it neatly, securely, and regularly by seaming the top Gathering 
  Fig. 15.
-P-A-G-E-113

edge of each groove to the bottom edge of the belt. 
For this the right side of the belt and the right side of 
the skirt are placed against each other, and each gather 
secured with at least two firm seaming-stitches. The belt 
is held away from the worker and the skirt to her whilst 
the work is being done, and (as is usual in dressmaking) 
the sewing is done on the inside, and each stitch drawn 
up closely to show as little as possible on the outside of 
the finished work. (See page 141.) 
The size of the gathering-stitch varies with the quantity 
of material to be set into the arranged space. For 
bodice fronts 
it would be a 
quarter of an inch 
on the face and 
Large Gathers for Skirt Backs an eighth behind, 
or less; for the 
Fig. 16. waist of the front 
. portion of straight 
skirts, a very little larger. In the large gathers for the backs 
of undraped skirts the stitch should be the length of the 
needle on the face and a quarter of an inch behind (se 
Fig. 16). For the heads of large puffed or leg-of-mutton 
sleeves the gathering-stitch was often reversed, and made a 
quarter of an inch on the face and half an inch at the 
back, This brings the ridges outside, and after the sleeve- 
head has been drawn up on the gathering-thread to the 
size of the lining, each gather is pressed flat to make a 
tiny box-pleat. This method of dealing with the sleeve- 
gathers makes a less bulky arm-hole seam, and inclines the 
sleeves to stand out from the shoulders—an effect specially 
desired with sleeves of the kind. . 
Where several rows of gathering are to come one below 
the other, to give a regular grooved effect, the stitches, long 
and short, must be placed very exactly to take up and leave 
the same thread as in the row above them. Each gathering- —_——  
-P-A-G-E-114
STITCHES. IO 
thread should be fastened on very securely on the wrong 
side, and after all the running has been done each should 
be drawn up separately and steadily, and the piece of work 
pulled gently from each end to assist the gathers to set, after 
which each gathering-thread is passed through to the back 
of the work and fastened off, and the gathers themselves 
are further strengthened and kept in place by a row of 
back-stitching or chain-stitching across the back of each 
row of gathering-stitches, the needle taking for this only the 
tiny ridge at the back of each groove or gather. This can 
be applied to both lined and unlined gathering, and when 
this style of fulness comes into vogue it is almost sure’ to 
bring fancy smocking (which is often only an ornamental 
outside strengthening of the smooth gathers) into fashion 
too. 
Biassing is a very pretty way of strengthening unlined 
gathers from the outside. A thicker ornamental thread (of 
a contrasting colour, if desired) is used, and (starting at the 
right of the work) 
a tiny downward yroray 
stitch is taken in ‘ my i i i each ridge, the ; j I Ll} i |

diagonally across each groove-of the gathering, with a very 
ornamental effect. 
Flash-running is a variety of gathering made by ex: 
tremely fine running, in which the needle is lightly shaken 
along through the material without being drawn out at all, 
the stitches being passed over the eye as it is filled. The 
expressive American term “shirring” is very descriptive 
of the manner in which the needle is shaken or slurred

along through the material, and the gathers produced by 
this method are beautifully crisp and full, while the small 
stitches hardly show the silk or cotton with which they are 
made. Where several rows of this extremely fine gathering 
follow one below the other, it is called gauging, the term 
being applied to both kinds of gathering. 
Casing is a term also applied to gathering by lines of 
fine, small running-stitches with puffy fulness between; 
where each line of gathering is pushed up a little above the 
place where it would come on the lining if the stuff 
remained its full Jength, so that it will hang over loosely, it 
makes the trimming called puffs, whether the stuff is 
gathered by the correct gathering-stitch or only by fine 
running. Fine flash-running makes the prettiest puffings.* 
This fine running is also called drawing, fly-running, etc. 
Whipping is used for drawing up the edges of frills and 
lace to a required degree of fulness, and to make orna- 
mental fulness 
= without showing 
the thread. 
Whipping may be 
described as a 
variety of gather- 
ing, but the whip- 
ping-stitch is made over the edge of the strip to be drawn 
up. In white work the rule is to roll the edge of the frill 
gently between the left thumb and forefinger to close in the 
raw edges, and work from right to left, putting the needle 
in behind the work, just under the roll and in a slanting 
direction, and bringing it out at the face, taking one stitch 
at atime. When whipping lace the roll is omitted, and the Whipping.

between the drawings are really casings— wire, whalebone, or steel being

where a wire could not possibly be used.

worker uses a long needle and makes a number of stitches 
at once, twisting the work under the needle, and the needle 
over the edge of the strip, alternately. Whipping over a 
slight fold made on the back of the work gives fuller 
puffings than flash-running, and shows. the thread less. 
It is also occasionally used in the place of hemming for 
finishing the edges of soft silk frills, when it” 4s worked in 
thick silk of a contrasting colour, and is not drawn up at 
all. The edge of the frill should be rolled and whipped 
along, after which the work should be reversed and the 
whipping again carried down the length, crossing all the 
spaces left in the first working. The drawn or gathered 
edge should be 
whipped in the 
same way before 
OPO OEE drawing up. Used 
Over-casting thus it is distinctly 
ornamental. 
Overcasting 
(sometimes called 
whipping) is used 
for neatening and 
protecting the edges of turnings inside the dress, also for 
making eyelet-holes, 
Overcasting is a variety of seaming or whipping, but 
is worked from left to right and nearly always over raw 
edges. The needle should be put in at a slight slant to 
make the stitch upright, and the stitch itself should be 
taken rather deeply to give a firm hold, especially with 
stuffs likely to fray. ‘Ewelve or more stitches to the inch 
is the rule for bodice seams. The cotton used should be 
the colour of the outside material, and the stitch should 
not be drawn up tightly or it will make a hard ridge at 
the edges of the turnings, which will show from the outside, 
and soon rub through the bodice. For eyelet-holes, on the 
contrary, the stitch should be fairly deep and very close, ! 
Fig.29,

and drawn up tightly, the ridge being an advantage and 
protection to the edge of the hole.* In inferior work the 
turnings are often whipped several stitches at a time ; this, 
however, gives a frayed and untidy look to the edges, and 
should be strictly 
avoided. 
The stitch 
shown in Fig. 20 
is called em- 
oop Stitch broidery button- 
hole-stitch, loop- 
4 stitch, scalloping- 
stitch, loop-over- 
casting, etc., and 
is used for ornamental eyelet-holes, loops, putting on hooks 
and eyes which are not to be afterwards covered with a 
ribbon ; sometimes for edges of turnings where very neat 
finish is required, as the top of the button-stand or wrap. 
Sometimes it is incorrectly used for button-hole stitch. 
The stitch is worked from left to right, and is very simi- 
lar to the correct button-hole stitch, with which it is often 
confused. With button-hole stitch, however, the edge to be 
worked over is held upwards, and the purl is tightened by 
pulling the thread upwards and away from the worker, 
whilst with loop-stitch the reverse is the case, and button- 
holes worked in loop-stitch are always inclined to curl over 
and fall apart at the centre, and allow 
the button to slip back. The stitch is 
worked by bringing the thread from the 
last stitch down and holding it under 
the left thumb whilst the next stitch is 
taken. After the needle has passed through the work the 
thumb sets the loop free, and the stitch is tightened by 
drawing down over it. For the application of this stitch

to eyelets and loops, see pages 73-4. All hooks and eyes 
on skirt belts, or that are not covered with a ribbon-flap or 
facing, are overcast to the belt or dress by this stitch, the 
overcasting being carried round the two little holes or rings, 
and up the shank of the hook to the turn; the eye is 
entirely covered. : 
Hemming (Fig. 22) is used as in white work, for 
holding down the edges of hems, facings, linings, and 
every variety of neat 
inside finishing, but 
must not show 
through to the face ; Hemming 
the needle should 
take up only the edge

and the lining. 
The manner of cutting and setting on a false or added 
hem is detailed on page 133, the inside facing of a skirt 
being a false hem; if the false hem is outside the skirt, 
it should be set on the finished skirt-and slip-stitched at 
both edges (see page 134). French hem is used for the 
edges of cross-cut flounces and trimmings of the class 
generally. For French hem an inch or more of the 
material is folded over on the right side, and a line of 
running or machine-stitching made quite close to the fold. 
The inch of material is then turned up and the edge turned 
as if for an ordinary hem; it is, however, to be hemmed or 
slip-stitched down on the ridge instead of through the 
outer material in the usual way, and thus the stitches are 
prevented from showing through. French hem is used 
for silk and cotton, or fabrics which cannot be conveniently 
slip-hemmed. 
For “roll” hem the material must also be on the cross, 
the hem about half an inch deep and turned up on the 
right side. It is then invisibly hemmed, all the stitches 
being made quite wader the edge of the fold that they may

not show through on either side. The appearance of the 
hem itself when finished should be soft and round. Roll 
bem can only be applied to materials which are alike on 
both sides. 
Invisible hemming, or slip-hemming (Fig. 23), differs 
from ordinary hemming in both stitch and effect. The 
hem is turned and pressed, and the fine silk fastened on 
securely ; then below the fold the needle takes up merely 
a hair—a hold so fine as to be hardly a thread of the 
stuff—in fact, it must 
not show or shine 
through to the right 
side. Tt is drawn 
gently through and 
then takes a good 
firm hold in the fold; 
Fig, 23. another hair again a 
little further on, and 
Tepeat. This stitch is not a difficult one to execute, once 
the knack of taking up the slight hold is acquired, and 
it can be very rapidly done; it is used for the edges of 
draperies, straight and curved, and for any parts of the 
dress where an edge ot unlined material has to be made 
neat without showing a binding or a visible finishing, 
and—being worked from right to left, and therefore handier 
~it is also often used instead of herring-boning to fasten 
down roughly edges which are afterwards to be covered with 
a facing ; in the latter case it is called rough-hemming, and 
both stitches take a firm hold in the material and lining, 
though not, ot course, showing through to the right side. 
It is sometimes called slipping or slip-stitching. 
The word slip-stitching is also used in two other senses 
~—either for joining two edges together (as with revers, 
etc.), or to fasten a fold down over a flat surface from 
the outside, as, for instance, slip-stitching a back drapery 
down at each side over the front, or draperies round each Sip or Invisible Hemming
-P-A-G-E-120
STITCHES. 107 
side of the pocket-opening. or the latter the stitch used 
is much the same as for slip-hemming, but the edge of the 
fold should be lifted up a little and the stitches taken well 
under it, that they may not be at all visible. The lower 
stitch, instead of taking up merely a hair, should take a 
good firm hold in the stuff, and this as well as the upper 
stitch should be made under the fold, that when the thread 
is drawn close it may lie entirely out of sight. When such 
slip-stitching has to be done down long lengths it is ad- 
visable to take a back-stitch at, say, every four stitches, to 
keep the join smooth and relieve the thread of the strain. 
Slip-stitching two edges together may be described as 
concealed running or concealed run-and-back-stitching ; the 
former is mostly used in millinery, the latter in dressmaking. 
The edges to be slip-stitched are turned carefully to shape, 
pressed, and tacked very exactly together. ‘The needle is 
then passed in between the folds an inch forward of the 
place where the actual stitching is to start, and run back- 
wards, taking the inside of each fold alternately till it 
reaches the starting-place, when it is drawn out between 
the folds, and the end of the silk drawn well down out of 
sight. ‘The stitch is then worked forward from the starting- 
point again. Three or four fine running-stitches are made, 
taking up only the inside of each fold; the needle is then 
drawn out, always between the folds, and the stitching 
tightened up as closely as it is possible to do without 
wrinkling the edge. The needle is put in again a little 
behind the place where the last stitch came out, and the 
running and gentle tightening-up repeated till the end of 
the work is reached, when the needle is again reversed 
and the securing (preparatory to the fastening-off) made 
for an inch backwards. Fine needles and fine sewing-silk 
should be used for slip-stitching in any of its forms—either 
for slip-stitching or invisible hemming. 
Herring-boning (Fig. 24) is worked from left to right, 
and used as a rough stitch to fasten down raw edges which

are afterwards to be covered by a facing (as the outside of 
the collar to the buckram stiffening, etc.), and occasionally 
for fastening-in the bone-casings instead of hemming or

across, from right to left, returning up the length to complete 
the stitch as shown in Fig. 25. The large cross-stitches are 
worked singly, each one being fastened off separately behind 
the turnings. The stitch is made in the same way, but can 
be worked more conveniently if the bodice is held with the 
neck to the worker’s left hand. The left fingers can then 
be slipped under the turnings at both sides of the seam, 
and the stitch taken from the bottom to the top of 
the belt-edges up one turning, instead of across the 
seam. 
Fans of stitches (Fig. 26) are ornamental as well as 
useful, and

A few words upon the darning which may be needed in 
dressmaking may be of use. Fine-drawing is generally con-

heavy winter jackets and mantles, and is scarcely as useful 
as might be expected, as it presupposes two firm edges 
such as af incidental cut might leave, and cannot be well 
applied to tears or worn places. Darning, to be really use- 
ful, should imitate the weave of the fabric, whether it is 
plain, twilled, or patterned, and should be done with 
’ threads of the material itself. Long warp threads, which 
can be drawn or frayed out from a strip cut the selvedge 
way of the piece, are generally the strongest and firmest, 
but if this is not available, either ordinary wool, cotton, or 
silk (according to the fabric to be darned) may be used, a 
strand being in all cases drawn 
out to leave it slightly soft 
and roughened. 
Button-hole stitch (Fig. 
27) is used for making a firm 
Ordinary Buttorhote/Stitch ornamental edging to button- 
holes, sometimes also for 
eyelet-holes, instead of loop- 
stitch, 
Fig. 27, General rules for marking 
and cutting button-holes, with 
details of size, distance apart and from the edge, of running 
or back-stitching before cutting, or overcasting after, etc., 
and some details as to the different kinds in use, are given 
on pages 33-36. It only remains here to deal with the 
stitch used in making them, and with stranding. 
The ordinary stitch is worked from left to right, beginning 
at that end of the slit which is away from the edge of the 
bodice. The silk must be quite at the edge at starting ; the 
needle is therefore first slipped up between material and 
lining and secured with a tiny back-stitch across the end ; it 
is then put in against the depth of the stitch and the silk 
from the eye brought forward and passed under the point 
from left to right ; the needle is drawn through and upwards 
to form the purl at the edge of the slit, the thread from the —feererereeeremirer

last stitch being always kept back and quite away from 
the needle. The needle is then put through from the 
back of the slit and the process repeated. The round end 
is not overcast as in white work ; the same stitch is used 
throughout. 
Another method of working button-hole stitch is also 
from left to right. In this the needle is put through and 
drawn out till a little loop of silk is left at the edge of the 
hole; through this the needle is passed from the back, and 
the purl drawn up as before. 
Tailors’ button-hole stitch is worked in a different way, 
the loop being made before the needle is set into the 
edge. Fig. 28 shows it worked from right to left, the silk 
from the last stitch cast upwards and towards the left in a 
circle, the upper part of which rests against the work; the 
lower is held under the left thumb till the needle has been 
set in the edge and drawn 
through, when it is re- 
leased to allow the purl to 
be formed. It is the 
English custom to work Tailors’ Button-hole Stitch 
button-hole-stitch from left 
to right, the French from 
right to left, but the stitch 
is exactly the same in each 
method if @// the move- 
ments are reversed: thus 
in the first method, if worked right to left, the silk from the 
eye should be passed under the point from right to left too, 
or always in the same direction as the work is proceeding. 
This practically gives us six methods of working true button- 
hole stitch. Whichever method is adopted, the stitch should

In addition to running or overcasting, very careful 
workers strand their button-holes—ie, carry a thread of 
silk across each edge, over which to work the stitch. In 
stranding, a tiny upward stitch is taken at one end of the 
hole, and a tiny downward one at the other, and the two 
stitches, being repeated, leave two strands of silk along each 
edge of the slit, below which the needle is to come at every 
stitch. Opinions are divided 
as to the value of stranding, 
some workers giving it high 
praise, and others contending 
that it draws the holes in and 
gives them an inclination to 
pucker. ‘he latter is certainly 
the case if they are not cut

threads are drawn at all tightly. 
Back-stitching can, if preferred, be substituted for running 
and stranding, and gives the good results of both. Care 
should be taken in working button-holes to keep the edges 
as close together as possible. Occasionally very large 
button-holes are used for ornamental purposes—these are 
cut and bound with inch-wide strips of silk on the cross. 
The strips are doubled, and the raw edges placed together 
and run on at the outside, then turned over and the fold 
hemmed down inside, the join coming to the square end 
of the button-hole. Stranding | the Hole

THE narrowest skirt in which a woman can walk must be a 
few inches more than twice its own length in bottom edge 
width ; therefore it will be found that the narrowest skirts 
are about two and a quarter yards round. From two and 
a half yards upwards, however, is needed to allow the aver- 
age wearer to step freely, and lined skirts should be at least 
three yards round at the foot. 
* The a tention given of late years to the plain bodice in all details of 
seams and edges, made it inevitable that the same attention should be 
directed to the plain skirt. The position and fail of the seams, the flow of 
the bottom edge, the set of the folds, ete., have become matters that require 
more exact sizing, and more direct adaptation to each individual figure than 
is possible if the old-fashioned rules of goring are strictly followed, and 
systems of skirt-cutting have now taken their place in the technology of the 
trade beside systems of bodice-cutting. hese, using a measure round the 
hips as the basis of construction, draft the gores and place the seams by 
Proportions of that measurement, thus adapting them to the form and size 
of the figure. The system of skirt-cutting given in ‘'Skirt-Cutting by 
System" was originally arranged to meet the requirements of students in 
ordinary domestic dressmaking classes not desiring to present themselves 
for examination ; it has proved so sure and so easy in working in compati- 
son with the old goring metbod that it is now used in certificate classes

A well-cut modern skirt should lie close and clear at 
waist and hips, without however being strained round the 
figure; it should take a slight outward slant as it comes 
down from hips to bottom edge, where it should hang 
even all the way round. The seams should not slope 
either backward or forward, but should appear to run ina 
straight line from the waist downward. ‘The front of the 
skirt should not have the slightest inclination to drop in 
between the feet, the side gores should be wide enough at 
the part where the hips are fullest (about seven or eight 
inches below the waist). to fall well behind the figure ; and 
in particular the back portion of the skirt, which is intended 
to fall loose and full to prevent the figure being defined 
too closely, should not spread forward at the sides, or fall 
close to the back of the feet. It is desirable that as little 
material as possible (consistent with the prevailing style) 
should be used, as heavy skirts are not comfortable in wear; 
and the general dislike to any extra fulness in the form of 
pleats of gathers round the hips and waist, excepting the few 
inches at the waist back, is so strong that the cutter makes 
every effort to avoid it in planning out the cut of the 
skirt. 
A number of straight breadths run together will not 
meet these requirements at all, as they would give a straight 
skirt hanging close at the bottom edge and requiring a large

foot width of the gores will fall into that of any given material without 
waste. For the average figure a one-eighth and two one-sixth side gores

straight breadth and two gores, of four gores, of three wedges, etc., whilst

The old goring rules, however, are not altogether discarded, though 
they are relegated to a minor place. Even with exact and accurate 
systems, we must refer to them from time to time, and it is as well for the 
young worker to know the principles on which the more exact systems are 
based,

amount of pleating or gathering to bring the top into the 
waist size; but if the breadths are sloped off at the sides 
from the top downwards, leaving them only as wide at that 
part as the figure requires, the waist bulk is avoided, gather- 
ing and pleating can be dispensed with, and the skirt will

flow out all round the hem. This device (sloping away the 
top width) is called goring, and is the foundation process on 
which the cutting of all fitting skirts must be based, whether 
the skirts are actually gored or not. The standard rules for 
goring front and side breadths are as follows, single-width 
stuff (27-inch wide serge is the old standard) being the basis 
of operation :— 
A front breadth is gored by folding it down the length, 
and sloping off half the width from the top down, thus taking 
the quantity sloped off from both sides, leaving it wedge- 
like in shape when opened (see Figs. 1 and 2). A front 
breadth is, therefore, a length of single-width material half 
as wide at the waist as at the foot, with both sides on the 
bias ; it is usually hollowed out at the top about half an 
inch, to allow it to sit close to the waist of the figure without 
wrinkling.
-P-A-G-E-129
116 THe Evemenrs or MopERN DRESSMAKING, 
For side gores the single width is divided into thirds, 
one-third being marked in from the selvedge at one end, 
and one-third in from the other selvedge at the other end, 
and from one of these marks to the other the slanting line 
of cutting is made, the line running across the twill if there 
is one on the stuff. (It is better to chalk the line across and 
cut through it than to fold over by it and cut in the 
fold; with springy stuffs, such as alpaca, the latter plan 
  Fig, 3.—Thirds Goring for Side-gores, Fig. 4.—Side-gore. 
almost invariably brings out one gore wider than the 
other. See Figs. 3 and 4.) 
A side gore is, therefore, a division of a width of material 
half as wide at the top as at the bottom, one side being 
selvedge and one side on the bias of the material. Half an 
inch is hollowed from the selvedge edge at the top of the 
side gore to fit it to the curve of the waist. The front 
breadth and side gores are always twice as wide at the foot 
as they are at the waist, true goring giving these proportions 
to these sections of the skirt. The ‘thirds” goring (which 
it must be remembered, is for side gores only) gives two 
gores, both the same size and shape, from one length of 
stuff; but if the material is patterned, one gore will be found
-P-A-G-E-130
Tae Goren SKrR?. 117 
to be both upside down and inside out, a detail which 
must be remembered when calculating the quantity of 
material to cut from (see page 178), as only one gore can be 
cut from each width. The other part must be used for 
bodice or sleeves. 
There are no back gores, strictly speaking, but a plain 
unshaped back breadth is very full at the waist and inclined 
to fall into straight folds, and is only now used for uniforms 
and housemaids’ skirts. A back with a gored centre seam 
flows out, setting away from the feet at the middle and fall- 
ing straight at the sides, and so gives the best “hang” a 
skirt can have ; and two single widths, laid face to face and 
gored off from half at the top to all at the foot, give a nice 
back of the kind ; but the gored seam is not always liked, and, 
unless it is fashionable, is regarded as a serious objection. 
When the flowing effect is desired it is usual to make the back 
of three parts, consisting of two gores with the bias edge 
turned to the middle, and a centre wedge (or iength gored 
off at each side, in the same way as the front) set between 
them, which gives a flowing back without a centre seam. 
‘This is the plan generally adopted for gored skirts of single- 
width fabrics, as silks, beiges, etc., and is used for lined 
walking skirts when a centre back seam is not in fashion. 
‘The back of a lined gored skirt should be at least as wide 
at the foot as a double width of dress material, Full 
styles are often wider than this, a foot width equal to three 
half-double widths, being not unusual, and these proportions 
must be prescrved’ in the gores, whatever the width of the 
stuff they are cut from. It must be remembered that it is 
not always possible to do this and yet keep the seams in 
their correct fashionable place on the figure ; and for this 
all-important reason the student is advised to master the 
principle of cutting on the hips measure basis (see note page 
113) as well as by the goring rules given in this chapter. 
In the standard gored skirts, the shape of front breadth, 
side gores, and back breadth does not vary, and the relative
-P-A-G-E-131
118 THe Evements oF MopERN DRESSMAKING. 
proportion of their top and bottom widths always remains 
the same. But as the rules for other are based on single- 
width stuff, materials of other widths must be gored (or 
divided) differently if waste is to be avoided. Double-width 
material, opened and divided by “thirds,” would give side 
gores much too large at both ends for the average hips size, 
and with far too much slope on the bias side to sit or look 
well; whilst twenty-inch silk treated in the same way 
would give small and narrow gores, and double-width

material gored without opening would give gores equally 
natrow, : 
Narrow fabrics (silk or velvet, eighteen to twenty-two 
inches wide) gore conveniently if half the width of the 
material is left in the top, and the whole width in the 
bottom of each gore ; this wastes very little of the material. 
One length gives the front breadth, two the side gores, two 
or three are wedged and joined for the back. If it is re- 
versible silk (up or down), and narrow gores are worn, two 
widths can be gored by thirds for four narrow side gores in 
the same way as explained for standard serge (page 115). The
-P-A-G-E-132

wedged side gore shown (Fig. 6) should only be used when 
wide skirts are in vogue. 
Wide print, etc., can be treated as single-width material, 
and gored like twenty-seven inch serge—one breadth giving 
the front, two breadths faced and gored together in 
thirds the side gores and the two gores for the 
back, and one breadth wedged’ off and set between 
the two back gores ; or (see Figs. 1 and 2, page 115) the 
side gores may be the full width of the material at the

bottom to half the width at the top, like the goring for silk, 
with one breadth set between them (Fig. 9) to make a wider 
flow. If for a very slight figure, the front breadth, after 
being marked off, can be narrowed two inches at the same 
slope, to bring the seam nearer the front (see Fig. 8). 
Double-width material (forty-two to forty-six inches), or 
fifty-two inch cloth or tweed, must be divided to prevent the 
slope on the bias, side of each gore exceeding the’ standard 
quantity, Where the style of the skirt and the position of 
the seams is not of importance (as with uniforms or house 
dresses), they may be gored according to either of the 
following diagrams :—

Tf preferred, one width can be gored for front and back, 
taking the front from the fold and reversing the two narrow 
gores left for the back (which will then be shaped and with 
a centre back seam) ; the second length. can be used for two 
wide side gores, cutting them from half. at the waist to the 
whole width at the foot. 
No. 2 (Figs. 12 and 13) divides one folded double- 
width into a narrow front and two wide side gores, leaving 
the other length for the back breadth, which of course 
may be gored off where less fulness at the waist is preferred. 
This division is suitable for wide cloth or tweed. 
A gored skirt of single-width material with one “thirds” 
side gore at each side and one back breadth is only barely 
sufficient in bottom edge width for a foundation skirt or 
a housemaid’s print gown. For ladies’ walking skirts wider 
side gores (cut half at the waist to all at the foot) should be 
used, and a flowing back is essential with skirts which are 
not flounced or trimmed in some very full style at the foot. 
The measures required for skirt-cutting are :— 
The length of the front, from the bottom of the waist- 
belt to the point of the toe. The stander should not look 
down, as bending shortens the measure. The length of side 
if the hips are large. 
The size round the hips—taken very easily round the 
figure at about seven inches below the waist. This measure 
must be loose enough to allow the stander to bend, or the 
skirt will rise at the waist. 
The size round the waist—close enough to be comfort- 
able, not tight. 
The cutting of a standard gored shirt is as follows, if of 
plain reversible twenty-seven inch material: A length—the 
length of the skirt with an allowance of one anda half inches 
for turnings and shaping—should be cut off and folded in 
half down the length, selvedge to selvedge, and wrong side 
out. The fold, which will be the centre of the front 
breadth, should be to the cutter and the two selvedges
-P-A-G-E-135
122. THe ELeMents or ALODERN DRESSMAKING. 
away from her, and the end which is to be the waist to 
her left hand. From the selvedges backward on the waist 
end, half the width of the folded material should be marked, 
using either a pin, a piece of French chalk, or a piece of 
tailors’ crayon. From the mark the line of goring should 
be lightly chalked down to the selvedges at the bottom 
edge, but not cut. Next, one or two breadths—also 
with an allowance of one and a half inches for turn- 
ings, shaping, and extra length—should be cut. (One 
breadth gives one gore for each side, two breadths 
give two gores for each side, and when it is intended 
to use the latter number the two breadths should be laid 
face to face, and pinned and gored together, to ensure 
correct cutting.) These should be marked off by thirds 
for side gores, but not cut; the pieces should then be 
laid together in the same way as the skirt will be made up 
the. with the selvedge edge of the side gore to the sloped 
line of the front breadth—and the whole measured across, 
The front breadth and side gores together, at about 
seven or eight inches below the waist, should measure 
from three to four inches less than half of the easy hips 
measure (three inches for average figures, four inches for 
stout ones), This should be carefully checked across, and 
turnings on the seams allowed for; if not large enough, 
less should be gored from the sides of the front breadth, 
or, if too large, the excess marked off from the bias side 
of the side gores, 
The front breadth and side gores together should 
measure twice as much or more across the bottom edge 
as across the hips; this gives eight to ten inches of slope 
to each side of the front of the skirt. The skirt being 
folded as explained, the measures for hips and bottom edge 
must be halved. 
It will be found that material twenty-seven inches wide 
yields these proportions for average figures. After checking, 
the front breadth and side gores should be cut out with inch
-P-A-G-E-136
THE GORED SKIRT. 123 
turnings and any surplus pared away. One straight breadth 
should be cut off for the back if a strictly correct gored 
skirt is wanted, though a shaped back is more usual if the 
skirt is not for a nurse’s uniform or a housemaid’s wear. 
The waist of front breadth and side gores should be 
reduced to the waist size by pleats lying backward, gathers, 
or darts taken out either in the seams or half-way across 
the side gores, as fashion may indicate, the back breadths 
being either gathered, box-pleated, or laid in pleats folding 
towards the centre of the back. 
From four to six inches excess in size may be expected, 
and this must be disposed of according to the prevailing 
styles. If for gathers, it should be left to be afterwards 
drawn up on a strong thread (see page 143), ready for 
the band. If for darts (which are really pleats, sewn out 
instead of being merely folded over), they should be marked 
in. The amount over the half waist measure should be 
divided by three; one-third should be marked for the 
small front dart, and two-thirds for the large hip dart. 
Darts should be from an inch to an inch and a half 
wide in the front breadth, and are better not larger than 
two and a half inches in the side gores, unless the difference 
in size between hips and waist is excessive, in which case 
it is better to put two darts in each side gore than to 
have very large ones. Tbe darts should be from four to 
five inches long, and slightly shaped to fall easily over 
the curve of the hips; the smaller one should be put in 
the middle of each half of the front breadth (old style), 
or in the front seams (present style), and the larger one in 
the middle of each side gore, unless two smaller ones are pre- 
ferred there, when they should be spaced out to come at equal 
distances from the seam and from each other. The darts 
may be marked with chalk or tacking thread, and the waist 
should still be left about half the full waist measure, that 
it may be eased to the belt in the finishing off. 
When fashion decrees that skirts shall fit without darts,
-P-A-G-E-137
324 Dwve Exremenrs or Movern Dressmaxine. 
pleats, gathers, or similar contrivances of the kind for 
reducing the waist to size, the only other way of dealing 
with the gores is to wedge them, which is done by sloping 
some of the excessive waist size away from the selvedge 
edges of the side gores, leaving each a third as wide at the 
waist as at the foot (Fig. 6, page 118). The front breadth 
should also be wedged off to leave the waist very little 
more than one-third of its foot width. The lines should 
‘be chalked and the skirt measured over before cutting, 
and great care must be taken that wedging does not de- 
crease the width across the hips, which must not be 
reduced ; less must be wedged off, and the seam curved 
up from hip to waist as a half-dart, if the hips measure 
will not permit-a slanting line from waist to hem. Wedging 
gives the skirt a wider “set” at the front and sides than 
goring, and, unless wide skirts are distinctly fashionable, 
should not be employed. 
The waist size being satisfactorily settled, the position 
for pocket and placket openings should be marked. The 
placket opening may be either at the left side or at the 
centre of the back, and should be at least ten inches 
long, or longer for a broad-shouldered wearer, as if it does 
not allow the skirt to slip over the shoulders easily it will 
soon be torn down. The opening for the pocket should 
be seven inches long, and its place in the skirt varies with 
fashion. It is best hidden, however, in the right-hand 
seam behind the hip, where the back breadth joins the 
side gore, and the pocket can lie under the fulness; and 
the lower end of the opening should not be more than twelve 
inches below the waist if the wearer is to reach it comfort 
ably. Ten inches below the waist is the usual distance 
when short bodices are worn, and twelve with coat 
bodices; this places the top of the opening from three 
to six inches below the waist. It is needless to say that 
these openings should be left tacked when the skirt seams 
are machined.
-P-A-G-E-138
THe GorRED SKIRT. 125 
The half inch of hollowing from the top of the front 
breadth need not be actually cut away, but it should be 
tacked round that it may not be forgotten; and the half inch 
from the selvedge edge of each side gore should certainly be 
cut out, or the waist-line of the skirt will be found too 
straight after the seams are made if the gores have been 
joined properly—ze., from the waist down. It is best to 
mark in the waist shaping as soon as the “round” (hips, 
bottom edge, and waist) measures have been satisfactorily . 
settled, 
After checking over, it should be cut out with turnings 
and planned out on the lining. Where a drafted skirt 
pattern is used, it will, of course, have been modelled to 
agree with the width of the material from which the skirt is 
to be cut. Joins in the stuff—unless they are very small 
ones at a part likely to be hidden under the fulness—are 
not liked or used by the best workers, unless a particular 
style makes it impossible to avoid them. If used they 
must be made on the straight thread, and the pieces must 
both be the same way of the thread; the seam must be 
sewn and well pressed. 
If the lining is a different width from the stuff, it must be 
joined by the straight thread also, and if it is not. reversible 
(as sateen) it should be folded ends together for the planning. 
The gores are then planned out on the lining, with the 
middle of the front, the straight edge of each side gore, and 
the centre of each wedge to the straight down thread, and 
pinned down and cut out with an inch of turnings at each 
seam, half an inch at the waist, and an inch and a half at the 
foot, to cover alterations in length. If a cotton lining (as 
linenette, silesia, sateen, etc.) is used, it can be wheeled 
through ; silk can also be lightly marked with the wheel ; 
alpacas and linings of the kind must be chalked or thread- 
marked, or the width of turnings very carefully allowed, and 
the quantity left out when tacking together. The foot 
stiffening is often cut to shape and about eight inches decp,
-P-A-G-E-139
126 Twe Eiements or MODERN DRESSMAKING. 
and sewn to the lower edge of each piece of lining before it 
is basted to the stuff; it is tacked to the wrong side of the 
lining and machined to it across the top edge. By this 
method of stiffening it must be stitched in with the lower 
end of each seam, if the seams are made to come through, 
and therefore is not suitable for every kind of stiffening and 
material, though it is a very easy way when the outside stuff 
is solid, and the stiffening not too firm (book muslin or 
victoria lawn). After cutting out stuff and lining, the pieces 
should be paired in the same way as the bodice pieces were 
paired, and tacked out in the fitting lines or basted out in 
the margin, letting the end of each stitch touch the fitting 
lines and easing the lining slightly in the width. It is usual 
to tack a line down the centre of each gore to steady it, 
and to tack out the lines at foot and waist. 
The side gores should be joined to the front from the 
waist line downwards, a straight to a bias edge, the 
bias slightly eased on being the rule. If the back 
breadths are wedged off where they join the sides, 
there is one seam at each side where two bias edges 
come together; this is a slight departure from the 
standard rules. 
The actual joining of gores is a matter demanding 
great care, as if the bias edge is stretched whilst being set 
against the straight edge of the next gore, the smoothness 
of the seam and the set of the skirt are both affected. 
The great point is to prevent the bias side from being 
stretched either in the joining or the subsequent machining, 
and this is best accomplished by keeping the gores on the 
table whilst joining them, lifting the edges together lightly, 
and only just sufficiently from the table to put in the 
pins, and pinning without yielding to the temptation to 
smooth the bias edge, which is how half the stretching is - 
done. Each seam should be pinned and then tacked or 
basted together for machining. 
Small basting is better than tacking for preparing the
-P-A-G-E-140
Tue Gorep SKIRT 127 
seams ; it holds the edges together better. When the join- 
ing is completed, the straightness of each line from the hips 
down should be tested with a tape or yard-measure, after 
which the seams are machined, each from the waist down, 
passing over the spaces for pocket opening and placket, 
which are left tacked for the present. In the actual 
sewing, hand-sewn seams should always be held with the 
bias edge up, as if the looser edge is eased a trifle it does 
not show much. Machined seams should be sewn with the 
straight edge up, as the feeder slightly eases the underside 
of the seam, and it shows least when it is the loose bias 
edge. . 
The presser-foot should not hold skirt seams down too 
closely, or it will cause the yielding bias to stretch as it 
passes under, and the tension of the thread should be easy 
enough not to draw up the length of the seam. With thick 
materials the stitch should be lengthened. 
Seams.—Various methods of joining the seams of skirts 
must be adopted, according to the exigencies of fashion 
and the material employed, but it is generally considered 
that a flat seam—ze., one that will allow the turnings to be 
laid equally under each side and that can be pressed open 
—is the best. Such seams lie flatter, and are less difficult to 
manipulate when finishing the foot, and especially when set- 
ting-in the pocket and arranging the lower end of the placket. 
Against it the worker-has to set the value of the time and 
labour employed in neatening or hiding the turnings (a 
serious item in a gored skirt with many seams), and also 
the appearance of the inside of the finished skirt, which 
certainly pleases best when no turnings are visible. This 
has led to the invention of innumerable methods of joining 
the seams, all having the same end in view, é¢, to join and 
neaten the seam in such a way that the turnings do not 
show, with as little labour as possible. 
The easiest way of making up close-hanging lined skirts 
of ordinary woollen dress materials is with the seams through,
-P-A-G-E-141

afterwards catching the turnings at intervals to the lining of 
the skirt to keep the seams flat; and that is the method 
generally used, when plain woollen skirts have only a 
few seams; but the inside does not look well when the 
skirt is turned. Some workers prefer to cut down the 
turnings in such a way as to leave one turning of the lining 
much wider than the rest, and to fell this neatly down 
over the other edges to the lining of the skirt. This looks 
better inside, but on the outside it will now appear that 
one side of the seam is depressed and the other raised— 
always the case when the turnings are laid to one side, of 
not laid open. 
For wide gored skirts the old-fashioned plan of lining has 
its advantages in economising time and labour. ‘The front 
breadth is first basted to the lining, and the seam is then 
arranged as follows: The lined front breadth is placed face 
up on the table, under it the side gore lining is placed 
face up. Upon it the side gore (material) is placed face 
down. The four pieces thus placed are ready to be sewn 
together. The seams should be machined and _ pressed 
and the turnings trimmed down to be of unequal width, 
each a little narrower than the other, to prevent a ridge 
showing through, and when the lining and material of the 
side gore are turned over to each other it will be found that 
the seam has been made and neatened by the one length 
of sewing, as the turnings are quite hidden between lining 
and material. The material and lining of the side gore 
should be basted together and the process repeated with the 
next gore, it being always remembered that the scams must 
be pressed before turning over, as it is almost impossible 
to press them satisfactorily afterwards, and there is always 
the risk of pressing the mark of a ridge through from the 
edges of the turnings, which, as in the preceding method, 
are laid to one side, the four edges being always between 
the last pieces joined on. 
Eyery seam can be joined in the same manner, working
-P-A-G-E-142
  Lue Goreo Skirt. 129 
from each side of the front breadth backwards, the whole 
of the skirt being between the lining and material of the 
back when the last seam is made. If the back breadth 
is wide, the whole skirt can be turned right side out quite 
easily after all seams have been made: but if the backs are 
narrow and much gored, or the material is one that will 
crush easily, it is wiser to join one lining and two materials 
only in the last seam of all, and to neaten by felling the 
other lining over it. 
This method does not make an equally flat seam, and so 
does not belong to the best class of work, but it is quick, 
and keeps the material fresh, and is worth bearing in 
mind. It is, in conjunction with the preceding method 
of joining and finishing, of the greatest value for securing 
the “panel” effect desired in skirts made of many gores of 
alternating colour, one depressed and the other raised, and 
aiming at giving the effect of an upper skirt slashed to show 
an underskirt of contrasting colour beneath. 
In the best class of work, each gore is mounted on 
muslin (stiff or soft, as fashion decrees, and slightly wider 
than the outside material), and the seams are made through 
exactly the same as those of a bodice; the seams of the 
lining are joined separately, and both sets of seams separately 
pressed ; both are then tacked together at the waist and 
bottom edge with the turnings between the two, that inside 
and outside of the skirt may be equally neat. Here and there 
the lining seams are caught with tiny catch stitches to the 
seams of the outer material, to hold all closely together. 
Sometimes the lining is hemmed in by hand, one edge only 
being folded down and hemmed through the other to the 
turnings of the outer seams. The waist and bottom edge are 
then finished as usual. Cloth and other firm materials can be 
made up in this way without the muslin interlining, but with 
softer materials it is absolutely necessary if a smooth, firm 
seam is to result. This plan offers some little difficulty in 
setting-in the pocket (see page 138), but the objection may 
J
-P-A-G-E-143
130 Zxe Eremenrs or MoDERN DRESSMAKING. 
be dealt with by joining all the parts for the “ front” of the 
skirt and then cutting out one lining to it, the seams of the 
lining having been previously joined without regard to 
where they will fall. The back may be lined in the same 
way, and the two side seams joined through like those 
of a bodice, all the others being between stuff and lining. 
This is very convenient for setting-in the pocket and 
finishing the placket; but, of course, the two seams show 
on the inside, and need careful neatening. 
For unlined skirts the mantua-maker’s hem, or mantle- 
fell, is used. It makes the seam and neatens it in one 
length of stitching, but is too clumsy for thick stuffs or 
closely hanging skirts, and cannot be well pressed out. 
Mantle-fell is clumsy if made by machine, and has, there- 
fore, dropped almost entirely out of use excepting for thin 
cottons and prints. To make it, the two lengths to be joined 
are put together face to face, with one raw edge (the bias 
one) a quarter of an inch below the other. (If the straight 
edge is a selvedge, so much the better, as one turn can be 
saved, and it will make the join less bulky.) The straight 
edge is turned as for a hem, and laid down over the bias. 
It is then closely hemmed along, each stitch taking up the 
fold of the hem and the two thicknesses of the stuff below 
it, thus making and neatening the seam at the one time. 
The French or double seam has a little advantage over the 
mantua-maker’s seam in point of bulk, but does not press 
well, The French or double seam (which French workers 
call English seam) is made by placing edge to edge the two 
lengths to be joined together, the right sides of both pieces 
being outside, and machining or running very closely at a 
quarter of an inch down from the edge, or less if the 
material is a firm one and not likely to fray out. ‘The line 
of stitching is pressed, and little irregularities are pared 
away ; the lengths are then turned over, and a second line 
of stitching made as close to the edge as possible, on the 
wrong side. Care should be taken that the second row
-P-A-G-E-144
Tre Gored Skirt. 131 
of stitching is sufficiently far in from the turn to quite 
enclose the raw edges. The finished seam is not unlike 
one made in the ordinary way, with the turnings neatened 
by turning in edge to edge, and sewing down, except that 
only one line of sewing is visible inside. French seam is 
used for unlined diaphanous fabrics. Finishing the turnings 
upon themselves with a machined hem (as explained for 
washing-dresses, page 155) also calls for consideration, 
Machine and fell is only suitable for foundation skirts, as a 
second line of sewing showing through is not permitted in the 
seams of skirts proper. Drapery seams of every kind must 
be flat and pressed open—the least stiffness or obstinacy in 
the seams will spoil the natural fall of the folds; here neatness 
must give way to the outside effect, and leave the turnings 
raw-edged, or they must be only very slightly overcast. 
Lace is joined by one edge being laid upon the other, 
matching the pattern as nearly as possible, cutting the 
upper part round to th® design, and closely darning or 
overcasting it down, raw edged, to it; the turnings of 
the under part are then treated in the same way, all the 
sewing being done from the face. The extremely fine stitches 
used are set in to follow the design; if they follow each other 
evenly they show the seam by drawing the eye to it. This 
is very dainty work, more like lace-making than dress- 
making, and is not necessary where the seam falls amongst 
folds. It can then be run or stitched, opened flat, and 
finely overcast back to the outer lace. 
All selvedges must be notched across at intervals for 
seams of any kind, if they are to look smooth and flat. 
When the seams are joined, macuined, pared down, 
pressed, and neatened by overcasting or binding with 
galloon (if neatening is needed), the foot should be turned 
up in the fitting-line and basted into place, the back fulness 
set into form, the waist-band tacked on, and the skirt tried 
on, and corrected if necessary ; the skirt is then ready for 
the foot finishing,
-P-A-G-E-145

It has been stated that the bottom edge of a well-cut 
skirt should flow outward (sufficiently so, in fact, to quite 
shadow the feet when the wearer is in a standing position), 
and a skirt which does not fulfil this condition is never 
quite satisfactory. To maintain this effect, frills, flounces, 
ruches, linings of crinoline and horsehair, de/ayveuses (or 
inside frills), wadded hems and rolls, etc., are all used 
in turn, and anything in the choice of lining or in the 
finishing of the bottom edge of a skirt that allows it to 
fall soft, or that draws it close in the slightest degree, is at 
once rejected as not meeting the requirements of the garment. 
Methods of finishing which leave the edges thin are, there- 
fore, less favoured than those which leave them firm and 
full, and all hems, stiffening, etc., are cut amply wide, and 
bindings, etc., well eased on, to guard against the danger of 
drawing in, 
Straight skirts are cut longer than required, and the 
hem is simply tumed up, but with gored skirts this plan 
would necessitate laying the top edge of the hem in a series 
of little pleats, which are bulky and unsightly, and soon rub 
through in wear—a separate added (or false) hem is always 
used in good work. 
This should be eight to ten inches’ deep, rather wider 
than the skirt edge, and exactly shaped to it, as lengths on 
the straight would need fitting down by pleats at the top 
edge. Lengths on the cross are sometimes used, but 
though they do not need fitting down with the series of 
little pleats at the top as those on the straight do, they 
do not sit as smoothly as a shaped hem or facing. 
The facing should be cut the same way of the stuff as 
he skirt itself, and the joins should be as few as the width 
will permit, and always so arranged that they fall at the 
side, and never at the middle of either front or back. The 
joins should also be away from the seams, and the shaping 
of the skirt edge carefully followed. 
The joins in the facing should be made and pressed

open, the skirt then folded down the centre and pinned 
together at the waist and down each side seam, aid the 
lengths carefully checked from the already shaped waist 
down the centre of the front, down each side seam, ‘and 
down the centre of the back. For gored skirts the side 
seam is usually made half an inch longer than the front, and 
the centre of the back one inch longer than the front, but 
this will vary with fashion, and must be regulated accord- 
ingly. Walking skirts may be cut the same length all the 
way round for all figures but those with very prominent 
hips, and are so cut at the present time. Where the figure 
is one requiring variation from the usual rules, the special 
measures taken for the purpose should be used. The 
lengths should be marked with pins or chalk, and a 
slightly curved line carried from one to the other. The 
lengths should also be checked down from the waist at 
two or three other parts of the skirt, -as well as from 
the points already indicated, to ensure correctness in the 
tun of the bottom edge, and great care should be taken 
that the line does not peak either up or down at the centre 
of front and of back, but takes a straight run for a few inches 
in from the fold. (This is a fault to be specially guarded 
against in skirt making; the fold should be opened and 
laid flat after cutting, and any slight peaking up or down 
straightened off.) The bottom edge is pared away to within 
an inch of the foot-curve, and the skirt is then ready for the 
facing. Two methods of fixing this are here given, either 
of which may be used for gored skirts at the option of the 
worker. 
Ordinary Method.—The skirt is laid face upwards on 
the table, and upon it the facing, face downwards. A 
stiffening of firm book muslin, cut half an inch narrower 
than the facing, is laid above it. The three thicknesses 
are machined through half an inch below the fitting line of 
the foot, the tension of the stitch being made loose 
enough not to draw in the line of sewing. The stitching
-P-A-G-E-147
134 Tue Exements of Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
is pressed, and the stiffening and facing turned up on the 
inside of the skirt, where the turnings are pared down 
and laid downwards to the foot; the extra half-inch of 
facing is turned over the top of the stiffening and hemmed 
down to the lining only of the skirt. The bottom braid, or 
a binding of bias velveteen, is then laid to the skirt edge 
and run along, and finally turned over and hemmed along 
the inside to finish. The custom of finishing bottom edges 
in this way, and putting a piped cording of silk between, 
dates from the times when skirts were plain, full, and long, 
and carried in the hand, and when the bottom edge was 
therefore an object of special attention and careful finish. 
Folding the braid and sewing it in between skirt and facing 
is no doubt a survival of the methods then found most 
useful ; but with ordinary walking dresses the braid wears 
out before the material, and should be put onin such a wey 
that it may easily be removed and renewed. 
High-class Method.—By this method the facing is 
prepared and joined, and the stiffening (cut the required 
depth without turnings) also prepared and joined. The 
bottom edge of the skirt should be turned up in the fitting- 
line over the stiffening, and tacked round or herring-boned 
down to the lining only through it, the facing fixed into 
place alittle above the skirt bottom and hemmed on at the 
lower edge, the top edge of the facing turned over the 
stiffening and hemmed through it to the lining, and the 
velvet binding or braid folded and run on to complete. This 
method is much the best to use for circular skirts, which 
are apt to drop at the sides and back and to require oc- 
casional shortening off (for alterations of this kind hand- 
work is much easier to open and replace than machine 
stitching), and is for all skirts a very complete finish. 
Firm stiffenings should be bound over the edges with 
strips of soft muslin on the cross. With horsehair, this is 
quite necessary, or it soon cuts through. 
The upper edge of the stiffening—always an eyesore ina
-P-A-G-E-148
THE Gorevd SKIRT. 135 
plain skirt, however carefully arranged—is a trifle less con- 
spicuous if it is enclosed in the hem. The “push” of the- 
top is then inward, rather than outward, and shows less 
than it does when tacked into the skirt itself, With stiffen- 
ings of horsehair this is a consideration, as it is very stiff, 
even when it is cut on the cross. 
The use of stiffening in the skirt edge was carried to 
extremes during the time (1890-1900) that quite plain skirts 
were worn. French canvas and fibre chamois were used, 
shaped to the gores as high as the knee (often higher at the 
back). The pieces were laid to the wrong side of the lining 
and machined to it along the top edge. When made up, the 
stiffening fell between stuff and lining and kept the hem of 
the skirt wide and firm. 
The bottom edges of lined velvet or velveteen skirts 
should not be faced up with their own material, but with 
silk or some other smooth finishing. The same applies to 
skirts of lace, net, gauze, and other thin, soft fabrics that 
would easily rub through or tear.* Washing skirts should 
not be lined through, but should only have a deep hem at 
the bottom. 
Trained skirts should be full enough to flow easily, but 
not so much so as to be heavy, and the back breadth should 
be shaped as explained (page 118), which takes three widths 
of silk ; the front and side gores may be cut wider in the 
bottom edge, as the train may draw the skirt in at the feeta 
litle, if heavy. The length of the front and also of the back 
from the waist being ascertained, the widths of material should 
be cut accordingly, those for the sides being cut half-way 
between the lengths of the others. The widths are joined 
from the waist down, and the hips, waist, and the bottom 
* Elegant skirts are further finished at the foot with an insi le frill of 
silk about six inches deep, and on the cross, or cut across from selvedge to 
selvedge if on the straight, hemmed at the lower edge and lace-trimmed, 
or pinked out at both edges. Once anda half the width of the skirt is allowed 
for this frill, and it is set in between two rows of gathering about half an inch 
below its top edge.

136 Tus Excemenrs or Movern Dressataxive. 
edge widths carefully checked, as already directed. The 
surplus length of each side gore is then curved off from the 
length of the front breadth to the side seam, where the sur- 
plus length of the back breadth is also curved off as far as 
the centre one of the three widths, the bottom of which 
should only be slightly rounded, not sloped off in a sharp 
peak. A shaped facing of the outside material or of firm silk 
is required, which should reach to the level of six inches 
above the ground all the way round, and thus is deepest in 
the train ; and a silk piping or a thick cord is used at the 
edge instead of a bottom braid. This latter should be held 
easy for the edge, and overcast to it with silk which matches 
in colour ; it will then roll over and conceal the sewing-on. 
It is best to finish the bottom edge before setting-in the 
pocket, as the slight bulk of the latter increases the difficulty 
of measuring out both sides of the skirt exactly the same 
length ; but when this has been done the placket should be 
finished to be ready for the belt, and the pocket set-in and 
finished off. 
Pocke's and plackets are admitted into dressmaking as 
necessary evils, and some very particular wearers endeavour 
to dispense with either or both, resorting to various expe- 
dients to accomplish this end, with varying success. One of 
these expedients is to have the pocket in the underskirt or 
the foundation skirt, and to lift the dress skirt bodily each 
time it is necessary to get to purse or handkerchief ; but this 
plan is not generally liked, and it is considered better to have 
an opening in the skirt just at that part which will allow the 
hand to be most readily introduced into the under-pocket, a 
troublesome plan where there are many folds, amongst which 
the pocket opening gets lost ; with plain skirts it is often sewn 
to the edge of the placket wrap—when such skirts are fashion- 
able, outside pockets, prettily made and ornamented, and 
fastened to the waist by ribbons, are almost sure to be used. 
The pockets generally in use in dressmaking are either 
flat or bag; the shapes may vary a little, but on the whole
-P-A-G-E-150
Due Gorev Sxirz. 137 
will be found to be much alike. (Where the pocket is 
meant to fall inside the skirt it should be as flat as possible, 
and the setting-in so arranged as to leave the opening a 
close slit, not a wide hole, especially if the upper part of 
the skirt is plain and the opening well forward on the 
figure.) 
‘The flat pocket is usually about fifteen inches long and 
eight wide when it is finished, and the slit, about seven 
inches long, should begin about two inches down from the 
top. 
The pocket should be made of bodice lining, black, 
backed if the skirt is dark and has a dark lining, and the 
pocket is to come quite inside the skirt; a piece of the 
dark skirt lining or foundation material should not be used, 
if only out of consideration for the wearer’s pocket-handker- 
chief. It is now usual to cut the pockets with a seam down 
the front (where the mouth comes) having turnings an inch 
wide. It much simplifies the setting-in with plain skirts if 
these turnings and those of the pieces facing the mouth 
are selvedge-edged. The pieces of lining being cut, the 
place for the slit should be marked; a piece of the dress 
material about eight inches long and four or more inches 
wide should be laid over the piece for the back of the 
pocket on the right side, the four edges neatly turned under, 
machined, and pressed. The back of the pocket needs 
the piece of material to face it on the inside, that the 
pocket opening may show the material, and therefore be 
less likely to attract the eye. The mouth should be faced 
with strips eight inches long and three wide, and the seam 
machined with turnings to the outside of the pocket, the 
seven inches for the mouth being left tacked. 
The edges are closed by French seam, the pieces should 
be laid together with the faced parts outside for the first 
line of stitching, that the seam may come outside when the 
second line has been made ; and a length of firm ribbon or 
Paris binding should be put between the two sides
-P-A-G-E-151
138 Zee Erements oF MopERN DRESSMAKING, 
at the top of the pocket, and sewn in with them. When 
the pocket is turned the ribbon will be securely and 
neatly sewn to the top and will be ready for sewing to 
the waist-band, to take the weight of the pocket from 
the seam. 
The setting-in depends on the finish of the skirt seams. 
With a flat seam the pocket opening should be left tacked, 
but the turnings should be pressed and neatened. ‘The 
pocket should be laid against the inside of the skirt, and 
pocket mouth and opening fitted carefully and exactly to- 
gether, Each side should be firmly backstitched in, the 
line of sewing to be made half an inch back into the 
turnings of pocket and skirt seams. There must not be 
any sewing across either end, only down the sides. 
With foundation skirts the line of sewing on each side 
must run exactly in the fold of the skirt seam, or the finish- 
ing of the outer draperies against it will be much complicated 
and very unsatisfactory in effect. 
After the pocket is securely sewn in, a small silk loop 
should be worked across each end of the opening to prevent 
tearing down; the seams should be pressed and overcast, 
the ribbon from the top fixed to the waistband, and the 
upper corners of the pocket attached to the lining of the 
skirt by a fan of five or seven stitches, to keep it flat and in 
position. The pocket should be fixed easy in the width for 
the skirt, or it will keep the sides of the opening apart. 
This method of setting-in is quite easy if the skirt seams are 
made through, but is less so if the turnings are between, 
as those of the lining have then to be snipped at top and 
bottom of the opening to bring them to the inside, which 
weakens them. To obviate this, that part of the skirt which 
is to carry the pocket is strengthened ; extra pieces of lining 
are made in with the outer stuff, and the pocket set into 
the outside only, the lining seams being closed al! the way 
up and the pocket falling between lining and skirt. With 
thin stuffs this might show the edges of the pocket through
-P-A-G-E-152

too plainly, and so it is allowed to go quite inside 
the lining, the fold of which is then hemmed down 
on each side of the setting-in to quite cover the raw-edged 
turnings. 
Flat pockets lie equally under both sides of the seam or 
opening, and certainly fill up the skirt less when used to- 
wards the front or sides of the figure; but there are styles in 
skirts where bag pockets are more suitable, as with seams 
very far back in the skirt, under folds to which the corners 
of a flat pocket cannot be attached, or where it is preferred 
that the pocket should lie under one side of the seam-only, 
as with draped foundation skirts. 
‘The mouth of the bag pocket is at the side, instead of on 
the face as in the flat pocket. It is faced with pieces of 
material about three inches wide and a little longer than the 
mouth, the pocket is then made by French seam, or simply 
machined round and the turnings overcast or bound. In 
cutting these pockets the seam should be carried the length 
of the side and made up with the turnings oulside as 
explained for flat pockets ; these are sewn to the turnings of 
the skirt-seam, the sewing being continued up each side 
to the turnings of the closed skirt seam until the top is 
reached, where it should be attached to the waist-band by 
a ribbon and finished off in every respect as already ex- 
plained. (If the opening for the pocket must be cut in 
the skirt, instead of being left in a seam, a flat pocket should 
be used.) . 
Pockets cannot be satisfactorily set into the upper. part 
of a plainly fitting skirt (¢¢., one without waist fulness at any 
part); where these skirts are made with separate foundations, 
a patch pocket of single silk about eight inches deep, and set 
wide, is sewn to the outside of the foundation below the 
right knee, just above the facing and foot-frill, and serves 
to carry the handkerchief. 
Wherever and whenever it is possible to have it so, the 
pocket and placket should be made in a seam, as it allows

better turnings and gives a better hold, and is more econom- 
ical where the possibility of having to alter the dress and 
utilise the parts in some other way has to be taken into con- 
sideration. With gathered, pleated, or other full backs the 
placket opening can be made at the left-hand side, where 
the back breadth joins the side gore. Skirts with in- 
verted pleats have the opening at the back or at the 
left side of the first seam, where the opening for the fitting 
skirt is usually placed. But, wherever it may be placed, 
the method of finishing varies very little. The opening is 
made amply long to allow the dress to slip on easily, ten 
inches being the usual length. 
The right-hand side is faced-in for two or three inches 
with a strip of the material, which is run on to the turn- 
ings outside the fitting-line, turned over in the fitting-line, 
and hemmed back to the lining; or the skirt edge is turned 
in and the facing hemmed against it at both edges. 
The left side is finished with a strip of the material about 
four inches wide which is run on half an inch or more 
beyond the fitting-line, pressed, turned over and hemmed 
just on the line of sewing, thus leaving a flap or false hem 
of double material one and.a half inches wide to fall under 
the opening and prevent gaping. ‘The bottom of the flap is 
curved off and either bound or turned in edge to edge and 
overcast ; the end is then caught to the lining under the 
right side, to assist still further the inclination to close. A 
silk loop is worked across the lower ends to prevent tearing 
down. ‘The top of the flap is finished in the same way as 
the other part of the waist. 
The placket is generally secured by a hook sewn mid- 
way under the right-hand side and a silk loop to correspond 
on the left; a lengthways button-hole made in the seam 
where the flap is sewn on, with a small rough button sewn 
to the facing under the right-hand side, has, however, 
much to recommend it, making a firmer and less visible 
closing. For front plackets the lately invented spring or
-P-A-G-E-154
Txe Gorep Sxirr. I4l 
press buttons make the best closing. The wrap and facing 
should be of thin single silk to reduce bulk, 
The waist band is prepared by turning a hem at one 
end to agree with the width of the wrap, hemming it and 
sewing two strong skirt eyes outside, the sewing to be just 
on the hem, that the doubled part of the belting may extend 
beyond the eyes. Another eye is then sewn on the doubled 
part quite close to the end. From the eyes the size of 
the waist is measured, and a narrow hem, just wide enough 
to carry two hooks, turned over and hemmed down, and 
the hooks sewn on inside. A third hook should be sewn 
on to correspond to the single eye on the placket part 
of the belt. Hooks and eyes should be overcast on as 
explained in the chapter on Stitches (page 105). The 
band, when fastened, should be exactly the-size of the 
wearer’s waist. 
The waist of the skirt should be prepared according 
to the method of finishing which it is intended to use. In 
the case of lined skirts, stuff and lining are already tacked 
together by the waistline, the back gathers should be 
drawn up ready for setting on, or the pleats made and 
firmly overcast together quite ready for the band. The 
deep hem at the left-hand end, which is to serve for 
banding the placket wrap, should be pinned into place, 
the ends of the eyes just level with the fitting-line of the 
seam, The band and the waist of the skirt are then divided. 
If the placket is at the centre of the back, and the whole 
back breadth is to be set into a space of three or four 
inches, half that quantity should be taken from each end 
of the belt, measuring from the ends of the hooks and eyes. 
The portions for the back are pinned to each side seam, 
and the rest of the band folded, the centre fold, marked 
with a line of small white cross-stitches, being placed to the 
middle of the front breadth. If the placket is at the side, the 
portion of belt for the back is measured off and pinned 
to the side seam (the placket wrap portion being first pinned

into place as before), and the remainder of the band divided 
and the centre placed to the middle of the front, as already 
explained. 
The top of the back breadth should be banded first ; 
if pleated, it should be large enough to be well cased to 
the band, and the sewing on of the latter (back and front), 
whether it is seamed, run, or hemmed, should be started 
from the centre, working round to each side seam, the dress 
being held towards the worker and the band away from her. 
The waist of the front breadth, if it is cut to fit without 
pleats or gathers, should be slightly eased into the belt or 
band ; and the same holds good of the side gores, especially 
that half of each which will fall upon the curve of the hips 
and behind them. 
With some fashions the disposal of the top of the back 
breadth is a matter of serious consideration. If the back is 
to be draped or lifted in any way below the waist, small 
gathers should be used, and the whole top set into a space 
of one-sixth of the waist. With undraped skirts, however, 
the back should be set into a smaller space one-cighth of 
the waist being considered ample ; and when the breadths 
are wide and unshaped, it is sometimes a question how to 
pack all the fulness into the space. The large gathers are 
then of great value, as they lic close and use up material 
very rapidly, and fall into deep folds that keep the back 
from swinging forward at the sides. 
For large gathers the top of the back breadth should be 
turned in edge to edge, and either run along or overcast 
closely ; it should then be gathered from one side seam to 
the other ‘on strong thread or (preferably) strong silk the 
colour of the dress—a length of button-hole twist serves 
admirably. This should be well fastened on at the be- 
ginning, and the stitch may be from one inch long to the 
length ofan ordinary needle on the outside, and a quarter 
of an inch or less on the inside. When all tne top is 
gathered, it should be very closely drawn up on the silk

or thread, the latter being wound over and under a pin put 
in at the end to hold it firmly, the gathers regulated, and 
the inside edges fastened together by a row of firm chain- 
stitching or backstitching. The back is then ready to be 
fastened to the band by seaming to it from the inside, each 
gather being secured by at least two or three firm stitches. 
Strong thread or twist should be used, and care taken that 
each stitch takes up both material and lining as well as s band, 
and that all the gathers are set into 
the space of the band reserved for the 
back. 
If pleated, the pleats should be 
laid, pinned, and basted down, and 
the upper edges firmly and strongly 
overcast together, the utmost care being 
taken to include every part of every 
pleat in the sewing. This is no easy Fig. s4.< Lares Gathers 
matter, as the stitches naturally draw Set. on Broad Blase. 
the inside and outside top edges to- 
gether, missing the pleats between. The top may be left 
raw-edged if the waist is to be bound or finished in any way 
that will cover it down; but if it is to be seamed to the band, 
or corded down, it is best to turn the top in edge to edge, 
as explained above for gathers, before pleating. 
The problem of finishing the front of the waist, to have 
it perfectly neat inside and out, with the minimum of bulk, 
is one of serious importance to the worker, especially as 
changes of fashion continually necessitate changes of method. 
Where belting is used, and the skirt seams are joined 
separately from those of the lining, the neatest plan is to 
turn the top of skirt and lining in edge to edge, turning in 
only a quarter of an inch (or less), and tacking together ; 
the skirt can then be seamed to the band, and if the worker 
has been careful to take both stuff and lining on her needle 
at every stitch, the finish will be neat, secure, and flat. 
Where the making of the skirt seams puts this method 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
144 Tue Erementrs or MovernN DRESSMAKING. 
of banding the waist out of the question, it is sometimes 
finished by laying the raw edge of the skirt waist outside the 
band, about a quarter of an inch above the edge, and firmly 
stitching it through; a length of galloon is then hemmed 
along—one edge to the band and one edge covering the raw 
edges and the line of sewing, to strengthen and neaten all. 
The galloon must be slightly eased to the belting in the 
hemming, and where it is intended to use this method of 
finishing it is a saving of time and labour to machine the 
galloon to the band before joining the latter to the skirt. 
With double belting the setting-on is much the same ; 
the skirt is stitched to 
the under part of the 
belting and the upper 
part then laid down 
and hemmed through 
to neaten. This belt- 
ing is sewn to the 
skirt before the ends 
are turned and 
finished for the 
fastenings. Straight beluing should be used for skirts that 
are to be worn with blouses or cotton shirts, as it keeps 
them well up into the waist. Curved belting should only 
be used if the bodice extends some few inches below the waist. 
Cording the waist is a very neat way of finishing for 
those who object to banding. A strip of the material on 
the cross, an inch wide, is prepared, and the piping cord 
laid on one edge, which is turned, and tacked down over it. 
The cording thus prepared is then laid to the outside of the 
skirt waist, with the corded edge down (towards the bottom 
edge), and the broad raw edge of the strip upwards, and a 
line of firm stitching is taken through to the inside of the 
skirt and close down to the cording. When this is done 
the cord is pressed back to stand up, and the broad turning 
of the cross strip turned under, and hemmed along to the 
  Fig. 15,—Cording the Waist.

lining inside the skirt top. This plan turns down a quarter 
of an inch of the skirt top, and if the back breadth is pleated 
raw-edged, makes rather too much bulk there. If, however, 
the material and lining have been turned in edge to edge 
before pleating, and firmly overcast together afterwards, the 
sewing on of the cording can be to the extreme top edge, 
and all undue bulk avoided. 
Binding the waist with a cross strip either of the material 
or of silk, zeithout the cord, would not serve, as it would 
soon stretch, and spoil the fit and hang of the skirt ; a firm 
straight ribbon should be used, if the cord is not liked. 
When the waist is bound to leave a binding visible, 
a narrow ribbon (galloon or Paris binding) is laid against 
the outside of the skirt a quarter of an inch below the top 
raw edge, and strongly run and backstitched or machined 
along quite close to the purl; the ribbon is then turned 
over the top, and firmly hemmed against the line of 
stitching on the inside. Finished in this way, the ribbon 
shows as a binding or narrow belt above the skirt waist. 
Where it is desired to bind the top of the skirt with this 
firm ribbon, yet in such a way that the ribbon shall not 
show as a binding or narrow belt above it, it may be put on 
as explained above, but about two inches of extra length 
should be eased on or made into tiny pleats at the front 
and sides to allow it to turn over easily, and lie flat to the 
inside of the skirt waist. Pleats or easing must be used— 
if the ribbon is put on at the top without some extra fulness 
and then turned quite down and hemmed, it will apparently 
sit well to the skirt until the latter comes to be worn, 
when it will appear very full and drawn-looking for some dis- 
tance below the waist, instead of lying smoothly to the figure. 
Ribbon fer binding skirt waists should be firm and 
strong, but very narrow—half an inch is wide enough unless 
it is intended to fold and use it double. A wide ribbon 
does not differ from a couble belting in any respect, but 
that of wearing out more quickly. .

Skirts are now almost invariably supported, being 
fastened to the bodice by one or two hooks and eyes, sewn 
respectively to the skirt back and the bodice band. The 
_ hooks should be sewn to the bodice band, half-way between 
the curved and centre back seams if two are used, or across 
the back seam only if “nautilus” hooks and eyes are 
preferred. ‘They are sewn on with the hooked or turned 
part downward, placed as usual (as if intended to fasten 
the bodice to the inner clothing, not turned towards the 
bodice itself) ; and when the eyes are sewn on by the two 
little rings to the skirt belt they will be found quite easy to 
fasten. 
At from eight to ten inches below the waist the back 
breadth needs some slight restraint to keep it from falling 
to the sides. Sometimes this is arranged by sewing a tape 
to each side seam and tying across. With foundation skirts 
a broad piece of tape is machined along both edges across 
the back breadth, making a slot through which a runner of 
tape is carried, and tied across to confine the back into 
place. Occasignally the tape is securely stitched to the 
seam at each end of the slot, and drawn up in the middle 
through a hole made in the slot-tape for that purpose, to 
relieve the wearer of the feeling of constraint in walking 
which the tied tapes always give ; and sometimes a length 
of broad (garter) elastic is run in the slot, and tying alto- 
gether dispensed with. 
With lined skirts the runner and slot cannot be used, 
but after the waist has been fixed to the band by the large 
gathers, as explained, the gathers themselves, at about eight 
to ten inches below the waist, should be set on a length of 
broad elastic or tape from eight to ten inches long, and 
already hemmed at both ends. Elastic is preferable to 
tape, as, being yielding, it is less likely to tear away; it 
should be put inside the skirt, and the groove of each deep 
gather pinned to it (spreading the gathers apart to make 
them fill the length of the tape, and spacing them nicely) ;
-P-A-G-E-160
THE Goren Sxirr. 147 
each gather is then secured by two or three catch stitches, 
the hemmed ends being left free to avoid showing “ pull.” 
Pleats should be caught down to a tape or elastic in the 
same way, the catch-stitches being taken through the inner 
fold of each pleat only; and even trained skirts are none 
the worse for some slight restraint, as it tends to confine the 
flow to the centre of the back (where it is most required), 
and so prevents the lower part of the front. of the skirt 
being drawn in to the feet by the drag of the train on the 
bottom edge. 
When the dress consists of skirt and banded bodice 
sewn together at the waist (as with nurses’ uniforms and 
housemaids’ dresses), the manner of arranging that the 
front opening of the bodice and the placket of the skirt 
shal! both be available is a very puzzling affair to the in- 
experienced worker. ‘There are, of course, various methods 
of arrangement, but as a general rule the raw-edged waist 
of the bodice is set between a band of the stuff about one 
and a half inches wide and some inches longer than the 
waist measure of the wearer, the extra length left. beyond. 
the right-hand front of the bodice. The top of the skirt 
is overcast and turned down a quarter of an inch, after 
which it is fixed to the lower edge of the band, and the 
back and the whole of the skirt waist seamed to it, the 
placket opening being made in the first front seam, to the 
wearer’s left hand. The left side of the front breadth should 
be seamed to the extra length of band allowed. Whentin 
wear, the left half of the front fastens across ; the placket 
finishing is as usual. 
Foundation Skirts—The gores for a foundation skirt 
should be neatly run and felled down by machine (the 
pocket space being left open), the darts machined and 
opened, and each side felled back, or overcast and 
ptessed flat. The waist should be turned over half an 
inch (the turnings to come to the outside of the skirt) 
and tacked down, the skirt then. placed. on the table and

folded carefully in half from the centre of the front, the 
waist pinned together, and the lengths of front, back, 
and side very carefully checked down and the bottom 
edge shaped as already explained, the exccss length being 
cut away, and an inch all the way round left for turnings. 
An outside facing and an inside hem, both of the out- 
side material, should next be prepared, and carefully fitted 
to the bottom edge of the skirt, the outside facing being 
a couple of inches deeper than the inside hem—the latter 
is sometimes of the foundation material in inferior work. 
The upper edges of both hem and facing should be 
turned under and pressed down ready for hemming, and then 
the two should be adjusted to the skirt edge in the following 
manner. The facing is put on the outside of the skirt 
face up (or as it will be when completed) ; outside this the 
inside hem is placed face down and the muslin stiffening 
(if used) above it—the three (or four) thicknesses are then 
tacked together, and machined through at the lower edge, 
just half an inch below the length allowed for in checking 
down. The sewing is then pressed, the skirt turned up at its 
correct length, the turnings pressed to lie downwards, and 
the inside hem, now half an inch above the edge on the 
inside of the skirt, tacked into place and machined through, 
and finally the outside facing machined down, hiding the 
sewing-on of the inside hem completely. The outside edge is 
then trimmed with a flounce or pleating of the outside fabric 
from six to eight inches deep. If the foundation skirt is of 
silk the outside facing is often omitted, and the flounce or 
pleating is of the foundation silk, not of the outside fabric. 
For foundation skirts the bottom braid is generally run 
on at the edge and then turned over and hemmed to the 
inside facing, or it is doubled and run on in one sew- 
ing. Where curved flounces are used as the lower part ot 
a foundation skirt, the lower edge of skirt and upper edge 
of flounce are counter-hemmed upon each other, and the 
lower edge of the flounce corded to give it substance.
-P-A-G-E-162

The back breadths are next gathered or pleated up, and 
the whole of the waist closely seamed to the belt, the 
pocket, faced and finished, firmly stitched into the seam, 
the inside turnings overcast, and thé placket facing run 
on. The skirt is then ready for the overskirt or draperies. 
The skirt is hung on a dress-stand for the better adjust- 
ment of the overskirt, and the pleats from the waist are 
spread slightly, that the whole back breadth may measure 
about one-eighth of the hips across at the level of the placket 
end. The back should be firmly stitched down ‘at this 
width, and again half-way between this and the waist, the 
stitches being taken over the edges of each pleat, and either 
through to an elastic or tape as for lined skirts, or only 
to the material itself—it being no serious objection in a 
foundation skirt if stitches show through, as long as they 
are neatly and regularly made. 
The lower parts of the draperies or overskirt should be 
already hemmed, trimmed, and finished as far as practicable 
apart from the foundation. It should then be arranged into 
place, pinned or tacked (raw edged) along the waist of the 
foundation, just below the belt, the raw edge of the drapery 
placket fixed to that of the skirt, and the flap already sewn 
on turned over it and hemmed firmly down. 
The ribbon from the belt is next turned down over the 
raw edges and hemmed firmly through, making all neat and 
secure. Short overskirts are lifted by the wearer when the 
pocket is to be used, but with long ones, or draperies, it is 
advisable to make the opening through from the outside. It 
there is a seam in the overskirt or drapery to correspond 
with the one below in which the pocket is set, it saves 
cutting, Otherwise the drapery is carefully pinned to the 
foundation alt round the pocket mouth, a slit cut, and the 
edges turned under and carefully slip-stitched down. Great 
care is taken that it is not pulled or strained at any part, as 
that would cause the pocket mouth to draw open when the 
skirt is in wear. With fitting skirts these rather compli-

150 Zwe Exements or Movern DReESsMAKING. 
cated arrangements of the back fulness, pocket opening, 
and placket are not needed, the pocket being arranged on 
the foundation as already explained. 
There are generally two hangers to a skirt. They are 
about six inches long, and made of Paris binding or 
galloon, and are hemmed in at each end just at the lower 
edge of the belt, along the top of the gore nearest the back 
breadth. They should be easy for the belt, that they may 
not draw it up, and should be very strongly sewn on. 
Bottom braids vary in width and quality; it is very 
poor economy to choose a cheap one. Those of black 
and fast colours are plunged into boiling water to shrink 
them, as they are apt to shrink on the skirt if they get 
wet, and so draw up the bottom edge, to the great detri- 
ment of the hang and appearance of the skirt. With 
colours specially matched to the material this treatment 
might not prove safe, and the alternatives are to press the 
braid thoroughly with a hot iron through a wet cloth, or to 
hold it in the steam of a fast-boiling kettle till thoroughly 
saturated with moisture, and then iron dry, always taking 
care to ease the braid on well when running it on, as a 
further security against shrinking. Firm, close, fine braid 
should be chosen; soft bulky ones rub through very quickly. 
The use of cross strips of velveteen for bottom edge 
bindings is a great improvement on plain braid, as the 
velveteen both wears and looks better. One of the best 
braids at present in use has a chenille thread run along 
the centre of the length, and when folded and sewn in it 
combines the advantages of braid and velvet. 
Shirt Difficulties —Sbould the front fall full between the 
feet, it has been too much gored at the top, or too much 
hollowed there, in proportion to the bottom. The remedy 
would be to take off some of the slope, thus narrowing the 
bottom; or to decrease the hollowing by filling up, or by 
cutting away a little of the stuff all round the waist, except 
at the hollowed part.
-P-A-G-E-164
Tue Gorep Sxirr. 1g 
If it falls in to the heels, either the back breadth is 
too scanty or the side seams (where it joins the side gores) 
are too far forward on the figure, or the front of the skirt is 
too narrow in the bottom width. Increasing the width of 
the back breadth, setting in a wider front, should remove 
the defect. It must not be forgotten that a straight 
(unshaped) back breadth always falls close at the foot. 
Draping across the hips-is caused. by the skirt not 
being hollowed enough at the waist of the front and the 
side gores. 
Straining across the hips appears if the skirt has not 
been hollowed sufficiently at the waist, or if the gores are 
too straight for the figure ; or if the hips-measure used is too 
close, or the skirt is tied back too closely. 
If the skirt is too long, the obvious remedy is to shorten 
it at the bottom edge, which does not affect the fit round 
the hips so much as shortening at the waist, though the 
latter must be resorted to if the bottom edge is much 
trimmed, . 
If it is too short, it is best to let down any waist or 
bottom-edge turnings, if possible; if not, to set on a false 
hem, hiding it by a flounce or band of trimming. 
Twisting round the knees is often caused by the wearer 
having an under-skirt wider than the dress-skirt itself, but 
is also a fault that may arise from joining the seams badly,* 
or cutting-off the lengths badly at the start. Drapers gener- 
ally run the arm forward at a slant or slight curve when 
cutting off lengths of material, and a careful worker will 
measure her lengths down from the shortest side of the 
slant, and fold very carefully for cutting off, pinning the 
selvedge edges together to make the fold run to a thread, 
and finally paring away the little surplus piece of slant. If 
this precaution is neglected, and the lengths are measured 
down each side of the selvedge from the slant, the skirt will 
be inclined to twist, and also to lift at one side, which is 
* See Seams Running Awry, p. 54.
-P-A-G-E-165
152 Lue Erements or Mopern Dressmakine. 
most provoking when repeated careful measuring fails to 
detect any difference between the lengths of both sides. 
The defect is one difficult to remedy, but is best dealt with 
by opening the seam and letting down the defective edge, if 
the fashion in which the dress is made will permit it. 
Corpulent figures usually need a skirt longer at the front 
than at the back, and wearers with large hips need extra 
length at the sides down the middle of each gore. In such 
cases side and back measures should be taken as well as 
front, and the skirt checked by them from the waist down. 
Tf the front is longer than the back, the figure will be 
prominent below the waist. The front breadth should not 
be hollowed out, but a curved dart, from a half to three- 
quarters of an inch on the double, or from one to one and 
a half inches across altogether, and about three inches long, 
should be put in on the fold of the front, which often gives 
the required difference in length without cutting the front 
longer ; it may be taken up in the lining only, and the stuff 
smoothed out over it, if so preferred. 
One plan of dealing with extra long fronts of this class 
is to cut the front breadth of the skirt one-half or three- 
quarters of an inch longer than the selvedge edge of the side 
gores, hollow the waist as usual, and ease the surplus length 
allowed into the seams over a space of about five inches 
below the waist when joining the gores. This plan gives 
the extra length required without the inclination to drop in 
between the feet. 
A large hip dart (three inches wide) will sometimes 
give the extra side length required for full hips ; where this 
‘is not sufficient it must be allowed in the gore itself, adding 
it at the bottom edge. Hips are seldom so large that the 
centre back of the skirt cannot be left the same length as 
the side seams; but if this stou/d happen, the shortening 
should be made at the waist of the side gore from the 
dart backwards, and the back breadth cut to correspond 
with it in the length.

WASHING-DRESSES. 
Bodices for Washing—Styles for Washing-Dresses Suitable Linings— 
Wadding—Cotton for Sewing preferable to Silk—Facings and Inside 
Bindings— Buttons to be preferred to Hooks and Eyes—The Belt— 
The Skirt and its Lining—How to provide for Shrinking—Back 
Gathers and Skirt Belt, etc, 
Dresses that will need washing at intervals must be made 
in such a way that they will come through the ordeals of 
washing, drying, and ironing with as little detriment to their 
wearing qualities and appearance as possible. To secure 
this, the inside finishings chosen and the manner of making 
up must differ from those used for ordinary woollen 
dresses, 
Bodices for washing-dresses should be made in a style 
that will wash and get up easily, and should, if possible, be 
cut a few inches below the waist to allow for shrinking. The 
style should be loose and full, or set in pleats or tucks. 
Unlined blouses are certainly the easiest to wash, but where 
a lining is required it is an advantage to have it arranged to 
fasten separately from the stuff, the latter being folded or 
drawn across to conceal the closing entirely. Plain close- 
fitting bodices seldom wash satisfactorily, so fat as the fitting 
is concerned. 
Linings with black backs should never be used, nor 
should they be of a colour likely to run in washing. Grey 
zephyr should be used for very dark or black prints, 
and calico, white silesia, or lawn for light colours. Calico 
for linings should be soaked over-night in warm water to
-P-A-G-E-167
154 Tue Evemenrs or Moperw DRESSMAKING. 
shrink it thoroughly, and then ironed smooth again before 
being cut. Very hard calico should be washed or scalded. 
Wadding should not be used between lining and stuff. 
If the figure requires it, it should be made as a separate 
padding between two pieces of white sarcenet, and tacked 
inside the finished dress ; it can then be easily removed for 
washing. - 
The outside material should not be stretched on the 
lining, or only very slightly, to minimise possible shrinking. 
All the sewing (including the button-holes) should be done 
with cotton; silk changes colour in washing, and so is un- 
suitable for either seams or outside work, and should not 
be used. For the same reason—v.e., that silk washes badly 
——the seams should be overcast, or turned in edge to edge 
and run, in preference to binding (the latter is often done, 
the look of the binding after washing not being considered 
of very great importance in comparison with the protection 
it gives the edges of the turnings). 
It is advisable to use a rather loose tension in all the 
machining, as the sewing-cotton is apt to shrink more than 
the material itself, and produce a slight puckering which 
cannot be ironed away. 
All the sewing should be fine and firm, and all hems and 
seams thoroughly turned. Raw edges should not be left 
anywhere, if possible, and where unavoidable by reason of 
bulk (as in the sewing-in of the pocket), should be very 
closely overcast. Slip-stitching in any form is quite unsuit- 
able for this class of work, and should never be used in a 
washing-dress at all. 
All facings and inside bindings should be of the outside 
material instead of silk or sarcenet ; and the bone-casings 
wash better if of fine tape (though white Paris binding is 
often employed). The bones should only be lightly tacked 
in, that they may be quickly removed and replaced. Any 
linen or stiffening should be white or “ whitey-brown,” and 
collars should be stiffened with two or. four thicknesses of
-P-A-G-E-168
WasHine-DR&ssEs. 155 
good, firm check muslin: the sewing is less likely to give 
if they are made and put on by the method given on 
page 20. 
Hooks and eyes should not be used, as they do not wash 
well, and may show a rust-stain through from the drying. 
Buttons are preferred, but as they are likely to break or press 
a hole in the bodice during the washing process, they should 
be removed each time the dress is washed; and as constant 
cutting-off and sewing-on weakens the stuff, they are not 
simply sewn on as for woollens, but eyelet-holes should be 
worked for the button-shanks to pass through, and the 
buttons threaded on a tape passed through the shanks inside 
the bodice, and then caught across each eyelet with a few 
firm stitches to prevent the strain on the button, when 
fastened, bringing the tape through the hole. Flat buttons 
perforated with holes should still be sewn to the tape, the 
stitching going through the eyelet-holes. 
The belt should be white or grey, and fastened with a 
buckle, or a check-string of tape, long enough to tie, used 
instead. Hangers should be made of either white ribbon 
or tape, according with the bone-casings. 
Skirts are preferably made without lining at all, and 
when so made the hem should be deep and securely 
machined or hemmed through—never invisibly hemmed. 
Where it is not possible to dispense with the lining altogether 
(as with flounced and draped skirts) it is best made asa 
separate foundation skirt, and finished quite separately from 
the outer material. The seams should be joined by French 
seam, or the turnings turned in edge to edge and run 
together, or each one separately turned over and neatly 
hemmed back (upon itself, not through the skirt). It is an 
accepted formula in dressmaking to join the seams of a 
washing-skirt by putting the edges together with the bias 
edge a little below the selvedge, and running or machining, 
afterwards turning the selvedge down over the raw edge of 
the bias and hemming it through to make the seam neat
-P-A-G-E-169
156 Zwe Exremenrs or Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
and secure without too many thicknesses of turnings; but 
for really good work selvedge edges should be cut entirely 
away, unless notched across (see page 131), as they draw up 
in washing. 
The top should be closely overcast and turned over a 
quarter of an inch before seaming to the belt, if single’belting 
is used, but double belting, binding over with tape or ribbon, 
or finishing with a crosswise piping, is neater and more 
secure. Shrinking in the length of the skirt is an awkward 
thing to provide for. If the top is turned over, it is bulky 
below the waist, and the line of stitching weakens the stuff, 
and is likely to show unless the bodice is a long one, or if 
it also has shrunk. Tucks are not always liked, cr in 
fashion, and when let down they show the line of the 
stitching, unless the latter is very lightly put in at the first ; 
letting down the hem makes a false hem necessary, and 
there is the same likelihood of the line of stitching showing, 
and some possible wearing of the bottom edge as well, to 
take into consideration. 
With cottons the shrinking is generally very slight, and 
if the skirt is made amply long at first it is not likely to 
become unwearably short after washing. Light dresses of 
expensive summer materials are now more frequently dry- 
cleaned than laundried. 
The back gathers should be set on a tape, as elastic 
does not wash well ; and the skirt belt should be white or grey, 
and fastened by buttons and button-holes worked through 
it; the placket may also close with a button and worked 
cotton loop. Bottom braid of woollen or worsted may be 
used, unless of a bright colour and liable to run, but it should 
be well shrunk before use, and eased on; it may, however, 
still shrink too much for the skirt, and need renewing. The 
braid is a great protection to the edge of the dress, and 
saves soiling, but is more often used for a servant’s plain 
gown than for a lady’s summer dress, When used for the 
latter it should be folded double and put inside the skirt,

and quite under the edge, that it may not be visible from 
outside. 
Dresses of washing silk are lined with lawn or sateen, 
and finished in much the same manner as those of cotton. 
Lacing is, however, a favourite fastening. The eyelet-holes 
are generally worked with cotton, but flat thread or washing 
silk (of the kind used for embroidery) may be used. The 
seams should be sewn with cotton in any case.

Tue word trimmings opens up to us a range so wide that 
- it is absolutely impossible to do more than glance at some 
of the general rules that prevail in the trade for the prepara- 
tion of those standard trimmings that return into fashion 
from time to time—always with some slight variations to 
suit the whim of the day. Trimmings that can be made in 
the length from piece material on the cross or the straight, 
and applied to the finished garment, include such standards 
as— 
Frills Pleats 
Flounces Kilts 
Crosswise bands Tucks 
French folds Ruches, etc. 
Many other gamitures, and methods of working up 
material into decorative form, could be enumerated and 
detailed, but these could only be dealt with if the writer 
had at her disposal a much larger space than the limits of 
this short chapter, into which, however, has been compressed 
what it is hoped will prove the most useful to the young 
worker. 
Single cording is made from strips of material an inch

TRIMMINGS. 159 
wide on the cross, and tacked over piping-cord, which is 
soft and evenly woven, and can be procured in white and 
black. The cord is laid in the middle of the strip of stuff, 
and the edge turned over it and tacked along quite close up 
to the cord, care being taken that the outside material does 
not twist in the slightest degree, as its absolute smoothness 
and roundness makes the beauty of the cording. The end 
of the cord should at the start be tacked to the stuff that 
covers it, as it is extremely awkward and annoying if a 
sudden jerk brings it all out of its casing, and the whole 
length has to be opened and started afresh. 
Cutting on the cross needs great care. The cross or bias 
of material is neither the way of the warp nor the way of the 
weft, but a slant across both. The exact cross is the 
diagonal of a square, the size of the square being regulated 
by the width of the material. To ensure the exact cross, the 
width of the material is folded down the length of the side, 
making a fold on the slant which gives the line of cutting, or 
true cross. If the material is a twilled one, the line of 
cutting must run the reverse way—across the twill, not with 
it, otherwise the strips will not hang well for flounces or fold 
smoothly for bands or cording, but will have an irresistible 
inclination to twist and wrinkle, however carefully handled. 
The width of the required strip should be measured from 
the cross edge at each end, marked, and a line lightly 
chalked across, by which it should be cut. If it is pre- 
ferred to measure up the selvedge at each end, it must be 
borne in mind that the cross strips come out about a third 
less than the measure up the straight, and due allowance 
has to be made for it’ All the slanting joins should be 
made to run in the same direction—that of the warp 
threads. This must be particularly borne in mind for 
flounces or any hanging cross-made trimming. In joining 
cross strips, the edges of each end must not be put evenly 
together, as in joining strips on the straight, but the points 
should be allowed to overlap at each end to the extent of
-P-A-G-E-173
160 Zee Liemenrs or Movern DRESSMAKING. 
the turnings to be taken up in making the join (or about 
a quarter of an inch). If there has been any irregularity 
in cutting the strips, and some are wider than others, the 
utmost care should be taken in joining to keep one edge 
of the joined lengths even, or the necessary paring down 
will throw every part out of the true cross, and spoil the 
appearance of the trimming made from it. 
Where only a few narrow cross strips are required it 
would be wasteful to cut into such a length of stuff as the 
full corner of double width would take, and a smaller one 
can be turned over to start the cress, so long as care is 
taken that both sides of the corner turned over are exactly 
the same length, to ensure that the strips cut are on the 
true cross. Double-width material should always be opened 
before the corner is turned over; if cut without opening, a 
series of V-shaped strips, instead of bias ones, is the result. 
The Flounce.—The chief trimming from material on 
the cross is the flounce. Gathered flounces are usually cut 
on the cross of the material, though sometimes the fashion 
of straight-cut flounces prevails. These differ entirely from 
the curved or godet flounce (vo/ante en forme) which has been 
popular during the first years of the present century, and 
which is so cut that the upper or. sewing-on edge of the 
flounce fits to the skirt without any surplus quantity for 
gathering or easing, the degree of curve giving the fulness 
at the lower edge. ‘The standard flounce on the cross is 
the same length at both edges; the upper one is gathered 
ot otherwise reduced to the skirt size, the amount allowed 
being half as much again as the space to be filled, or one 
width on the cross to a “space equalling the width of the 
stuff or silk straight across from selvedge to selvedge. ‘The 
lengths are cut and joined, and the joins pressed. The 
lower edge is finished in some ornamental way that does 
not show the sewing—sometimes it is finished with slip hem, 
French hem (see page 105), or rolled hem ; again it is finished 
with silk pipings or with cross bindings of silk of a contrast-
-P-A-G-E-174

ing colour laid up to the outside, or the edge is turned up 
and finished with narrow satin or ribbon velvet; whilst in 
certain phases of fashion pinking and fraying are also 
employed, and flounces on washing-dresses are often edged 
with narrow lace. The top edge is turned over and gathered 
twice or more to draw it up to the required size, after which 
it is halved and quartered, the divisions marked with 
pins, and the flounce set to the skirt, which has been care- 
fully halved and quartered to correspond. The fixing is best 
done on a skirt-board ; and a light tacking thread should 
be run round the skirt at the required height from the foot 
to ensure the flounce being set on evenly. Sometimes 
flounces are put on with ornamental beadings, or a cord is 
run through the top edge to draw it up to size; at others 
they are set on raw-edged and finished by cross bands of stuff, 
silk, or passementerie, The setting-on of curved flounces is 
usually covered by stitched bands or handsome bands of 
passementerie or braiding. Flownces on the straight are 
usually pleated at the upper edge, the trimmed lower edge 
being left to flow and ruffle as it will. Pleated flounces take 
from twice to three times the length of the space to be filled 
according to the closeness of the pleating employed. They 
should be cut across the fabric from selvedge to selvedge, 
as they fall flat and quickly cut through if cut with the 
selvedge, though that way of cutting is very tempting to 
the inexperienced worker who thinks mostly of saving joins, 
A frill, strictly speaking, is a full, narrow flounce, cut on the 
straight, across from selvedge to selvedge. The quantity 
allowance, manner of making, and setting-on are the same as 
for flounces, though it is usual to allow a little extra fulness, 
as frills look poor unless they are very full. Frills in dress- 
making are often cut on the cross, and are really no more 
than narrow and rather full flounces. 
Plain crosswise bands are cut an inch wider than they 
are to be when finished. A stiffening of victoria lawn should 
be cut on the same cross and the same width as the silk. 
L

The two are tacked together, and both edges are then 
turned under half an inch, and rough-hemmed down to the 
muslin. Great care should be taken to keep a true edge, 
as if it is in the least drawn or stretched the bands will not 
lie smoothly. If the edges are to be corded (or piped) the 
cording is next set on. In high-class work such bands are 
sometimes lined with sarcenet, which is cut the width of the 
finished band, turned under and slip-stitched over the raw 
edges to make the under side neat. The bands are then 
slip-stitched to the skirt by the upper edge only, the lower 
edge being left free. In ordinary work the bands are usually 
left unlined and are slip-stitched to the skirt at both edges. 
A good worker can give a fair degree of curve to a crossway 
band for skirt trimming by slightly straining the lower edge 
and holding in the upper one whilst rough-hemming down, 
but inexperienced workers are wiser to ease the top edge 
slightly in setting on, to give the needed spring at the lower 
edge. If the bands are to be ornamented with rows of 
machine-stitching, the muslin must be soft enough to allow 
the stitching to sink ; and stitched bands are often made of 
double material for this reason, as the deeper the stitching 
the more effective the decoration. The bands are made 
and stitched before they are applied to the skirt, one row at 
each edge being worked afterwards to hold them in place. 
The French fold is a narrower, more ornamental variation 
of the crosswise fold ; it is usually from .an inch to an inch 
and a half wide, not more. Twice and a half the width of 
the finished fold, or a little over, is needed to make it satis- 
factorily. The requisite number of cross strips are cut and 
joined, after which it is laid wrong side up on the table, and 
one edge folded down one-third of the width of the strip, 
and tacked along. The other edge is turned in half an 
inch, folded up to lie on the part already tacked down, and 
slip-stitched through to it. The tacking (which does not 
show) may be left in the work, it keeps the first turn well 
down, and thus saves strain on the slip stitching, and leaves

the face fold deep and round. The latter should come 
exactly down the centre of the French fold proper. French 
folds are much used in crape for mourning garments. 
Puffings are made from strips cut on the cross or straight 
according to the fashion, usually on the cross, The foot of 
the skirt is usually trimmed with a narrow (say two-inch) 
flounce or pleating set on raw-edged, the lower edge of the 
puffing is run or pleated, and sewn, raw-edged to the skirt, at 
the top of the pleating or flounce (or into the place it will 
occupy on the skirt). The puffing is then turned upwards 
to cover the raw edges, and the top edge fixed into place, 
the length being pushed down about a quarter of its depth 
to make it stand off full and loose, and the pleated or 
gathered upper edge sewn down to the skirt, and finished 
with a band trimming of some kind. The quantity allowed 
for the puffing should be once and a half the space to be 
filled, or twice or more for very thin fabrics. Where yokes, 
sleeves, or other-decorative sections are set in puffings, the 
material is usually cut the required shape with the allowance 
for fulness in the width, and an extra allowance of one inch 
for each gathering thread in the length. The place for each 
line of gathering is creased or lightly marked with French 
chalk or pins, the rows of gatherings are set in and drawn up 
to size, after which each is caught down from the back to 
the lining, the stuff standing out in puffs between. 
Ruches, whether gathered or pleated, differ from flounces 
and pleating in being finished at both edges and caught 
down the middle of the length ; flounces and pleats are sewn 
down at the upper edge and flow free at the lower one, A 
very simple ruche can be made by cutting lengths on the 
cross, each cross strip to fill a space equalling the width of 
the fabric on the straight, joining them, finishing the edges 
in some pretty way (fraying, pinking, binding over, French 
hem, etc.), then folding down the length and running along 
the crease to draw the strip up to required size. If the 
centre is gathered on a cord it looks more finished and is
-P-A-G-E-177
164 Tae Erements or Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
easier to set on without showing the stitches. This isa 
gathered ruche. If the same cross length is laid into close 
treble box-pleats, quite a different effect is obtained. A 
ruche more suitable for heavy wear is made by cutting the 
strips a little more than twice the width required, and 
folding over to bring the join at the back, where it is herring- 
boned down, one edge just above the other. The length is 
then box-pleated, each fold being about half an inch wide, 
and tacked down (often machined down) the middle. It is 
then fixed into place on the garment and stitched on in the 
line of the tacking, after which the two edges of each box-pleat 
are caught up together with a tiny stitch, making a full and 
soft surface effect. 
Handsome ruches are arranged in this way in double, 
treble, and quadruple box-pleats, laid very thickly and close 
together ;—for these the quantity to be used must be 
ascertained by making up a specimen on any scraps at hand 
—sometimes four, five, or six times the space to cover is 
used in full ruches of light and gauzy fabric. By varying 
the pleating and the manner of catching the edges together 
a number of pretty shells, fans, and other variations can be 
made, and durable and effective ruches can be arranged 
from very simple pleatings by lining the strip of stuff with 
silk or other trimming fabric which shows in the ruffling up, 
and catching across. The lengths to be used are cut from 
the straight or the cross according to the prevailing fashion, 
but lengths on the cross have a much softer and fuller effect 
than those on the straight. Laces, ribbons, and other light 
fabrics are often ruched.

Pleats are made on the straight of the fabric, the width

-P-A-G-E-178
PLEATS, 165 
in vogue. If the fold edges of the pleats are to lie firm and 
flat, they are best made of lengths taken down the selvedge 
way of the fabric, but if a soft and rather full effect is desired 
at the fold edge the fabric should be cut across from selv- 
edge to selvedge. 
For a plissé (or single pleating) of light material the length 
allowance should be three times the space to be filled ; the 
pleats will then be exactly edge to edge. If a fuller effect is 
desired more length may be allowed, at the maker's discre- 
tion; always remembering that if the fabric is thick or 
heavy the weight of a “kilted” or overlapping pleating is 
a great objection. The pleats in such fabrics are usually 
spaced ; only twice and a half the space to be filled, or even 
less than that, being allowed in the length for pleating. To 
make the pleats the lengths should be cut, the joins made 
and pressed, the lower edge hemmed, trimmed, etc., and the 
first row of pleating started there, that the line of the bottom 
edge may be absolutely even, whether it is pressed flat (as a 
knifing) or allowed to spring and ruffle (as a pliss¢ flounce). 
The left hand lays each fold over to meet the needle, which 
should not be drawn out of the work, and the pleats are 
passed over the eye of the needle as it is filled—a coarse 
running stitch being used for the tacking. After the lower 
edge has been pleated to size, the length is laid on the 
table, the end of each pleat is firmly pinned down to it 
(drawing-pins serve exceedingly well for this purpose), and 
the folds drawn down from the pins by the straight of 
the thread to the other edge, where they are tacked again, 
It is essential that the straight thread of the fabric should 
lie down the fold edge of each pleat. If the pleating is 
over four inches deep or very fine, a third row of tacking 
is made midway, after which the length is taken up and 
lightly pressed from the back, the greatest care being taken 
only to give just the amount of pressure required by fashion; 
for ordinary pleating this is just enough to incline the pleats 
to retain the fold, whilst for knifings the pressure should be
-P-A-G-E-179
166 ZHe Eremenrs or Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
heavy enough to leave the folds sharp and clear, and lying 
quite close and flat upon each other. After pressing, the 
backs of the folds are usually caught across with a loose 
catching-stitch to keep the pleats in position ; ‘this is taken 
through the heel of each pleat as a back-stitch, that it may 
not work out. This line of catching is often taken in curves 
instead of in a straight line, as it allows the flow of the 
lower edge to appear more free and unrestrained. Great 
care should be taken that the catching threads are not low 
enough to catch the wearer’s heels ; if they cannot be kept at 
least six inches above the foot of the skirt they should be 
very closely run into the back of each fold, not taken 
loosely across from one to the other. The pleating is then 
set into its place on the skirt. The tackings are left in till 
the garment is completed, when they are snipped and drawn 
through from the face, and the whole lightly shaken down 
into place. Like all other trimmings made from the length, 
pleatings can be made by machine. An ingenious contri- 
vance of the kind pleats the material and holds it in form 
until it is pressed. When pleatings are fashionable the busy 
dressmaker finds a kilting machine a great saving of time 
and labour, but like most other mechanical aids it is not so 
much favoured in the high-class workroom, where hand work 
is preferred, as in that of the middle-class worker. 
Box-pleats (made by two single pleats, one folded to the 
right and one to the left) are a pretty variation of the single 
pleat, and can be advantageously used for a deep pleating 
of rather heavy material, as the box-pleat looks quite well 
when spaced, #2 with its own width between each box-pleat. 
If used as a foot trimming to a skirt the under side edges 
of box-pleats should meet, or nearly so (particularly if the 
trimming is to be pressed); but in deep box-pleats that 
extend for half or three-quarters to the whole depth of a 
skirt, there are difficulties of shaping that must be dealt 
with according to the variation of box-pleats in fashion. It 
is essential that the straight thread should run exactly down
-P-A-G-E-180
Tucks 4nd Tucxrés., 167 
the middle of the face of each box-pleat, and if straight 
lengths are box-pleated the heels of the pleats must be 
under-wrapped at the top edge to draw them into shape 
and yet keep the straight down the face. Box-pleated skirt 
backs have for some years been cut as wedges, one wedge 
for each pleat, but these scarcely come under the head 
of trimmings. 
The method of making the box-pleat is the same as that 
detailed for single pleats—twice the space to be filled or 
more being allowed, according to the spacing arranged. 
Double, treble, and quadruple box-pleats come into fashion 
from time to time, but can scarcely be included as standard 
trimmings for firm fabrics ; they are mostly used for ruches, 
ruffles, or where a very full and fluffy effect is desired.

Tucks on the straight. Standard tucks are of the kind we are 
accustomed to see round the lower part of a child’s smock or 
pinafore, usually three to five tucks, each half an inch or an 
inch wide, above a deep hem. At times each tuck overlaps the 
stitching of the tuck below, at others they have their own 
space between them. The method of making is as follows: 
The full length of the garment must be allowed ; in addition 
to this, fawice the depth of the tuck for each tuck, and two 
turns for the hem. The seams should be made, pressed, 
etc, the hem turned and sewn, and from the stitching 
twice the depth of the tuck measured upwards, and marked 
with pins, The tuck can then be folded at the right depth 
from the pins (keeping the edge on the straight) and tacked 
through from the under side, which in the case of a slightly
-P-A-G-E-181

gored skirt or smock is just a trifle full for the outside. The 
fulness can, however, be eased away if the fixing and tacking 
are done over the hand. Each tuck should be measured in 
the same way—three times the depth of the tuck being 
allowed from the last row of stitching, if the tucks are to 
be spared, and the fixing and tacking done from the 
under side. After fixing, the tucks, if not run by hand, 
should be machined with silk with the face upwards, 
feeding the eased under side gently through and taking 
care the tension js not at all tight or it will draw up the 
line of sewing and spoil the appearance of the work. After 
machining, the tucks may or may not require pressing, this 
being a matter of fashion and fabric; such pressing, to be 
satisfactory, should be done from the under side of each 
separate tuck, which should be laid upwards, and the line 
of sewing and the tuck itself gently pressed, but the whole 
set should not be pressed from the back of the work or its 
appearance will be completely spoilt, After pressing, the 
garment should be shaken, to set the tucks down in their 
places; the edges will then be flat and well defined, but they; 
will set off from the garment as they would not do if pressed 
in a mass from the back. Many workers prefer to tack the: 
tucks as described, and press the line of tacking before sew- 
ing, feeling that it gives the tucks a less flattened look than 
pressing after stitching. 
The fine pin tucks that have been so popular during the 
reign of the stretched back and pouch front bodice are 
usually made on the material before it is cut out. There 
are tuckers sold with most of the modern sewing machines ; 
these pick up the fold and stitch it, and at the same time 
press in a mark for the next tuck, and thus very much 
simplify the marking out, but for hand run tucking ‘some. 
method of marking must be adopted by the inexperienced, 
though many good workers disdain any help beyond that of 
a true eye, and pick up and run each tuck by the straight 
thread without any preliminary marking or fixing. The

writer finds it a good plan to lay a tape measure across 
each end of the silk, from selvedge to selvedge, and tack tiny 
marks at every inch, or mark with pins pointing downwards; 
—the tucks can then be picked up by the two tacking marks 
or the two pins and creased, with the certainty that they 
will not be twisted from the straight of the thread. If they 
are needed fine and close together, one can be picked up 
on the tacking itself, and one between each; if taken only 
on the inch lines they are too far apart unless spaced or 
made rather deep. The grouping can be varied according to 
liking. Fine tucks of the kind are not pressed as a rule, 
though the back of the whole piece is often drawn (tucking 
upwards) over an iron placed face upwards on the stand, 
to smoothen the stitching slightly. 
Curved tucks should be fine, not more than a quarter of 
an inch deep to set well; they can be marked from the 
lower edge or Jast sewing as explained for straight tucks, 
and picked up by the pins or tacking thread, the under side 
being well eased on over the hand. It is very important to 
ease the underside, not to stretch the upper, or the whole 
flounce will be pulled out of all shape and set, especially if 
it is all soft and yielding, as the curve naturally falls on every 
way of the thread, increasing the difficulty the worker finds 
in picking up just the exact quantity required in each tuck. 
They should be machined face up with a loose tension as 
described for straight tucks, and pressed at the back as for 
pin tucks. 
Pin tuchs on the cross present the same difficulty. The 
worker must be extremely careful not to stretch either in 
fixing or stitching—the latter is particularly difficult to avoid 
when stitching by machine. . 
Separate crosswise tucks for skirts are made in much the 
same way as crosswise bands, but are sewn on at one edge 
wrong side out, and turned over and laid down into place, 
the lower edge being quite free.

Braiding. Where a decorative section is to be braided 
with narrow braid, it is already stiffened with muslin; where 
it is intended to braid any portion of a bodice or skirt, one 
thickness of muslin should be loosely tacked under the part 
to give it a little substance. The garment should be 
accurately fitted before the design is marked upon it, and 
even then it is as well to keep the braiding design well within 
the outlines, as after braiding the garment may require a 
fraction of tightening at some point. The manner of mark- 
ing the design on the fabric varies. If a prepared transfer, it 
is laid face down on the stuff and ironed off. The iron 
should be of only medium heat. Tt is advisable to cut off 
the trade number from the transfer, and iron it down on a 
scrap of the stuff when the degree of heat that is required 
can be gauged. Other plans are to outline the design in 
coloured cotton, running the outline through the paper 
pattern and tearing the paper away after, or tracing through 
manifold paper (which can now be procured in light colours). 
The braid should be laid on easily, the outer edge just cover- 
ing the outline of the design—if at all strained out it will 
draw up the surface below it. A tiny running round the 
inside edge often helps to draw small curves into good shape 
and make them lie nicely, and firm tacking down should not 
be spared if the design is much curved. The braid may be 
run from the face or slip-stitched on, according to the pattern. 
Most braids need slip-stitching on, or sewing with long

BRAIDING. 171 
diagonal stitches taken through and underneath the braid 
from edge to edge alternately—the sewing should be worked 
with strong silk the colour of the braid, and it is most im- 
portant that the stitching should not be drawn up tightly, 
and that the fastening on and off should be firm and secure. 
‘Tailors sew on braid with threads drawn from a cut length 
of the same braid. The cut end of braid frays out very 
quickly : a Jength of cotton should be wound round it and 
fastened through with a few stitches. Broad flat braids are 
saved from spreading and fraying if, before cutting, two lines 
of machine-stitching about an inch apart are made across 
the braid ; it should then be cut between the lines. After 
braiding, the portion should be well pressed from the wrong 
side, taking great care that it is laid on a thick soft cloth for 
the process, or glazing may follow. Flat braids can be shaped 
to fit a slightly curved edge, as for collars, cuffs, etc, by 
finely running one edge, drawing it up to shape, and press- 
ing from the wrong side under a wet cloth. In sewing on 
it is best to keep two needles in use, one at each edge; it is 
then not necessary to turn back, and any unequal fixing or 
sewing sooner shows itself, and can be more easily and 
quickly rectified, than would be the case if the whole of 
one edge were sewn down before starting the other. For 
scrolls, etc., the drawing braids (braids with a drawing cord 
in the edge) were admirable, as they could be drawn up 
and pressed to shape without the tedious preliminary of 
gathering. 
Braiding garments by machine is now so extensively 
carried out that it is almost a trade in itself. 
Gimps and passementerie, etc., should be slip-stitched at 
each edge, or sewn on from the face with the diagonal stitch 
from edge to edge already described, with fine silk matching 
in colour, The trimming should always be held very easy, 
that it may not draw up the surface below it. 
Lace insertions and garland laces are also slip-stitched 
down by the edges, or sometimes finely hemmed, according

to the patterns. ‘These delicate garnitures need setting on 
with the hand and eye of the artist rather than by strict 
work-room rule of procedure, and the only really authoritative 
rule that can be given is that the stitches should not show, 
and that there should not be any indentations to show 
where they are set in,

Tue term trimming is often applied to a decorative section 
of a garment, bodice or skirt, made of richer material than 
the garment itself, or of the same material worked up into a 
pretty ornamental surface effect, as by gathering, tucking, 
etc. Under this head we may include :— 
Fancy neckbands Vests 
Yokes Revers 
Collarettes Cuffs 
Belts Wide Collars 
Wristbands Epaulettes 
Shoulder-frills, etc. 
(Skirt decoration is mostly carried out with length trim- 
mings and draperies, though panels, curved flounces, etc., 
must come under the head of decorative sections, and the
-P-A-G-E-186

foot of the skirt is often shaped out into scallops and battle- ments, etc.) 
The lines for these decorative portions are marked 
on the drafting (the working lines for such portions are 
spoken of as style lines, or design lines, and make up a 
great part of the art of style cutting), and from it a pattern 
is traced and cut out, usually without turnings. 
The making up of each section differs a little, according 
to the position the portion of the garment takes on the 
body, but as a general rule there are two ways of making up 
in ordinary use. In the high-class method a stiffening suit- 
able to the section is first prepared. Buckram is used for 
stiff neck-bands, gauntlet cuffs, etc.—book muslin or victoria 
lawn, according to the outside fabric, for softer portions, as 
collarettes (sailor collars), yokes, wrist-bands, etc. The 
dressmaker, too, appreciates French canvas as a stiffening 
for portions that should roll slightly, as revers, etc., though it 
is not strictly speaking considered a dressmaking material. 
Where the stiffening is a hard one (as buckram) it is usually 
cut to the size required, without turnings. Soft muslin is 
cut a little larger, and tacked on the face and over the edges 
to soften them and prevent them cutting through; the 
corners of the muslin are turned truly and tacked closely 
down, and the whole machined round a quarter inch or 
more in from the edges and pressed under a damp cloth. 
If a Medici collar or gauntlet cuff, it is moulded into shape 
whilst pressing. The outside velvet or silk, cut a quarter 
of an inch or more larger than the buckram, is laid on 
and fixed into place, the edges are turned over and rough- 
hemmed down to the muslin, already machined to the 
buckram, which gives a firm hold, and allows the outside 
fabric to be well strained and smoothened out in fixing on. 
The cross of the stiffening yields more readily if moulded 
before machining the muslin to it. Corners and points are 
carefully turned, a tiny. scrap being cut away if they are 
inclined to be thick or clumsy. If the section is made of
-P-A-G-E-187
174 THe Exements or MopERN DRESSMAKING, 
a fabric that needs pressing it is next pressed from the 
inside, and any required stitching or trimming (as braid- 
ing, etc.) completed before it is lined with thin silk or 
sarcenet, which is cut to the size of the finished section, or 
a shade larger, turned in a quarter of an inch at all edges, 
and slip-stitched into place to just cover the raw edges 
and rough-hemming. Such linings are put in easy both 
in width and length, not to contract the outside. When 
victoria lawn is used, as with a sailor collar or a shoulder- 
frill, it is often cut with half-inch turnings (the good cutter 
being careful to place parts of the pattern that fit better 
for a little straining-out on the cross of the muslin), the 
trimming fabric is cut like the muslin with only half-inch 
turnings also. The two are tacked together and then turned 
in the fitting-lines, which are pencilled or wheeled on the 
muslin, and all the raw edges but the one of the sewing-on 
line rough-hemmed down. If the muslin is at all firm it 
must be cut away at the corners or they will be clumsy. 
As in the preceding method, the edges are pressed from 
the under side if the fabric is one that needs pressing, and 
the section is stitched, trimmed, etc., as before, lining with 
silk or sarcenet cut to size and slip-stitched in a little way 
under the edge, as already explained. A yoke closing 
across has the hooks sewn on before the silk is fixed in, and 
the lining at that edge is slipped under the turn and hemmed 
down very finely to neaten. ‘The neck of the yoke is 
neatened by the setting-on of the collar, but in the case of 
revers or shoulder frills and some kinds of large falling 
collars the neat finishing of the sewing-on edge is a matter 
that exacts attention. Many high-class workers finish such 
portions completely at all edges and finely slip-stitch on 
with strong silk, taking great care to leave the silk very loose, 
to avoid drawing up the edge; but where a rolling, turned- 
over effect is desired this method is not available. The 
best plan to adopt is to lay the section (face down) on the 
garment, the two sewing-lines together, straining that of the
-P-A-G-E-188
Decorative SECTIONS. 175 
section slightly wherever there is a hollow on the figure 
(falling collars should be strained at the turn of the neck, 
added revers from the bust downwards, etc.), tack firmly 
into place with small stitches, turn over in the tacking-line 
of the section, and try on. After making any needed alteration, 
stitch on by hand, sewing a little behind the tacking-line, 
not in it, being very careful not to draw the thread tightly. 
Well done, this preserves the turned out effect, especially if 
the turnings are kept narrow and snipped at short intervals. 
The outer edge of the silk lining is already slip-stitched to 
the outer edge of the section, the inner edge can be turned 
and slipped under the turnings, covering them completely, 
and caught down to them witha long, loose slip-stitch which 
will hold it in place without drawing the outside fabric back. 
Once the principle is grasped, the quick-witted worker will 
see that this method, with very little variation, is the one 
used in all good work-rooms for every kind of decorative 
section. A Swiss belt is made by cutting the canvas to shape, 
turning the velvet over and slip-stitching down, and lining 
with silk, the variation being the finishing of the front ends 
for bones and eyelet holes, and so on. 
The style-lines for each section must be varied according 
to fashion and system, but as a general rule yokes should 
“not be deeper than the chest, falling collars the same or less, 
vests should not be wider at the bust than at the neck, and 
revers should carry out the idea of the front of the bodice 
being turned back. The outer edges of revers should be 
cut on the straight thread of the fabric, and every effort 
should be made to secure a rolled back effect; lines of 
trimming of any kind, bands, tucks, folds, etc., should follow 
the run of the bodice front from neck to bust, or should 
incline forward to meet at the waist. In the skirt, panels 
should widen at the foot, and flounces, puffings, and every 
kind of length trimmings should be fullest and deepest at the 
lower edge, graduating off in fulness and depth as they rise to 
the knee.
-P-A-G-E-189
176 THe Exements or Moverx DRESSMAKING. 
The inferior way of making these decorative sections is 
to cut muslin, trimming fabric (say velvet), and lining silk 
all the same size, and place them velvet and silk face to face, 
the muslin to the wrong side of the velvet, and machine 
them together at all edges but the sewing-on edge, using 
a loose stitch, taking very small turnings, quarter-inch or 
less. The sewing is pressed (if the fabric will permit), the 
turnings pared down, and the section turned right side out 
and nicely coaxed into shape, perhaps pressed again, and 
then it is ready for setting-on. The plan has the recom- 
mendation of speed, but edges finished in this way are soft 
and puffy ; and corners cannot be turned out as true and 
fine as by the method first given ; it is therefore not accepted 
as a high-class method. 
Scallops, vandykes, and other edge ornamentation of 
the kind should be carefully spaced out before cutting. 
It is best to measure the edge to be ornamented and 
divide it into so many scallops, allowing a half at 
the front and a half at the back if it is intended to 
have a point or a curve there, or simply dividing into a 
given number if the centre is to show a cut. A length of 
tough thin paper of suitable depth should next be cut. On 
this one scallop or vandyke should be marked, the paper 
then folded over and a number of scallops cut through at a 
time, say six or more. The paper can then be laid on the 
edge (under which firm muslin has been fixed), and a line of 
small tacking carried round each scallop to transfer the 
shape, or they may be marked with French chalk if speed 
is an essential, though that is less likely to be accurate. 
The scallops can then be cut out,. leaving quarter-inch 
turnings round each curve and cutting straight up between 
each scallop. The turnings of the muslin may be cut away 
if it is at all thick. The scallops are then turned in the line 
over the muslin, taking great care not to stretch the yielding 
cross in shaping and rough-hemming up. Scarcely any 
turning is taken at the top of each cut, vandyke points are
-P-A-G-E-190
Decorative Sections, 177 
turned sharp and true, and every effort is made to keep the 
ornamentation flat and smooth, and nicely curved or pointed 
according to the design. The edges, after rough-hemming, 
are pressed, stitched, and trimmed, and are then lined up 
with silk which is cut to shape, laid underneath and slip- 
stitched to the scallops or vandykes, a quarter of an inch 
under the edge. 
The strip of silk for the scallops lining should be about 
twice the depth of the scallops—the upper edge can then 
be caught to the foundation skirt and firmly secured without 
showing any stitching through. Scallops are often piped or 
bound over with doubled cross strips in the same way as 
explained for false buttonholes; the method is much the 
easiest for inexperienced workers, who are apt to spoil the 
ends of the cuts by taking up too deep a turning there. 
Skirt trimmings are best joined before they are applied. 
The length to go round the skirt should be measured off, 
with a slight allowance for easing-on—say two inches on 
the whole skirt width. The join should be made (on the 
slant if not to be hidden under a fold), sewn, and well 
pressed, after which the completed trimming should be set 
to the skirt, eased round and firmly slip-stitched or 
machined on,

generally wider than print, delaine than beige, and diaphan- 
ous silk fabrics (as chiffon) than velvet. 
Any method of calculating quantity must, if it is to be 
of practical value, take changes of fashion into account; 
yet anyone who has followed these changes round will have 
noted how little the total quantity of material required for 
the complete dress varies, standing as it does at from six to 
seven yards of double-width material forty-four inches wide, 
or twice that quantity of single-width if narrow, or a yard 
less, perhaps, if the single-width material is wider than half 
the double-width, as is generally the case. 
There are styles and materials where careful planning 
and close cutting will considerably reduce this allowance, as 
there are others that exceed it: gored skirts of reversible 
materials, such as alpaca, come under the first head, and 
the same from rich fabrics with a large and bold design upon 
them (as brocaded velvet) under the second. In gored 
skirts, whether of print or brocade, cut from fabrics where 
there is a pattern, pile, nap, or sheen, one gore is upside 
down and inside out where only two side gores are cut; 
all can be made right side out if there are four gores (two 
at each side), but then those at one side will still be upside 
down, and where this cannot be admitted, owing to the 
pattern or the way of the fabric, the gores which cannot 
be used in the skirt must be utilised for the bodice and 
sleeves, where they cut to less advantage. It is therefore 
the established rule in dressmaking to plan off or cut out 
the skirt before the bodice. 
It is of extreme practical value to the cutter to have a 
clear idea of how each part of the dress can be cut from 
material of a certain width, how much each part will take, 
and whether cuttings from one part can or cannot be utilised 
in the cutting out of the others. Stock cutters for wholesale 
houses are experts at such planning; they seem able to cut 
garments from incredibly small quantities of material, for by 
dint of long practice they have learned to lay the patterns
-P-A-G-E-193
180 THe Exrements or Mopern DRESSMARING. 
on the material to fill every hollow and to utilise every 
scrap of space. Every dressmaker, too, has her own way 
of placing the pattern on the lining to cut correctly, and 
yet from the smallest quantity of material. 
Facility in judging quantities may be cultivated by 
making it a rule to measure up the lining, stuff, etc., 
which has been planned out, and sketch a rough diagram 
showing the width and length, and how each part was 
obtained from the whole, and in a lesser degree by making 
model “lays” or plans. This may be done in the following 
manner :— 
Tapes or rulers should be made to a reduced scale—say 
half an inch to the inch, or a quarter of an inch to the inch ; 
the latter is the best scale for ordinary practice. The tapes 
or rulers can easily be made from strips of sectional paper 
gummed over tape; the lines already ruled on the sectional 
paper can then be inked and figured, either for the half- or 
the quarter-inch scale. 
By this tape or ruler a reduced pattern (bodice and 
sleeves) should be drafted to an average set of measures, the 
lower edge shaped off to prevailing fashion—as round, 
pointed, box-pleated basque to back, etc.—and the model 
pattern cut out in thin cardboard or cartridge-paper, the 
proper allowance for turnings on the reduced scale being 
made upon it or not, according to the discretion of the 
worker. 
Strips of paper or lining should be cut the width of the 
material they are intended to represent, and as many yards 
of such material allowed as it is calculated that a dress 
will require, width and length both being measured by the 
reduced scale tape or ruler, the scale being the same as that 
of the model bodice pattern. If it is meant for double- 
width stuff it should be folded and creased, after which 
the pieces of the model pattern should be planned out 
upon it, the bodice and sleeves placed correctly, and 
the lengths for the skirt marked off, gored, and otherwise
-P-A-G-E-194
Quawtiry, Cost, anp Price. 18) 
arranged exactly as would be done with a full-size bodice 
pattern and the real material. 
Different workers prefer different methods of planning 
out. Some open out all linings and fold over end to end, 
spreading the pattern to fill up spaces and finally cutting 
the lining double; others place the pattern on the lining 
doubled as it is bought. The latter plan is perhaps less 
confusing, but each has its own advantages; and as long 
as the pieces are properly placed with respect to the way 
and thread of the material, and with full appreciation of the 
value of economical planning out, every good method has 
its own value. 
The same holds good of the material; with double 
cutting there is less labour and time spent in the actual 
cutting out, and there is no risk of any of the pairs of pieces 
being cut both for one side of the garment, as there always 
is in single cutting, even when the planning has been very 
carefully done. Still, in planning out narrow single-width 
material, especially if the skirt is a gored one, there are little 
spaces that can be utilised if the pieces are laid on singly, 
and for practice in this kind of very close cutting, paper 
with a distinct right and wrong side may be cut double 
to represent the actual pieces of the lining, or pairs ot 
models may be made, the back of each piece being marked 
to ensure that no two are laid on for one side of the bodice, 
and the whole planned out singly on the paper representing 
the material. Lines should be drawn round the model for 
fitting-lines and also for turnings, and the spaces inside th= 
outlines lightly shaded in to throw up the shape of ea 
piece more clearly from the background. The habit 
calculating by “plan” is one the most experienced cut! 
cannot afford to despise, and it is of inestimable value 
the inexperienced. : . 
If the cutter can readily judge the average quantity 
which bodice, sleeves, and skirt will take, her rough mental 
calculation for a dress would tun like this -—
-P-A-G-E-195
182 THe Ecements or Mopern DRESSMAKING. 
Calculation of quantity for a fashionable dress.—Flare 
skirt would take three double widths each about one and 
a quarter yards long, including turnings and shaping off; 
the pieces from side-gores would give facings if economy is 
an object, or an extra half-yard would give them six inches 
deep. Bodice and sleeves take about one and a half yards 
for an ordinary figure, but more for very full styles—say two 
yards. The margin on allowances would give shoulder- 
frills, vest, tucks, revers, small zouave fronts, or other trim- 
mings, as well as facings-up and facings-in for those parts of 
the dress that require it, such as the placket, the mouth of 
pocket, lining of habit backs, etc. For a small figure it 
might also give a flounce or band round the skirt, but for a 
large one the trimmings would require an extra allowance of 
material. 
Bodice, sleeves, and collar, with a margin for variety in 
style—as full front, fancy back, sleeves or collar, etc.—can 
be cut for average figures from: 
1} to 2 yards double-width dress stuff. 
3 to 33 yards silk or rich stuffs. 
2} to 23 single width woollen or cotton. 
Average Quantities of Linings are: 
14 to 2 yards bodice lining, double width (38). 
4% to 5 yards skirt lining, single width (27). 
3% to 4} yards skirt lining, double width (38). 
From calculations of quantity we naturally proceed to 
calculations of cost, and here we come to the question of 
the basis on which such a calculation is to be made. 
If the worker has to supply all the finishings beyond the 
outside material, linings and trimmings (as is generally the 
case), the cost of each item (even though trifling in itself, as 
a strip or two of muslin or a few hooks and eyes) must be 
considered, or she would be at a loss when these items 
are repeated in a large number of cases. On the other 
hand, the charge for “sundries” should be kept as low as 
it can, consistently with fashion’s demands, or a feeling of
-P-A-G-E-196
Quanity, Cost, ano Price. 183 
dissatisfaction and distrust is created in the mind of the 
customer. Where the worker has only the value of her 
own labour to consider when settling what the cost of 
making is to be, it is simply a case of time and quality 
of work. Where there are workwomen, improvers, and 
apprentices to be paid, each according to the value of her 
work, and rent for city workrooms, etc., to be considered, 
the manager has a more complicated calculation to make, 
and buying in the best markets has to balance the increased 
working expenses. ‘The latter consideration, however, need 
not be entered into in detail here. 
The time used in making a dress varies ; some fashions 
may involve more labour than others, or the length of the 
working-day may differ, but two dresses per week is con- 
sidered a good average for one worker. Some can make a 
dress in a day, but good finish cannot be expected with 
such rapid work, though speed is correctly considered one 
of its elements. Slow workers seldom set-in their stitches 
with the same beauty and regularity as quick ones; it 
seems that a certain speed is necessary before they can 
acquire that power, and with it comes a lightness of hand 
which seems to hold the work without touching it; the 
fresh look of a bodice which has been lightly handled is 
certainly one of the items which both employer and worker 
take into strict account when considering finish. 
Good sewing, good pressing, flat seams, well-finished 
points and corners are details of good finish, and the 
employment of the finest finishings would be useless if the 
work put in did not match them in character. 
Hand-work takes more time than machine-work, and so 
commands a better price, especially when to ensure a satis- 
factory finished effect constant watchfulness must be 
exercised throughout the processes; and the fit of the 
garment has also to be adapted to the 
Better pay is always expected for work t 
it being justly considered to require
-P-A-G-E-197
184 Zaz Exements or Movern Dressmak ine. 
experience, and skill on the part of the worker, and these 
qualities having (in every trade) their distinct monetary 
value. Quality of work (style,* fit, and finish) on materials 
employed and time used ate therefore the great price 
regulators. 
‘Price of making is a little influenced by the style of 
dress chosen, being generally a little higher for elaborately 
trimmed dresses than for plainer ones. Many dress- 
makers refuse to recognise this, declaring that the plainer 
styles require much more careful making and fihishing than 
fancy ones. Dresses of rich material, such as silk, velvet, 
lace, etc., generally command a higher price for making 
than woollens, and these again than cottons, which vary 
in cost of making according to the style chosen, ladies’ 
summer dresses costing nearly as much for making as their 
evening ones, whilst a servant’s print gown is usually 
charged at a very low rate indeed. It is unfortunate for 
the average dressmaker that there is no fixed rate of 
charge for making in the trade. She cannot say “The trade 
price is .” The pay varies with the neighbourhood, 
the social position of the customers, and the necessities of 
the worker, a reputation for style and fit being no incon- 
siderable factor in the matter of the charges made by a 
well-established dressmaker, whilst a good worker with her 
connection yet to make may give equally good work for 
very much lower pay. 
The price paid for making a servant’s print gown varies 
from half-a-crown to seven shillings and sixpence, accord- 
ing to neighbourhood, three-and-sixpence to five shillings 
being the middle-class average; the latter price commands 
fair work and fair finish. 
For a fashionably-made washing-dress it may vary 
from ten-and-sixpence to fifteen shillings, according to   
* Good style may be defined as the ability to select from the prevailing 
styles the one most suited to the material 10 be made up, and to the age 
and appearance of the wearer,

neighbourhood ; twelve-and-sixpence is a very fair middle- 
class average. 
. The charge for making stuff dresses ranges from ten-and- 
Sixpence to seventeen-and-sixpence as the average, with a 
slight increase if the disposal of much ‘rich trimming is 
included in the making. 
Dresses of washing silk come between the woollen and 
the silk dress in scale of price. . 
Evening dresses, or those of rich material, generally 
command an average price of from fifteen to thirty shillings 
for making, one guinea being about the middle-class medium 
price. These prices cover labour only, all sundries being 
charged extra. Of course a dressmaker of established 
reputation and with a good connection can command 
prices considerably higher than those quoted above, and 
exclusive houses that make for a few special customers 
only, and reserve their designs for them, can almost name 
their own prices. The sums quoted represent the average 
charge for work only, without reference to special advan- 
tages of any kind. 
The quality and price of the linings, finishings, and 
trimmings should be proportioned te the cost of the dress 
material itself, cheaper ones being chosen for dresses of 
poor material than for those of better quality, and the charge 
for making regulated in the same way. It would be absurd 
to line a dress made of cheap serge costing, say, ninepence 
the yard double width, with a lining costing ninepence 
the yard too, or to bind all the turnings with sarcenet 
ribbon and finish the front edges with lining silk. Cheap 
silesia Oxford lining is good enough, and such a dress 
should be finished as inexpensively as possible (the turnings 
overcast and facings of the stuff itself used), good inside 
finishings being as unsuitable as expensive outside trim- 
mings would be with a dress of this kind. Some general 
rules for proportioning the cost of finishings to that of the 
outside material may here be given.

cost from four shillings a yard upwards (about five shillings 
and sixpence, if good wear is to be expected) ; trimming 
silks, two, shillings and sixpence upwards; soft washing 
silks two shillings upwards. Velveteen, though only a 
cotton fabric, can hardly be procured of fair quality under 
two shillings per yard. Silk velvet averages seven shillings 
and sixpence to ten shillings and sixpence per yard. Medium 
quality double-width woollens average two shillings and six- 
pence to three shillings and sixpence, rising to five shillings 
and sixpence. Heavier wide width (56 inches), five shillings 
and sixpence upwards. Single-width, from one shilling and 
fourpence upwards. Mixtures, as Henrietta cloth, poplin, 
etc., four shillings per yard upwards. Ordinary cottons, 
prints, sateens, ginghams, etc., fourpence-halfpenny to ten- 
pence, sixpence-halfpenny being average. Finer cottons 
(either fashionable or delicate fabrics), up to one shilling and 
sixpence per yard. (Very fine muslins rise considerably 
above this.) Cotton bodice-lining, threepence-halfpenny 
to sixpence-halfpenny to tenpence per yard upwards. Linen 
lining, one shilling upwards. Silk lining (silk width), two 
shillings and sixpence upwards. 
Silesia, alpaca (single-width) linenette, and glazed skirt 
linings average sixpence to ninepence per yard. Coloured 
linens cost little more than cotton. Silk linings average two 
shillings and sixpence per yard upwards. 
Proportionate cost of linings and finishings may run :— 
Bodice and skirt linings for average woollen stuffs (middle- 
class quality, two shillings to three shillings and sixpence 
per yard, double-width) should run about one-sixth to one- 
quarter of the price per yard of the outside material. Silk 
linings about one-third the price of the outside silk. Trim- 
ming of silk, satin, or velvet for woollens, once and a half to 
twice the price per yard of the outside material. Buttons (per 
dozen) about half the price of the stuff per yard. Average 
cost of making an ordinary cotton or woollen dress would

be about the same as cost of material without linings, 
finishings, fastenings, or trimmings. For rich stuffs this 
would not hold good; about half the cost should be 
fair pay. 
The quality of finishings and kind of work expected 
vary with the class of work as follows. 
Low-class bodices lined with cheap silesia, the fronts, 
bottom edges of sleeves and bodice, and inside of collar 
faced with narrow strips of the dress stuff on the cross or 
lining, the inside seams machined down, pinked out, or 
whipped ; cheap cased bones tacked in. 
Medium-class, lined with black-backed silesia, faced and 
tured up with silk, Paris binding bone casings, French 
horn for boning; the seams overcast or bound with cheap 
sarcenet ribbon,

seams scalloped and bound ; edges finished with fine sarcenet 
or silk ; bone casings of silk ; fine thin whalebone ; all edges 
firm, flat, and well defined.

or firm muslin and lined with Italian cloth or silk, all seams 
between ; the wadding machined to the lining ; the fronts 
further stiffened under the button-holes with firm linen;

facings of silk. 
Washing-dresses of any class are faced and turned up 
with the outside material.

lining; seams through; narrow facings on the straight pleated 
in (sometimes made of the lining only, instead of the stuff),

High-class skirts, lined with fine alpaca, polonaise, or 
silk; seams bound, or made up to come between; deep 
facings of the stuff shaped and hemmed up by hand; silk 
foot-frills ; silk belting ; bottom braid or velvet binding run 
on, turned over, and carefully hemmed or slip-stitched up. 
Tailor-made skirts, much the same, but linings made 
separately, so that seams come between; pockets and 
nlacket openings strengthened by strips of firm linen, and 
pocket made firm by decorative stitching. 
Washing-dress skirt linings are made separately wherever 
it is impossible to avoid having a lining altogether. 
A list of the materials generally used in finishing is sub- 
joined, those marked by a star being at present out of use. 
Quantities are placed against those that vary but little, but 
such quantities can only be approximate, changes of style 
making a difference here and there that must be duly taken 
into account.

+ Paris binding, Prussian binding, flannel binding, galloon, ferreting, etc., 
are different names for bindings differing so slightly that they may prac- 
tically be counted the same thing, and any one of them used as galloon at 
the worker's discretion. The soft twilled silk binding of the kind should 
be chosen for good dressmaking; the hard ones are unminageable, and

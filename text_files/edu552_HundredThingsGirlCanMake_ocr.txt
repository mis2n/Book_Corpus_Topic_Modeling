PREFACE 
Tuis addition to the numerous books on Handicrafts for Girls justifies 
itself in three distinct ways: it makes its approach to the subject from the 
standpoint of art; the materials used and the problems offered are neither 
commonplace nor hackneyed ; and the finished results, if attained through 
a careful following out of the directions given, are not only of artistic 
interest, but possess as well unquestioned commercial value. 
For these reasons, it is hoped that the book will appeal to mothers 
who desire to provide high standards of handwork for girls; to teachers 
of Domestic Art and Home Decoration who seek new ideas and fresh 
inspiration for their classes; and to the girls themselves, who are ever 
responsive to suggestions that bear upon the question of “ fancy work.” 
The average girl is bound to do something with her fingers. The 
so-called “art” needlework of the day gives her little opportunity for 
invention or for self-expression. Generally, she follows specific directions 
or a set pattern, feeling no responsibility for the design, nor for the artistic 
quality of the result. In such work, conscientious though she may be, 
the Girl may violate every art principle known to man, but she does it 
unconsciously, for she is ignorant concerning art principles. She follows 
the standard set by the pattern she has purchased at the department store, 
and she devotes endless time and patience to the production of articles 
that should never have been imagined nor created! 
These Hundred Things a Girl Can Make will suggest new fields for 
her activity and will bring to the youthful worker some realization of the 
meaning of “joy in the doing.” 
Here for the first time are offered simple approaches to the limitless 
fields of creative art. Step by step the idea unfolds. The process is 
alluring and the result convincing. The Girl is no mere copyist in working 
out these problems. She becomes, in a certain sense, a creator. Her 
product is not like any other product. It is characterized by the freshness

  of invention and it carries the stamp of individuality. Such work as this, 
done in the light of creative imagination, will play no small part in the 
development of national art standards. 
In assembling the various problems which appear in this book the 
authors desire to acknowledge their indebtedness to several co-workers, 
among whom are Miss Ella L. Langenberg, of Chicago; Miss Katherine H. 
Scott, of the University of Illinois; Miss Jean Corser, of Cleveland, Ohio; 
Miss Caroline Sheldon, Miss Marguerite Marquart and Mrs. Ida W. 
Stroud, all of Newark, New Jersey.

A HUNDRED THINGS A GIRL 
CAN MAKE 
PART ONE 
GHAP TER: 
Articles Made of Felt 
Fett is not a new material. We have worn it in slippers and in hats 
and caps. We have used it in mats and in coverings for tables and pianos. 
Cabinet makers have lined boxes and drawers for silver with it, and college 
students have for years waved pennants of felt at foot-ball games and 
at various “meets” and field days. Felt is a fabric well known to the 
commercial world, but its use as a material for making articles of use and 
beauty is not general because its possibilities and its attractiveness are 
not realized. 
Felt is not woven or spun, but is made of a mass of wool or cotton 
fibres, pressed and rolled into a fabric of uniform thickness. Its cut edges 
require no trimming or hemming to keep them from raveling. From the 
cutting of decorative shapes of paper to the cutting of decorative shapes 
of felt is therefore an easy step. 
Felt is manufactured in a variety of fine colors and is sold in the 
shops by the yard. Its extreme width (it is two yards wide) makes it 
impracticable for the industrial art worker to purchase a number of colors, 
in this form. School supply houses and some department stores have 
therefore provided a number of assorted colors of felt, cut in small pieces, 
and put up in packages. One of these packages would furnish material 
for many of the problems described in this chapter. 
If one is so fortunate as to live near a felt mill or a factory where articles 
of felt are.manufactured, it is often possible to buy cuttings, scraps and 
waste of the material by the pound. This will give a variety of colors in 
small pieces and at slight expense. Black and white should be included 
with a collection of bright colors.

    Fic. 1. 
A Pin-Tree Made of Felt 
The pin-tree (Fig. 1) is really a pin cushion, and is a bright accessory 
for dressing-table or bureau. The smallest flower pot known to commerce 
was used as a basis. The diameter of its top and its vertical height meas- 
ured two inches. It was filled with wet plaster of paris (Fig. 2), and a round 
stick or dowel cut five inches long, was’ set in the plaster (Figs. 3 and 4). 
In the absence of a suitable stick, a section of lead pencil answers the pur- 
pose. When the plaster had hardened, the flower pot and stick were 
painted with opaque water color in a tone selected with reference to the 
felt that was to be used for the tree. When the undercoat was dry, a 
border was painted on the flange of the flower pot, as shown in Fig. 1. 
When this painted border was dry, a coat of white shellac was applied, 
and the flower pot with its stick was set aside to dry. (Shellac that is com- 
mercially supplied is too thick for this type of work. It should be diluted

with alcohol. Two coats of this shellac give better results than one coat 
of thick shellac.) 
The next day, a wad or ball of cotton was glued and tied to the top of 
the stick as shown in Fig. 5. A circular piece of felt about five inches in 
diameter was then prepared. The edge of this circle was cut in points, 
and outlined with a painted marginal band of opaque water color. The 
3 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
circle thus decorated was placed over the cotton and tied with yarn securely 
to the stick. Pins with white and black bead heads were then stuck in the 
tree. These beadlike heads might be painted with opaque water colors to 
carry out any color scheme desired. When this is done, a coat of varnish 
should be added to the painted beads, to give a glossy finish. 
The color scheme used in Fig. 1 consisted of orange for the flower pot 
and stick, white, orange and black for the painted boarder on the flange, 
emerald green felt for the cushion, with painted points in black, and black 
yarn used in tying the cushion to the stick. The pin heads were black and 
white, the white surface of the plaster remaining unpainted. Figs. 6 and 
7 show three more designs that might be used in making this attractive 
and useful article. 
Fig. 6 was worked out in a color scheme of blue and orange. The 
flower pot was painted dark blue, and the felt for the cushion was bright 
orange. Small circles of black felt were glued to the tree, as an added 
decoration. In Fig. 7,a scheme of yellow and violet was chosen.. The flower 
pot was yellow with a black wave-and-dot border, while the cushion was 
dark violet with a painted decoration in yellow. Fig. 8 was finished in a 
scheme of blues and greens. The flower pot was dark green with a border 
in two lighter tones of green. The cushion was blue, with light green 
circles pasted upon it.

  Fic. 1. A Japanese Hot Dish Mat with Decorations of Felt Appliqué. 
Japanese Hot Dish Mats 
Sometimes in the Oriental shops we find sets of hot dish mats, made 
of cardboard circles, ovals, or rectangles wrapped with raffia, straw or 
grass. These sets are generally five in number, and range in size from 
six to twelve inches in diameter. Enhanced by a simple decoration of 
colored felts, these mats are extremely decorative, and are useful on the 
luncheon or tea-table, or about the house wherever the protection of a 
polished surface is necessary. 
The five mats afford an opportunity for expressing five different color 
schemes, all equally interesting. The surface of the mats is neutral in tone 
and provides a suitable background for any color scheme chosen. The 
unit of design is a circle, about an inch and a quarter in diameter. Fig. 1 
shows one of the finished mats. The colors selected formed a comple- 
mentary scheme of yellow and violet. Fig. 2 shows the mat undecorated. 
The white thread stitches have been covered with similar stitches of black

Germantown yarn. Fig. 3 shows a coin (a quarter) placed upon a piece 
of light violet felt, with a pencil tracing the shape. The cut-out felt circle 
appears above at the right. Similar circles were cut from yellow felt, the 
whole number of circles used in making the border depending on the size of 
the mat. Alternate circles of yellow and light violet were spaced within 
the outer rim of the mat, the distance between the units being carefully 
adjusted. When good spacing was secured the units were first pasted in 
place and afterward fastened with a single stitch sewed through the center 
(see Fig. 1). A couching stitch of black and white Germantown was 
used to cover the outer row of stitching on the mat (see Fig. 1). The 
whole mat was then lined with a circle of violet felt, a little darker than 
the tone used for the circular units. This lining was shaped by tracing 
around the mat itself. It was then cut out and glued to the under side of 
the mat. In the absence of a piece of felt sufficiently large for this lining, 
colored paper may be substituted. 
Other color schemes that might be used in working out these mats are 
as follows: 
(1) Bright red circles with black lining for the mat. 
(2) Circles of yellow and yellow-orange, with lining of yellow-green. 
(3) Orange and light orange circles with lining of normal blue. 
(4) Blue and blue-green circles with lining of blue-violet. 
In all these schemes, black yarn should be used for the stitches.

Fic. 1. An Elephant Button Bag.   
An Elephant Button Bag 
This bag, which may be used for buttons or marbles, is a source of 
delight both to maker and user. Gray felt was selected for this, with a 
blanket or saddle cloth of gorgeous orange (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the 
drawing of the shape which forms the pattern of the bag. Two separate 
pieces must be cut like this (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows the pattern for ears 
and tusks. Gray felt, slightly darker in tone than the felt used for the 
body of the elephant, should be selected for the ears, and white or ivory 
felt for the tusks. Fig. 5 shows the two large pieces of gray felt machine- 
stitched together, with a three-inch opening left across the top. The 
saddle cloth is a rectangular piece of felt, measuring two and a half by five 
inches, decorated with a running stitch of black. This saddle cloth is sewed 
to the back of the elephant, leaving the front edge of the opening free. A 
snap fastener is sewed to the saddle and to the front side of the bag, as

shown in Fig. 6. A piece of gray soutache braid, a narrow strip of felt or 
a bit of cord will suggest a tail, while small bright beads, orange in color, 
used for the eyes, will give to our elephant the well-known expression 
of sagacity. 
Small brass bells whick may be purchased at the ten-cent store, are at- 
tached to each corner of the saddle cloth. A bone or brass ring, sewed to 
the middle of the saddle cloth, makes a convenient hanger (see Fig. 1). 
Other color schemes which might be used with equal success 
are suggested : 
(1) Black felt for the elephant, bright green saddle, gray ears and tail. 
(2) Dark violet elephant, bright yellow saddle, white ears and tail. 
(3) Brown elephant, orange saddle, yellow ears and tail. 
(4) Dark green elephant, bright red saddle, gray ears and tail.

  Fic. 1. A Felt Holder for a Tea-pot Handle. 
A Felt Holder for a Tea-pot Handle 
The parrot’s shape and the parrot’s brilliant scheme of coloring have 
been the suggestions for the attractive addition to the tea-table which is 
shown in Fig. 1. Its use is to protect from injury the hand that “ pours.” 
Its color scheme may be adapted to the rest of the tea-service or to the 
color scheme of the dining-room. Our model is made up in an analogy of 
yellow, orange and red, balanced with black and white. 
Fig. 2 shows the pattern drawn or cut on paper which is three by 
eight and one-half inches in size. Fig. 3 shows the pattern laid on a piece 
of folded felt, orange in color. Thg parrot shapes must appear alike on both 
sides, in the finished holder, and they must be joined together as shown in 
Fig. 4. Fig. 5 shows that all cut edges are covered with a blanket stitch, 
and that the edges of the head and tail are button-holed together, leaving 
an opening in which the handle of the tea-pot is to be slipped.

of black felt are cut for bill, comb and wing. White shapes are added for 
eyes and for wing decorations. These shapes are first pasted in place and 
afterwards secured with stitches of yarn. The finishing touch is supplied 
in a red bead, sewed on the white circle which locates the eye.

  Fic. 1. A Child's Noah's Ark Bag. 
A Child’s Noah’s Ark Bag 
A charming little bag for which a child will find many uses is illustrated 
in Fig. 1. Its form suggests a little house. One use which was made of it 
gave it the name ‘‘ Noah’s Ark,” because it was filled with little wooden 
animals, such as are found in the well-known toy, always popular with 
children. If wooden animals cannot be obtained, a delightful substitute for 
them is found in animal crackers, which are short-lived, however, for their 
destiny decrees that they shall be eaten! 
The chief attraction of this little bag will be its color. Orange and 
yellow-green, yellow and violet, bright red and gray are three of the many 
combinations which may be selected. Stitches for the windows and for 
fastening the sides together should be made with black or white yarn. In 
all instances, the cord and the handle should be made to harmonize with 
the chosen colors of felt. 
Fig. 2 gives the dimensions and the pattern for the “ roof,” which forms 
the top part of the bag. It is generally the brighter of the two colors used. 
The pattern should first be cut from paper and then the felt shape should

be cut from it. Fig. 3 gives the dimensions and shape for the “ house” 
which forms the lower part of the bag. This, too, should first be cut from 
paper, as felt is too precious to waste through any misfits. 
Before the straight edges at the sides of the bag were blanket-stitched 
together, the windows were sewed on one side. Six long stitches of yarn 
were used for each little window (see Fig. 4). Then the straight edges of 
the bag were blanket-stitched together. The handle was a common wooden 
parcel-carrier, with the wire removed (see Fig. 5). A coat of black opaque 
water color was applied to the handle and allowed to dry. Then the 
decorative bands were painted in white and one color. Generally, this one 
color matched the color of the “ roof.” When this paint was dry, the 
handle was given a coat of shellac. 
The cord was knotted in the well-known “ Idiot’s Delight” method. It 
12 
 
-P-A-G-E-19
  may be made of yarn or cotton, but in color it must play its part in the gen- 
eral scheme. About fifteen inches of knotted cord will be necessary. 
Baste the back upper edge of the house to the middle of the roof. Lay 
the middle section of the cord along the basting and sew it firmly in place 
with small stitches of thread. Slip one end of the cord through the hole 
in the handle and knot the two ends of the cord together. Slip the handle 
over the knot. Remove the basting thread and sew a snap fastener on the 
under side of the front of the roof and on the outer side of the front of the 
house, as shown in Fig. 4. 
These bags, made in bright colors, are most attractive additions to 
the Christmas tree. 
The traveller will find them most convenient for holding thread, 
needles, scissors, snaps, buttons and other small but necessary accessories 
for repairing slight damages to gloves, hose and underwear. The soft, 
thick texture of felt and the protecting flap formed by the roof makes 
the “ Noah’s Ark” an ideal container for the sharp-pointed scissors and 
for papers of needles and pins. 
Other uses for these bags are suggested, as follows: 
As holders for hairpins of assorted sizes. 
As cases in which to keep lingerie tape, narrow ribbon, tape needles and 
extra lingerie pins. 
As pockets for powder puff or chamois skin. 
As safe bags for rings, pins, necklaces and other small articles 
of jewelry. 
A group of girls made for a church sale a number of these bags in a 
variety of attractive color schemes. They sold readily for fifty cents each. 
Had they been filled, in accordance with the suggestions given above, the 
selling price might have been proportionately increased. 
In offering for sale any of these simple articles, let us remember that 
it is the fine choice of color that first makes an appeal to the eye. After 
attention is thus caught, a further inspection must disclose some use for the 
article, whatever it is—and finally the quality of the workmanship must 
“stand up” under the closest scrutiny. Uneven stitches, faulty seams or 
any indication of carelessness in making, will not and should not 
attract customers. 
These are points which must be borne in mind when home-made articles 
are entered in the commercial field.

hued flowers, giving joy and delight, as flowers do, to all who beheld them. 
Fig. 1 shows the finished bag. It is made of two circular pieces of felt 
with appliquéd units on the upper disk, forming the top of the bag. Fig. 2 
shows the twelve-inch disk of oak tag which was used as a pattern in cut- 
ting the felt circles. Two circles, exactly alike, were marked in chalk 
around the pattern which was laid on the felt. The felt circles were then 
cut. One of these circles was next cut from circumference to center, as 
shown in Fig. 3. The cut disk, which was to form the top of the bag, was 
then decorated with three groups of three circles each, cut from felts of 
contrasting colors, and appliquéd at equal distances from each other. In 
the model illustrated in Fig. 1, the bag was made of violet felt, the edges 
were button-holed with light violet yarn and the decorative circles, which 
were about an inch and a quarter in diameter, were in yellow-orange, yellow 
and yellow-green. This formed what is called a split complementary color 
scheme. The edges of the large felt circles were then button-holed to- 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
    gether. If preferred, button-hole stitching may also be used to protect the 
edges of the opening. 
A colored glass bracelet, such as is affected by Chinese laundrymen, 
was used for the handle of the bag. Fig. 4 shows one of these bracelets 
attached to the center of the upper disk by means of a narrow felt strap, or 
a few strong stitches. In the absence of the glass bracelet an inch-wide- 
strip of felt, sewed to form a loop, does very well. This loop slips over the 
wrist, in carrying the bag. A tassel of felt or of yarn (Fig. 6) or a pendant 
of permanent modeling clay (Fig. 7) is then suspended from the center of 
the lower disk. This serves the double purpose of pulling the lower disk 
away from the upper, and of providing a decorative finish. 
Other forms of decoration may be used upon these circular bags instead 
of the group of three small circles which forms the unit of design in the 
bag illustrated. 
Simple flower or animal shapes may be cut from felt and appliquéd 
at regular intervals upon the upper disk; or an entire border might be 
arranged; instead of these widely spaced units for this, small squares 
or oblongs might be used. It is not wise to attempt the cutting of broken 
edges in small pieces of felt, because points, short curves or frequent 
changes of direction are hard to manage in the thick fabric. 
We must not hope to obtain with felt appliqué the same effects that 
are possible with embroidery. With a needle and silk or wool thread we 
can do finer and more varied work than with pieces of thick cloth. Differ- 
ent mediums demand different designs and different treatment. 
There is also opportunity for originality in the designing of the tassel. 
In Fig. 1 the tassel is made of yarn. In Fig. 6 narrow strips of felt, cut 
about a quarter inch in width, have been used. Many variations may be 
made in the number and style of beads used on the cord which suspends 
the tassel. 
Still another suggestion is found in the gorgeous tassels of Chinese 
make. These may be bought at shops dealing with Oriental goods, or in 
many department stores. They are wonderfully effective when used on 
these bags, although they add considerably to the cost. When a Chinese 
glass bracelet is made to serve as a handle, a Chinese tassel would be emi- 
nently appropriate, as a finishing touch. 
Care must be exercised in selecting the right color, if these tassels are 
used, for a discordant note here would ruin the effect.

  Fic. 1, A Table Mat Made of Felt and Decorated with Block Printing. 
A Table Mat Made of Felt and Decorated with Block Printing 
Block printing as a craft is not new, but block printing when applied to 
felt is quite different in appearance from block printing on cotton, silk or 
velvet. Fig. 1 shows a table mat about twelve inches square, made of 
orange felt, with a border design printed in black. One block only was used 
in the printing. The edges of the mat are not hemmed, and no lining is 
required. It is soft and thick, as the protector of the polished surface of a 
table should be. Its color may be varied to suit the decorative scheme of 
the room in which it is to be used. The mat illustrated in Fig. 1 was 
planned to be used on a dark oak table, under a brass bowl which often 
held nasturtiums or calendulas. 
Fig. 2 shows a simple design which has been drawn on squared paper, 
then traced on thin paper and pasted to the upper or rubber surface of a 
linoleum block, in this case about an inch and a quarter square. A sharp 
stencil knife is seen in Fig. 3, held in the proper position for cutting the

Cy lines. All that part of the block not needed in printing the design is cut 
away and dug out. Edges must be kept straight and corners must be left 
clean. Fig. 4 shows the block ready for printing. 
The best medium for printing is oil paint in tubes. This paint must be 
thinned by the addition of turpentine or gasoline. A pad made of several 
18 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  
thicknesses of outing flannel should be saturated with the thinned oil paint. 
The block should be pressed firmly upon the pad, as shown in Fig. 5. Sev- 
eral impressions should be printed on a piece of waste felt until an even 
print of all parts of the design is secured. Use the pad between 
each printing. 
With a sharpened piece of white chalk, draw with a ruler two squares 
within the felt square. Plan carefully the distance left between the border 
and the edges of the felt. The distance between the two drawn squares 
must be the width of the printing block. Fig. 6 shows the process of 
printing the border. Fig. 7 suggests a number of designs, any one of 
which may be easily cut from a small block. 
Good block printing never obscures the texture of the fabric upon 
which the design is printed. The paint used in printing must never be 
so thick as to form a paste or opaque coating on the cloth. The design 
must seem to be a part of the fabric itself. 
Many designers prefer printers’ inks to oil paint for block printing 
because it is easier to secure with ink a clean, sharp impression. Oil paints, 
especially when used in printing on thin silk, are apt to show a margin 
or line of oil between the design and the fabric. 
If printers’ ink is used, it must be applied to the block by means of 
a “ dauber,” rather than by means of a pad. A dauber is made by covering 
a wad of cotton with a double thickness of silk, tying the silk with thread 
so that a ball is formed. Spread the ink on a china plate or on a piece 
of glass, and use the dauber in distributing the ink evenly. Then apply 
the ink with the dauber to the printing surface of the block. 
In printing the table mat, a tube of black oil paint or a quarter-pound 
tube of “ job black” ink may be purchased. Any print shop will be able 
‘to supply the ink. 
If you should ever visit the city of Tokio, in Japan, you would see block 
printing done on the street. The worker would be sitting cross-legged 
upon the sidewalk, in front of his shop or dwelling. He would have at 
hand a bolt of cheap, white cotton cloth, and would be provided with a 
board, a pot of ink or dye and a number of wooden printing blocks. With 
this primitive outfit he will print, while you wait, one or more of the inter- 
esting Japanese towels, which in this country we utilize as table-scarfs, 
curtains and luncheon cloths. This bit of hand printing he will sell you 
for a few pennies,

A Shopping Bag Made of Felt and Decorated with Block Printing 
This shopping bag is strong and serviceable, is quickly made, and is 
most attractive in appearance. Felt seems to take the print in a highly 
satisfactory way. The impression does not obscure the fabric, but permits 
interesting flecks of background color to show through the paint. Thus 
the printed design becomes a part of the fabric. 
The size of the bag may be adapted to its intended use. In making the 
model illustrated in Fig. 1, a piece of light violet felt, cut twelve by twenty- 
four inches, was selected. Two strips of stiff cardboard, each two by 
twelve inches, were cut and inserted in cases made of darker violet felt, 
each cut five by thirteen inches. These cases were machine stitched to 
each side of the top of the bag, a cardboard strip inserted in each, and the 
ends of the felt turned in and overhanded together (see Fig. 2). Then,

before the sides of the bag were sewed together, the design was printed so 
that the front and back of the bag were decorated alike. Dark violet oil 
paint made thin by the addition of gasoline was used in printing the design. 
White chalk lines, which could be brushed from the felt when the printing 
was complete, were used to keep the stripes straight. For handles, strips 
of felt about an inch wide, middle violet in color, were sewed firmly in place 
with stout thread. The sides of the bag were then button-hole stitched to- 
gether with dark violet yarn. Fig. 2 shows all the steps in the construction 
of the bag, and Fig. 1 gives the color scheme and the decorative design of 
this particular model,

A Felt Handbag Decorated with Appliquéd and Wool Embroidery 
This is a delightful problem, involving a little more skill in needlework 
than the block-printed bag. It is lined with silk or satin and shows an in- 
teresting use of wood panels in insuring strength and shapeliness. Fig. 1 
shows the finished bag, the panels of wood held in place by the lacing of 
strong silk cord. 
The decorative design should first be sketched in pencil on paper. The 
shapes of which the design is composed should then be cut out, and ar- 
ranged upon the felt, transferring the design by means of tracing with 
chalk around each shape. Then the paper shapes should be used as patterns 
in cutting shapes from felt, of the colors selected for the design. Thus 
there will be no waste of material and no uncertainty as to the assembling 
of all parts of the design. Remember that too many small pieces will result 
in fussiness. A few rather large shapes, well arranged, will give a 
better effect.

The body of the bag is made of felt, cut ten by eighteen inches. A good 
background color should be selected, such as black, gray, dark blue, violet 
or green. The decorative design is to be appliquéd to the background first 
of all. In Fig. 3, eight small pieces of felt were used to express the flower 
arrangement in the bowl. The scroll under the bowl was outlined in black 
wool. All the shapes were first pasted in place, then secured by a stitch or 
stitches. French knots of white were used on the bowl shape. One long 
stitch was used on each stem element, and stitches to suggest a midrib and 
one or two veins were used on the leaves. The flower shapes were attached 
by running stitches set near the edges. All this stitchery is done with wool, 
its color to be determined by the color scheme selected. Satin or silk lining 
of black or of a tone in harmony with the color of “4e felt is cut the same

  size as the outside of the bag. To strengthen the sides the felt is turned in 
and overhanded to the lining (Fig. 2). The sides are then overhanded 
together with stout sewing silk matching in color the body of the bag. A 
space of about three inches is left open on each side at the top (Fig. 4). 
Fig. 5 gives the dimensions of the strips of wood, which must be stained or 
painted to match the color of the felt. They are to be pierced at each end 
with holes large enough to permit the cord to pass through twice in lacing. 
Notice that the strips of wood are placed on the outside of the bag and that 
the cord which holds them in place is strong enough to be used for handles. 
Fig. 6 is a detailed drawing, showing the method of lacing the cord through 
the strips of wood. 
For a bag of this kind all-wool felt should be used, because of its dura- 
bility and also because of its finer color and smoother finish. Wool felt 
has a quality similar to broadcloth. In fact, broadcloth may be substituted 
for felt, in this instance. The edges of broadcloth, however, must always 
be turned in or protected by stitchery, to prevent raveling. 
A bag of this fine material would always be distinguished in appear- 
ance, and would be appropriate for use with the richest of street costumes. 
The expression “all wool and a yard wide” carries with it a sugges- 
tion of quality, directly opposed to the idea implied by the word “ shoddy.” 
Hence cotton felt should not be selected for a bag whose decoration is as 
elaborate as this. 
The use of wool embroidery in connection with felt appliqué affords 
variety in the expression of certain details, such as veins, stamens, berries, 
centers of flowers, edgings of shapes, tendrils and scrolls. None of these 
elements could be expressed with felt alone. 
Many decorative stitches are used in obtaining effects of details, in a 
design. French knots, outline stitch, chain stitch, cable stitch, blanket or 
button-hole stitch, feather stitch, couching stitch are among the many 
decorative stitches that may be employed in this combination of felt 
appliqué and wool embroidery. 
In the decoration of homes, felt appliqué has wonderful possibilities. 
Portieres, screens, sofa pillows, table covers, piano scarfs and table mats 
are suggestions of the great variety of uses to which this type of decoration 
may be applied.

  Fic. 1. Ten Cent Hats with Felt Decorations. 
Ten Cent Hats with Felt Decorations 
Perhaps the crowning exercise in the decorative use of felt is found in 
the trimming of a hat. What girl ever possessed a sufficient number of hats 
to satisfy her need in the outing season? Inexpensive “sport” hats are 
quite suitable for felt decorations. Sometimes the “ Five and Ten” stores 
supply them. Each girl can choose a becoming shape, as there are many 
styles available. Fig. 1 shows two examples. The secret of successful 
trimming of these hats lies in the use of colored papers, cut into the shapes 
to be used in felt and pinned in place on the hat. The effect of the decora- 
tion can thus be observed, criticised from the standpoint of good design 
and color, and modified if necessary. Figs. 2 to 9 show a number of ele- 
ments that may be used in planning the trimming. Fig. 10 shows one of the 
many combinations that may be assembled, in addition to those illustrated 
in Fig. 1.

Fic. 10. A Combination of Felt Shapes to Form Hat Ornament, 
Stitches of Germantown wool are used in applying the felt shapes to the 
hat, and also to enrich or add to the design. In the illustration above 
(Fig. 10) are shown several different stitches. These may be varied in 
many ways. For instance, centers to the two large central shapes might 
be made of a soft ball of cut Germantown yarn after the manner described 
on pages 116 and 117 of this book. The fluffy quality of the ball affords 
a fine contrast of texture when compared with the flat, firm felt shapes. 
Another means of enrichment is found in the use of glass beads at 
the centers of the flower-like shapes. These beads may be applied in 
either of two ways: small beads may be used to fill in a shape or field, 
or larger beads may be used singly or in clusters at the centers of the 
felt shapes to give a brilliant and jewel-like effect. 
The same care should be exercised in the selection of colors, regarding 
their intensity, values and the use of balancing neutrals such as black 
and white, as would be observed in planning a room interior, a costume 
or a poster. 
All-felt hats, hats of rough colored straw, or frames covered with 
velveteen or any similar material may also be trimmed with felt appliqué. 
27
-P-A-G-E-34
  Each girl can thus become her own milliner, at least to the extent of 
trimming becoming shapes. It is the trimmed hat which is costly in the 
shops. Through the use of the decorations suggested, several hats may 
be obtained at the cost of one which has been purchased already trimmed. 
A few color combinations are suggested : 
1. White felt hat, trimmed with emerald green and black. 
2. Black velvet hat, with felt appliqué in orange and white. 
3. Orange broadcloth or duvetyne hat, with black and white felt 
appliqué. 
4. All-felt hat, any desired color, trimmed with wool embroidery, 
omitting felt shapes. 
In these exercises, the all-important considerations are fine color 
combinations expressed through neat and accurate workmanship. 
The effect gained through the use of rich materials may be utterly 
destroyed if colors are not harmoniously adjusted and all stitches well set. 
A hat, as well as a building, should be well constructed, from the foundation 
to the minutest details. 
A safe principle of design, when working with any material, is to 
exercise restraint in the use of decoration. A hat as well as a building 
should depend primarily on its fine line quality, rather than upon the 
amount of decoration.

CHAPTER ITI 
Articles Made of Cardboard and Paper 
Paper and cardboard can be obtained by everyone, at slight expense, but 
even materials as common as these must be selected with judgment and taste. 
Cardboard for a box, for example, must be heavy enough not to bend easily, 
nor to warp. The various papers that are suggested for use in this chapter 
must be fine in color and suitable for the purpose, in quality. 
The school supply houses are equipped with a variety of papers and 
cardboards suitable for the simple constructions involved in these articles, 
so that any store which is accustomed to meet the demands of school 
children would probably carry stock of the kind desired for the problems 
in this chapter. 
When paint is specified in these descriptions, opaque water color is 
meant. This medium is well known to commercial designers, who use it 
for display cards, window signs and posters. It comes in bottles or small 
jars, and is sometimes called “ Show Card Color” or “ Letterine.” It can 
be bought at any stationer’s. Two brushes, a No. 3 and a No. 6, will be 
found convenient to use when applying opaque color. The paint can be 
washed. from the brushes by shaking them in clean water, as with ordinary 
water color. Opaque color should be of the consistency of cream, when 
applied. If it is too thick to spread well, as it comes from the bottle, it 
can be diluted with water. If the bottle shows a sediment in the bottom, 
the paint should be thoroughly stirred with a small stick until it is of a 
uniform consistency. 
A good quality of paste will be necessary in making these articles. 
Mucilage is unsatisfactory for this purpose. Paste which contains a small 
amount of glue is best. 
When shellac or varnish is used, as in the making of the lampshade 
(page 44) and the coin-purse (page 57), apply it thin, reducing its con- 
sistency, as it comes in the can, with a little alcohol. Do not add alcohol to 
the fluid in the can, but pour a small quantity out, and thin only what is 
needed. Apply two coats of thin shellac, or even three, rather than one 
thick coat. One coat must dry thoroughly before another is added.

  A Needle Book with a Bright Cover 
This small but useful article finds a ready sale at a bazaar or Christmas 
fair, and is a welcome addition to the workbasket. Needle books in a great 
variety of bright colors may be made, following the simple scheme of 
choosing for the covers, papers of intense colors, with all decorations in 
black and white. The illustration shows a needle book whose cover was 
a brilliant emerald green, with the design of black and white paper shapes. 
Fig. 1 shows a 2% inch by 4 inch oblong of oak tag (a thin cardboard) 
which gives stiffness to the cover. Fig. 2 shows an oblong of bright colored 
paper cut exactly the size of Fig. 1. This paper is pasted to the cardboard. 
Another oblong of paper of the same color, 4% inches by 234 inches, is 
then cut, and covered cardboard laid upon it, color side up, so that 4 inch 
margins of colored paper extend on all sides of the covered card- 
board (Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows the corners of paper trimmed (mitred) and 
the margins ready to be turned and pasted down. Fig. 5 shows the shape 
and finish of two pieces of flannel for the leaves of the book. These leaves 
are cut a little smaller than the cover. They are sewed with white thread 
to the middle of the cover, as.shown in Fig. 6. The little book is then folded 
carefully, so that the crease on the outside of the cover is straight. A 
simple design, like those shown in Fig. 7, is then cut, carefully arranged, 
and pasted on one side of the cover. A few needles should be inserted in 
the flannel leaves, as shown in Fig. 6.

Necklace Made of Paper-Beads Strung with Glass Beads 
When painted in opaque water colors and varnished, these paper beads 
are remarkably effective. They resemble Venetian beads, which are made 
of glass or porcelain, or the painted clay beads of the Egyptians. In- 
expensive glass beads, strung alternately with paper beads, will give spark- 
ling notes of color, and add variety to a repetition which might otherwise 
be monotonous. 
The construction of the cylindric beads illustrated on this page is very 
simple. Fig. 1 shows the pattern and the rolling process, which must be 
accurately done, so that the edges make smooth ends of the bead, when 
rolled and pasted. A strip of manila paper, one-half inch wide and nine 
inches long is rolled on a round wooden toothpick, its surface first being 
covered with paste. Each successive layer of paper thus sticks tightly to 
the under layer. When tightly rolled, and before the paste is dry, the 
layers may be pressed into a cylindrical shape, with flat ends. The removal 
of the toothpick leaves a hole for stringing.

    \Vhen cut apart, the pattern for each bead is an isosceles triangle, whose 
base is one and one-quarter inches. 
Fig. 2 shows the triangular strip covered with paste, with the round 
wooden toothpick laid in position for rolling the bead. Beginning at the 
base, the successive layers become narrower and narrower, ending in a 
point which marks the middle of the outside of the bead. The outer surface 
is not smooth, as in the cylindric bead, but the ridges do not interfere with 
decorative painting. Fig. 3 gives a number of suggestions for designs and 
color schemes. Fig. 4 shows a necklace made of paper beads, painted in 
dark blue and pale orange, on a cream manila background. They are 
strung with small, dark blue glass beads.

  Fic. 1. A Box for Holding a Ball of Twine. 
A Box for Holding a Ball of Twine 
A box of this kind has several uses. It may hold a knitting-ball, a ball 
of twine, or, by cutting a rectangular opening in the top, and pasting the 
three open edges of the cover to the side of the box, it may serve as a bank, 
for the saving of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters. 
Fig. 1 shows the box, finished for use as a twine holder. Note the per- 
foration in the center of the top, through which an end of twine passes, and 
the tapes for tying pasted on the cover and front side of the box, under the 
cut paper decorations. 
Fig. 2 shows the pattern of the box which must be carefully measured 
and drawn with a ruler on heavy cardboard. The back of a large writing 
tablet might be used for this. Fig. 2 gives all dimensions. All edges that 
are to be bent, in forming the box, must first ibe scored, that is, partially cut 
through with the point of a knife-blade. Fig. 3 shows the box cut out, 
scored and folded. Fig. 4 shows the size and shape of the four strips of 
dark gray paper, which are pasted on the corners. Each strip should first 
be creased, as shown in Fig. 4, to assist in pasting the sides of the box 
together (Fig. 5). Fig 6 shows the method of cutting from paper a part 
of the decorative design, which is made entirely of cut paper shapes. The 
colors used for these shapes should be bright and decorative. In the model 
illustrated (Fig. 1) squares of gray paper were cut to fit all sides of the

A box in which handkerchiefs are sold may be made individual and 
interesting if treated in the manner suggested on this page. Black squared 
paper is cut in a square which measures a half-inch smaller than the top 
of the box. Four narrow panels, each a quarter-inch smaller in each di- 
mension than the sides of the box, are then cut. Upon each of these five 
pieces of squared paper is to be printed a design, made by dipping a small 
stick whose ends are of some geometric shape into opaque water color and 
then pressing the dipped end upon the surface where the shape is desired. 
When these papers are covered with a surface pattern, they are pasted to

the top and sides of the box. Each shape of paper is a little smaller than 
the side of the box to which it is pasted, so that a narrow margin is left, 
surrounding each panel of paper. This margin may be painted, if desired. 
Fig. 1 shows the decorated box, upon whose sides are pasted panels of 
black squared paper, printed in white and emerald green. A knotted cord 
of emerald green silk or mercerized cotton, with painted paper beads at 
the ends, adds a further decorative note to the box. Fig. 2 shows the way 
in which a surface pattern and a border are obtained by stick printing. Fig. 
3 shows a collection of small sticks, each differently shaped at the end. 
These sticks may be bought at any school supply house. In their absence, 
the ends of matches, small corks or pencils may be used. Fig. 4 is a diagram 
which shows the relation between the decorated shapes of paper and the top 
and sides of the box—there must always be a narrow margin of cardboard 
around each paper panel. Fig. 5 shows two more boxes, of different 
shapes. The upper one is an empty Uneeda Biscuit box. This is an ex- 
cellent container for home made candy, nuts, small cakes or any other 
Christmas goody. The lower illustration shows a commonplace commercial 
box, transformed into a handsome gift box, by the process described. 
These boxes are not varnished or shellaced, when finished. The deco- 
rations, therefore, have no gloss.

Decorative Paper Flowers 
These designs, made entirely of paper, remind us of flowers. They are 
a good substitute, when fresh blossoms are not available. For table deco- 
rations, for window displays in stores, or for use in complementing or 
completing the color scheme of a vase or jar, they are most interesting and 
unique. Their construction is simply a matter of paper folding and cut- 
ting, but their success as decorations depends on the choice of colors in 
papers and paints. 
Bright colored, rather thin papers, known as chroma or poster papers, 
are best for this work, as they fold easily, can be pasted without wrinkles, 
and can be painted upon with opaque water colors. These poster papers 
may be obtained of any school supply house. Tissue or crépe papers should 
not be substituted for them. Fig. 1 shows a group of these flowers placed 
in a painted bottle, which is described in the chapter on “ Painted Things.” 
The stems are of milliner’s wire, around which narrow strips of green 
paper have been tightly twisted. The ends of these papers at the top, are 
pasted to the middle of the underside of the flowers. An extra circle of 
paper is slipped over the stem and pasted to the entire base of the flower, 
thus covering the joining of stem and base. 
Figs. 2 to 8 show the development of a six-parted design. This may be 
used as a pattern in tracing and cutting the design from any number of col- 
ored papers, or it may be folded and cut of any color desired, and pasted on 
a three-inch circle of paper, in a contrasting tone. Fig. 9 shows additions 
paint, made to further enrich the design.

shows this same design and one other, both pasted to five-inch circular 
backgrounds and treated with further enrichment with opaque water colors. 
These two designs are now ready to be pasted to their paper covered stems. 
Perhaps the most helpful suggestion that can be made in regard to color 
schemes for these flowers will be through a description of the group shown 
in Fig. 1. The vase was painted in yellow-orange, orange and red-orange, 
with additions of black. It was decided to carry these same colors, in dif- 
ferent tones, to the flowers. Several sheets of poster paper showing light 
tints of orange and yellow, an intense note of red-orange, with black and 
white for color balances, were then selected. A number of four and five- 
inch circles were cut from these papers, preliminary to the folding and 
cutting of the various designs. The aim was to use a light design against 
dark background, or the reverse. One of the most successful arrange- 
ments was not folded at all—it was simply a succession of circles, varying 
from three inches to three-quarters of an inch in diameter. These circles 
were cut in red-orange, black, white, and yellow. The result shows at the 
lower right, in Fig. 1. 
It is possible to carry out these color schemes entirely through the use of 
poster or chroma papers, if a sufficient variety in colors is at hand. Opaque 
water colors are only used in the absence of suitable colored papers. These 
flowers should not be varnished.

  is called mechanical drawing paper. These shades may be made singly or 
in sets. At a luncheon or dinner, the shades used are generally alike in 
color and design. 
Fig. 2 shows the pattern for the shade, drawn on a g-inch by 12-inch 
sheet of paper. The curves, which are arcs of circles, must. be drawn 
with a compass, the outer curve with a six-inch radius, and the inner curve 
with a 234-inch radius (Fig. 2). The outer curve is to be measured by a 
chord of 11% inches (Fig. 2). Cut out the shade. 
For the decoration, a few large shapes are better than many small ones. 
In the model illustrated (Fig. 1) three main shapes are used. Fig. 3 shows 
the method of cutting the pattern for these. As the decorations are to be 
painted on the shade, the pattern for the design may be cut from plain 
paper, placed on the shade, and traced (Fig. 4). The three main shapes are 
then filled in, with opaque water color—in this case ultramarine blue. A 
wave line of orange was painted on the top and bottom edges of the 
shade (Fig. 5). When the paint was dry, marginal lines of black were

added to both blue and orange shapes. The large blue shapes were further 
enriched by additions of white and black, as shown in Fig. 1. Smaller cir- 
cular shapes of black, orange and white, were painted between the large 
blue shapes (Fig. 1). When all the paint was thoroughly dry the entire 
shade was given a coat of shellac. 
Wire frames are necessary for holding the shade in place on the 
candle (Fig. 6). These can be bought at ‘ Five and Ten” stores, or in 
any novelty shop.

A Paper Shade for an Electric Lamp 
A larger and somewhat more elaborate shade than that given in the 
previous problem is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is planned for use on an elec- 
tric lamp, in a bedroom or boudoir, and its decorations may be. adapted to 
any color scheme already expressed in the furnishings. 
Mechanical drawing paper is used again for this shade, a somewhat 
larger sheet being required, as the radius for the outer curve is 14% 
inches (Fig. 2). A parallel curve for the lower edge of the shade is drawn

with a radius of 9% inches. This leaves a height of 5 itches for the 
shade. The chord that measures the outer arc of the shade is 21% inches. 
Fig. 2 gives all these dimensions, which must be accurately raeasured and 
drawn by means of compasses and ruler. 
Fig 3 shows the shade cut out and divided into four panels. This 
division, also, should be made with the aid of compasses and ruler. Note 
that a quarter-inch space for lapping and pasting is set off at one end of 
the pattern, the rest of the arc being divided into fourths. The pencil lines 
are covered with a brush line in black. These four spaces are to be filled 
with decorative units. Four suggestions are shown in Fig. 4. A shape is 
first sketched on a small piece of paper, and then cut out, to serve as a pat- 
tern in tracing the unit in each of the four patterns of the shade. These 
shapes are then filled in with the desired color. After the first coat is dry, 
various lines, dots or other shapes may be added, as indicated in the illustra- 
tions. Marginal bands of black are painted around both edges of the shade. 
When all paint is absolutely dry, the shade may be shellacked, if an ivory 
finish is desired, or linseed oil may be applied if a darker tone is preferred. 
Oil may be applied with a brush. A wire frame is necessary to hold the 
shade in position over the electric bulb (Fig. 5). The beauty of the lamp- 
shade depends very largely upon the choice of colors used in painting the

design units. Strong contrasts of light and dark colors are desirable, in a 
small decoration of this kind. Violet and yellow, strong blue and orange, 
vermilion and turquoise are all good, and may be effectively combined with 
black and white. Fig. 6 shows another suggestion for the decorative unit. 
These shades may be infinite in variety, as the imaginative invention of 
the worker will suggest many motives for the design, and many beautiful 
combinations of color.

This kite floats in the air, as a pennant does. It must always be at- 
tached to a stick. When carried by children in pageants, processions or 
parades, these floating masses of intense color are most interesting and 
effective. They may also be suspended, singly or in groups, from the 
chandeliers, or hung in porches or other outside places where currents of 
air will keep them in motion. In Japan, a huge and gorgeous fish kite, 
attached to gateway, door-post or chimney, betokens the birth of a boy baby 
to the happy family. 
The brightest colors of crépe paper are used in making the kites. Yel- 
low, orange, red, violet, blue and green colors in their most intense tones, 
are gorgeous to behold with the decorative elements—in eye and tail—in 
black and white. 
Fig. 2 shows the shape which should be drawn on smooth wrapping 
paper, cut out and used as a pattern, in cutting the front and back of the 
kite from crépe or tissue paper. Two shapes of the same size and color are

  necessary. The edges are pasted together throughout, except the edges 
of the “mouth,” which are left open. A piece of milliner’s wire 12 
inches long, is formed into a ring by twisting the ends together (Fig. 3). 
This is placed in the “ mouth” of the fish, the edges of paper being turned 
over the wire and pasted down. String is tied to opposite sides of the wire 
ring, as shown in Fig. 1. . A cord as long as desired is tied at the crossing 
of the strings, the other end being tied to a rod, if it is to be carried. 
The scales are drawn with charcoal, or painted with opaque water 
colors. When “silver” or “gold” scales are used, the effect is 
quite dazzling. 
Figs. 4, 5 and 6 give the construction of the eye, and a suggestion for 
the tail decoration.

  Fic. 1. Portfolio with Wrapping Paper Crackled and Dyed. 
A Portfolio Covered with Wrapping Paper, Crackled and Dyed 
This portfolio is unique because of its interesting cover. A piece of 
wrapping paper whose surface is hard and glazed has been crumpled in 
the hands until it is crackled into an interesting pattern. In this crumpled 
condition it is immersed in dye, allowed to stay a minute or two, until the 
dye has penetrated into all the folds, then removed and squeezed as nearly 
dry as possible. The wet paper is then unfolded and pressed with a hot 
(not scorching) iron, until it is nearly dry. It is then left to dry slowly, 
resulting in an effect that closely resembles tooled leather. 
The dye that was used in coloring the paper in the portfolio illustrated 
in Fig. 1 was obtained by soaking a sheet of green crépe paper in about a 
pint of water. All the color left the paper, which was squeezed out and 
thrown away. The dye that remained was strong in color, as it should be 
for this work. Any color desired can be obtained by soaking different 
colors of crépe paper. Orange dye obtained in this way gives a delightful

color effect when crumpled brown wrapping paper is dipped in it. Violet, 
red and blue dyes obtained from crépe papers have also been used with 
great success. The cheaper the quality of crépe paper, the better is the 
coloring matter extracted by soaking. 
Fig. 2 shows one of the two cardboards necessary for the covers of the 
portfolio laid upon a sheet of crackled paper. The paper should extend a 
half-inch beyond the cardboard, on all sides. Figs. 3 and 4 show how the 
corners of the paper are trimmed or mitred, so that the margins may be 
neatly folded over and pasted down. 
The inside of the covers must now be covered. A decorative end paper is 
most desirable here. Fig. 5 shows a sheet of 9 inch by 12 inch construction 
paper, whose color is harmonious with the crackled paper used on the out- 
side. This paper has been ruled in half-inch squares, to form a diagram 
upon which may be printed an interesting design. Sticks such as those 
shown in Fig. 7 are used in printing the design on the end papers, follow- 
ing the same process described on pages 37 and 38. The ends of corks, 
printing sticks, etc., may be cut and slightly carved, so that a variation on 
the geometric shape is obtained, as shown in the last five drawings in Fig. 7. 
Opaque water color is used to print the design, which in this case was car- 
ried out in a scheme of yellow and orange, on a green background, 
The covers of the portfolio were perforated about two inches from each 
end, and eyelets inserted in the holes. Notebook rings were passed through

A Chinese Coin Purse 
As a safe receptacle for silver change, this fascinating bit of color is of 
practical use. When we find that it is evolved from an empty container of 
a gas mantle, our interest in the trifle is immensely increased. Here is 
another instance of a commonplace and apparently worthless article made 
interesting and useful through the application of art. 
If gas mantles are not used in the household, a suitable box may be 
obtained at any drug store where they are in constant use as containers 
of various powders, tablets and salts. They are about three inches high and 
two inches in diameter. 
Before beginning work on the purse, it is well to assemble all ma- 
terials to be used in making it, for the color scheme will be determined by 
the choice of cretonne or other fabric that is necessary to cover the box. A 
small piece about 614 by 314 inches is all that is needed, but this scrap must 
be interesting in design and fine in color. It forms the basis of the color 
scheme, and all other decorative elements added must be selected with 
reference to this bit of cloth. 
The next selection, in order of importance, is the Chinese cord and 
tassel, which is at once a necessary element in the construction of the purse, 
55

and one of the main features of the decora- 
tion. This should be bright in color— 
orange, green, blue, violet, yellow or red— 
and should reflect or supplement the colors 
of the cloth. The tassels may be bought at 
any shop that deals in Oriental goods. In 
: small sizes, they are often seen in “ Five Fic. 6. Coin Purse Open Show- Fe ! 
ing the Construction of the Cord. and Ten” stores. Those most suitable for 
our purpose range in price from twenty-five to thirty-five cents. 
The box is first given a coat of paint, both inside and out, of the tone 
desired for lining, cover and rims. Opaque water color is used for this 
(Fig. 2). When the paint is dry, a hole is punched in the exact center of 
the lid, and a small button mold is glued over this hole, on the outside of 
the cover (Fig. 3). This button-mold is then painted in a color in harmony 
with the lid, but not necessarily the same color. The scrap of cretonne, 
ribbon or silk is then fitted around the box, and sewed neatly and securely 
with thread that shows as little as possible. If the material is heavy enough, 
paste may be used instead of sewing (Fig. 4). A bit of trimming braid, 
cotton or silk, is pasted to hide each edge of the fabric (Fig. 5). (White 
braid may be painted or dyed, to bring it in harmony with the general 
color scheme.) A hole is then punched in the exact center of the bottom 
of the box, a bead is strung on the double cord of the Chinese tassel, and 
the end of the double cord is strung through the hole in the bottom and also 
56
-P-A-G-E-63
  
be   
through the hole in the cover. A knot is tied below the bead, to hold it in 
place against the outside of the bottom of the box (Fig. 6). Another bead 
is strung on the cord above the button mold, and knots tied in the cord, 
both above and below the bead. This holds the bead firmly in position, 
and acts as a stop to the lid, when the purse is open. Fig. 6 shows the 
adjustment of cord, beads, knots and box. Fig. 7 shows several arrange- 
ments of beads, modeled from permanent clay, which have been painted 
with show card colors, and varnished. Such decorations may be strung 
upon the cord at intervals, thus adding to the effectiveness of the purse as 
an ornament. 
The top, bottom, rims and inside of the box should be treated with one 
or two coats of shellac or varnish, to give lustre to the paint and to add to 
its durability. 
Sometimes the gas mantle box, transformed by these touches of art, 
officiates as an electric light pull. Its cord, adjusted to the proper length, 
can be attached to the switch chain, the box and hanging tassel providing 
decorative notes of bright coloring. The box is strong enough and of 
suitable size to be grasped by the hand when pulling the chain. 
Art students and young people of talent are always looking for a 
market for their products. The general public is not interested in sketches 
and illustrations. The majority of people are, however, anxious to purchase 
articles that are unique and novel in their character. Sometimes a trifle 
such as the coin purse becomes the vogue or fad for a time, and herein 
lies the opportunity of the art student. Gift shops are always on the 
look-out for something new in the way of favors. Decorated boxes are 
particularly popular for a box or container is a universal need. 
Another cylindric box, much smaller in size, is employed commercially 
as a container for the brass paper fasteners used extensively in business 
offices. Few people think of saving these boxes. When empty, they are 
usually tossed into the waste basket. Transformed by a coat of opaque 
water color and by painted decorations, these little boxes became very 
popular as holders for small powder puffs. They were known as 
“sweater” powder boxes, because they could so easily be carried in 
sweater pockets. 
At a school bazaar, these tiny boxes, containing a small powder puff, 
sold for fifty cents each. They were made by a class of high school girls 
who sold all they had prepared and took orders for more. 
So many and so varied are the schemes for the decoration of boxes 
that it seems wise never to throw away a box that is well made, of good 
57
-P-A-G-E-64
  proportions and intact. The size and shape of the box must suggest its 
decoration. If of large size, colored papers may be substituted for 
paints in planning the decorations. For example, a common oyster con- 
tainer, cylindric in shape, was made into a really interesting box by 
pasting strips of colored papers, cut about half an inch in width, at equal 
intervals around the box, on its curved sides. A cut paper decoration 
for the round top, similar in style to the designs suggested on pages 40 
and 41, was pasted in place. The colors used were tints of red and green, 
and the contents of the box carried out the general color scheme, for it was 
filled with red and white and green and white stick candy. Of course this 
box was used as a Christmas favor. 
It is not the cost of a gift which makes it of value to the recipient. 
It is rather the unique and unusual quality of the article, however simple 
it may be, together with the suggestion that the donor has expended taste, 
skill and thoughtful consideration in preparing some little token of 
affectionate regard.

CHAPTER III 
Articles Made of Wood 
Ir is a mistake to suppose that girls are debarred from the pleasure of 
making anything of wood, simply because they are girls. Some girls, as 
well as some boys, have a decided inclination toward the handling of tools. 
This natural bent should be allowed to develop, through exercise and 
training. Thin whitewood is not a difficult material to work with, and the 
coping saw is a tool that may be easily manipulated by girls and boys alike. 
As a matter of training, girls need practice in the handling of tools, in 
measuring accurately and in the manipulation of materials other than 
cloth, threads and yarn. There is no reason for confining their hand-work 
to sewing, knitting, embroidery and the general crafts of the needle. 
Quarter-inch whitewood, cut in sizes for the making of toys and small 
decorative articles, may be obtained at school supply houses, or in mills 
or shops dealing with lumber. The wood of cigar boxes or other con- 
tainers of like nature is not desirable, as it splits badly and is injured by the 
soaking process necessary to the removal of labels. 
For hard woods of beautiful grain or surface, stains and oil finishes are 
best, as they bring out and enhance the natural beauty of the wood, but 
stains seldom improve the surface of soft wood. On the contrary, stains 
seem to seek out the sap-filled portions of thin, soft woods, and to empha- 
size rather than to conceal defects. A box or tray that has been beautifully 
planed or sand papered to a satin finish is frequently ruined by immersion 
in a bath of water or oil stain. For soft woods, paint is the most satis- 
factory finish. 
Opaque water colors are the most convenient to handle in applying 
decorative color schemes to the various articles described in this chapter. 
They dry quickly, and when shellacked or varnished the effect is quite as 
good as that obtained through the use of oil or enamel paints. If enamel 
paints are at hand, and it is possible to give the necessary time to the 
drying of the several coats required, they will make a more durable finish.

    Fic. 1. Tumbling Tom. 
Tumbling Tom 
Tumbling Tom can be depended upon to appeal to every individual, 
young or old, grave or gay, rich or poor, ignorant or cultured. He is in- 
evitably comic, as he turns a succession of somersaults upon the parallel 
bars which support him. The notches into which the turning pin slips are 
not at first noticeable, so that a moment of breathless suspense is ex- 
perienced by the uninitiated, lest the tumbler fall ignominiously, when he 
reaches the end of the bars. 
Tom is painted in gorgeous colors. In the first place, he has received 
a coat of flesh tint (light red-orange). Then his trousers are painted 
dark blue, his jacket and shoes bright orange, his collar and stockings white, 
his hair and features black. Either enamel paints or opaque water colors 
may be used for this. In either case, the colors, when dry, should be shel- 
lacked or varnished. 
The bars upon which Tom turns should be painted black or white, so 
that the main color interest centers in the little clown. Fig. 1 shows the 
finished toy. 
Thin whitewood, a coping saw and paint, are the materials required.

Fig. 2 shows the sketch of the figure, drawn upon a piece of three-eighths

upon paper and cut out, to use a pattern in tracing it on the wood. In this 
way, many figures may be traced from one drawing. Fig. 3 shows the 
coping saw in position for sawing out the figure. After the figure is sawed 
out it will be best to make the parallel bars before attempting to find the 
point through which the balancing rod is to pass.

Fic. 6. Construction of Parallel Bars. 
Seven pieces of whitewood are used in the construction of the bars— 
a base, four uprights, and two horizontals. The base is a piece of half-inch 
whitewood, cut two and one-half by ten and one-half inches. The four up- 
rights are made of quarter-inch whitewood, cut six and one-half by three- 
quarter inch. The horizontals are three-eighths inch whitewood, cut 
twelve and one-half by one-half inches. The method of nailing these 
parts together is shown in Fig. 6. Half-inch brads are used. Fig. 6 also 
shows the notches which are cut near the end of each horizontal, to prevent 
the turning pin from working off the bars. 
After the bars are finished, determine as nearly as possible the balancing 
point, through which a three-sixteenths inch dowel is to pass. Two pins, 
with sharp points and bead heads may be driven in the figure temporarily, 
to test the position of the balancing point (Fig. 4). If the little clown turns 
easily on these pins, they may be removed and a hole bored at this point 
with a three-sixteenths inch bit. Through this hole a three-sixteenth inch 
dowel, cut four inches long, is driven. To support and strengthen this 
dowel, two button molds are slipped over the ends, and glued to the sides of 
the clown, as shown in Fig. 5. The figure should now turn repeated somer- 
saults on the bars, when struck lightly on the protruding lock of hair above 
the forehead. 
Any color scheme desired may be used in painting the toy. The 
scheme used in painting this model has already been described.

  Fic. 1, An‘‘Elephant"’ Cardholder. 
An Elephant Cardholder 
This little article is a useful adjunct to the desk or writing table. It 
may hold correspondence or catalogue cards, envelopes or unanswered let- 
ters. Fig. 1 shows the finished model painted in a scheme of black, white, 
gray and orange. It is made of three pieces of wood, the dimensions of 
which are given in the working drawing shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 2 shows the 
method of shaping the pattern for the sides. A piece of 234 by 3 inch 
paper is folded on its short diameter and cut in a curve, resulting in the 
shape shown in Fig. 3. This shape is traced on each of two pieces of quar- 
ter-inch whitewood, measuring 234 by 3 inches. After the shapes are 
sawed out, they are fastened with 34 inch brads to the middle piece, which 
is 34 inch by 3 inches (Fig. 4). Three brads are used on each side. The 
sides are then sand papered to a smooth, satin finish, and the form of the 
elephant sketched upon both, as the holder is alike, back and front. The 
various shapes of tusk, ear, trunk, legs, tail, eye and blanket should be 
definitely drawn, as they are all to be lined in with black, after the painting 
is done. The body of the elephant is painted gray, the background orange, 
the tusk and toes white, the saddle or blanket black, with an orange and a 
white band. The eye is indicated by a line of black, with a white dot under 
it. These paints are all opaque water colors. When they are dry, one or 
two coats of thin shellac will be necessary to give them brilliancy. 
Fig. 5 shows the cardholder in use.

Fic. 4. Working Drawing Showing Construction of Cardholder. 
The shape of the elephant is peculiarly suitable for the design of the 
cardholder, as the animal is so nearly symmetrical. It is therefore har- 
monious with the structural contour of the object. 
Other animal shapes may be used, of course, but care should be 
exercised in the selection, because the mere painting of an animal shape 
would not take into consideration the requirements of structure. 
An owl shape with slight changes might serve as an appropriate 
design. Two animal shapes facing each other might be used—dogs, cats, 
frogs, rabbits, etc., might be drawn in sitting postures, facing each other. 
Whatever animal is taken as a motif, remember that the emphasis 
must be placed upon the shape as a design rather than upon its use as a 
picture. Realism has no place in the decoration of a constructed article.

  Fic, 1, A Decorated Hanger for a Telephone Book 
A Decorated Hanger for a Telephone Book 
Where to hang the telephone book so that the nail will not be unsightly 
is often a problem. The device illustrated in Fig. 1 shows a diamond 
shaped piece of wood, decoratively painted, which is to be fastened at top © 
and bottom to the wall or window frame, by means of finishing nails. A 
decorative brass hook is screwed through the center of the hanger and the 
telephone book is hung by its loop upon that. 
Fig. 2 shows the diamond shape drawn on a piece of quarter-inch white- 
wood, cut 2% by 334 inches. When this shape is sawed out, a line is ruled 
all around it, 1% inch from each edge (Fig. 3). This marginal line de- 
termines the slant of the bevel, which is made by planing, preferably with 
a block plane. When the bevel is planed smooth and even on all edges, the 
entire surface of the wood is smoothed with “oo” sandpaper. The hook is 
then screwed in place (Fig. 4). A decorative design is then prepared, either

by cutting a paper pattern or by drawing directly on the block (Fig. 1). 
The shapes are filled in with a group of colors that will be harmonious with 
the color scheme of the room in which the hanger is to be used. (Black, 
white and one intense color, is a safe scheme to follow.) The bevel may be 
treated with a line and dot or wave design, as suggested in Fig. 1. Two or 
three coats of thin shellac should be applied to protect the paint and give 
it brilliancy.

Decorative Window Stops: Figure Motive 
When the wind rattles the windows at night, a convenient little wedge 
may be slipped between the sash and casing. If the wedge is interesting in 
color and design we shall not object to its permanent employment. At 
least it will be granted a place on the window sill under no danger of being 
tossed into the wastebasket—the usual fate of a less interesting though

In Fig. 1 are given three colorful and attractive figures, to be drawn 
and painted on the bits of wood that form the window stops. The witch, 
the King and the cook are fanciful figures, the coloring of whose costumes 
is here given in detail. Fig. 2 gives the construction. The general shape 
of the figure is drawn upon a piece of quarter-inch whitewood, 334 by 14 
inches, and then sawed out. With a plane or knife the lower end of the 
sawed-out shape is whittled or shaved to form a wedge. The details of the 
figure and the shapes of different parts of the costume are then drawn on

the wood. If preferred, the drawing may 
first be made on paper, and then traced on 
the wood, or a tracing of one of the figures 
shown in Fig. 1 may be made on thin paper 
and transferred to the wood. (Designs may 
be transferred by rubbing graphite from a 
lead pencil on the back of a tracing, placing 
the graphite side next to the wood, and 
drawing over all lines with a hard, sharp 
pencil.) When all shapes are clearly de- 
fined, they may be filled in with paint. 
Ogaque water colors and shellac may be used, or enamel paints, as desired. 
Two coats of thinned shellac or varnish are better than one heavy coat.

Window Wedges Made of Thin Wood and Decoratively Painted 
These “ fancy free” bird shapes are first designed with scissors and 
paper, or drawn on paper and cut out, as shown in Fig. 2. They may be 
made to resemble closely some familiar bird, or they may be entirely imag- 
inative, both in shape and coloring. In either case, each shape must show 
the addition of the wedge, cut out of the same piece of wood, so that both 
wedge and decoration are entirely flat. Fig. 2 shows the first step. Fig. 3 
shows the process of tracing the pattern on a piece of white wood, the size 
to be determined by the size and shape of the bird, not more than 214 
inches in its greatest dimension, including length of wedge. Fig. 4 shows

the coping saw in position for sawing out the shape. ‘The end of the 
wedge is to be whittled or planed, so that it will slip easily between the sash 
and the casing. The entire shape is then sandpapered, to give a smooth 
surface. Additional shapes, such as wings, tail, bill, etc.) may be drawn 
on the wooden shape, and the paint applied. The color scheme should be 
brilliant, in strong contrasts of dark and light. If opaque water colors 
are used, shellac or varnish will be necessary as a finish. Enamel paints 
already contain varnish, and are glossy when dry.

A Balancing Parrot 
This gay bird balancing on his stand, challenges you to disturb his 
equilibrium. A slight blow will set him to swinging, but he is not easily 
“knocked off his perch.” 
The parrot is sawed from a single piece of quarter-inch whitewood, cut 
5% by 10% inches. Fig. 2 shows the drawing which was made on paper 
the same size as the wood. The sketch was cut out and used as a pattern 
in tracing the shape on the wood, preparatory to sawing it out. Fig. 3 
shows the end view of the wood, and the saw in position. 
The stand (Fig. 4) is made of four pieces of whitewood stock, the 
dimensions of which are given in the drawing. Lead weights such as are 
used in ladies’ coats, are fastened to either side of the tail, at the extreme 
end. This is done with half-inch brads. The weights serve as a balance, 
increasing the pendulum-like motion of the bird when swinging. 
The foot or claw of the bird is made of tin. A split. or incision one- 
quarter inch deep is made with the coping saw in the wood, and a flat piece 
of tin is forced into this cut. The size of the tin is about 14 inch by %4 
inch. It may be cut with tinner’s shears from a tin can. A narrow groove 
is made with a knife in the top of the perch, as indicated in Fig. 1. Into 
72 
 
-P-A-G-E-79
  this groove the tin edge of the claw is inserted, keeping our parrot from 
slipping off the perch. 
An attractive color scheme for the balancing parrot would be green, 
red, black and white—green for the stand, red for the comb, black for the 
bill, white for the body, green, red, black and white for the wing, and red 
and black for the tail. Opaque water colors may be used, with finishing 
coats of shellac, or enamel paints may be applied, if preferred. 
The balancing parrot will also perform his graceful undulations if he is 
set in a trapeze instead of on a perch. A trapeze may be made of two 
quarter-inch dowels (round sticks), respectively four and five inches iong. 
The parrot is fastened to the middle of the five-inch stick by means of a 
three-quarter-inch brad. A half-inch brad is driven into each end of each 
dowel so that a cord may be attached, in completing the trapeze. The 
upper and shorter dowel is about nine inches above the lower dowel. This 
gives the parrot ample room for swinging.

  Fic. 1. Plant Sticks Made of Thin Wood. 
Plant Stick Made of Thin Wood 
Plant sticks in the window garden serve a double purpose. They sup- 
port a stalk that needs strength or direction and they afford a bright note of 
interest among the green leaves. It seems entirely harmonious to see 
shapes of birds and butterflies among the plants and flowers. 
Fig. 1 shows two of these plant sticks, painted in bright colors. The 
stick itself is a quarter-inch dowel, sharpened at one end, and of any 
length desired. The bird shape is a separate piece of whitewood, sawed 
out in the manner previously described, and attached to the end of the dowel 
by means of a brad whose head has been filed to a point. 
Fig. 2 shows the shape of a bird drawn on paper, to be cut out and

used as a pattern in tracing the form on a piece of quarter-inch whitewood 
(Fig. 3). The size of the whitewood depends upon the desired size of the 
decorative bird shape. (The longest dimensions should not exceed three 
inches.) Fig. 4 shows a brad which has been driven into a quarter-inch 
dowel, and whose head has been filed to a sharp point. This point is pushed 
into the thickness of the bird shape, at a place where it will give the proper 
position to the bird. Both dowel and bird shape are painted in decorative 
color schemes. If opaque water colors are used, two or three coats of shel- 
lac will be necessary to finish. Perhaps in this case, enamel paints would 
be better, as the plant sticks will inevitably become spattered with water. 
The oil in enamel paints will offer a better resistance to dampness. 
Fig. 5 gives several interesting shapes which are large enough to be 
traced and used in the same size, as decorative heads to plant or flower 
sticks. In every case, the paint should be applied flat, with no attempt to 
show feathers or other effects of realism. These sticks are decorations, 
rather than representations of living birds. 
These sticks are planned for use in flower-pots, and are intended 
primarily for the house or porch. The same idea may be applied in 
making garden sticks of larger size. For such a purpose, the dowel should 
be from two to three feet long, and one-half or five-eighths inches 
in diameter. 
The decorative shape may be sawed from one-half or five-eighths-inch 
stock. The design of these shapes may be conventional flowers, decorative 
birds, butterflies or other animals, or they may be geometric or purely 
imaginative. The thickness of the stock will force a certain simplicity 
of treatment which is a decided advantage. 
In the garden, before blossoms appear on such growths as chrysanthe- 
mums, lilies, gladiolas, foxglove stocks, snap dragons, asters and marigolds,

these sticks with their gorgeous mosaics of color will afford something of 
the joy and interest which later are supplied by the blossoms. 
These plant and garden sticks have a definite commercial value, as is 
evidenced by their increasing sales in gift and craft shops.

a piece of quarter-inch whitewood also cut 514 inches by 6 inches. Fig. 4 
shows the tracing completed and the coping saw in position for sawing out 
the shape. The stand or carriage is made of thin pieces of wood (not 
counting the wheels) the dimensions of which are given in Fig. 5. The 
two side pieces are nailed with half-inch brads to the broad piece in the 
manner shown in Fig. 1. Notice that the side pieces are nailed broad side 
down to the foundation piece. This leaves a space of one-quarter inch pe- 
tween the two side pieces, into which the feet of the toy snugly fit. 
The wheels of the carriage are sections of a broomstick, sawed three- 
eighths inch thick (Fig. 6). Fig. 7 shows the manner of attachment of

the wheels will turn easily. 
The horse is gaily painted in a decorative scheme of yellow, violet, white 
and gray, the colors of the carriage supplementing the colors used on 
the horse. 
Fig. 8 gives a suggestion for a toy dog, and Fig. 9 shows a toy donkey. 
Both of these toys are made by the process just described, using whitewood 
of the same dimensions as those indicated for the horse. 
These toys are usually painted with opaque water colors, with the appli- 
cation of two or three coats of thin shellac. Enamel paints may be substi- 
tuted if preferred.

dowel and the arms of half-inch dowels. A discarded curtain pole makes an 
excellent substitute for the one and one-quarter-inch dowel. It may be 
sawed into lengths for the body of the doll. Similar dowels for the legs and 
arms can be obtained at hardware stores. 
The key to the anatomical mysteries of the Dowel Doll lies in ability to 
perform successfully a few of the simplest of tool operations. A saw, a 
hammer, a half round file, a round or rat tail file, a small plane, and some 
one inch, flat-head brads must be on hand, in addition to the dowels 
required. A bench vise is almost a necessity for holding the dowels firmly 
in place, during the operation of sawing.

In Fig. 10 the half round file is shown in position for shaping the top of

in place with brads, so that they articulate freely yet are firmly joined. 
Figs. 13 and 14 show the shaping of the shoes and the method of attach- 
ment to the leg. 
When all the parts are nailed together, the whole doll is given a coat of 
white oil paint. When this is dry, a coat of flesh colored enamel paint is 
applied, with such accessories as hair, features, stockings and shoes ren- 
dered in appropriate colars, as shown in Fig. 15. 
Dressing the doll is a delight to all girls. Patterns for bloomers and a 
slip-on dress should be drawn on paper first. Fig. 16 gives the plan and 
the dimensions for the pattern of the bloomers, and Fig. 17 shows a method 
of rounding the corners of the paper pattern. Fig. 18 shows the bloomers 
cut from muslin or cotton crépe, with openings for the legs buttonholed 
and the hem run in for the draw string. Fig. 19 shows the garment drawn 
into shape. 
The pattern for the doll’s slip-on dress is very simple. Fig. 20 shows

how to cut it from a piece of eight-inch by tourteen-inch paper. When the 
dress is cut from cloth, the edges are hemmed and a decorative stitch, such 
as a long running stitch, a blanket stitch or a cross stitch is used for trim- 
ming. (See Fig. 1, page 81.) 
Figs. 21, 22 and 23 give the pattern and the processes of cutting, making 
and finishing a hood or bonnet, which is usually made from the same ma- 
terial as the dress, decorated with the same style of stitchery. 
The making of the doll’s parasol is illustrated in Figs. 24 to 26. A sec- 
tion of a cork three-fourths of an inch in diameter is used as a center. 
Into this are inserted eight round toothpicks, at equal distances from each 
other. The toothpicks for the ribs upon which is woven mercerized cotton 
“woof,” in colors that harmonize with the decorative stitching on the bon- 
net and dress. Figs. 24 and 25 show the construction of the frame and the 
process of weaving. Fig. 26 shows the insertion of a short hairpin or a 
flower pin into the center of the under side of the cork. The ends of the 
toothpicks, the cork center and the hatpin should be painted black.

  ‘ 
THERE are many things about the liouse that are commonplace and un- 
interesting themselves, but which suggest treatment that is capable oi 
transforming them into objects of individuality and beauty. Such treat 
ment must always be rendered in the light of art knowledge. Indeed, the 
objects themselves must be selected vith due regard for their appropriate- 
ness for transformation. A person with art knowledge or possessing an 
art “sense” would not think of decorating a coal scuttle, of gilding a 
rolling pin or of painting a landscape upon a snow shovel. Such decora- 
tions are ridiculous, they are offensive to people of refinement and good 
taste. A sense of the fitness of things will aid in the selection of articles 
that may be decorated without interfering with function or use, and in 
creating new uses for articles that have been considered worthless. 
The articles presented in this chapter have all been transformed through 
the use of paint, applied under the guidance of a knowledge of color 
harmonies and of the principles of design. Many other suggestions will 
doubtless occur to the girl who works out these problems, for originality 
and invention are stimulated and developed through these delight- 
ful occupations. 
A Glass Container Transformed Into a Cracker Jar 
Since the reign of high prices, these containers have disappeared from 
the shelves of the Ten Cent Stores, where they were formerly sold, and are 
now to be found among housefurnishings in department or hardware 
stores. Even here the price is not prohibitive. If there are smokers in 
the family, it is not unlikely that empty glass jars which formerly held 
tobacco may be obtained. After a thorough cleansing, such jars may be 
decorated in the manner illustrated on page g1. 
The form of the glass jar shown on page 91 suggested the scheme of 
decoration. Orange and black enamel paint was applied to alternate panels, 
as shown in the sketch. A bevel between the panels was left unpainted. 
Around the knob was tied a gorgeous Chinese cord and tassel, emerald 
green in color. It took but a little time and small expense to transform this 
cémmonplace jar into an interesting and unusual addition to the tea service.

   Fic. 1. School Bag with Decorated Wooden Handles. 
A School Bag from the Ten Cent Store Decorated with a Band of 
Appliqué Felt and Painted Handles 
Two commonplace articles have been transformed in this exercise 
by a, touch of the fairy wand of color. The shoestring bag has been cut 
down to more pleasing proportions, and decorated by a broad binding of 
felt, upon which has been appliquéd some simple shapes, also of felt. . The 
band was a fine orange in color, and the appliquéd shapes were white and 
black. (See Fig. 1.) 
Perhaps the greatest transformation was the changing of a common 
wooden bundle carrier into a handle of real beauty. Fig. 2 shows the first 
step—the removal of the wire, through the use of pliers. The handle thus 
freed from the wire was given a coat of orange paint. When this was dry, 
bands of white were painted upon the orange background. After these 
were dry, black dots and marginal bands were added, as shown in the 
handle of the bag illustrated in Fig. 1. Either enamel paints or opaque 
water colors may be used to paint the handles. If the latter, two or

three coats of shellac will be necessary to give the paint brilliance 
and durability. 
Stout twine must be twisted or knotted to form a cord strong enough 
to hold a bag full of books. This cord is slipped through the hole in the 
handle, and the ends fastened securely to the sides of the bag. Two 
wooden handles and two cords will be necessary, one for each side of the 
bag. Fig. 3 gives four more suggestions for the decorations of these 
handles. They may be used for many purposes.

Whene’er your curtains flap at night,

And go to sleep again. 
Art has a magic hand, which transforms and beautifies that which it 
touches. The prosaic clothespin whose mission seemed fulfilled in the 
laundry has been made fit for my lady’s chamber, through the tasteful 
arrangement of a few colors and shapes. 
Fig. 1 shows two suggestions for such arrangements. Nothing is done 
to the clothespin, save the application of various colors and shaffes of paint. 
First, an undercoat of whatever color is desired as the dominating tone 
is applied. While this coat is drying, a design for the upper and lower 
rectangular spaces should be planned on paper. These spaces are long, 
narrow rectangles, about six times as long as they are wide. Several 
ideas for the decorative design are given in Figs. 1 and 2. A long, narrow 
rectangle may be drawn, and filled with a treatment of parallel lines, as in 
the first illustration (Fig. 1). A simple unit may be repeated, as in-a

border, surrounded by marginal lines, as in the second illustration; a bor- 
der of alternate units, as in the third illustration; or a wave line with 
variations, as in the fourth illustration. The design when drawn should 
be transferred to the upper and lower surfaces of the painted clothespin, 
and painted with a small brush, in a color strongly contrasting with the 
undercoat. Either enamel paints or opaque water colors may be used 
for this. Finishing coats of shellac are necessary, in case opaque water 
colors are selected. 
These pins should be painted in pairs. They sell readily at fairs or 
bazaars, because they fill a real need, and are interesting bits of decoration.

Figs. 1, 2 and 3 show spools that have been painted with opaque water 
colors, and varnished, and used as decorative elements upon the curtain 
cord which is attached to the metal ring at the bottom of a window shade. 
Additions of beads, painted button molds, pendants and tassels may be 
made, as suggested in the illustrations. Any color scheme desired may be 
employed, remembering that these small decorative notes are generally most 
effective if painted with brilliant colors, in strong contrasts of dark 
and light. 
Fig. 4 shows a spool of average size and shape. This is to be painted 
first with an undercoat of opaque water color, in any tone desired. A 
button mold, as shown in Fig. 5, may be glued to the top and bottom of 
the spool, and painted in the same or in contrasting colors. Beads of 
wood may be painted to harmonize with the spool, or glass beads may be 
used (Fig. 6). Either tassels or pendants made of permanent modeéling 
clay and painted, may be attached to the lower end of the cord upon 
which the spool and beads are strung. Fig. 7 gives suggestions as to 
shapes of these pendants,

A Clothespin Doll 
These dolls are intended for dinner favors, and have been used fre- 
quently in connection with place cards. They can be made to stand 
upright if a half-inch hem, secured with thick paste, is turned up at the 
bottom of the dress. A simple decoration, such as a wave line or a hori- 
zontal band of color, may be painted on the hem with opaque water colors. 
The paste and the paint make the hem so stiff that the dress will support 
the doll, thus forming a background against which a place card may rest.

coat of flesh-tinted paint, either oil paint or opaque water color. Hair, 
eyes, mouth and nose have been added in appropriate colors. Fig. 5 shows 
the simple pattern for the dress, which should be made of crépe paper in 
an intense color which harmonizes with the table decorations. Fig. 6 
shows the head of the doll slipped through the neck opening. The dress 
is then folded to form the sleeves of the kimona, the folds being held in 
place by a crépe paper sash, of contrasting color, or of black or white 
(Fig. 7). A button mold measuring about one and three-eighths inches 
in diameter is then tacked on the head of the doll, to serve as a hat. Fig. 8 
shows two of the many designs which may be painted on the button 
mold, with opaque water colors, or with oil paints. Fig. 9 gives three 
more suggestions. 
If opaque water colors are used in painting the doll, and the hat, a coat 
of shellac must be added, when the colors are dry. 
These little favors are “ best sellers” at a bazaar or fair.

A Painted Bottle Used as a Flower Holder 
Flowers from the garden are the bright accents that dress a room and 
add a note of interest to any decorative scheme. We are often at a loss 
for suitable containers for the wealth of blossoms that our gardens provide.

proportions may be painted in color schemes that suggest certain flowers. 
We may thus increase the supply of flower holders, and at the same time 
provide unusually interesting receptacles for the garden favorites. Fig. 1 
shows a container that once held Maraschino cherries. It was selected 
for decoration because of its fine contour and graceful proportions. By 
the intelligent use of enamel paint and varnish it has been transformed 
from a bottle into a vase, worthy of a place in drawing room or boudoir. 
The first step in the transforming process is the application of a coat 
of varnish or shellac, laid with a brush directly on the outside of the 
bottle (Fig. 2). This coat is allowed to dry thoroughly. Next, the 
desired scheme of colors must be selected. Figs. 3 and 4 show a bottle 
painted in a scheme of yellow, yellow-orange, orange and red-orange, with 
special reference to its use as a holder of galliardias, marigolds or calen-

dulas. Three of these colors were applied over the coat of shellac, as 
indicated in Fig. 3. A very narrow space of unpainted glass was left 
between the colors to prevent blending. When the paint is dry, bands of 
black or white may be painted over these spaces, as shown in Fig. 5. These 
bottles may be kept severely simple, showing no decoration other than the 
coats of paint, or they may show added decorations in lines, dots or 
small shapes. The middle illustration in Fig. 5 shows a bottle of the 
former type. It has no decoration except its color and two bands of 
black. It is intended as a holder for asters. The lower portion is painted 
104
-P-A-G-E-111
violet, and the neck a tint of red-violet. The collar or flange is blue-violet. 
The third bottle shown in Fig. 5 was painted a light yellow-green, with a 
band of blue-green at the top, and decorative lines of dark blue. The bead- 
like spots were light yellow. The first illustration in Fig. 5 was painted in 
two tones of blue, with black and white lines and dots. It was intended 
as a holder of bachelor’s buttons. 
Bottles or other glass containers must be painted with oil paints, as 
opaque water colors will not adhere to the glass. Enamel paints, which 
are oil paints mixed with varnish, are best for this purpose, because they 
dry to a glossy finish which resembles a glaze obtained through firing. It 
is well to add a coat of varnish even to the oil paint when dry, as this 
protects the paint from the injury which will inevitably result from water 
and much handling.

As the surface of the fan is not smooth, being broken by ridges radiat- 
ing from the top of the stem or handle, it is best to depend upon cut paper 
patterns for the conventional flowers which form the decorations. The 
process of cutting these patterns is shown in Figs. 2 to 7. Fig. 2 shows 
the three inch square of stiff paper which is to be used for folding. An 
easy way to cut a circle is shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 shows the four-fold 
creased again, to form an eight-fold, and a design sketched upon it. Fig. 5 
shows the design cut out. When unfolded, Fig. 6 is the result. Fig. 7 
shows two variations which may be cut froma circle folded into eight parts. 
The process of using a paper pattern to paint the decorations on the 
fan is shown in Figs. 8 to 10. In Fig. 1 the largest unit appears at the 
top. A four-inch circle was drawn or traced upon the fan. This circle was 
filled in with enamel paint, emerald green in color. When the paint was dry, 
a pattern was cut on a five-fold circle. (See page 108.) This pattern was 
placed over the emerald green circle, and traced both on the inner and outer 
edges (Fig. 8). The space between the traced lines was filled in with dark 
blue enamel paint (Fig. 9). A marginal line was added in dark blue, and 
small circles were painted in white, as shown in Fig. 10. The upper unit in

The other units on the fan were painted in the same way, beginning 
with patterns cut from various folds of circles of paper. A marginal 
band is painted on the outer edge of the fan, and the handle is given a 
coat of paint in harmony with the general color scheme. Both sides of

Celluloid Powder Boxes Decorated with Enamel Paints 
Various small articles made of celluloid (or a close imitation) are to 
be found in the Five and Ten Cent Stores. Powder boxes, trays and 
other accessories of the toilet table are made more interesting by the 
addition of color, judiciously applied in small designs. For this purpose, 
choose the ivory tint in preference to pink or blue celluloid. It is a safer 
background upon which to paint the simplest design, in colors. 
Enamel paints must be used for this, as opaque water colors will not 
adhere to the smooth, shining surface of celluloid. 
Figs. 1, 2 and 3 show three sizes of boxes that are useful and which 
have been made decorative. A simple system of lines, dots and small 
abstract shapes has been painted on each box. The colors were applied

A Decorated Picnic or Market Basket 
The basket that lends itself best to this style of decoration is about 
twelve inches long and five inches high. It is made of br ad splints woven 
in the “ over and under” method, and has at the top bot’: an inner and an 
outer rim, to which the splints and the handle are nailed. Such a basket is 
useful in many ways. It may serve as a holder for snall garden tools, 
it may accompany a lady to market, or it may be packed with a generous 
lunch for the picnic. With such attractive decorations as are illustrated 
in Fig. 1, it may make its entrance into polite society with no occasion 
for apology, for it reflects credit upon its possessor, and honors the office 
which it fulfills. 
Either enamel paints or opaque water colors may be used in painting 
the basket. The former are somewhat more durable, and the latter, when 
used, must be protected by several coats of shellac. 
If a decoration similar to that illustrated is desired, a paper pattern will 
prove the most convenient means of placing the units of design upon the 
basket. Fig. 2 shows a four-inch square of paper, folded in the middle.

a pencilled outline made of each unit. The color scheme is then selected. 
Some bright color, as orange or blue, should be used for the flower shapes. 
The leaves may be green or black. The outlines are filled in with the 
selected colors, which must be allowed to dry thoroughly. Further 
additions in the way of bands or dots in contrasting colors, may then be 
made to the flower shapes. A broad outline of black placed around all leaf 
and flower shapes will bring the design out strongly. 
The outer margin and the handle may then be painted in black, or in a 
dark tone of the color used for the flower shapes. When this is dry, lines 
or shapes of white or a light tint of color may be added.

Who would believe that a common brick could be so transformed? 
Enamel paints, applied with some little knowledge of color harmonies and 
design, have wrought this change in its appearance. Its decorations have 
not interfered with its function, which in this case is to keep an open door 
from swinging shut. Indeed, the door stop, as it is called, has become 
an object of interest in the general scheme of decoration.

‘anel. 
A pressed brick, with straight edges and even surface should be selected 
for this purpose. It should be given first a coat of paint or shellac so that 
the enamel paints, when applied, will not sink into the porous surface. 
This undercoat must be thoroughly dry before the design is placed upon it. 
Fig. 3 shows the method of preparing the design for the top face of the 
brick. A piece of paper is cut the exact size of the top face, and laid off 
in three panels. The shape of the elephant is drawn in the middle and 
widest panel. The end panels are cut off. One of them is folded in the 
middle, and half of the design unit is drawn upon the fold (Fig. 4). The 
unfolded unit is shown in Fig. 5. The elephant shape is then cut out. The 
top face of the brick is marked off in panels, similar to the divisions 
made on the paper pattern (Fig. 3). Upon the middle section the cut 
out elephant shape is placed and traced. The design for the end panels 
is traced from the unit shown in Fig. 4. The shapes of the blanket, 
ear, eye, tusk and toes must be drawn after the main shape of the elephant 
is traced. 
A color scheme must now be selected. In Figs. 1 and 2 the 
elephant shape was painted orange, against a black background. The 
blanket was painted white, with a blue border, and the end designs were 
white against black, with an orange circle in the middle of the flower shape. 
A simple arrangement of lines was painted on the sides of the brick. 
These. were orange against a gray background. When the paint was 
dry, a coat of shellac was applied to protect the surface, and to prevent 
chipping. A rectangle of felt, cut the exact size of the broad face of the 
brick, was glued to the bottom, to prevent the scratching of a polished floor.

servation that lie all about us, if we have eyes to see. Every household

  must solve in some way the problem of the disposition of its numerous 
“ containers.” The rubbish can is the usual destination of all such articles. 
America as a nation has been condemned for profligacy. Unfortunately 
we have earned this reputation through our habits of wastefulness. 
For the sake of correcting this tendency as well as for the pleasure 
of exercising ingenuity in “making something out of nothing” can we 
not give a thought to the further use of the pasteboard packet, the tin 
container, the glass jar or bottle, the wooden box or the papier-maché cup, 
measure or pail? 
The habit of treating a worthy container in the same way that we 
would treat a costume, a room or a house—as suggesting interesting 
possibilities for the creation of beauty—will inevitably lead to the better- 
ment of national standards of taste. 
It is art in the little things that counts!

CHAPTER V 
Needlework 
Tue crafts of knitting and crochet are purposely omitted from this 
book, not because they are deemed unworthy, but because the field is 
already so well covered. Every manufacturer of yarns, knitting cottons 
or silks puts out a book of directions for their use. The magazines and 
home departments in other journals constantly furnish new ideas in the 
various forms of handwork commonly practised by women. It is the aim 
in this chapter to suggest a group of articles in the realm of needlework 
that will possess the charm of novelty, at the same time offering oppor- 
tunity for artistic expression of design. 
The “tie and dye” method of textile designing is now in vogue. As 
is the case with many other fads taken up by those who possess little or 
no knowledge of color harmonies or of the principles of design, many 
artistic crimes are committed in the name of this interesting craft. If 
one is to make it a success, the materials used must be suitable, the dyes 
must be of good color quantity, and the dyeing, which really determines the 
placing and the distribution of color shapes, must be planned with regard 
to art principles. 
The directions for dyeing the specific designs presented on pp. 116 to 
146 would better be followed exactly, until the worker has gained enough 
experience to vary the patterns illustrated and to invent new ways of 
using them. 
The common commercial dyes, put up in small envelopes for household 
purposes, are to be used in this work. They may be obtained in any drug 
store. In preparing them for use, follow the directions printed on the 
envelope. An effort should be made to select the colors of best quality 
among those available. A fine orange, an excellent blue, a satisfactory 
violet, a good yellow and several tones of green may now be obtained. 
These colors will form a good basis for beginning the work.

A Boutonniére Made of Felt and Germantown Yarn 
These little bouquets, made of felts and Germantown yarns, are wonder- 
fully effective, when worn on a coat, a muff or a hat. At a Christmas 
bazaar, they sell themselves, for they are so evidently unique, and so 
adaptable in their wide range of colors to many different personalities. 
A bunch of three usually forms the boutonniére, as illustrated in Fig. 1. 
The different “flowers” may be expressed in colors that are analogous 
(that is, related to each other) as are yellow, yellow-green, yellow-orange, 
or violet, blue-violet and red-violet. Tints and shades of these related 
colors should be used in combination with intense tones. Black, white 
and gray in felts or yarns, always stand ready to balance any decorative 
color scheme. 
Fig. 2 shows the disk of cardboard or stiff paper that is used as a 
winder for the yarn. The size of this disk determines the size of the 
ball which forms the center of the flower. Fig. 3 shows a string or cord 
placed around the inner opening of the disk and the first stitch or loop of 
the yarn tied to keep the cord in place. The fingers must hold the cord so 
that each stitch is sewed through it and around the disk, as shown in Fig. 4.

When the disk is completely covered with yarn, the ends should be in posi-

knot at the center, and the scissors in position for cutting the yarn at the 
outer edge of the disk. The disk is to be torn or cut out and thrown away. 
Fig. 6 shows the clipping process necessary to make the ball even on 
the surface. 
The calyx-like foundation for the ball is made of felt. A paper 
pattern is first cut from a two-inch circle, folded into four, five or six 
parts, as described on pp. 40 and 41. This pattern is laid upon the felt 
and traced. One of the cut out results is shown in Fig. 8. A piece 
of milliner’s wire is cut for the stem—about three inches in length. Each 
end of the wire is bent and twisted to form a loop (Fig. 9). The cord 
with which the ball is tied is passed through the loop at the top of the

Figs. 2 to 7 show the steps in making the pinwheel, and in developing 
the design for its decoration. Two cardboard disks are first cut, measur- 
ing five and one-half inches in diameter (Fig. 2). These disks are to be

(Fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows the method of developing the decorative design. 
A circle of paper about four inches in diameter is folded into sixths. One- 
sixth is then cut out, folded on its axis, and a sketch of half of the unit 
made upon the fold (Fig. 6). With a compass, a four-inch circle is then 
drawn upon one side of the covered cardboards. This circle is divided into 
sixths, by laying off the radius six times upon the circumference, and 
ruling lines from these points to the center of the circle. The unfolded 
pattern of the unit of design is placed within each of these divisions and 
traced. The shapes thus formed are filled in with opaque water colors, 
in the desired tones. Marginal lines or small shapes may be added, if the 
design seems to need enrichment. The placing of the pins at regular 
intervals on the edge of the wheel is the finishing touch,

This apron, which in its shape and decoration suggests a basket filled 
with flowers, is most convenient to use when setting out small plants, 
gathering seeds or “ slipping.” Its deep pockets may hold a pair of garden 
shears, a trowel, a small weeding rake or several plant labels. The apron 
should be made of denim or of stout unbleached muslin, as it will be 
subjected to rough use. 
Fig. 1 shows a model made of unbleached muslin, the edges bound 
with bias strips of sateen, held in place by long running stitches of 
Germantown yarn. White or colored tape might be substituted for the 
bias strips of sateen. The flower and leaf shapes are cut from any

bright hued cotton or linen scraps that the piece box provides. These 
shapes are basted in place on the apron, just above the top of the pockets 
and are then permanently secured by a couching stitch of yarn, around the 
edge of each shape. A cluster of French knots placed near the middle of 
all flower shapes helps to hold them in place, and adds to the decora- 
tive effect. 
Fig. 2 shows the method of drafting the pattern for the apron. A 
piece of paper about 16 by 9 inches will be needed. Make all measure- 
ments according to the dimensions given in Fig. 2, and then draw the 
necessary lines. Cut out the pattern. Lay it on the folded cloth and cut 
out the apron. 
The pocket is exactly the shape of the lower part of the apron. Care- 
fully measure the dimensions, draw the curve at the right, and cut out the 
pattern. Place this on folded cloth and cut out the pocket. Lay the 
pocket over the lower part of the apron, and see that all edges fit. Baste 
on the binding. Notice that a double line of running stitches is sewed

also that the bands of binding or tape that are sewed from the middle of 
the top edge of the pocket to the belt. Fig. 4 gives the width of the tie 
strings, which are to be made as long as desired and hemmed. They are 
to be stitched to the belt, which is made of a strip of muslin doubled, and 
the top edge of the apron slipped between the edges. The bias bands of 
binding (or tape) are used at the top and bottom of the belt. The 
attractiveness of this article depends upon the choice of colors made, and 
upon neatness of workmanship.

becoming, and are often worn as sport caps to school, on the playground 
or wherever an informal head covering is appropriate. One and one-half 
yards of unbleached muslin will be required to make both of these articles 
in a size large enough for the average girl of ten years. 
Fig. 1 shows the completed models. The decorations are in blue, 
orange and black stitchery, although shapes cut from colored cottons or 
linens could be substituted for the wool embroidery. The apron is not 
hemmed, but the edges are blanket-stitched with dark blue yarn. Fig. 2 
shows the cap. This is easily made, if the steps shown in Figs. 3 to 8 
are closely followed. It has but two parts—a brim and the crown. Both 
must be cut from patterns. 
Fig. 3 shows the pattern for the crown. A piece of paper 8 inches by 
12% inches will be needed for this. Lay off the dimensions as given in

piece of paper measuring 434 inches by 8 inches, lay off the dimensions 
given in Fig. 4, draw the curves indicated for the shape of the brim and 
cut out the pattern. Lay the pattern for the crown on muslin folded in 
the middle and cut out the crown (Fig. 5). Run a gathering thread 
around the upper curve, as shown in Fig. 5. Baste a piece of white 
cotton tape to the lower curve, to serve as a casing for elastic, as shown 
in Fig. 7. 
Cut three separate pieces of muslin from the pattern shown in Fig. 4. 
One of these is to be used as a lining between the other two. (If a 
stiff brim is preferred, lining canvas may be substituted for the inner piece 
of muslin.) Before basting these three pieces together, plan the design 
to be used on the brim. This is best accomplished by cutting leaf and 
flower shapes of paper, arranging them as shown in Fig. 6, and tracing 
around the shapes with a soft lead pencil. The yarn is run in to fill these 
shapes with a darning stitch, as shown in Fig. 6. Orange for the center 
shape, blue for the right and left shapes, and black for the leaf shapes 
is a good combination. The three shapes for the brim are then basted 
together. The outer edges are turned in and run with a double row of 
stitches, as shown in Fig. 6. One row is in blue Germantown and the 
other in black. The gathering string on the crown is then pulled to fit 
the inner edge of the brim, and the two parts basted together. The seam 
is bound with white tape. The cap should now look like Fig. 7. Fig. 8 
shows the cap with the elastic inserted in the casing and adjusted to fit 
the head size. 
The pattern for the apron is shown in Figs. 9 and 10. Make all meas- 
urements carefully, and draft the necessary lines. Cut out the patterns.

Cut the front of the apron on folded cloth, but cut two separate pieces 
for the back. 
As the open edges must be hemmed, and the top secured by a button 
and button hole, or by snaps, allowance must be made for two hems. 
Pockets may be added, if desired. The same patterns cut for the deco- 
rations of the cap may be used again for the front of the apron. If 
decorations are used on the pockets, smaller shapes must be cut out, and 
a simpler arrangement made. Fig. 10 gives all necessary details for 
finishing the apron.

      Fic. 11. The Apron with its Decorations. 
Unbleached muslin of the cheaper quality—showing a loose, open 
weave—is a material capable of many uses, in decorative needle work. 
The more expensive quality being heavier and more closely woven, is stiff 
and unyielding. It does not drape easily and it is not so suitable for 
embroidery or for dyeing. This is another instance of the use of materials 
of little cost in accomplishing results of genuine artistic merit. Art does 
not depend on money, fortunately, in working its miracles.

  Pic. 1. A Tied and Dyed Pillow Cover. 
A Tied and Dyed Pillow Cover 
The interesting “tie and dye” method of securing textile design is 
illustrated in the pillow cover shown in Fig. 1. Diamond dyes for cotton 
goods are the colors used in the group of designs which follow. The 
pillow cover was dyed a fine blue-green, made by mixing a green dye and 
a blue dye, prepared separately. The directions printed on the envelope in 
which the dyes are sealed should be followed exactly to secure satisfactory 
results. Unbleached muslin of a light, open quality or cotton crépe are 
the best materials for all the articles described in this chapter. 
Fig. 2 shows a piece of unbleached muslin cut 18 inches square. A 
large marble is placed in the center and the muslin, is drawn smoothly down 
on all sides. A rubber band or a piece of cotton cord is then twisted or 
tied around the muslin, close up to the marble. More rubber bands are 
then twisted around the cloth under the marble until a space about two 
inches wide is wrapped, as shown in Fig. 3. This wrapping must be tight, 
but not close enough to absolutely cover the cloth, as the spaces between 
the wrapping permit the dye to enter, resulting in an interesting play of 
color in a space that would otherwise be entirely white. A second space is

wound about an inch and one half below the first winding (Fig. 4). This 
second winding is about an inch in width. Notice the interesting relation 
of spaces, in the tied design in Fig. 4—first, the marble, then the two-inch 
band of cord or rubbers, then the inch and one-half space of muslin, then 
the inch-wide band of tying. This arrangement when dyed results in the 
middle part of the design shown in Fig. 1. A marble is then tied in each 
corner of the square, with two bands of tying, as shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 6 
shows the square tied, and ready for dipping in the dye. It should first 
be soaked in clear water, until all the folds are thoroughly saturated. This 
will take longer than would be supposed—probably ten minutes. It should 
then be dipped in the dye—hot or cold as the directions state. Let it stay 
135
-P-A-G-E-138
in the dye until all parts are thoroughly saturated. Sometimes it is neces- 
sary to boil the goods in the dye. Upon removing the goods from boiling 
dye, rinse thoroughly in clear water. Shake out the cover and hang it 
up until nearly dry. Then remove the rubber bands or string and shake 
out the square. The result should be similar to Fig. 1. A square of plain 
muslin for the back of the pillow should be dyed at the same time as the 
tied design. 
Another method sometimes followed in securing a design similar to 
the pillow cover illustrated on page 134 is the sewing method. To do this, 
fold all four corners of the square to the center. See that all four sections 
thus folded are even in size. Upon the folded square, lay a small plate 
or saucer, exactly at the center. Trace around this with a piece of 
sharpened chalk. Remove the plate and with a needle and strong thread 
sew around the drawn circle with running stitches about a half-inch long. 
Draw this thread straight, and tie it securely. Adjust all the gathers 
evenly, as in gathering a ruffle. All four sections of the square will be 
included in the gathers. 
Now begin the tying or winding, starting at the gathering thread and 
winding down, or below the thread, until the desired width of the band is 
obtained. Skip a space, and wind again. Immerse in water, as before, and 
dye. When the string and the gathering thread are removed, a design 
similar to Fig. 1, page 134, will result.

    Fic. 1. A Tied and Dyed Pillow Decorated with Wool Stitchery. 
A Tied and Dyed Pillow Decorated with Wool Stitchery 
In the “tie and dye” method of designing, there are ways in which a unit 
may be evenly distributed over a surface. Fig. 1 illustrates a pattern of 
this kind. The pillow cover here shown was dyed a fine orange color, 
with a few long stitches of black Germantown yarn sewed in the center 
of each small square. This was added after the dyeing was dry, before 
the cover was sewed on the pillow. As a finishing touch, a ball of black 
yarn and one of white were sewed at each corner of the pillow (Fig. 1). 
These balls were made according to the directions given on page 117. 
The method of distributing the unit over the square is shown in 
Figs. 2 to 6. 
Fig. 2 shows the square of unbleached muslin, which has been folded 
and creased into sixteen small squares. A four-inch square of paper, with 
a one-inch opening in the center was then cut for a pattern. This was

placed first at the exact center of the square and its position indicated by 
dots placed on the muslin at each corner. The pattern was then removed 
and placed four more times, at the intersection of folds, as shown in 
Fig. 4. A half-square was indicated in the middle of each side of the 
cover and a quarter-square at each corner. A running stitch of cotton 
thread was then sewed around each of these suggested units, as shown in 
Fig. 5. Ends of thread should be left, so that these stitches may each 
be drawn up and tightly tied. A single band should then be wound, begin- 
ning with the sewing and winding toward the center of each shape, until 
a width of about an inch is attained. This winding may be done with 
rubber bands or with cotton cord, as in the previous pillow design. Fig. 6 
shows the tying completed, and the cover ready to be soaked in cold water 
and dyed. Fig. 7 shows the design after it has been dipped, rinsed, par- 
tially dried, untied and shaken out.

    Fic. 7, The Square Dyed and Untied. 
A circular, oval, or diamond shaped unit could have been used in the 
same way, the unit depending upon the shape of the paper pattern employed. 
It is better not to press these articles entirely dry with an iron, but to 
shake them until they are dry. The slightly wrinkled effect that results 
from this treatment is rather desirable than otherwise. 
Instead of the balls used to finish the corners of the pillow a large 
cord may be knitted with the fingers, using double strands of black 
Germantown wool. This cord may be sewed on the pillow over the seam 
where the back and front covers join. 
Another method of finishing is in the use of blanket-stitching with 
black Germantown, applied over the seams. 
These finishing touches of contrasting wools add greatly to the appear- 
of tied-and-dyed design.

  Fic. 1. A Tied and Dyed Table Runner Made of Cotton Crépe. 
A Tied and Dyed Table Runner Made of Cotton Crépe 
A yard of white cotton crépe will make a table runner of good propor- 
tions, although the design shown in Fig. 1 may be adapted to fit any table 
or dresser for which a cover is desired. The runner illustrated was dyed 
a fine orange color, with all edges turned and finished with a running 
stitch of ivory tinted mercerized knitting cotton. Small balls of the cotton 
in ivory and black were used at each corner. These balls were each 
attached to a cord upon which a dark blue bead was strung. Common 
wooden beads such as are used in kindergartens may be painted with 
opaque water colors, varnished, and used for this purpose. The hemming 
and all other finishing touches are applied after the article is tied and dyed.

  Fic. 2. Cotton Crépe Laid Fic. 3.. The Pleating Fic. 4. Pleats Tied 
in Pleats 114” Wide. Complete. and Ready for Dyeing. 
The process of tying is very simple. Each end of the runner is laid in 
pleats about an inch and a quarter wide, much as a child would lay tucks 
or pleats in paper, in making a fan. Fig. 2 shows the process. These 
pleats must be evenly laid, as shown in Fig. 3. 
The tying of the band determines the position of the border on the 
runner. Therefore, the distance between the end of the runner and the 
beginning of the border must be determined before the tying begins. The 
width of the border must also be decided upon. Fig. 4 shows the winding 
or tying completed. The little spaces or interstices left between the 
windings of cord or rubber bands will permit the dye to enter the field 
of the border, resulting in the attractive stencil-like effect, shown in Fig. 1. 
When both ends of the runner are tied as shown in Fig. 4, soak the whole 
thing in water until you are sure that the folded portions outside the tied 
bands are wet. Then wring out the water and drop the runner in the dye. 
Leave as long as the printed instructions direct, then remove the goods, 
rinse in cold water, wring out, and hang out until partially dry. Remove 
the tie strings and shake the runner until dry.

Fic. 1. Table Runner Tied and Dyed in Wave Design.   A Table Runner Tied and Dyed in a Wave Design 
Another interesting design for the decoration of a table runner is shown 
in Fig. 1. Unbleached muslin was used in this model, and the dye was a 
fine, strong blue. When the dyeing was accomplished, the sides and ends 
were turned in a broad hem, about three-fourths of an inchin width. This 
hem was held in place with blanket stitching in black Germantown wool. 
Tassels of this wool, attached to cords upon which decorative beads were 
strung, were sewed in place at each corner of the runner.

upon a table. The distance between the edge of the goods and the begin- 
ning of the border was first determined, as was also the desired height of 
the wave. Two horizontal lines were then ruled, using a sharpened piece 
of charcoal to mark the lines. The wave-like curve was then drawn with 
charcoal, between the horizontal lines (Fig. 2). This wave line was then 
sewed with running stitches, and all the marks of charcoal were rubbed 
from the cloth (Fig. 3). The thread expressing the wave line was then 
drawn straight and securely tied, to prevent slipping. The folds of muslin 
were adjusted evenly, and the first tying was wound around the cloth, 
beginning at the sewed wave line and winding above it (Fig. 5). A space 
was then left, and with no more sewing, a second and narrower band was 
wound and tied (Fig. 6). The other end of the runner was treated in 
the same way. The whole runner was then soaked in cold water until all 
folds near the tied bands were thoroughly saturated. Then it was wrung 
out and placed in the dye. The rinsing, drying and untying processes were 
duly performed, resulting in the design shown in Fig. 1.

A Tied and Dyed Blouse of Unbleached Muslin, with Wool Sutchery 
No more charming use can be made of tied and dyed design than to 
apply it in the making of a blouse, such as is illustrated in Fig. 1. They 
are suitable for girls of grammar school or high school age, or indeed for 
figures of any age, to which the kimona style of waist is becoming. 
Fig. 1 shows a blouse made of unbleached muslin. Cotton crépe, cot- 
ton Georgette or silk may be used with equal success. Any color desired a 
may be selected for the dye. The wools used in the stitchery which is 
employed to enrich the design must harmonize with the color used in dyeing.

Fic. 2. Draft of Pattern for Blouse. 
The blouse illustrated was dyed a salmon pink, with stitchery in light 
green and dark blue-green Germantown wools. All hems were secured 
by a double row of running stitches in these two colors. The sleeves 
were lengthened by the addition of cuffs, stitched on with a sewing machine 
before the blouse was tied and dyed. A loose belt or girdle may be worn 
with the blouse if desired. This should be made of the same material and 
dyed in the same bath with the blouse. Fig. 2 shows the method of drafting 
the pattern for the blouse. It also shows the pattern for the cuff. Two 
yards of goods thirty-six inches wide will be required. Lay off all meas- 
urements accurately on a large sheet of paper and draw the necessary 
lines, as indicated in Fig. 2. Then lay the pattern on the cloth, which 
has been folded in the middle, and cut out the blouse. The neck opening 
should be shaped to suit the wearer, after the blouse is slipped on, through 
an opening cut in the middle of the top. The side seams may also be 
shaped to fit the wearer. They are then sewed together on a machine.

  Fic. 3. Blouse Tied Ready for Dyeing 
Three spots are tied on the blouse illustrated, one just below the neck 
opening in front, and one on each shoulder. There are two spots tied on 
each cuff. These spots may be tied by the use of a marble, as described 
on p. 135, or by making use of a paper pattern, as shown on p. 137. Fig. 3 
shows the bands of cord or rubbers, which are wound to any desired 
width. Remember that it is highly desirable to secure the interesting 
“accidents” of color, that creep between the windings, so that the spot 
may not be an unbroken circle or square of white. 
After the blouse is tied, soak it in water, and then place it in the dye, 
which has been prepared according to printed directions on the envelope. 
When the blouse is rinsed, partially dried, untied and shaken until 
thoroughly dry, the stitchery may be applied. The interesting line from 
the shoulders to the middle of the front (shown in Fig. 1) is first sketched 
in charcoal, then outlined with a double row of running stitches. 
There are many ways in which these blouses may be varied, in the 
application of tied and dyed design. A broad or a narrow band may be 
146
-P-A-G-E-149
  tied around the bottom, as in the table runner on p. 140. A band may be 
tied around the neck, or a variety of different shapes may be sewed by 
the use of paper patterns and tied. When the worker has mastered the 
simple technique of the process, she will begin to invent and devise shapes 
and decorations of her own. This is true designing. 
Tied and Dyed design is particularly attractive when applied to the 
decoration of children’s dresses. The simplest patterns of garments lend 
themselves best to this form of decoration. The little dress should be 
made of cotton crépe or unbleached muslin and all seams should be sewed 
before the dyeing takes place. Hems may be secured with running 
stitches of Germantown yarn. The designs should be confined to one 
large unit well placed on the front as in the case of the blouse just described 
with a unit on each sleeve and possibly a band across the bossom or a 
circle of small spots may be tied to outline the neck. This will give a 
suggestion of a necklace of daisies or small flowers, particularly if yellow 
centers are added with stitches of Germantown wool. The color of these 
little dresses should be tints rather than strong colors. The Diamond 
dye, Turkey red, if properly diluted gives a charming pink. Light blue 
may be obtained by diluting the strong blue dye.

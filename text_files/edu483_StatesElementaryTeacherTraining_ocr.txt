  CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
1. AIM OF STUDY 
The present study has attempted to make a fairly compre- 
hensive investigation of Kentucky’s elementary teacher- 
training problem. The purpose of the study has been to 
determine to what extent Kentucky has accepted its respon- 
sibility for the training of elementary teachers; to analyze 
the present status of elementary teachers; to ascertain the 
state’s need for trained elementary teachers, and the facili- 
ties for preparing them; and to estimate the cost of employ- 
ing professionally trained teachers for the elementary 
schools of the state. 
Briefly, the study undertakes primarily to answer the fol- - 
lowing questions: 
1. What has been the history of teacher-training in Ken- 
tucky? 
2. What is the present status of elementary teachers in 
Kentucky? 
3. What is Kentucky’s need for professionally trained 
elementary teachers, and what facilities does the state have 
for preparing them? 
4. What will it cost Kentucky to employ professionally 
trained teachers for the elementary schools? 
In answering these major questions, many minor ques- 
tions have been answered incidentally. 
In addition to the conclusions, it is hoped the methods 
used in this study may prove of value to those interested in 
making a similar study for other states. 
2. SOURCES OF THE DATA 
Chapter II is based on documentary evidence. The origi- 
nal biennial reports of the Superintendents of Public Instruc- 
tion, the Kentucky statutes, catalogs and reports from the 
normal schools, and histories of education have been the 
chief sources of material for this chapter. 
For Chapter III data were obtained from a questionnaire 
sent to the teachers of the state by the Legislative Commit- 
tee of the Kentucky Educational Association. (See Appen- 
dix, p. 93.) This committee invited the General Education 
Board of New York City to draft for Kentucky a scientific 
certification law. The invitation was accepted. Dr. Frank
-P-A-G-E-8
8 A State’s Elementary 
P. Bachman and a staff of assistants came to the state, and 
made a survey of the training of the present teaching force. 
Several thousand dollars were spent in assembling these 
data. The certification bill was drawn, but never intro- 
duced in the General Assembly. Through the courtesy of 
Mr. J. Virgil Chapman, chairman of the Legislative Com- 
mittee of the Kentucky Educational Association, and Dr. 
Frank P. Bachman, of the General Education Board, all of 
that material was made available for this study. 
The intelligence measurements of student-teachers were 
made at the Eastern Kentucky State Normal School and 
Teachers College in 1921, 1922, and 1923. 
Chapters IV and V use the same sources for much of 
their material. The officers of the State Department of 
Education, and the presidents and deans of the teacher- 
training institutions have supplied an abundance of data 
from the official educational records of their offices. 
3. METHOD EMPLOYED 
Both discursive and statistical treatment of data have 
been employed in this study. The investigation, however, 
is very largely a quantitative study. All the tables are so 
arranged as to give information relative to the several ,ad- 
ministrative school units as well as the state at large. By 
this method of statistical presentation, the facts have been 
made so clear that only a brief discussion has been consid- 
ered necessary to bring out what the data mean. It is be- 
lieved the information presented in the tables is exceedingly 
important, and that they can be read almost as easily and 
as rapidly as the text. Only simple statistical treatment 
has been found necessary for an interpretation of the data 
involved in this study. 
An explanation of the following terms may serve to as- 
sist the reader: 
The median (mid-point) is that point on the scale which 
divides the frequency distribution equally. One-half of the 
cases fall below and the other half above this point. 
The 25 percentile (Q,) is that point on the scale below 
which one-fourth of the cases of the distribution falls, and 
above which three-fourths fall. 
The 75 percentile (Q,) is that point on the scale below 
which three-fourths of the cases of the distribution fall, and 
above which one-fourth falls. 
The quartile deviation (Q) is one-half of the distance 
between the first and the third quartile. It is a measure of 
variation frequently used, since from Q it is a simple matter
-P-A-G-E-9
Teacher-Training Problem a 
to determine the distance upon the scale which will include 
the middle fifty per cent of the cases in the distribution. 
The concentration of the measures about the median is easy 
to obtain by the use of this measure of variation. 
4. SCOPE 
This study has been limited to a consideration of the ele- 
mentary teacher-training problem. No account has been 
taken of the high-school teacher-training question. A simi- 
lar study of high-school teachers would offer an interesting 
and profitable problem for further research.

CHAPTER II 
THE HISTORY OF TEACHER-TRAINING IN 
KENTUCKY © 
INTRODUCTION 
The early settlers of Kentucky were sturdy pathfinders 
of the nation. These rugged pioneers dared the dangers and 
hardships of a long journey over the mountains to find a 
new home and to carve out of the wilderness a new state. 
As one contemplates the history of these early days, he can- 
not but be thrilled by the many dramatic incidents in the 
daily life of these people. There is in their lives both ro- 
mance and adventure as gripping as that found in a story- 
book. They brought with them the social customs, atti- 
tudes, and institutions of their forbears back in Virginia 
and North Carolina. They had no other pattern by which 
to be guided, and quite naturally they repeated the history 
of the mother state to a very large degree. In matters of 
education, their views were not unlike those of their fathers 
and their fathers’ fathers. To them education was a mat- 
ter of private concern, because it had always been so con- 
sidered in their homeland. That they were interested in 
providing the rudiments of education for their children, 
ample evidence is to be found in their early efforts to provide 
private schools. Harrodsburg, the first settlement in Ken- 
tucky, was founded in 1774, and Boonesboro, the next set- 
tlement, in 1775. As soon as rude cabins had been con- 
structed for shelter and stockades for defense, private 
schools were opened for the purpose of teaching the chil- 
dren in these settlements to read and to write.. The first 
school to be taught on Kentucky soil was opened at Harrods- 
burg in 1776 by Mrs. William Coomes.'. From the same 
source we find that a school was opened at Boonesboro in 
1779 by Joseph Doniphan, and that an average of seventeen 
pupils attended during the summer. These feeble efforts 
are the evidence of an early educational interest in Ken- 
tucky. Wherever a new settlement of any proportion was 
started, soon thereafter a crude, private, frontier school 
came into existence. Most of these schools were short- 
lived and sporadic in character. As feeble and ineffectual 
as these efforts were, nevertheless, in those days when life 
was a struggle for existence against all the forces of nature 
and roving bands of Indians, they must have meant consid-   
‘Collins: History of Kentucky, Vol. 1, p. 486.
-P-A-G-E-11
  Teacher-Training Problem 11 
erable sacrifice and privation on the part of the parents who 
supported them. What better evidence do we need of the 
faith of these early settlers in education than their attempts 
to establish schools? 
That they failed in their efforts to educate the youth, no 
argument is necessary to any one who takes the time and 
makes the effort to study the schools of that early day. 
Their system of school administration has always failed to 
provide adequate education for all the children. 
Kentucky was admitted to the Union in 1792. The first 
constitution did not recognize education ‘as a state function; 
it made no mention of the schools. But in 1798 the Gen- 
eral Assembly passed an act? endowing “certain seminaries 
of learning” with 6,000 acres of vacant land for the estab- 
lishment and support of a county academy. This is the 
first time that the state recognized that it had an obligation 
in providing education for the youth. Public education, 
however, had but few friends. Such an institution was 
contrary to the customs and traditions of the early settlers. 
It took the champions of the common school nearly fifty 
years to overcome the inertia of the indifferent and the 
philosophy of the conservative. Slowly, but surely, through 
the process of a long evolution and the rising of a new gen- 
eration, public education gained friends; but the history of 
this interesting period is not the theme of this study. 
CHARACTER OF EARLY TEACHERS AND SCHOOLS 
Very little is known of the training and qualifications of 
these early teachers. There is no documentary evidence 
available as to the character and preparation of any consid- 
erable number of them. No standards of preparation of a 
tangible character were required. Each family, or group 
of families, who employed a tutor for their children deter- 
mined what the qualification of the teacher should be. There 
is evidence which would lead one to infer that some few of 
them were well educated, but the overwhelming majority 
were men and women of meager learning, who could teach a 
little reading and writing and ciphering as far as the rule 
of three, and that very crudely. Lewis’ gives us possibly 
the best description of the early schoolmasters and their 
schools. He says: 
“Some of the teachers of these schools, as Doniphan, were 
men of high standing, often following for a great part of 
their time the calling of a surveyor, then an honorable and 
lucrative one; but most of them were not, the character of

the teacher and the methods he used being often almost as 
primitive as the house he occupied. He was usually some 
elderly man of that or an adjoining neighborhood, who was 
supposed to have some education, but whose main qualifica- 
tion for the position was more often that he did not know 
how, or did not care, or have the energy to do anything else 
he had undertaken; or he was some stranger, a traveling 
Irishman or Englishman, or a wandering Yankee, whose 
qualifications for the place were presumed from the fact 
that he had seen a good deal of the world. 
“These men could not have made teaching a profession, 
as their wages were very low. However, they were re- 
quired to take up early and turn out late, giving short 
recesses and noon intermissions, the idea being that they 
must earn their money. They were otherwise under prac- 
tically no supervision, except such as the pupils chose to 
put upon them, and taught according to their own peculiar 
theories, temperaments, and habits. They were often as 
rough and passionate as they well could be, and liberal in 
their use of the rod, even knocking down impertinent pu- 
pils; while, on the other hand, some of them allowed their 
scholars to do as they pleased. All, as a general thing, had 
written rules, which were frequently read and usually vig- 
orously enforced, the pupils often dreading the frown and 
birch of the master more than the screams of the wild ani- 
mals they sometimes heard on their way to and from the 
lonely schoolhouse.” 
STRUGGLE FOR STATE SUPPORT FOR TEACHER 
TRAINING 
It is a striking coincident thatthe very year (1838) Ken- 
tucky was establishing, by legislative enactment, a public- 
school system, Massachusetts was also enacting a law cre- 
ating the first state normal school in America. Had teacher- 
training institutions been established in Kentucky simulta- 
neously with the enactment of this law, creating a state 
school system, doubtless the history of education in Ken- 
tucky would be a different story. 
There is ample evidence that the legislators who enacted 
the law establishing a system of common schools recognized 
the fact that teachers should possess certain definite quali- 
fications for their work, for they wrote into that law “that 
no teacher shall be deemed a qualified teacher within the 
meaning of this act who shall not have received, and shall 
not hold, a certificate of qualification from a commissioner 
and the trustees of the common schools in the district in  
-P-A-G-E-13
  Teacher-Training Problem 13 
which he proposes to teach.”! , They also by resolution 
called upon the Superintendent of Public Instruction to re- 
port to the next General Assembly “upon the expediency of 
organizing a profession of teachers, analogous to the other 
learned professions.” 
The first Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Rev. 
Joseph J. Bullock (1838-39), in his initial report to the 
General Assembly, asked for “the founding of one or more 
normal schools for the purpose of training the sons of the 
soil for teaching. . . . The establishment of a school 
or schools for teachers is certainly a great desideratum. 
It is the voice of reason and experience that they must exist 
before education-can be performed in the best possible man- 
ner and with the greatest attainable success. In those coun- 
tries where education has been carried to the greatest per- 
fection, schools for teachers have formed an important 
feature in their systems, and with the best results.” 
The voice of the first superintendent went unheeded; his 
plea fell upon deaf ears. The legislature made no move in 
the direction of establishing training schools for teachers. 
But the first Superintendent of Public Instruction was no . 
more unsuccessful on this issue than the long line of his 
distinguished successors was destined to be. Sixty-eight 
years came and passed before a legislature heeded the sane 
advice of these educators. Fifteen different superintend- 
ents appeared before more than thirty sessions of the Gen- 
eral Assembly in behalf of teacher-training, soliciting, coun- 
seling, persuading the members to provide normal schools, 
before these institutions were permanently established. 
Their recommendations were frequently supplemented by 
recommendations from the Governor in behalf of the cause 
of teacher-training. But an indifferent or hostile General 
Assembly always either ignored the recommendations or 
voted them down when they were presented in the form of 
legislation. 
The most desperate struggle in the history of school leg- 
islation in Kentucky was the fight to create state-supported 
institutions for the training of teachers. The state was 
forty-six years (1792-1838) in being persuaded that it was 
its function to educate the children, but it took one hun- 
dred and fourteen years (1792-1906) to convince the people 
that it was the function of the state'to train the teachers. 
Excerpts from the biennial reports of the State Superin- 
tendents illustrate their interest and faith in state-sup- 
ported institutions for the training of teachers. 
The second superintendent, Rev. Hubbard H. Kavanaugh 
+An Act to Establish the Common Schools in the State of Kentucky (1838).
-P-A-G-E-14
14 A State’s Elementary 
(1839-40), discussed at length the need of training schools 
for teachers. The following brief extract will suffice to 
show the trend of his argument :® “In the judgment of those 
perhaps the best qualified to decide upon the claims of our 
system, it is regarded as being materially defective only in 
one point. As one has expressed it, it is a body without a 
head, a stream without a fountain. It needs a school of 
superior grade exclusively devoted to the instruction of 
teachers.” 
The Right Reverend Benjamin Bosworth Smith (1840- 
42) requested the legislature to establish four normal schools, 
two male and two female schools.* 
Superintendent Ryland T. Dillard (1843-47) made the fol- 
lowing recommendation :? ‘The superintendent would, there- 
fore, most respectfully call the attention of the present leg-. 
islature to the propriety of establishing at least two normal 
schools—the one on the north, the other on the south of the 
Kentucky River. Thus the state will have the benefit of 
such teachers as may go forth from these nurseries of knowl- 
edge. And, furthermore, it will have a tendency to make 
the great body of teachers prepare themselves better to dis- 
charge the duties of the office. Thus, by degrees, we may 
hope to arrive at a system in the art of teaching without 
which it is vain to suppose that general proficiency will ever 
be attained to.” 
In 1847-53 we find the brilliant Rev. Robert J. Breckin- 
ridge, the Horace Mann of Kentucky, in the office of Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction. It was he who first gave 
the schools vitality. Through his influence and courageous 
fight in opposition to the Governor, he led the Constitutional 
Convention to write into the new constitution (1850) arti- 
cle eleven, in which the status of the school fund is fixed in 
the organic law of the state. 
He, too, like his predecessors, urged the establishing of 
normal schools... “What I propose,” he said, “is to appro- 
priate, say, $120,000 a year to the support of district schools. 
The remaining $8,000 I would appropriate to the teaching of 
those who are themselves to teach the district schools. Now, 
it is clear that the main question involved as a common- 
school question is just this: Which of the two plans, the one 
in use (without normal schools) or the one here proposed 
(with normal schools), is really best for the common schools 
themselves—whether it is better to divide $8,000 among 200,- 
000 children, and thus give four cents more to each child and

let them have inferior and, to a great extent, foreign teach- 
ers, or employ $8,000 in providing these children with 
_ superior teachers, reared and educated among ourselves? 
Shall we give $128,000 for a very defective education, or 
$120,000 for a good education and the other $8,000 to create 
a constant and sufficient supply of good teachers? Either , 
way the whole sum goes for common schools. The princi- 
ple involved lies in these statements. According to my 
judgment, it is a principle about the adoption of which there 
ought to be no doubt.” 
While Superintendent Breckinridge’s administration is 
commonly accepted as a brilliant success, nevertheless, on 
this issue of teacher training he failed. 
The Rev. John Mathews (1853-59) succeeded Superin- 
tendent Breckinridge. He also strongly recommended the 
creation of normal schools. During his administration a 
thing happened which brought temporary success in this 
direction. Transylvania University, at Lexington, Ky., had 
met with financial reverses. The trustees proposed to Su- 
perintendent Mathews that they would turn the property 
over to the state if it would open a normal school. This 
property was valued at about $100,000, located in the heart 
of the blue-grass region. It consisted of a ten-acre campus, 
on which were located Morrison Hall, a beautiful building 
which cost $40,000, and dormitories ready for occupancy. 
A splendid faculty was available for the purpose of con- 
ducting such a school. The proposal was a generous one. 
Superintendent Mathews transmitted this offer of the trus- 
tees of Transylvania to the General Assembly (1856), to- 
gether with a strong recommendation that the proposal be 
accepted. The legislature accordingly passed, after consid- 
erable opposition, “an act to reorganize Transylvania Uni- 
versity and to establish a school for teachers,” and appro- 
priated $12,000 out of the common-school fund for the 
salaries of teachers of the normal school.® 
The friends of education over the state were elated. It 
appeared that at last the state could soon have better- 
prepared teachers for the district schools. The school was 
opened in September, 1856, with eighty pupils. Superinten- 
dent Mathews said of it a short time later :1° “No school of 
similar character in this country ever commenced with that 
number of pupils or under such favorable auspices and 
with a full corps of instructors. The Normal School of 
Kentucky opened its career with vigor. The day of its birth 
was the day of its manhood. Six months’ instruction have

borne testimony to the cheering and gratifying success of 
the institution. One hundred and nineteen pupils have been 
returned to this office by commissioners from ninety coun-" 
_ ties. Some have declined their appointments, and a few, in 
view of pecuniary difficulties and personal perplexities, 
during the first. week of the session, left the school, but they 
had not tested its advantages nor become acquainted with 
the faculty of the school. Others were promptly appointed 
and occupied their places. Better selections of more de- 
serving young men could not have been made; and the opin- 
ion is expressed, without fear of contradiction, that a col- 
lection of students cannot be found in any institution of 
more studious habits, purer morals, and general good deport- 
ment. The state has every reason to be proud of her school 
for teachers, and to cherish it as the apple of her eye.” 
There can be little doubt that the school was a success 
from the very start. It promised to fulfill the dreams of the 
six Superintendents of Public Instruction who had served 
the state since the establishment of a system of common 
schools. But scarcely was the school launched upon its task 
before the next General Assembly (1858), with wanton 
recklessness, ‘demolished their school for teachers” by re- 
pealing the pfevious act. This was done over the protest 
of the friends of education and the Superintendent of Public 
Instruction, who said: “It has given a retrograde movement 
to state education which cannot be retracted for at least a 
quarter of a century.” The result was even more serious 
than he predicted. It was nearly fifty years before another 
General Assembly was to enact a law providing for the es- 
tablishment of teacher-training institutions. 
Superintendent Robert Richardson succeeded Superin- 
tendent Mathews in 1859. ‘Teaching is a profession,” he 
said in his first report to the General Assembly, ‘and, like 
other professions, must be learned in schools of a higher 
grade. . . . In deep conviction that schools for teachers 
are necessary, I recommend them. Their establishment 
ought not to interfere with the funds or practical working 
of the present district system. But established they must 
be. We should provide Kentucky teachers for Kentucky 
youths, to guard against that degeneracy and decline which 
will always threaten us without them.’ 
This recommendation, like others which had: been made 
before it, went unnoticed by the solons of the state. One 
superintendent after another brought this important issue 
to the attention of the legislators in vigorous fashion, but 
their efforts all resulted in failure. The public conscious-   
“Biennial Report of Superintendent of Public Instruction (1860).
-P-A-G-E-17
  Teacher-Training Problem 17 
ness had not been aroused on this question. The people ap- 
peared indifferent as to what type of teacher they employed. 
The more prosperous sent their children to private schools, 
where the teachers were usually better prepared, many of 
them coming from the East. The private schools felt that 
they held certain “vested interests” in education, and they 
fought bitterly any movement looking toward an improve- 
ment of the public schools. The influential friends of pub- 
lic education were so few that they could not make much 
headway against such entrenched odds.* 
Howard A. M. Henderson, a very able and scholarly man, 
was elected Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1871, 
and served for eight years. Under his administration the 
schools made tremendous progress. The aggressive leader- 
ship which he displayed in behalf of public education gave 
the schools more vitality than they had ever known. He, 
too, recommended to the General Assembly that normal 
schools be established, but even this active and forceful 
educational statesman failed to jar the legislators out of 
their complacency. But Superintendent Henderson was too 
ingenious to be daunted by their indifference. He secured 
the codperation of the Kentucky Military Institute, which 
proffered the use of its excellent plant for three months 
each summer. The services of Professors, R. D. Allen, W. H. 
Bartholamew, and S. P. Browder, distinguished educators 
of that day, were secured as teachers. He then proposed 
to the General Assembly “an act to establish a normal 
school,’’!2 and caused it to be passed. This experiment was 
to be carried on during the summers of 1878 and 1879, with- 
out cost to the state. The purpose of this experiment was to 
demonstrate the value and desirability of the state’s creating 
teacher-training institutions. The venture was a success 
as far as the school was concerned, but it failed to convince 
the lawmakers of the state that it would be a desirable thing 
for the state to establish normal schools. 
THE COLLEGE OF EDUCATION SLOWLY EVOLVES 
The Normal School Department of the Agricultural and 
Mechanical College, Lexington, Ky., was authorized in 1880 
by the General Assembly. Free tuition was granted to one 
student from each representative district. The atmosphere 
of this institution was not conducive to develop trained 
teachers. Those who were responsible for the administra-

tion of the college were not sympathetic with teacher-train- 
ing. The professors of this department were not held in 
high academic esteem by their colleagues; and, likewise, the 
students of the Normal Department were, in the common 
estimate, ranked lower than those of the other colleges. 
Laboring under such handicaps, the school never attained 
the influence that it would have under more auspicious cir- 
cumstances. It failed to reach any considerable number of 
teachers. Nevertheless, the faithful teachers in this Normal 
Department did all any group of men could do under the 
circumstances, and they exercised a marvelous influence 
over the few who came to them for instruction. Had the 
Normal Department been more favorably located, there is 
little doubt that it would have greatly influenced education 
in the state at this time. As it was, most of its energy was 
expended attempting to establish its rights in an indifferent, 
if not hostile, environment. This objective was finally ac- 
complished, for in 1907 the Normal Department was dis- 
continued, and a Department of Education of the College of 
Arts and Science of the university, with collegiate rank, 
was established. : 
A building was erected at once to house the new Depart- 
ment of Education. Professor J. T. C. Noe was appointed 
head of the department. Our Commissioner of Education, 
J. J. Tigert, also was a member of the faculty until his ap- 
pointment as chief of the Bureau of Education. 
Many students enrolled for work in education, and the 
department soon became one of the most popular in the uni- 
versity. Its energies were directed toward the prepara- 
tion of high-school teachers and administrators. It has 
prepared a very large number of the secondary teachers who 
are to-day teaching in the schools of the state. 
While the work of the Department of Education of the 
College of Arts and Science was a success, nevertheless, as 
long as it was a department of one of the colleges of the 
university, its influence and opportunities for aggressive 
leadership were somewhat limited. The Survey Commis- 
sion in 1920 pointed out the need for a College of Education 
at the university. This recommendation was accepted by 
President McVey and the trustees of the university, and in 
September, 1923, the College of Education was opened, 
with Dean W. S. Taylor in charge. It now has its own 
budget of $57,252 annually, a faculty of nine professors 
and instructors, and a practice school for secondary teach- 
ers. In the short period it has been in existence, it has dem- 
onstrated its ability to enlist the codperation of the super- 
intendents and teachers of the state. Large numbers of
-P-A-G-E-19

students have enrolled, many of them for graduate work. 
It promises to be one of the most dynamic forces in the 
promotion of education in the state. 
This brief résumé of the slow evolution of the teacher- 
training movement in the University of Kentucky is an in- 
dex to the desperate struggle and vicissitudes of the entire 
teacher-training development in the state. Every step to- 
ward progress was made only after heroic effort had been 
put forth. The forty-three years which intervened between 
the creation of the Normal Department of the Agricultural 
and Mechanical College and the establishing of a College of 
Education of the university should serve to demonstrate how 
slowly public opinion crystallized on this important issue. 
KENTUCKY NORMAL AND INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE FOR 
COLORED TEACHERS 
A common-school system for colored children was cre- 
ated by the General Assembly of 1873. Superintendent 
Henderson called a convention of the colored teachers of the 
state at Frankfort (1877) for the purpose of organizing a 
Colored Teachers’ State Association. This association be- 
gan agitating the cause of teacher-training for colored teach- 
ers, and in a few years it succeeded in realizing its objec- 
tive. In 1886 an act was passed by the General Assembly 
establishing “State Normal Schools for Colored Persons.” 
An appropriation of $7,000 for the erection of a building 
and $3,000 annually for the payment of teachers was al- 
lowed. Since that date the state has been more generous 
in its appropriation for buildings and equipment as well as 
in its annual appropriation for maintenance. 
This institution has done a splendid work for the colored 
people of the state in spite of the fact that it has frequently 
been the football of politics. Table I shows something of its 
growth during the past score of years. . 
The apparent ease with which the colored people were 
able to convince the legislature of the necessity of profes- 
sional training for their teachers, when compared with the 
long struggle to obtain normal schools for white teachers, is 
significant. It possibly indicates more forcefully than any 
other argument could that the private schools and their 
so-called “vested interests” in education retarded the estab- 
lishment of normal schools in Kentucky for many years.

WHERE WERE THE TEACHERS TRAINED BEFORE THE 
STATE ACCEPTED THIS RESPONSIBILITY? 
In the interim between the establishing of a state school 
system (1838) and the creation of the state normal schools 
(1906), the training of the public-school teachers was left 
to private agencies. The qualifications for teaching were 
low, and many thousands of teachers who “kept school’ in 
these years possessed no professional training whatsoever, 
and only meager academic education gained by a few years 
spent in crude, onesroom country schools. This was the 
only Alma Mater the majority of the teachers ever knew. 
After spending several years in such schools, the more am- 
bitious, and for the most part the best, pupils journeyed to 
the courthouse and “tried” the county examination for a 
teacher’s certificate. These examinations were held under 
the directions of a popularly elected county superintendent, 
who was oftentimes quite sensitive to the will of the electo- 
rate. If the applicant made any semblance of an effort, he 
was awarded a certificate of the first, second, or third class, 
which permitted him to teach any school in the county, if 
he could secure the appointment from the district trustees. 
But this source of supply did not fill the demand for teach-
-P-A-G-E-21
  Teacher-Training Problem a 
ers. Many teachers came into Kentucky from the border- 
line states on the north—in fact, quite a few came from far- 
away New England. The most famous, perhaps, of this 
group of teachers was the brilliant Harriet Beecher, after- 
wards Mrs. Stowe, the novelist, who wrote “Uncle Tom’s 
Cabin.” Not all these itinerant teachers possessed the ge- 
nius of this representative of the celebrated Beecher family. 
Many of them were poorly educated and wholly incompe- 
tent to teach. They were, for the most part, the “left- 
overs” of the other states where the supply of teachers 
exceeded the demand. There were exceptions to this, how- 
ever; and occasionally a capable, well-educated young man 
or woman came south for the adventure and taught a good 
school. 
While the great majority of the teachers of the state were 
poorly trained, however, there was a small minority who 
were well qualified for their work. These depended for 
their training on the colleges, academies, and particularly 
on private normal schools, which sprang up in different 
parts of the state. Sixteen private normal schools!? were 
active in 1880, when the first gesture was made by the state 
to train its teachers. 
Many of the teachers of this period were capable, ener- 
getic young men, who were ambitious to secure an educa- 
tion, but who had no idea of following teaching as a pro- 
fession. Teaching offered the best opportunity to earn a 
little money for the purpose of carrying on their education 
and for a preparation for the other professions. In a town 
of about 5,000 population in Eastern Kentucky a study of 
the early careers of the prominent citizens revealed that 
every lawyer, doctor, preacher, banker, and the majority 
of the most successful merchants had taught school at one 
time or another. These men, for the most part, were suc- 
cessful in their present vocations, and they would have 
probably been able teachers had the economic returns been 
sufficiently inviting to have induced them to continue in the 
profession. ; 
“There is a general complaint that teachers are transient 
persons,” said Superintendent Dillard'+ in 1844, “rarely re- 
maining longer than a year in one place. One short year 
is sufficiently long to expend the little stock of knowledge 
they may have acquired ; then another field of labor is sought. 
Many of these teachers make no effort to improve them- 
selves as such, for they make this a stepping-stone to some   
“Bachman: Public Education in Kentucky, p. 61. “Biennial Report of Superintendent of Public Instruction (1844).
-P-A-G-E-22

other calling, and as soon as they obtain the means they 
abandon it.” 
The poorly prepared teacher in Kentucky has always led 
a nomadic existence, teaching here and there for a few 
years, finally dropping out of the profession altogether. 
This has been the history of the unprepared teacher from 
the beginning of the public-school system down to the pres- 
ent. : 
STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED 
Twenty-seven years intervened from the time of Superin- 
tendent Henderson to the date of the establishment of the 
normal schools. During that period five Superintendents 
of Public Instruction administered the schools. They were: 
Superintendents Joseph Desha Pickett (1879-1887), Ed. 
Porter Thompson (1887-1895), W. J. Davidson (1895- 
1899), and H. V. McChesney (1899-1903). These men, 
like their predecessors, tried in vain to lead the General 
Assembly to take action in the direction of doing something 
for the preparation of teachers for the schools. This time 
was not altogether wasted. The friends of education were 
at work enlightening the public as to its responsibilities on 
this issue. The ablest educators of that period were writ- 
ing articles and addressing public audiences on this subject. 
The most potent and effective agency in behalf of this 
cause was the Kentucky Educational Association. The 
leaders of this association, at their meetings in Maysville 
(1904) and Mammoth Cave (1905), planned an educational 
campaign for the purpose of carrying to every locality of 
the state the need for professionally trained teachers. This 
campaign was successful. The people responded enthusi- 
astically. Many of the indifferent were changed to ener- 
getic advocates. Public education became a popular theme. 
The politicians began to get interested. The bill for cre- 
ating state normal schools was introduced first in the lower 
house of the General Assembly by Hon. R. H. Miller, of 
Madison County. It was passed in March, 1906, and was 
immediately signed by Governor Beckham. 
Many of the friends of public education had a part in cre- 
ating public sentiment in behalf of this measure. No his- 
tory of this movement would be complete if it did not men- 
tion the most ardent champions of the cause. Among those 
who led the fight, Dr. E. E. Hume, Messrs. H. H. Cherry, 
Ruric Neville Roark, M. O. Winfrey, E. H. Mark, and J. A. 
Sharon, and Superintendent of Public Instruction J. H. 
Fuqua, Sr., deserve to be mentioned.!®

The act'® provided for the “Eastern Kentucky State Nor- 
mal School, to be located in Normal School District No. 1, 
and the Western Kentucky Normal School, to be located in 
Normal School District No. 2.” It appropriated $40,000 
annually to be divided equally between the two schools for 
maintenance. It also gave each school $5,000 for equip- 
ment and improving grounds. 
The Governor appointed the following members of the 
commission to locate the new institutions: Messrs. George 
B. Edwards, Basil Richardson, E. H. Mark, and M. G. Wat- 
son. This commission met, organized, and issued invita- 
tions to eligible towns to bid for the location of the schools. 
After receiving a number of propositions, the commission 
visited various towns and surveyed conditions. On May 
7, 1906, the commission met in Louisville and selected Rich- 
mond and Bowling Green as the most favorable locations 
for the new schools. 
Richmond gave to the state for the home of the Eastern 
Normal School the buildings and campus of the old Central 
University. Bowling Green gave the buildings and campus 
of the Southern Normal School, a private institution with 
an attendance of 500 students. These gifts to the state 
enabled the schools to open their doors at once. 
EASTERN KENTUCKY STATE NORMAL SCHOOL AND 
TEACHERS COLLEGE 
Governor Beckham appointed on the Board of Regents, 
May 9, 1916, the following gentlemen: Hon. J. A. Sullivan. 
Richmond; Mr. P. W. Grinstead, Cold Springs; Hon. Fred 
A. Vaughn, Paintsville; and Judge J. W. Cammack, Owen- 
ton. Judge Sullivan and Judge Cammack have served the 
school since their first appointment. The institution has 
been fortunate in having only three changes on its Board of 
Regents in eighteen years of its existence. Senator H. M. 
Brock and Hon. Charles F. Weaver are the other members 
of the board at the present time. The Superintendent of 
Public Instruction, McHenry Rhodes, is an ea-officio mem- 
ber of the board. 
Dr. Ruric Neville Roark, one of the most distinguished edu- 
cators Kentucky ever produced, was elected president. He 
organized the school, which was opened in September, 1906, 
with about fifty students. President Roark and a small 
faculty taught those who came for instruction. President 
Roark’s work was cut short by his untimely death in April. 
1909. He had lived long enough, however, to give the school 
something of his spirit and ideals. 
Ibid., p. 191.

24 A State’s Elementary 
Mrs. Roark was appointed acting president, and she © 
served until the election of Superintendent J. G. Crabbe 
(1910), who was at that time Superintendent of Public In- 
struction. President Crabbe was a dynamic character, ex- 
ceedingly active and aggressive. He carried the school to 
the people and greatly increased its influence as well as its 
resources. New buildings began to appear on the campus, 
the faculty was increased, and the course of study extended. 
President Crabbe’s administration ended in 1916, when he 
accepted the presidency of the Colorado State Teachers Col- 
lege at Greeley. 
The Board of Regents unanimously appointed Professor 
T. J. Coates, State Supervisor of Schools, as president. In 
size and resources the school has developed rapidly since 
that date. Since President Coates’ administration began, 
six new buildings and a farm of 200 acres have been added 
to the plant, which is now valued at over a million dollars. 
By an act of the General Assembly (1922) the school has 
been made a teachers college. The first class to be granted 
degrees will be graduated in June, 1925. 
The course of study has passed through many changes. 
The first course was about the equivalent of a three-year 
high-school course, with some professional training added. 
Gradually it has been lengthened until at present the insti- 
tution is recognized as a standard teachers college, with 
re? in the American Association of Teachers Col- 
eges. 
The following statistical data tells something of the his- 
es of its rapid advancement in the brief period of its ex- 
istence:

WESTERN KENTUCKY STATE NORMAL SCHOOL AND 
TEACHERS COLLEGE 
The Western Kentucky State Normal School opened with 
a student body of about 500; in fact, the Southern Normal 
School, a private institution, became the new State Normal 
School, and the student body of this private institution was 
transferred to the new institution. 
While this school has not enjoyed a consecutive service from 
those who have served on its Board of Regents, it has had 
continuity in the administration of its president. Professor 
H. H. Cherry was appointed president in 1906, and he has 
served continuously in this capacity. President Cherry has 
been one of the most energetic and enthusiastic educators in 
Kentucky for the past score or more of years. The history 
of the school has been very much like that of its sister insti- 
tution established at the same time. The Western Normal 
School has always been larger than the Eastern Normal 
School. Both institutions have had the same course of 
study. The “Western Normal School and Teachers Col-
-P-A-G-E-26
  26 A State’s Elementary 
lege,” as it is now officially called, graduated a class of over 
sixty students the past year, granting the A.B. and B.S. 
degrees. This institution is a member of the American As- 
sociation of Teachers Colleges.

WEST KENTUCKY INDUSTRIAL COLLEGE (COLORED) 
This institution, which is located at Paducah, Ky., came 
under state control by an act of the General Assembly of 
1918. The function of the institution is to provide normal- 
school instruction for colored teachers from the western 
part of the state. During 1922-23 the enrollment was 102, 
of which only 18 were-enrolled in normal-school courses.!* 
The school has an annual appropriation of $15,000 for oper- 
ation. The report of the Kentucky Educational Commis- 
sion says:1§ “Although the West Kentucky Industrial Col- 
lege is to be counted among the state’s resources for the 
training of negro teachers, the Frankfort school is the only 
state institution even fairly well equipped to train teach-

ers.” The report recommended that this institution be 
abandoned. 
COUNTY SUMMER SCHOOLS FOR TEACHERS 
The General Assembly of 1922 appropriated $50,000 an- 
nually for county summer training schools for teachers. 
The law also authorizes the State Board of Education to 
establish training departments in high schools wherever 
such a department is practicable. 
The summer school for teachers is usually established in 
counties which apply for such aid. The county frequently 
pays half of the cost, though this is not required. So far 
no teacher-training departments in high schools have been 
authorized. In the summer of 1922 there were sixty-nine 
white summer schools, enrolling 3,756 teachers, and eight 
colored summer schools, enrolling 386 teachers.!® y 
MOREHEAD AND MURRAY STATE NORMAL SCHOOLS 
The two schools established in 1906 have done the pioneer 
work in teacher-training in Kentucky. They have demon- 
strated their worth to the public. They have not been able, 
however, to train a sufficient number of teachers for all the 
schools. But their popularity and service to the state have 
been of such a character that when the issue for more nor- 
mal schools for Kentucky was before the General Assembly 
in 1922, that legislative body, with very little opposition, 
voted to establish two new normal schools. An annual ap- 
propriation of $30,000 for the maintenance of each school 
was provided. One of these schools was located at More- 
head and the other at Murray. They were officially named 
the “Morehead State Normal School” and the “Murray 
State Normal School.” The General Assembly, at its next 
session (1924), increased the annual appropriation of the 
schools to $132.000. respectively, besides appropriating to 
each school $400,000 for buildings. These new teacher- 
training institutions are enjoying liberal support from their 
initial opening. The work of educating the public to the 
need of trained teachers has been so well done by the East- 
ern and Western Normal Schools that the creation and lib- 
eral support of the newer institutions came from the Gen- 
eral Assembly without a prolonged struggle. 
Professor F. C. Button was appointed president of the 
Morehead Normal School, and Dr. John W. Carr, president 
of the Murray Normal School.

STATE’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TRAINING OF 
TEACHERS ACCEPTED 
Kentucky has, after a struggle of more than a century, 
accepted in principle the state’s responsibility for the train- 
ing of the teachers for the public schools. No more con- 
vincing proof of this fact can be cited than to name the insti- 
tutions which Kentucy has provided for the training of 
teachers and to indicate the provisions which the state has 
made for the maintenance and capital outlay of each insti- 
tution for the school year 1924-25.

The magnitude of the task before these institutions de- 
mands that the state support them liberally if they are to 
fulfill their function. Later chapters of this study will 
reveal to some extent their prodigious problem. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
1. The early schools of Kentucky were private. They . 
came into existence simultaneously with the establishment 
of the settlements. The teachers of these schools, with few 
exceptions, were men and women of little education. They 
taught reading, writing, and ciphering as far as the rule of 
three. 
2. Common schools were establishd by legislative act in 
1838. The first Superintendent of Public Instruction rec- 
ommended to the General Assembly the creation of a school 
for teachers. Every one of his successors followed his ex- 
ample and worked ardently for state teacher-training insti- 
tutions. Sixty-eight years passed before the legislators 
heeded the advice of these educators. The fight to establish 
state normal schools has been the most desperate struggle 
in the history of school legislation in Kentucky. 
3. The first normal school was established in Kentucky in

1856. The trustees of Transylvania University gave that 
institution to the state on the condition that it establish a 
school for teachers. The General Assembly accepted it, and 
appropriated $12,000 annually for its maintenance. Two 
years later this legislation was repealed. By this act the 
state again refused to recognize any responsibility for the 
training of its teachers. It was nearly fifty years before 
another General Assembly was to enact a law providing for 
establishing teacher-training institutions. 
4. A Normal School Department of the Agricultural and 
Mechanical College was authorized by legislation in 1880. 
From ‘this department the College of Education, established 
in 1923, slowly evolved. 
5. Common schools for colored children were created in 
1873. An act was passed by the General Assembly in 1886 
establishing “State Normal Schools for Colored Persons.” 
The apparent ease with which the colored people convinced 
the legislators of the necessity of professional training for 
their teachers would indicate that there were certain pri- 
vate interests opposed to similar institutions for white 
teachers. 
6. Before state normal schools were established, many of 
the teachers were educated in private schools. A large 
number came from adjoining states. A Superintendent of 
Public Instruction complained that teachers were “transient 
persons.” 
7. Largely through the influence of the Kentucky Educa- 
tional Association, the General Assembly was persuaded to 
establish two state normal schools in 1906. These institu- 
tions have experienced rapid growth and development in 
their brief existence. 
8. The General Assembly of 1922 established two new 
normal schools. These schools are receiving generous sup- 
port from their beginning. 
9. Kentucky has accepted the responsibility for the train- 
ing of the state’s teachers. Ample proof of this statement 
is evidenced by the fact that the appropriations to the 
teacher-training institutions of the state for the school year 
1924-25 amount to $1,351,313.

CHAPTER III 
THE PRESENT STATUS OF TEACHERS IN 
KENTUCKY 
INTRODUCTION 
This chapter, is based on the data collected by the Legisla- 
tive Committee of the Kentucky Educational Association as 
described in Chapter I. That investigation secured infor- 
mation from teachers in each of the 120 counties, from 49 
of the 60 cities in the state, and from 197 independent school 
districts. Louisville was not included in the original study, 
but Superintendent B. W. Hartley has generously supplied 
the information desired for the entire teaching staff of that 
city. The manner in which the intelligence scores were 
obtained has previously been mentioned.* No defense of 
the reliability of these data is deemed necessary. A num- 
ber of answers to the questionnaire, however, were checked 
against the teachers’ scholarship records, filed in the regis- 
trar’s office of one of the state normal schools, and in each 
instance they were found to have reported accurately. If 
discrepancies appeared in any of the answers to the pro- 
posed questions, they are most likely to be in the nature of 
an over-evaluation of one’s professional equipment. Hu- 
man nature is so constituted that individuals, as a rule, do 
not underestimate their accomplishments. The chances are 
that if any error has crept into the answers of those re- 
sponding to the questionnaire, it has been in the form of an 
exaggeration of their scholastic attainments, the amount of 
salary they draw, the grade of certificate they hold, or the 
number of years they have taught. An analysis of the final 
results of this study shows that the present status of teach- 
ers in Kentucky is so deplorable that it is scarcely conceiv- 
able that the teachers have overstepped themselves in re- 
sponding to the questionnaire. It is true, however, that 
credit for years of schooling above the eighth grade was 
given for work done in nonaccredited high schools, and that 
more credit was actually given, in many instances, to those 
reporting than they could get recognized in a standard in- 
stitution, in the event they should have presented tran- 
scripts for evaluation. If there is any bias in these data, 
it has resulted in drawing a more flattering picture of the 
*See page g.  
-P-A-G-E-31
  Teacher-Training Problem 31 
present status of teachers in Kentucky than the condition 
actually warrants. 
In answering the question, “‘What is the present status of 
elementary teachers in Kentucky?’ it is necessary to con- 
sider a number of factors in relation to the teaching staff. 
The sex, training, certification, length of service, length of 
service in present position, length of school term, salary, 
and intelligence of teachers are studied that their status 
with respect to these factors may be known. This chapter 
is in the nature of a survey of conditions as they actually 
exist. 
I. SOME FACTS RELATIVE TO THE PRESENT STATUS 
OF TEACHERS IN LOUISVILLE 
Information relative to the training, experience, certifi- 
cates, and salary of the elementary teachers of the public 
schools of Louisville is shown in this study. It has been 
found necessary to present these data in separate tables 
rather than attempt to combine them with similar informa- 
tion regarding each of these factors from the other cities 
of Kentucky. The standards which prevail in Louisville 
relative to each of the factors mentioned above are very 
much higher than the standards of other cities of the state. 
The data, therefore, are not homogeneous and should be an- 
alyzed separately. Louisville stands in a class by itself in 
Kentucky, and at the head of the list, as far as the status 
of its teachers is concerned.

32 . A State’s Elementary 
The Louisville teachers represent the most adequately 
trained group of teachers in the state. Eighty-five per cent 
of them have had two years or more of training beyond 
high-school graduation. About fifteen per cent have had 
less than two years of normal-school training. Most of 
these were inducted into the school during the emergency 
occasioned by the World War, when hundreds of trained 
teachers left the service for war work and more remunerative 
positions in the industrial world. At this time the schools 
were compelled to employ teachers with inferior training or 
close their doors. Except for those who were employed 
during the teacher shortage referred to above, the Board of 
Education has for many years required a minfmum prep- 
aration of two.years of normal training of all those admitted 
to the teaching staff. Another important aspect of the pro- 
fessional equipment of Louisville’s teachers should not be 
overlooked in any consideration of this topic. Many of the 
elementary teachers take advantage of the extension courses 
offered by the Louisville Normal School and the University 
of Louisville, and in this way continue their training while 
in service. This gives to the city a group of well-qualified 
teachers.

An examination of Table V will reveal the grade and 
something of the character of the certificates held by the 
teachers of Louisville. Sixty of the teachers hold a high- 
school certificate. These certificates are granted on creden- 
tials representing from two to four years of college work. 
While this certificate is called “high-school certificate,” it is 
also a legal license for teaching in the grades. 
The advanced certificate is issued to the two-year grad- 
uates of the normal schools. After three years of success- 
ful experience, it becomes a life certificate. This is the 
characteristic license held by the Louisville teachers. Prac- 
tically 84 out of each 100 teachers have been granted the 
* advanced certificate. 
The special certificates are but few in number, and they 
 
-P-A-G-E-33
  
Teacher-Training Problem 33 
represent the odds and ends. Most of them are certificates 
issued in other states with which Kentucky has a reciprocal 
agreement regarding the licensing of teachers. 
The most significant feature of these data on the certifi- 
cation of the teachers of Louisville is the small number of 
certificates issued by examination. Only 4.5 per cent of the 
teachers now employed secured their license by passing an 
examination. All the others presented credentials repre- 
senting the completion of a definite amount of academic and 
professional preparation, and they were issued certificates 
on these scholarship records. This practice is in line with 
the best thought on the administration of the licensing of 
teachers.

ure of Louisville teachers is practically identical with that 
revealed in other studies.

The median salary of $1,347.50 paid elementary teachers 
in Louisville appears high when compared with the median 
salary of $933 paid teachers in other Kentucky cities. But 
when Louisville is compared with other cities of its class in 
the United States, and it is shown that the median paid in 
cities? of over 100,000 population is $1,876, it does not show’ 
up to an advantage. In fact, the median salary paid in 
Louisville is below the median for all cities in the United 
States with a population of 2,500 or more. In 1923 city 
teachers for the country as a whole received an average 
salary of $1,653. In the other factors considered in this 
study, Louisville ranks well with the cities of her class. It 
is on salary alone that she is outclassed. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
1. Assuming that the typical teacher of a system of 
schools may be described in terms of the central tendencies, 
it will be observed that the characteristic elementary teacher 
of Louisville is a normal-school graduate with two years of 
training beyond the high school; she holds, as a license, the 
advanced certificate, which has been granted on credentials ; 
she has taught for 7.7 years, and her present salary -is 
$1,347.50. 
2. Eighty-five per cent of the Louisville teachers have two 
years or more of normal training. 
3. The method of licensing the teachers of Louisville is 
*Research Bulletin, May, 1923, p. 13.  
-P-A-G-E-35
Teacher-Training Problem 35 
in accord with sound educational theory. Ninety-five and 
five-tenths per cent of all the teachers receive their licenses 
on credentials. 
4. The median tenure of the teachers of Louisville is prac- 
tically identical with that for the city teachers in other parts 
of the United States. 
5. The salaries of the Louisville teachers are much lower 
than other cities of its class pay, and somewhat smaller than 
the salaries paid in all cities of 2,500 or more population in 
the United States. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Louisville should take steps immediately to adjust her 
salary schedule so as to compensate her teachers as liber- 
ally as other cities of her class to the end that the teachers 
may have some economic freedom in making personal in- 
vestments for the purpose of further professional growth 
and advancement. Such a salary schedule should be so 
planned that it would be a constant urge to the teachers to 
continue their preparation beyond the minimum training 
required for teaching in the elementary schools. 
Il. FACTS RELATIVE TO THE TEACHERS OF THE 
STATE (LOUISVILLE OMITTED) 
NUMBER AND SEX OF ELEMENTARY TEACHERS 
An examination of Table VIII will show the number of 
elementary teachers employed in the counties, cities, and 
independent graded-school districts for the school year of 
1923-24. It also shows the number and per cent of teach- 
ers in the several administrative units who are reporting 
in this study. There were 11,633 teachers employed in the 
elementary schools, exclusive of Louisville. If to this num- 
ber the 901 elementary teachers of Louisville are added, it 
gives the state a total of 12,534 elementary teachers. A 
little over 61 per cent, or 7,665, of the 12,534 teachers of 
Kentucky are represented in this study. Since Louisville 
has been considered as a separate unit, it will be omitted 
hereafter in dealing with the totals for the state. It will be 
noted, then, that the records of 58.1 per cent, or 6,764, of 
the 11,633 teachers, exclusive of Louisville, have been used 
in this survey of the present status of teachers in Kentucky. 
It is assumed that conclusions based on returns from so

large a percentage of the teachers will hold approximately 
true for the entire teaching body.* 
Aside from the actual number of teachers in service, pos- 
sibly the most striking fact to be observed in examining 
Table VIII is the number of men engaged in teaching in the 
elementary schools. A little more than one-fourth, or 26.7

rather unique situation in this day and age, when men are 
rapidly disappearing from the elementary schools. In a 
*Note.—There are three possible assumptions which may be made relative to the 
39 per cent of the teachers whose records were not obtained for this study. 
First, it may be assumed that if their records were available they would show a 
much better distribution with respect to the various factors considered than is shown 
by the records of those reporting. 
Second, that they would have distributed themselves over about the same range 
very much in the same fashion as the cases reporting without changing the character 
of the distribution materially. 
Third, that those who did not report are much worse with respect to the factors 
under consideration than the individuals who reported, and that the distribution 
would be much poorer if they were considered. 
It appears that the first and last assumptions are untenable. It seems reasonable 
to assume that if the records of the 39 per cent who did not report were available 
they would distribute themselves very much as those who reported. 
Sampling is a device much used in scientific studies. It is uually impossible to 
study a complete universe. The number of cases used in this study is relatively much 
greater than the number used in many scientific researches.

recent bulletin,t issued by the Bureau of Education, statis- 
_ties show that in 1919-20 only 14.1 per cent of all the teach- 
ers of the United States were men. Kentucky was reported 
in that study to have 21 per cent of her teachers of the male 
sex. Those data were collected just after the war and be- 
fore many of the men had had an opportunity to return to 
the schoolroom. This fact may account for the larger per- 
centage of men actually engaged in teaching in 1923 than is 
reported in the statistics of the Bureau of Education for 
1919. Only five other states—Arkansas (31.2 per cent), 
West Virginia (28 per cent), Utah (24 per cent), Tennessee 
(22.4 per cent), and Mississippi (22 per cent)—had a 
higher percentage of men teaching in 1919 in the public 
schools. Unless some of these states have increased their 
percentage of men teachers, as Kentucky has, only two 
states—Arkansas and West Virginia—now exceed Kentucky 
in the proportion of male teachers. 
Even though the state still maintains a relatively high 
percentage of men (26.7 per cent men, 73.3 per cent women)

and in the western part of the state only a.small percentage 
of the teachers are men. Most of the men engaged in teach- 
ing in the rural schools are teacher-farmers, or farmer- 
teachers, depending somewhat on which interest predomi- 
nates. A study of their salaries reveals that it is essential 
that they supplement their income in some manner if they 
are to continue teaching. The remuneration which they 
receive from their seven months of teaching is not sufficient 
to sustain one person for the year. Many of them, how- 
ever, have families to support. A further discussion of the 
salary problem will be considered later. 
THE TRAINING OF ELEMENTARY TEACHERS 
What are the qualifications of those into whose hands is 
given the teaching of Kentucky’s children? This is one of 
the important questions which this study attempts to an- 
swer. It is important because the educational progress of 
the state is primarily dependent upon the competency of its 
teachers. Teachers who have had little or no training can- 
not be competent.* The state’s educational status is condi- 
tioned to a greater extent by the training of its teaching 
personnel than by any other factor. A careful exami- 
nation of Tables X and XI will give an idea of the present 
training of teachers in Kentucky. Table X shows the years 
of schooling above the eighth grade for the white and col- 
ored teachers of the several administrative units. Table 
XI is a supplement to Table X, making use of the same data, 
but for the purpose of showing where the training has been 
obtained. It also attempts to show, concerning those who 
have graduated from high school and have done some work 
in the normal school, the amount of training they have re- 
ceived expressed in the number of weeks of attendance. A 
considerable number of Kentucky’s teachers spend a summer 
or two in the normal school after they graduate from high 
school,+ and this constitutes the extent of their professional 
training. It has been thought wise to present this infor- 
mation in such form as to demonstrate to what extent this 
practice prevails.

In Table X four years of schooling above the eighth 
grade was defined so as to include all those individuals who 
had 3.6 years to 4.5 years above the eighth grade. There 
are 1,788 teachers in this group. This same group is dis- 
tributed in this manner in Table XI: 544 in the column 
marked 4 years in high school, 507 in the column marked 
1-6 weeks in normal school, and 727 in the column marked 
7-18 weeks in normal school. The 1,166 teachers shown in 
Table X with 5 years of schooling above the eighth grade 
are distributed in Table XI, as 111 with one year of college 
training, 666 with 19-36 weeks of normal-school training, 
and 389 with 87-54 weeks of normal training. The 760 
teachers in Table X with six years of schooling above the 
eighth grade include the 213 with 2 years of college train- 
ing and the.547 with 55-72 weeks of normal training. These 
are the only differences in the distributions in these two 
tables. 
On the basis of the data shown in Table X, only 15 ele- 
mentary teachers out of each 100 are satisfactorily pre- 
pared if high-school graduation plus two years of additional 
training is accepted as a minimum standard} for teaching 
in the elementary school. More than 40 per cent have not 
had full four years of high-school training, and practically 
7 per cent have never gone beyond the elementary grades.   
*Students who had more than one-half year and less than one and one-half years of high school were given credit for one year above the eighth grade. 
;This standard will be defended in the next chapter.

  Teacher-Training Problem 41 
Stated somewhat more concretely, if it were possible to line 
up all the 11,633 elementary teachers of Kentucky in a com- 
pany front, and if those teachers who had only completed 
the elementary grades were asked to step out two paces in 
front of the line, 814 would move forward. If it were then 
requested of all who had not completed their high-school 
work to join this group, it would be recruited by 3,940 more. 
If a further command were given for those who had not 
completed as much as two years of training beyond the high 
school to move forward, an army of 9,888 elementary teach- 
ers with less than the standard minimum training would be 
the result of this maneuver. 
While this is an unfortunate shortage in the training of 
teachers in Kentucky, nevertheless there is room for encour- 
agement when these data are compared with the findings 
of the Survey Commission® on the training of teachers in 
service in 1920-21. At that time only 10 out of each 100 
teachers were adequately prepared. while 63 per cent had 
not completed a full four-year high-school course, and 23 
per cent had never gone beyond the elementary school. The 
improvement which has come about in the interim can very 
probably be attributed in a large measure to the stimulus 
which the Survey Commission’s findings gave to education 
in the state. One of.the results of that investigation was 
to send practically all of Kentucky’s teachers to school.* 
The changes which have been effected in the three years rep- 
resent a marked improvement in the training of the teaching 
staff. 
Turning to Table XI, it will be observed that there are 
more teachers reporting in this study who have never gone 
beyond the elementary school than there are normal-school 
graduates actually engaged in teaching in the state. As- 
suming that the figures: are approximately true for all the 
teachers of the state, only about 6 per cent, or 697, of the 
elementary teachers of the state are graduates of the two- 
year normal-school course, while it was shown above that 
814 teachers have never gone to school beyond the grades. 
The normal schools of the state have graduated more 
than 2,000 teachers since they began their work. It would 
be interesting to learn what becomes of the normal-school 
graduates. Do they soon quit teaching? Do they enter the 
high-school field? Do they leave the state for more attrac- 
tive positions? These are questions which cannot be an-

swered in this study. They are questions, however, which 
the teacher-training institutions should answer. 
Thus far the analysis of the training of teachers has dealt 
with totals for the state. To say that the median number 
of years of schooling beyond the eighth grade for all the 
teachers of the state is 4.2 years (see’Table X) is inade- 
quate. Further analysis of the training of the teachers of 
the various administrative units is essential to a proper in- 
terpretation of the state’s teacher-training problem. It 
will be observed that for the white teachers of the state the 
median number of years of schooling above the eighth grade 
for the city schools is 5.5; for the county schools, 3.9; and 
for the independent graded school, 4.7. Only 15 per cent 
of the rural teachers and 29 per cent of the independent 
graded-school teachers reached or exceeded the median 
training of the city teachers. When it is remembered that 
the median training for the city teachers is below the stand- 
ard recognized as desirable, one is impressed with the 
lamentable status of the training of rural teachers. while 
that of the teachers of the independent graded schools rep- 
resents but little improvement over the rural schools. 
Anderson.’ in reporting the status of the training of rural 
teachers in Wisconsin in 1920-21, says: “Ninety-three and 
two-tenths per cent of all the rural teachers of the state do 
not have the minimal professional and academic prepara- 
tion necessary to aualify them to give to rural children that 
equality of educational opportunity that adequate teacher 
preparation can insure.”* These data reveal almost an 
identical state of affairs for Kentucky. Ninety-two and 
three-tenths per cent of the rural teachers are inadequately 
trained. Eighty-one and three-tenths per cent of the 
graded-school teachers possess inadeauate academic and 
professional preparation, as contrasted with 69 per cents’ 
for the same type schools in Wisconsin. The city teachers 
of Wisconsin are also better prepared than those of Ken- 
tucky. Only 23.7 per cent fall below desirable minimum 
standards, whereas 64.5 per cent of the city teachers of 
Kentucky show deficiencies in their scholastic attainments. 
Another striking feature indicated by the data shown in 
Table X is that the colored teachers seem to show relatively 
higher training than the white teachers when they are com- 
pared in the corresponding administrative units. The me- 
dian amount of schooling above the eighth grade for the 
rural colored teachers is 4.9 years. This is exactly one year   
Anderson: The Status of Teachers in Wisconsin, p. 19. *See p. 65 for Anderson’s definition of “adequate teacher preparation.” STbid., p. 58.
-P-A-G-E-43
  Teacher-Training Problem 43 
more than that credited to the white teachers in the similar 
class of school. The median colored city teacher has 6.2 
years of schooling beyond the eighth grade. This is slightly 
more than one-half of a year in advance of the training of 
the white city teachers. 
To conclude that the colored teachers of the state have a 
training superior to that of the white teachers would prob- 
ably be erfoneous. The schools in which they have obtained 
their training are decidedly inferior to the state institutions 
and private colleges in which the white teachers have re- 
ceived their education. The colored school which is recog- 
nized as the best of all the colored institutions of the state is 
the State Normal and Industrial Institute at Frankfort. 
Of this institution Bachman said:® “The normal-school 
course itself covers three years, and is a queer mixture of 
advanced high-school instruction and normal-school work, 
including practice teaching. About thirty students com- 
plete the course annually. They compare favorably with 
the graduates of similar institutions elsewhere.” Most of 
the colored teachers of the state receive a large amount of 
their training in this school. To affirm that they have a 
training superior to white teachers of the state is a conclu- 
sion of doubtful validity. To say that they have spent more 
years in school beyond the eighth grade than the white 
teachers have more nearly approaches the facts. 
There are at least two reasons why the colored teachers 
make a somewhat more favorable showing in the years of 
preparation for their work than the white teachers. The 
first is that the colored teacher is held in higher esteem 
among: his people than the white teacher usually is. The 
colored teacher, along with the colored preacher, enjoys a 
social prestige not always accorded to the white teacher. 
The second reason is an economic one. The salary of the 
colored teacher is usually as high as, or higher than, he 
could earn in other fields of labor. This is seldom true re- 
garding white teachers. These facts make for competition 
among the colored people who are intellectually inclined, 
resulting in the selection of the best of their race for the 
profession. It also sends to school many a teacher who 
does not care to see his position awarded to some one who 
has made more preparation. 
Attention should be called to one further fact which the 
data in Table X reveals relative to the status of teacher 
training in Kentucky. Each of the five administrative 
units has a different standard of training for its teachers as

revealed in its present practice. This observation will be 
more fully discussed later in the chapter. 
THE CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS 
The number of teachers who hold the various grades of 
certificates is shown in Table XII. It will also be observed 
from a study of this table that Kentucky has two methods 
of licensing teachers—one by examination and the other bv 
credentials. Seventy-five and three-tenths per cent of all 
those coéperating in this study hold some class of certificate 
obtained on an examination, whereas 24.7 per cent have 
been granted licenses on the basis of work actually com- 
pleted in accredited schools. 
There have never been many applicants for the “state 
teachers’ diploma” or the “state teachers’ certificate.” To 
obtain either of these certificates, the applicant must pass 
an examination on all the common-school subjects, as well as 
a number of high-school subjects, the former being much 
more difficult to obtain than the latter. The teachers who 
are prepared to pass these examinations, as a rule, have 
sufficient normal-school or college credit to obtain a certifi- 
eate on credentials. The “elementary certificate of the 
first grade” and the “elementary certificate of the second 
grade” are obtained by passing an examination on the 
common-school subjects and the theory and practice. of 
teaching, the first certificate requiring an average grade 
of 85 per cent, with no grade on any subject below 70. per 
cent, and the second certificate requiring an average of 75 
per cent, with no grade below 65 per cent. For many years

Teacher-Training Problem 45 
the state has extended for life the licenses of those teachers 
who have taught for twenty years on first-class certificates. 
There are three grades of certificates issued on creden- 
tials—viz., an “elementary certificate,” an ‘intermediate 
certificate,’ and an “advanced certificate.” These certifi- 
cates are granted applicants by the University of Kentucky 
and the normal schools, with the approval of the Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction, upon the completion of a cer- 
tain amount of academic and professional work.. A num- 
ber of the private colleges and normal schools of the state 
also have the authority to grant these certificates. One in- 
teresting commentary on the administration of this feature 
of the certification laws of the state merits consideration. 
The amount of credit required for any one of these certifi- 
cates is not the same at the university as it is at the normal 
schools. And the normal schools have changed their re- 
quirements in the past from time to time. Unfortunately, 
the certificates, though named alike, do not always mean 
the same.* 
The cities of the state have the legal right to license their 
own teachers. However, many of them do not exercise this 
authority, but require their teachers to obtain a certificate 
in the same manner in which the county teachers are 
licensed. 
An examination of Table XII will reveal clearly that the 
tendency of Kentucky teachers is to secure a license by pass- 
ing an examination. Each year for more than a generation 
thousands of applicants appear on the date of the examina- 
tions at the courthouses of the state to take the examina- 
tions for a teacher’s license. Many of them seem to have 
caught the spirit of that old motto, “If at first you don’t 
succeed, try, try again;” for frequently they appear before 
the local examiners until they chance to strike an “easy 
examination” or succeed in “cramming”’ sufficiently to pass 
the formal, factual quéstions which are asked on the exami- 
nations. 
The licensing’ of teachers should be based on the actual 
training of teachers, but for at least 75 out of each 100 
teachers of the state there is no mark of relationship. The 
*The Kentucky Statutes (see Sec. 4535a-14 and Sec. 4636b-2), which authorize the 
university and the normal schools to confer certificates on teachers, say that the ele- 
mentary certificate shall be issued on the completion of not less than one year’s work, 
the intermediate certificate on the completion of not less than two years’ work, and 
the advanced certificate on the completion of not less than three years’ work. The 
university requires high-school graduation for entrance. The normal schools will ad- 
mit a graduate of the eighth grade. On the completion of one year’s work. each of 
these students may receive an elementary certificate. One of them has had five years 
of work above the eighth grade, and the other one year. The law has been adminis- 
tered in this manner for a number of years. However, the General Assembly (1924) 
changed the law somewhat, so that the normal schools now may issue four grades of 
elementary certificates.  
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 A State’s Elementary 
practice of granting licenses on examination is an. anti- 
quated system,!° and it in no respect measures up to the 
present standards or ideals of the best authorities on this 
subject. The certification of teachers by this method per- 
mits and even encourages teachers to follow the line of least 
resistance. Intellectual and professional stagnation are 
the final outcomes. This system offers no incentive for pro- 
fessional growth. A teacher may continue to teach for a 
lifetime on the lowest grade of certificate. The inadequate 
training of the teachers, which has previously been dis- 
cussed in this chapter, can to some extent be charged to a 
system. of certification which permits of professional tor- 
pidity on the part of the state’s teachers. 
Any one who will take the trouble to study the certifica- 
tion laws of the state over a period of years will discover 
that there has been no fundamental, guiding principle on 
which this legislation has been enacted. The certification 
laws of Kentucky do not represent a growth, or evolution, 
but rather a patchwork. It appears that at almost every 
session of the General Assembly some one feels called upon 
to tinker with the existing certification laws. These laws 
have been amended time and again to meet the exigencies 
of some temporary or imaginary emergency. Even since 
these data were collected. the General Assembly of 1924 en- 
acted a new certification law. This law is but another patch 
in the crazy-quilt legislation which has previously been en- 
acted on this subject. What Kentucky needs is a sound cer- 
tification law—a law which recognizes the state as the sole 
agent in the licensing of teachers. Under such a system, 
certificates will be issued on credentials only, and the char- 
acter and grade of the certificate which each applicant will 
receive will depend upon the amount and type of the candi- 
date’s training. Each grade of certificate will be tied up 
with a minimum salary schedule, which will consider both 
training and successful experience. Such a law should be 
so drawn that the least prepared teachers would draw the 
smallest salary, while those who have had more training 
should in some measure be rewarded for it. The law should 
be so administered as to stimulate growth on the part of the 
teachers of the state. It is not possible within the scope of 
this study to propose a certification law. This is a prob- 
lem, however, which is a challenge to the educational leader- 
ship of the state. It deserves immediate inquiry. The cor- 
rect answer to this perplexing question is a solution to one of 
Kentucky’s knottiest educational problems.

  Teacher-Training Problem 47 
LENGTH OF SERVICE 
Business organizations find labor turnover to be econom- 
ically wasteful. Great effort is made to secure for the busi- 
ness a permanent organization. The selling of stock to 
employees at prices much lower than market value, profit- 
sharing, bonuses, and old-age pensions are some of the de- 
vices which business uses to avoid labor transiency. It isa 
recognized principle of business that the organization which 
is assured a long tenure of service from its employees has a 
great advantage over competing organizations where the 
labor is constantly shifting.* It is extremely doubtful 
whether any business could survive in our modern industrial 
world if its labor turnover was as great and its tenure as 
brief as it is for the teaching staff of a state school system. 
The answer to the question, “How many years have you 
taught altogether?” is given in Table XIII for all the teach- 
ers reporting. The median number of years of experience 
is 4.98, or practically five years, with a quartile deviation of 
a little more than four years. Fifty per cent of the elemen- 
tary teachers of the state have been in the service less than 
five years, and 19 per cent are teaching their first school. 
For the same year (1923) Bachman‘! found 43 per cent of 
the elementary teachers of Indiana had less than five years 
of experience, while 14 per cent were teaching for the first 
time. Since business finds it. difficult to maintain a high 
degree of efficiency when it is dependent on a transient 
force, is it not legitimate to question the effectiveness of a 
state school system whose teaching staff is as shifting as 
these data would indicate? Is it not wanton waste, both 
material and spiritual, for a state to tolerate the main- 
tenance of an organization as ephemeral as the teaching 
force of Kentucky? 
To appreciate fully the actual conditions as regards the 
tenure of the elementary teachers of Kentucky, one must 
study the total experience of the teachers of the various ad- 
ministrative units as shown in Table XIII. The rural 
teachers are the most unstable group. The median number 
of years of experience for them is 4.2, with a quartile devia- 
tion of 3.94 years. Twenty-two and eight-tenths per cent 
are teaching their first year, while only 43.5 per cent have 
taught five years or longer. Sharp'? found that 15.6 per 
cent of the rural teachers of five Southern States; had 
taught only one year, and 47.9 per cent had had five years’

for Kentucky are somewhat lower than these percentages.

is the same as it is for the white teachers of Louisville and

compare the data for the two administrative units. The 
following interpretation appears justifiable from a study of 
these graphs: Practically 10 out of each 100 of the city 
teachers are new each year, which represents a 10 per cent 
turnover; whereas nearly 25 out of each 100 of the rural 
teachers are new, or a turnover of 25 per cent.

It is interesting to observe that the median experience of 
the colored teacher is higher than the median experience of 
the white teacher. These data indicate that the colored 
teachers are a more permanent group than the white teach- 
ers. 
To increase the tenure of all the teachers of the state 
constitutes another serious educational problem for Ken- 
tucky. It is suggested that a study should be made to ascer- 
tain the reasons why teachers drop out of the profession, to 
the end that remedial measures be taken to stabilize the 
teaching staff of the state.

The rural teacher is a peregrinator. Forty-nine and

70 per cent of the teachers were new to their position, and 
only 2.5 per cent had taught CSE in the same posi- 
tion for five years or longer. 
Conditions in respect to this factor are somewhat better 
for city teachers. These data would indicate that about 
one-fourth of the city teachers change position each year. 
In Wisconsin'*® identical conditions were found as to the 
transiency of city teachers. The independent graded-school 
teachers are more nomadic than the city teachers, but not so 
restless as the rural teachers. The longest tenure in pres- 
ent position is shown for colored city teachers. 
Diagrams 3 and 4 clearly contrast the differences in the 
length of service in present positions for city and rural 
teachers. This is only another index to the inequalities 
which exist when educational opportunities of city and coun- 
try children are compared. 
What is the explanation for the restlessness of teachers? 
Crabbe, in an article'* in the Peabody Journal of Education, 
May, 1924, says: “It is my distinct belief that the major 
factor in all of this transiency is the teacher’s shortage of 
training. A teacher who works poorly tends to shift often, 
both by reason of a lack of pride in his own achievement 
and the failure of his constituencies to lend any indorsement 
to his continuance.” That it means a decided interruption 
in the educational process when it becomes necessary for 
the rural child to get acquainted with a new teacher every 
other year and the:city child every fourth year is a proposi- 
tion which does not admit of debate. Such are conditions 
existing in Kentucky to-day. A discovery of the reasons of 
all this itinerancy on the part of elementary teachers would 
be a contribution of inestimable value. An investigation 
of the causes for the restlessness of teachers should be made 
so that measures may be applied that will result in a more 
permanent order of service. 
LENGTH OF SCHOOL TERM 
The minimum length of the school term is defined in the 
Kentucky statutes* as seven months. Table XV shows that 
most of the rural communities (86 per cent) are satisfied 
with a seven-months term; the cities maintain schools for 
nine or ten months each year, and the graded schools are 
open for eight or nine months. This is another glaring 
example of the inequalities of educational opportunities. 
Certainly the rural child cannot be expected to compete with

tions more frequently, draws a smaller salary, as will be 
shown later, and teaches all the grades from the first 
through the eighth. Kentucky should not be satisfied to 
permit this condition to exist any longer. The inequity of 
the situation clamors for an adjustment of the educational 
opportunities of the children of the state. The cities will 
never consent to a lowering of their standards. The solu- 
tion lies in the improvement of the rural school to that de- 
gree of efficiency approximated by the best city school of 
the state. 
THE SALARIES OF ELEMENTARY TEACHERS 
Half of the teachers of Kentucky, if these figures are rep- 
resentative, get an annual salary of less than $585 and a 
half get more. In view of the fact that practices vary with 
each administrative unit, it is more significant to study the 
salaries of the various units as entities rather than attempt 
to analyze them as one system of schools. 
From Table XVI it will be seen that the median salary for 
rural teachers is $545. The median salary paid rural teach- 
ers in the United States for the school year 1922-23 was. 
$845, or exactly $300 more than Kentucky is paying her 
rural teachers. Since it is universally recognized that the 
remuneration of the rural teachers of the nation is noto- 
riously low, it is evident that the compensation of the rural 
teachers of Kentucky is niggardly. Such compensation 
should not be dignified by referring to it as a salary; it is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-54

wage, and nothing more. It is so low that it may be said to 
be selective in character, but unfortunately not in the sense 
the term “selective” usually connotates. It forces the rural 
school to select as teachers those with little training, little 
experience, little ambition, and not infrequently individuals 
with little intelligence. Since this wage is scarcely suffi- 
cient to enable the rural teacher to eke out an existence, it 
prohibits further preparation on the part of those teachers 
who do desire more training. It certainly offers no induce- 
ment to the ambitious young man or woman to enter teach-

ing as a profession. So long as Kentucky continues to pay 
a wage as low as she now pays, the majority of the teachers 
will make as little preparation for their work as the law will 
permit, and they will teach only until they can find some- 
thing else to do. The present economic status of rural 
teachers constitutes the outstanding educational problem of 
Kentucky. Further educational progress awaits the enact- 
ment of a salary schedule so arranged that there will be at

all times a constant urge to the teachers to render their best 
service and to improve their training and preparation.1* 
Only 2.9 per cent of the rural teachers reached or ex- 
ceeded the median salary of $933 paid the city teachers of 
the state. The median salary of the teachers of the inde- 
pendent graded schools is $735, which is about midway be- 
tween the compensation of rural and urban teachers. The 
median salary paid teachers in cities of from 2,500 to 5,000 
population in the United States is $1,108, and for cities with 
a population of from 5,000 to 50,000 it is $1,204. All of 
the cities of Kentucky except Covington fall in one or the 
other of these two classes. It will be observed that the an- 
nual salary paid city teachers of Kentucky is from $175 to 
$271 less than that paid the teachers: of other cities of simi- 
lar classes. 
The salaries paid colored rural teachers is somewhat 
higher than that paid the white teachers of the same class 
of schools, while in the cities the colored teachers receive con- 
siderably less than the white teachers. 
It has not been the purpose of this study to discover rela- 
tionships between the various factors involved. That is a 
problem for further investigation. Correlations were made. 
however, between salary and experience, and salary and 
training for both county and city teachers. The data from 
ten counties, representing each natural geographical sec- 
tion of the state, and from thirteen cities, representing cities 
of different size and character, were used in making these 
correlations. There were 453 cases used in making the cor- 
relations for the counties and 405 for the cities. A corre- 
lation (Pearson’s method) of .19 with a P.E. of +.02 was 
found to be the relation between salary and experience, and 
a correlation of .57 with a P.E. of +.01, the relation between 
salary and training for county teachers. 
For city teachers the correlation between salary and exve- 
rience is .51 with a P.E. of +.01, while the correlation be- 
tween salary and training is .15 with a P.E. of +.02. 
It is interesting to note that the county teacher’s salary is 
not materially increased by reason of additional years of 
experience, but that the salary is increased by additional 
years of training. For city teachers the reverse is true. 
The longer the city teacher remains in the service, the 
larger salary he will receive; but additional years of train- 
ing tend to have very little or no influence on the size of his 
salary. 
It was an interesting revelation to discover in the tabula- 
tion of these data that there is not a single salary schedule 
“Research Bulletin, N. E. A., Vol. 1,.No. 3 (May, 1923), p. 76. 
 
-P-A-G-E-56

built on principles and standards commonly accepted as 
fundamental'® in operation in the state. Even the city of 
Louisville is without a salary schedule. 
So long as Kentucky continues to pay her teachers the low 
salary she is now paying, the state may expect to employ 
only the immature, inadequately trained, itinerant, and pro- 
fessionally isolated teachers. If there were a sufficient num- 
ber of well-qualified teachers to fill every teaching position 
in the state, Kentucky would still have a complicated 
teacher-training problem. The well-qualified teacher can- 
not afford to and will not teach for the salary paid in the 
rural schools. Ample proof of this statement may be had 
by consulting Table XI. Of the 4,748 rural teachers re- 
porting, only 73 were graduates of a normal school. The 
solution to this educational problem will not come until the 
state invests more in the education of its children.

THE INTELLIGENCE OF STUDENT-TEACHERS

teachers who had completed high school before entering the 
normal school, and for 1,119 student-teachers who had not 
completed their high-school work. Of those who had not 
completed their high-school course, some had never gone 
beyond the eighth grade; others had completed one, two, or 
three years of high-school work. 
The score equivalents expressed in letter grades and the 
appropriate definitions of each are given below :!°

Yoakum and Yerkes?° have this to say in further explana- 
tion of the ratings: “The rating a man earns furnishes a 
fairly reliable index of his ability to learn, to think quickly 
and accurately, to analyze a situation, to maintain a state of 
mental alertness, and to comprehend and follow instruc- 
tions. The score is little influenced by schooling. Some of 
the highest records have been made by men who had not 
completed the eighth grade.” 
Concerning directions for the use of intelligence rating in 
the army, the same authors?! make this recommendation: 
“Commissioned-officer material is found chiefly in the ‘A’ 
and ‘B’ groups, although, of course, not all high-score men 
have the other qualifications necessary for officers. Men be- 
low ‘C+’ should not be accepted as students in officers’ train- 
ing schools unless they possess exceptional powers of leader- 
ship and ability to command.” Assuming that this recom- 
mendation is valid for the army, is it not a questionable pol- 
icy to admit students to the normal school whose rating is 
below “C+’? 
The median intelligence score of the high-school graduate 
who is taking teacher-training at the Eastern Kentucky 
State Normal School and Teachers College is 115.7. Ap- 
plying the same terminology used in classifying men in the 
army, it means that the median high-school graduate who is 
a student at the normal school is a “B”-grade individual, 
and is designated by definition as “superior.”? This prob- 
ably signifies that these student-teachers possess sufficient

intelligence to train successfully for any position they de- 
sire to fill. The teaching profession will advance if it can 
be recruited from such material. Another encouraging as- 
pect of these data is that the upper quartile is composed en- 
tirely of “A”-grade, or “very superior” individuals. From 
this group the future educational leadership may safely be 
drafted. 
Turning from those who are the high-school graduates 
at the normal school to the group which has not completed 
high school, one is confronted with an entirely different 
assemblage. The median score for the 1,119 student-teach- 
ers in this group is 83.8. This is the score of a “C+” indi- 
vidual, or one who is slightly above the average. These 
prospective teachers are but little better than an unselected 
group. They possibly do not rank much higher than the 
first thousand individuals one would chance to meet on the 
street or public highway. It will be noted that there is a 
difference of 32.4 points in the intelligence rating of these 
two groups. Only 16.9 per cent of those who are not high- 
school graduates reached or exceeded the median score for 
high-school graduates. It will be difficult for the normal 
school to make teachers out of many of these students, espe- 
cially those who fall in the lower ranges of this distribution. 
It would appear that the normal schools are wasting a large 
amount of time and money on a considerable number of 
rather unpromising students. These institutions would 
serve the state better by concentrating their efforts on the 
more promising material graduated from the high schools. 
Probably no learned profession can ever be successfully re- 
cruited from an unselected group. The intellectual de- 
mands made upon those who would enter the law, medicine, 
the ministry, or teaching, are such as to make it imperative 
that they come from the upper quartile of society. A pro- 
fession which recruits its personnel from a lower stratum 
than this is very likely to suffer from stagnation. 
It has been assumed in the interpretation of these data 
that the Alpha Army Intelligence Test measures mental 
ability. But whether it measures intelligence or school op- 
portunity, as Dr. W. C. Bagley22 would probably contend, it 
must be admitted that the high-school graduate has a de- 
cided advantage over those who have not had high-school 
work. Even if it were granted (and this is not admitted) 
that the two groups are equally capable of receiving train- 
ing, it would require much longer time and greater expense 
to train the group which has not completed high school than 
“Journal of Educational Research, Vol. 6, pv. 377.
-P-A-G-E-59
  Teacher-Training Problem 59 
it would the high-school graduates. The sooner the normal 
schools of Kentucky discontinue the practice of receiving 
this heterogeneous throng, which comes each year for a 
smattering of training, the better they will be able to serve 
the state. There are in Kentucky 492 white public high 
schools, 51 colored public high schools, and 86 private sec- 
ondary schools, with an enrollment of 47,709 students.2% 
Every effort should be made to recruit the student bodies of 
the normal schools from the graduates of these high schools. 
It is assumed that the intelligence rating of these student- 
teachers is fairly indicative of the intelligence of the teach- 
ers of the state. It is certainly not lower, and it may be 
slightly higher than it would be if the tests were given to all 
the teachers in view of the fact that the more ambitious are 
the ones who attend normal school. If these intelligence 
scores are approximately true, it would appear that the in- 
telligence score of the average city teacher more nearly cor- 
responds to the median score.(115.7) for the high-school 
graduates, since city teachers have a median training of 5.5 
years above the eighth grade. On the other hand, it would 
appear that the median score of 83.3 is more nearly typical 
of the intelligence rating of the average rural teacher in 
view of the fact that the median training of rural teachers 
is less than high-school graduation (8.9 years). 
Diagrams 5 and 6 are graphic presentations of the intel- 
ligence ratings of the two groups so arranged that a com- 
parative study may be made and greater facility in the in- 
terpretation of these data may be secured.

DoES KENTUCKY MAINTAIN A SYSTEM OF COMMON SCHOOLS 
oR MANY, DIFFERENT SYSTEMS? 
The Constitution of Kentucky requires the General As- 
sembly to provide by law for a system of common schools. 
These schools are to be maintained by the income from the 
state school fund and from a uniform school tax. Each 
county receives from the state annually its share of the 
school fund, distributed on a per-capita basis. No distinc- 
tion is made on account of race or color, but separate schools 
for the white and colored children must be maintained. 
An analysis of the data found in the tables of this chap- 
ter indicates that Kentucky does not have “a system of com- 
mon schools,” but it maintains systems of common schools— 
at least six, and possibly more, in number. First, there is 
a system of schools in Louisville operated on standards dis- 
tinctly different from those practiced in other parts of the 
state. This system represents the most advanced educa- 
tional effort to be found in Kentucky. Second, in signifi- 
cance, is the system of schools found in the cities of the 
second, third, and fourth classes. These schools are all 
quite similar in character. Third, in order of importance, 
as measured by the efforts put forth by the unit of admin- 
istration, is the independent graded-school district system 
of schools. Fourth, and at the bottom of the list, is the 
county school system—a weak, feeble, struggling, poorly 
supported, and frequently maladministered system of com- 
mon schools. Then there are the colored schools, a system 
of city colored schools, and a system of county colored 
schools. They are different in character, and they consti- 
tute our fifth and sixth systems of common schools. It 
would appear that the differences between these systems of 
schools within the state are as marked as the differences 
would ordinarily be between the school systems of different 
states. Each system operates under a different standard 
as to the length of its term, the qualifications of its teachers, 
and the salaries paid its teachers. There is considerable 
evidence, not referred to in this study, that would indicate 
_ other differences even more pronounced than those pointed 
out in this investigation. To determine whether the Gen- 
eral Assembly has followed the injunction of the Constitu- 
tion and provided a system of common schools for the state, 
or many different systems, as these data would indicate, 
would furnish material for an interesting and profitable in- 
vestigation. 
The different standards of each system, as divulged in the 
practices of each administrative unit, are partially revealed
-P-A-G-E-61
Teacher-Training Problem 61 
by a characterization of the typical teacher employed in 
these schools. 
THE TYPICAL COUNTY TEACHER 
Assuming that the typical teacher may be described in 
terms of the central tendencies previously referred to, the 
chances are two to one that the rural teacher is a woman 
holding either a first or second-class certificate obtained by 
an examination. She teaches in a school where the term is 
seven months in length at a salary of $545 per year. The 
odds are fifty-fifty that this is the first year for her in her 
present position, and she is likely to have had three years 
of experience previous to this year. She has had a little 
more than three years of high-school work, but no normal 
training. Her intelligence is slightly above the average for 
an unselected group. She makes a raw score of 83.3 points 
on the Army Alpha Intelligence Test. 
THE TYPICAL Ciry TEACHER 
The typical city teacher is almost invariably a woman 
holding some grade of certificate secured by an examination. 
She teaches in a school where the term is either nine or ten 
months in length at a salary of $933 per year. The chances 
are one to three that this is the first year for her in her pres- 
ent position. She is likely to have had six and one-half 
years of experience previous to this year. She graduated 
from a high school, and has spent from thirty-six to fifty- 
four weeks training at a normal school. Her intelligence 
would be defined as “superior,” for she makes a raw score 
of 115.7 points when tested by the Alpha Army Intelligence 
Test. 
THE TYPICAL GRADED-SCHOOL TEACHER 
The typical graded-school teacher makes a somewhat bet- 
ter showing than the rural teacher, but she does not meas- 
ure up to the standards of the city teacher. Like the city 
teacher, she is almost invariably a woman. She holds a 
first or second-class certificate, obtained by examination. 
She teaches in a school where the term is eight or nine 
months in length at an annual salary of $735. The prob- 
abilities are forty-six out of one hundred that this is her 
first year in her present Position. Previously she has had 
about six years of experience. She is a high-school grad- 
uate, but she has done less than a year’s work at the normal 
school. The indications are that her intelligence is above 
that of the rural teacher, but somewhat lower than the score 
of the city teacher.
-P-A-G-E-62
62 A State’s Elementary 
THE TYPICAL COLORED COUNTY TEACHER 
The typical colored rural.teacher holds.a license secured by 
an examination. She teaches in a school where the term is 
seven months at an annual salary of $595. The probabili- 
ties are two to three that this is her first year in her present 
position. Previously she has had ten years of experience. 
She is a high-school graduate, and she has attended the nor- 
mal school a little less than one year. 
THE TYPICAL CoLORED CITY TEACHER 
The typical colored city teacher holds a life certificate, 
obtained on credentials. She teaches in a school where the 
term is nine months in length at an annual salary of $720. 
The chances are fifty-fifty that this is her fifth year in her 
present position, and she has had nine years of previous ex- 
perience. She is a high-school graduate, and has also grad- 
uated from the normal school. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS* 
An attempt has been made in this chapter to present data 
revealing in some detail the status of elementary teachers 
in Kentucky on all the factors heretofore enumerated. The 
following brief summary anwers the question: ‘“‘What is the 
status of elementary teachers in Kentucky?” 
1. Kentucky has a relatively high percentage of men 
teaching in the elementary schools when compared with the 
other states, but the number is rapidly decreasing. Twenty- 
six and seven-tenths per cent are men, and 73.3 per cent are 
women. 
2. Only 15 out of each 100 of the teachers of the state 
have adequate training. The rural teachers show greater 
deficiencies in training than the teachers of the other ad- 
ministrative units. The normal-school graduates do not 
teach in the rural schools, and at least two-thirds of them 
have left the elementary field altogether. The colored 
teachers have spent more years in school above the eighth 
grade than the white teachers. 
3. Three-fourths of the teachers of Kentucky secure their 
licenses on examination and one-fourth on credentials. The 
certification laws of the state are not based on fundamental 
educational principles usually accepted as basic. 
4. The tenure of the teachers of Kentucky is of short du- 
ration. Fifty per cent have been in the service fewer than 
five years. The rural teachers are the most unstable. Prac- 
tically one-fourth of them are teaching for the first time. 
*For a summary of facts relative to the Louisville school, see page 34,  
-P-A-G-E-63
  Teacher-Training Problem 63 
The average tenure of the city teachers of the state is 
slightly higher than for the cities of Wisconsin. Practi- 
cally 10 per cent of the city teachers are teaching their 
first year. The colored teachers are a more permanent 
group than the white teachers. 
5. Forty-two out of each 100 teachers of Kentucky are 
teaching for the first time in their present.positions. Only 
19.5 per cent have taught for five years or longer in the 
same position. The rural teacher is the most nomadic. 
About one-half of them change positions each year. The 
teacher transiency of the state reveals a deplorable educa- 
tional waste, but Kentucky does not suffer in comparison 
with other states. Sharp found conditions slightly worse 
in five Southern states, and Anderson reports a much worse 
condition in Wisconsin. 
6. Only a seven-months school term is maintained in 86 
per cent of the rural schools. The graded schools are open 
for eight or nine months each year, and the city schools for 
nine or ten months. The inequalities of educational opvor- 
tunities are glaringly illustrated in the length of the school 
term for the different administrative units. : 
7. The median salaries paid Kentucky teachers are much 
lower than the median salaries paid the teachers of the 
United States. The rural teachers ‘get $300 a year less 
than the rural teachers of the country at large, and the city 
teachers draw from $175 to $271 less than the city teachers 
for cities of the same size and class. The salaries are so 
low, especially in the rural school, that they attract only the 
untrained and professionally unprepared teachers. 
The colored rural teacher draws a slightly higher salary 
than the white teacher, but the city colored teachers do not 
receive as much as the city white teachers. 
There is not in operation in the state a single salary sched- 
ule based on principles commonly accepted as fundamental 
in the building of a salary schedule. The economic status of 
Kentucky teachers constitutes the outstanding educational 
problem of the state. 
8. The student-teachers at one of the normal schools who 
are high-school graduates are a selected group. They make 
a median score of 115.7 on the Alpha Army Intelligence 
Test. Those who are not high-school graduates are only 
slightly above an unselected group in mental ability. They 
make a median score of 83.3. Only 16.9 per cent of these 
reach or exceed the median of the graduates of high schools. 
It would appear that the normal schools are wasting con- 
siderable time and money attempting to train some rather 
unpromising material.

a system of schools as enjoined by the Constitution, but 
systems of schools. Each system operates under different 
standards. The differences between the systems of schools 
within the state are as marked as the differences would or- 
dinarily be between the school systems of different states.

  CHAPTER IV 
KENTUCKY’S NEED FOR TRAINED TEACHERS AND 
THE FACILITIES FOR PREPARING THEM 
This chapter will attempt to answer the following ques- 
tions: 
1. What amount of training constitutes satisfactory prep- 
aration for teaching in the elementary school? 
ee pO many trained elementary teachers does Kentucky 
nee 
83. How far short of the standard minimum training does 
the present elementary teaching staff fall? 
4. What facilities does Kentucky have for training these 
teachers? 
WHAT AMOUNT OF TRAINING CONSTITUTES SATISFAC- 
TORY PREPARATION FOR TEACHING IN 
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL? 
The Salary Committee of the National Educational Asso- 
ciation! in its report says: “In regard to the standards for 
professional and academic training required for beginning 
teachers, there is practical agreement in believing that no 
elementary teacher should have less than two years of 
normal-school training above a standard four-year high 
school.” 
In discussing the training of rural teachers, Anderson? 
accepts the following thesis: “The minimum standard of 
qualification of rural teachers should be two years of aca- 
demic and professional education beyond the high school.” 
Cooper? says in his study of the cost of training teachers: 
“It is generally conceded that the teacher in the elementary 
school should have, as a minimum, normal-school training, 
which is two years of professional work in advance of high- 
school graduation.” 
“To be satisfactorily prepared,” says Dr. Bachman,‘ “an 
elementary teacher should be a high-school graduate, and 
should have, besides, at least two years of training espe- 
cially related to teaching in the elementary school.” 
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has by law set as a 
minimum qualification for all teachers by 1927 and there-

after graduation from a state normal school or equivalent 
education.® 
The Committee on Standards for Accrediting Teachers 
Colleges and Normal Schools, at a meeting of the American 
Association of Teachers Colleges at Cleveland, February, 
1923, made a report containing the following ‘standard, 
which was adopted: ‘The standard American teachers col- 
lege or normal school is a school with two-year, three-year, 
and four-year curriculums designed to afford such general 
and professional education as will best fit students for spe- 
cific teaching in elementary and secondary schools.’’® 
The Southern Association of Teacher-Training Institu- 
tions, in session at George Peabody College, October, 1924, 
also adopted the above-mentioned standard. 
This standard implies that the minimum training for 
teachers should not be less than two years of work above the 
high school. For a half century or longer the curricula of 
state normal schools have been two-year courses. The state 
teachers colleges have developed since about 1900 with their 
four-year curricula; but these institutions, without excep- 
tion, still maintain two-year curricula. By this practice 
they recognize two years of college training as a minimum 
preparation for teaching. 
The answer to the first question proposed in this chapter 
is: High-school graduation plus two years of academic and 
professional preparation in a teacher-training institution 
is a minimum preparation for teaching in the elementary 
school. 
Justification of this standard is found in the practice of 
state teacher-training institutions in offering two-year cur- 
ricula, in the legal sanction it has received, and in the opin- 
ion of well-known authorities. 
HOW MANY TRAINED TEACHERS DOES KENTUCKY NEED? 
In arriving at an answer to this inquiry, it is first neces- 
sary to answer another important question: How many chil- 
dren can a trained teacher instruct efficiently? This has 
long been a subject of debate, and in recent years a number 
of interesting investigations have been made to determine 
the size of the class. 
Twenty-three years ago Dr. J. M. Rice tested 6,000 chil- 
dren from the fourth to the eighth grade, inclusive, to dis- 
cover their ability to solve problems in arithmetic. These 
children were selected from eighteen schools of seven cities.

  Teacher-Training Problem 67 
In the interpretation of his results he said:* “Equally sur- 
prising—if, indeed, not more incredible—may appear the 
statement that no allowance whatever is to be made for the 
size of the class in judging the results of my test. I shall 
not enter into the details in regard to this point, but will dis- 
miss it with the remark that the number of pupils per class 
was larger in the highest six schools, . . . and that the 
classes were exceptionally small in the school that stands at 
the lower end.” 
The relative efficiency of instruction, as measured by the 
promotion rate, was the method Cornman used in his inves- 
tigation of the size of the class.8 After a detailed analysis 
of his data, he concludes: “In general, it may be said that 
(a) careful scrutiny of the facts. . . fails to reveal 
any advantage in the smaller classes over classes of medium 
size as regards promotion percentages; (b) the classes of 
medium size make, on the whole, the best showing; (c) the 
larger classes do not, on the whole, fall much below the 
other groups; (d) in the grammar grades the larger the 
class, the better the promotion record; . . . (e) that 
size of class is not a very important factor in the determina- 
tion of the rate of progress or retardation of the pupils of the 
class; (f) that medium-sized classes (forty to forty-nine pu- 
pils) make somewhat the best showing; (g) that larger 
classes (fifty or more pupils) make a poorer showing in the 
primary than the grammar grades.” 
Harlan? used several factors in his study of the size of the 
class. The promotion rate, classroom conditions, and the 
ability of the children to solve problems in arithmetic were 
the criteria which he applied in measuring the schoolroom 
efficiency of classes of different size. He interprets the re- 
sults of his investigation in the following words: “In the 
light of these conclusions the class of medium size (twenty- 
three pupils) seems too small for the most economical ad- 
ministration of our schools. Small classes are expensive, 
since they increase the cost per pupil. This added expense 
does not seem justified when it is known that the differences 
in achievement of the small over the large classes are small, 
as has been demonstrated. If one wishes to secure higher 
promotion rates, higher scores in arithmetic, better atten- 
tion and wider participation in class work, more efficient 
classroom management, and better habits of study, these 
things can undoubtedly be secured through improved meth-

ods of instruction and more efficient supervision of the 
larger classes rather than through a reduction in the size 
of the classes.” 
Boyer!® studied the promotion rate of schools in Philadel- 
phia in 1913. The results of his investigation appear to 
justify the conclusion that for the primary grades, at least, 
the medium-sized classes had the advantage. A medium- 
sized class was defined to be thirty-five to forty-four pupils. 
Elliott tested pupils in a large number of cities in compo- 
sition, spelling, range of vocabulary, handwriting, and arith- 
metic in studying the effect of the size of the class on the 
attainments of the children. He concludes:"! “So far as the 
records of these tests are valid, there is apparently no rela- 
tion between the size of the class in which the children have 
been taught during the present year and the attainment or 
variability.” 
Class size and efficiency in teaching spelling were investi- 
gated by Breed and McCarthy.'2 The authors showed that 
the improvement in the larger classes surpassed the smaller 
in three of five grades. They recommended that “classes 
in the elementary school of less than forty. especially below 
the seventh grade, be increased to an enrollment of forty to 
forty-five.” 
Two very recent investigations of class size and efficiency 
of instruction have been made—one by Almack'® and the 
other by Stevenson.14 Almack carried on his experiment 
in the Training School of the Teachers College, San José, 
Cal. He compared the attainments of the pupils in the 
smaller classes with those of the pupils of the larger classes, 
the mental ages of the two groups being equal both in range 
and central tendency in order to reduce the variable to one— 
viz., the size of the class. He arrives at the following con- 
clusion: “The data are somewhat conflicting. On the one 
hand, a pupil may make more than the normal progress in 
the small class, and considerably less than normal progress 
in the large class; and the situation may be exactly reverse 
by another pupil of the same age. Furthermore, the rapid 
gain of a few may be responsible for showing a group ad- 
vantage for the large class, while in reality learning was 
more consistent in the small class. Stated in terms of the 
whole group, the conclusions bear out the others [investiga-

tions] which have been reported. Results are independent 
of the size of the class.” 
Probably the most elaborate research in attempting to 
find an answer to this question is the work of Stevenson in 
his investigation in Chicago. He had fifty classes taught 
by twenty-five teachers. Each teacher taught a pair of 
classes. One of these classes she taught the first semester, 
and the other the second. On one occasion the class was 
large, and on the other it was small. The achievements of 
the children were tested regularly, and conclusions were 
based on the improvement which the children made. The 
author says: “It was found, on the whole, that the smaller 
classes were a little more efficient than the large classes; 
and it was also found that for all elementary grades com- 
bined the smaller-classes in general were of greatest advan- 
tage to dull pupils, and of less advantage to the average and 
bright pupils.” 
It should be related, however, in connection with Steven- 
son’s investigation, that the small class was a class of thirty- 
one to thirty-five, and that the large class was forty-six or 
more pupils. His smaller classes are more nearly medium- 
sized classes. 
These investigations of the problem of class size, while 
not in complete agreement, tend to show that the size of the 
class is not a determining factor in efficiency of instruction. 
If any deduction regarding the proper size of the class is 
justifiable from these investigations, it appears that school 
progress is somewhat more favorable for medium-sized 
classes than for very large classes or extremely small classes. 
The best information!® available concerning the size of 
classes in the United States at present is that the median 
elementary class contains thirty-eight pupils, with thirty- 
two and forty-three for the lower and upper quartile, re- 
spectively. There is considerable evidence in the investiga- 
tions reported above which might be used in defense of pres- 
ent practice. It is recognized that the problem of class size 
is a subject for a much more extensive investigation than 
has thus far been made before a definite answer can be se- 
cured. But, in the absence of a better standard, it ts as- 
sumed that practice is our best guide, and, therefore, a 
trained teacher can instruct efficiently thirty-eight pupils. 
A deviation of four or five above or below this number will 
not materially affect the quality of instruction. 
Having arrived at the number of pupils a trained teacher 
can instruct efficiently, the next step is to determine how

many children should be, under favorable conditions, in 
average daily attendance in the elementary schools of the 
state. The answer to the question, “How many trained 
teachers does Kentucky need?” can then be secured by di- 
viding the average daily attendance by the number of chil- 
dren a trained teacher can instruct efficiently. 
The school census for 1922-23 shows that there are 659,- 
395 children of school age (six to eighteen, inclusive). If 
all the children of the state entered school at six years of age 
and advanced regularly each year for eight years, 66 2-3 
per cent, or 439,596 children, would be enrolled in the ele- 
mentary schools of the state. There are many factors con- 
tributing to the retardation of pupils, and such ideal con- 
ditions never prevail. In 1922-23 there were 545,777 pu- 
pils enrolled in the elementary schools, with an average 
daily attendance of 425,026. Sixty-four and four-tenths 
per cent of the children enumerated in the census were in 
average daily attendance, and 82.7 per cent were enrolled 
in the elementary schools. With so large an enrollment the 
percentage of attendance was unsatisfactory. Table XVIII 
shows the average daily attendance based on the census for 
all the counties of the state. It will be observed that some 
counties have an exceedingly low percentage of attendance. 
It would not be difficult to increase the attendance in many 
of the counties by developing more school sentiment and by 
amore rigid enforcement of the compulsory school law until

the attendance for the state would equal the upper quartile 
(69.7, or practically 70 per cent at present). In deter- 
mining the number of trained teachers need#d in Kentucky 
it is assumed that it is better to figure the average daily 
attendance at 70 per cent.of the school census than at 62.4 
per cent, the present median for the counties. 
School Census Average Daily Attendance 
659,395 X.70 = 461,576 
461,576 + 38 = 12,147, the number of trained teachers needed. 
Seventy per cent of the school census will give the aver- 
age daily attendance of children in the elementary schools 
under favorable conditions. This number, divided by 38 
children per teacher, equals the number of trained teachers 
(12,147) Kentucky needs. : 
Louisville employs 901 elementary teachers.* This city 
maintains a standard city normal school for the purpose of 
training her teachers. This municipal institution is amply 
able, and does supply practically all the new teachers in- 
ducted into the schools of the city. By reason of this fact 
the number of teachers employed in Louisville should ‘be 
deducted from the total number of trained teachers needed 
for the state in determining the problem before the state’s 
teacher-training institutions. Kentucky (exclusive of Lou- 
isville) needs 11,246 trained teachers. The state now em- 
ploys 11,633 teachers, or 887 more than is apparently 
needed. This is probably due to the fact that there are 
many one-room schools located in sparsely populated areas, 
and the number of children in attendance is necessarily low. 
It would appear that the consolidation of one-room schools 
wherever feasible would tend to reduce the number of teach- 
ers needed. This is a problem which should be investigated 
by those who are responsible for the administration of the 
schools. 
HOW FAR SHORT OF THE STANDARD MINIMUM TRAINING 
DOES THE PRESENT ELEMENTARY TEACH- 
ING STAFF FALL? 
The answer to this question is found in Table XIX. The 
median number of years of schooling above the eighth grade 
was found in Chapter III. To find the shortage in teacher- 
training years, subtract the median above the eighth grade 
from 6, the standard minimum number of years of training. 
Multiply the shortage in teacher-training years by the num- 
ber of teachers who are short this amount of training to get 
the total shortage of teacher-training years for any admin-

in Kentucky; &feir median schooling is 3.9 years above the 
eighth grade; they are 2.1 years short of what is recognized 
as desirable minimum training; multiplying 8,340 by 2.1 
gives 17,514, the total shortage in teacher-training years for 
the rural teachers. Jt will be observed from Table XIX 
that for the white teachers of Kentucky there is. a total 
shortage of 19,657 teacher-training years, and for the col- 
ored teachers a shortage of 543 teacher-training years.

WHAT FACILITIES DOES KENTUCKY HAVE FOR TRAINING 
THESE TEACHERS? 
Kentucky maintains five teacher-training institutions, the 
sole function of which is to train white teachers, and two 
institutions devoting the major portion of their time to the 
training of colored teachers. These institutions are the 
- College of Education of the University of Kentucky, the 
Eastern Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers Col- 
lege, the Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teach- 
ers College, the Morehead State Normal School, the Murray 
State Normal School, the State Normal and Industrial 
Institute, and the West Kentucky Industrial College. The 
last two schools named are for colored teachers. 
The College of Education of the University of Kentucky 
has confined its efforts thus far to the preparation of .ad- 
ministrators and secondary teachers. In view of this fact,   
*A teacher-training year is defined as a year (36 weeks) of training in a standard 
teacher-training institution.
-P-A-G-E-73
  Teacher-Training Problem 13 
it will not be considered available at this time for the train- 
ing of elementary teachers. The responsibility for this 
task rests on the six other state institutions. 
How many teachers can each of these teacher-training 
institutions prepare annually? The commonly accepted cri- 
terion for determining the capacity of a normal school or 
teachers college is the size of its training school. The 
American Association of Teachers Colleges, at its meeting 
in Cleveland, Ohio, February, 1923, adopted this standard :1% 
“The number of pupils annually enrolled in the training 
department (including children in the public schools used 
for practice) should not be less than four times the annual 
number of graduates from the institution.” The normal 
schools and teachers colleges of Kentucky for white teachers 
are members of the American Association of Teachers Col- 
leges. Their membership signifies that they have accepted 
this standard which would automatically control their ca- 
pacity for producing trained teachers. The number of 
graduates* each institution is capable of preparing annu- 
ally will depend upon its facilities for practice teaching. 
This number will be found by dividing the number of chil- 
dren available for practice purposes by four. 
The Eastern Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers 
College and the Western Kentucky State Normal School and 
Teachers College each owns and operates a training school 
on its campus. The Morehead State Normal School and the 
Murray State Normal School depend on the local schools for 
their practice facilities. The president of the Murray State 
Normal School is also superintendent of the city schools of 
Murray. This type of organization makes it possible to use 
the city schools for observation and practice as effectively as 
a training school owned and operated by the normal school. 
The number of graduates a normal school or teachers col- 
lege may be expected to produce annually depends on the 
size of its training school (including children in the public 
schools for which it has made arrangements to use for 
practice). The maximum number of graduates is condi- 
tioned only by the number of children in the city or imme- 
diate community in which the normal school is located. It 
is assumed that if the proper overtures are made to the city 
schools, all the children in the community may be available 
for practice teaching. This will probably require infinite 
tact in the administration of the schools, as well as some 
form of state subsidy!? which will guarantee the community

such facilities as it could not purchase for itself. There is 
no doubt that a town or city is under constant obligation to 
a state normal school located within its corporations Ten- 
dering its public schools to be used as laboratories with ° 
proper safeguards is probably the most effective way a local 
community can coéperate with a state normal school. A 
community that is unwilling to extend this help should not 
be selected as the site for a state normal school or teachers 
college. .

Normal School and Teachers College can graduate 75 stu- 
dents annually by using its training school only. If ar- 
rangements were made to use the city schools, it could in- 
crease the number of graduates by 122, making a total of 
197. .The capacity of the Western Kentucky State Normal 
School and Teachers College is 90 graduates annually if it 
adheres to the standard of four children in the training 
school to each member of the graduating class; but it has 
facilities for graduating 311 more, or a total of 401, by mak- 
ing arrangements to use the city schools for practice teach- 
ing. At Morehead and Murray the maximum and. mini- 
mum numbers are the same, because these institutions have 
the local schools available for use as laboratories. It is 
evident from Table XX that these four institutions have 
the facilities at the present time to produce 400 graduates

annually as a reasonable minimum number, and they have 
possibilities which would enable them to graduate 833 teach- 
ers. Having determined the number of graduates the 
teacher-training institutions are able to produce, it is a rela- 
tively easy matter to discover the number of teacher-training 
years these institutions are able to give annually. The ap- 
plication of a simple formula will furnish the desired infor- 
mation. An institution’s capacity expressed in teacher- 
training years — graduates + first-year students x length of 
school year.* 
It is interesting to apply this formula to the teacher- 
training institutions of Kentucky. Table XXI shows the 
number of teacher-training years each institution has facili- 
ties for giving. It is assumed, however, in this table that

the number of graduates each institution is able to produce 
annually is conditioned only by the number of children in 
the community where the school is located. 
It will be seen from Table XXI that if all the teacher- 
training institutions will operate at their maximum capacity 
they can give 2,221 teacher-training years of preparation 
annually. In Table XIX it was shown that the total short- 
age in training for all the white teachers is 19,657 teacher- 
training years; therefore, the total shortage (19,657) di- 
vided by the maximum annual capacity (2,221) of the 
institutions will give the length of time (8.4 years) required 
to bring the present teaching staff up to the standard mini- 
mum training for teachers in the elementary schools. 
It is not the purpose of this study to attempt to deter-   
*A school year is ordinarily defined as 36 weeks. For institutions operating 48 
weeks, multiply by 4-3. 
Because of the failure of many students to complete the course, the number of students enrolled will necessarily have to be considerably larger than these data would indicate in order to produce the number of graduates shown in this table. The two teachers colleges offer four-year curricula. No account has been taken of the students enrolled in the third and fourth years of college.

mine the annual demand for new teachers or to make a 
prognosis of future need. This is a problem for further 
study. It may be observed, however, that if these data, as 
shown in Chapter III, Table XIII, are typical, about 20 per 
cent of the entire teaching force are new each year. If the 
state needs 11,246 teachers, this means the normal schools 
and teachers colleges will have to produce 2,249 graduates 
annually. This is a task far beyond their capacity. Ben- 
son!® has shown that the trained teacher has a longer period 
of service than the general teaching population by at least 
four or five years. As trained teachers are inducted into 
the service in Kentucky it is reasonable to assume that the 
strain now placed on the teacher-training institutions may 
not be so great as it is at present. 
The colored teacher-training shortage is not so serious. 
The colored normal school in Frankfort has the practice 
teaching facilities for supplying the state with trained col- 
ored teachers. The number of colored teachers needed annu- 
ally is decreasing. The Federal census for 1920 shows that 
the colored population of the state has decreased since 1900 
at the rate of approximately 2,000 per year.2° The school 
census for 1890 shows that there were 111,400 colored chil- 
dren of school age (6 to 20 years) in the state. The num- 
ber of colored children of school age (6 to 18 years) reported 
in the 1920 school census was 42,708. As a result of this 
loss in colored population, the number of teachers needed 
annually is decreasing. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
1. High-school graduation plus two years of academic 
and professional preparation in a teacher-training institu- 
tion is a minimum preparation for teaching in the elemen- 
tary schools. 
2. The investigations which have been made to determine 
class size tend to show that the size of the class is not a 
determining factor in efficiency of instruction. The median 
elementary class at present in the United States contains 
38 pupils, with 32 and 43 for the lower and upper quartile, 
respectively. In the absence of a better standard, it is 
assumed that practice is our best guide, and that a trained 
teacher can instruct efficiently 38 pupils. Slight variations 
will not materially affect the quality of instruction. In the 
counties of Kentucky where the best conditions prevail as 
to school attendance 70 per cent of the children enumerated 
in the school census are in average daily attendance. If 70

per cent of the children of school age (6 to 18 years) attend 
school regularly, and if one teacher can instruct 38 children 
efficiently, Kentucky (exclusive of Louisville) needs 11,246 
elementary teachers. 
83. The white teachers of Kentucky have a shortage of 
training amounting to 19,657 teacher-training years, and 
the colored teachers a shortage of 543 teacher-training 
years. i 
4, Kentucky has seven teacher-training institutions, five 
white and two colored. The College of Education devotes 
its efforts to the training of administrators and secondary 
teachers. The other institutions direct most of their efforts 
to the training of elementary teachers. . 
The number of graduates an institution can produce is 
conditioned by the size of its training school. ‘The number 
of pupils annually enrolled in the training department (in- 
cluding children in the public school used for practice) 
should not be less than four times the annual number of 
graduates from the institution.” Applying this standard, 
the teacher-training institutions of Kentucky have the facil- 
ities at the present time to produce 400 graduates annually 
as a reasonable minimum number, and they have possibili- 
ties which would enable them to graduate 833 teachers. 
The maximum production in teacher-training years is 2,221. 
It will require the present teacher-training institutions 8.4 
years, operating at their maximum production, to bring the 
present elementary teaching force up to the desirable mini- 
mum preparation for elementary teachers. 
The colored teacher-training shortage is not serious. 
It appears that at the present rate of change Kentucky 
needs about 2,249 new teachers annually.

  CHAPTER V 
WHAT WILL TRAINED ELEMENTARY TEACHERS 
COST KENTUCKY? 
It was pointed out in Chapter II that Kentucky, after 
over half a century’s agitation, finally accepted the princi- 
ple that the training of teachers is a state function. In 
Chapter III it was shown that the state has not yet accepted 
the practice of employing trained teachers only. In the 
absence of an educational program which would demand 
specific minimum training of all teachers entering the serv- 
ice after some future date, it now appears that the state may 
continue to employ untrained teachers indefinitely. So 
long as the popular notion, brought over from pioneer days. 
prevails—that anybody who can get on well with a roomful 
of children can teach—untrained teachers will continue to 
be employed, because they can be secured at less cost to the 
state. : 
What will trained teachers cost Kentucky? This is a 
question which should be answered to the end that the public 
may know the difference in cost between unskilled and pro- 
fessional service. This chapter proposes the question and 
attempts to make a few constructive suggestions. It does 
not offer a final solution. A complete analysis of the prob- 
lem would involve an investigation as extensive as those 
made of the cost of education in New York, Illinois, Iowa, 
and California by the Educational Finance Inquiry Commis- 
sion. 
The first step in attempting an answer to this question 
would be to determine what a trained teacher’s services are 
worth. The professionally trained teacher is an agent of 
the state, contributing definite, comprehensible, and calcu- 
lable social values, thereby enabling society to maintain its 
integration and to conduct its own affairs in a democratic 
way. What this service is worth to a self-governing people 
would be difficult to estimate. That it is indispensable to 
the perpetuity of a republican form of government has long 
been accepted as an established fact. That the teacher who 
makes the professional preparation to render this type of 
service to the state is entitled to be equitably compensated 
is a corollary which should naturally follow. 
The Salary Committee! of the National Educational As- 
sociation reported a suggestive salary schedule which may

be thought of as the teacher’s estimate of the value of his 
services. In view of the fact that a number of the progres- 
sive cities have standards as high as those suggested in 
Table XXII, there is evidence that some communities value 
the services of trained teachers as highly as the educators 
themselves. 
It will be seen from a study of the above-mentioned table 
that for communities with a population under 5,000 the 
initial salary for graduates of a standard normal school is 
$1,200, and that this salary is increased $120 annually for 
six years until the maximum of $1,920 is reached. For 
teachers with additional preparation increases are provided 
accordingly. Since most of the teachers of Kentucky are 
employed in communities under 5,000, therefore most of the 
teachers would receive salaries within this range if this 
salary scale were used in Kentucky. Such a salary sched- 
ule is not out of proportion with the wages paid in skilled 
occupations, and certainly much less than the salaries paid 
other professional men and women of Kentucky.* While 
it is conceded that the suggested salary schedule recom- 
mended by the National Educational Association is not ex- 
orbitant, nevertheless it is recognized that at the present 
status of educational sentiment in the state what the people 
are willing to pay for trained teachers is at variance with 
what they probably should pay. Even a superficial study 
of the problems of school finance in Kentucky will convince 
» any one that the people of the state do not contribute to the 
support of education in proportion to their wealth or incomes, 
but in accordance with what they conceive to be the educa- 
tional need. To employ trained teachers, assuming that 
they are available, at the salaries indicated above would 
about double the salaries paid the present teaching force. 
Public opinion is not ready to make such advances, if. in- 
deed, it would be wise to do so immediately. It is evident 
that certain intermediate steps will have to be taken before 
an ideal salary schedule can be achieved. 
In order to arrive at a salary which it is believed the state 
could be persuaded to pay for trained teachers. a study of 
the salaries of all the normal-school graduates who reported 
in this investigation has been made. Table XXIII shows the 
distribution of salaries paid normal-school graduates iri the 
several administrative units. It appears that the median 
salary paid white teachers who are normal-school graduates 
is $908 annually, with $804 and $1,028 for the lower and 
upper quartile, respectively. The tenure of service for these

teachers varies in length from one to many years. In de- 
termining what it will cost Kentucky to employ trained 
teachers for all of the schools, it is necessary to make two 
assumptions which appear justifiable in the light of the 
data shown in Table XXIII. First, that if the state would 
pay a median salary of $1,028 (the upper quartile), it could 
employ and hold trained teachers. In view of the fact that 
Kentucky does now employ 75 per cent of her trained teach- 
ers at less salary, this would seem to be a reasonable as- 
sumption. Second, that public sentiment could be developed 
in Kentucky to such a point that the state would provide 
funds to pay a median salary of $1,028 for trained teachers. 
Since 25 per cent of the trained teachers of the state are 
now receiving that much or more, this also appears to be a 
reasonable assumption. Accepting a salary schedule with 
$1,028 as the median salary for elementary teachers, it will
-P-A-G-E-82
  82 : A State’s Elementary 
cost Kentucky 1,028 times the number of teachers needed 
to employ trained teachers for all the elementary schools of 
the state. It was shown in Chapter IV that the total num- 
ber of elementary teachers needed in the state, including 
Louisville, is 12,147. The cost of employing a trained 
teacher for every elementary classroom in the state will be . 
$12,487,116. In 1923 the state and local communities paid 
$10,067,0002 in salaries to elementary and high-school teach- 
ers. Data are not available to determine what it paid ele- 
mentary teachers only. If the present method of distrib- 
uting school funds (per capita based on school census) were 
used, it would cost for instruction alone $18.94 per child. 
In Chapter IV it was shown that under favorable conditions 
70 per cent of the children enumerated in the census will be 
in average daily attendance. The cost of instruction based 
_on average daily attendance would be $27.05 per capita. 
The Salary Committee of the National Educational Associ- 
ation says: “In the United States between 65 and 70 per 
cent of the total current expenses of operating public schools 
goes for teachers’ salaries.” Assuming 70 per cent of the 
total funds is paid for teachers’ salaries and 30 per cent 
for other current expenses, it will cost Kentucky $38.65 per 
capita for each pupil in average daily attendance, or $17,- 
839,912.40 annually to maintain the elementary schools. 
The Educational Finance Inquiry Commission has re- 
cently investigated the cost of education in a number of 
states. In 1922 the median salary for elementary teachers 
of California* was $1,799. The cost per pupil in average 
daily attendance was $81 for maintenance and $40 for-cap- 
ital outlay, or a total of $121. The average per-pupil cost 
in New York statet for 1921 was $89. Kentucky will not be 
able to secure such liberal support for her schools probably 
for along time. But these data are presented to show that 
the proposals recommended above are conservative. 
Having discovered what it will cost the state to maintain 
the elementary schools with trained teachers in charge, one 
is immediately faced with the problem: From what source 
can this additional revenue be derived for educational pur- 
poses? This is a question for further research. The pres- 
ent investigation merely suggests a few possible, available 
sources. i 
In his study of the subject, “What is Kentucky’s Ability 
to Support Public Education?”’> Mr. Carl Adams says: 
“There is one source which the state has not yet touched,

Teacher-Training Problem 83 
but which promises much. It isthe income tax. This form 
of taxation is not only considered sound by the students of 
taxation, but it enjoys probably the widest popularity of any 
scheme of raising revenue. Almost.all European countries, 
as well as most of the American states, have adopted it in 
some form or other. Wisconsin has the oldest and what is 
considered the best state income tax. This act was passed 
in 1911. Since that date states have practically every year 
adopted such a course, until now nearly forty different 
states have this form of taxation in one phase or another. 
Reliable data disclose the situation in Kentucky, with ref- 
erence to the income tax, to be about as follows. 
If the state should desire to levy an assessment against 
these incomes (above $2,000) for education, a 2-per-cent 
ungraduated rate would yield $13,699,585.”’ Kentucky has 
never tapped this source of revenue. The state has de- 
pended very largely on a general property tax to supply all 
the expenses of the government. Students of taxation are 
agreed that an income tax is the most equitable form of 
taxation so far devised. This source of revenue should not 
be ignored in financing public education in Kentucky. 
The severance tax is another source worthy of consider- 
ation. A number of states have adopted it in various forms. 
Arkansas, in 1928, enacted a law creating a severance tax 
for school purposes only; Louisiana has a severance tax; 
Oklahoma calls it a “gross production tax ;” Texas names it 
a “gross receipt tax;” in Pennsylvania it is known as the 
“output tax;” in Alabama, the “tonnage tax;” and in Min- 
nesota, the “occupation tax.” Kentucky has already en- 
acted an oil production tax, but she has never taxed mineral 
productions. Dr. Willard R. Jillson, State Geologist, re- 
cently said :* “The coal area of Kentucky is equal to that of 
all Europe, excluding Russia, and much of this coal is of the 
highest quality and easily mined. . . .  Kentucky’s re- 
sources in coal, oil, asphalt, fluorspar. and building stone 
are vast enough to support an annual crude production of at 
least $500,000,000 a year.” The state is already one of the 
leading producers of coal. A small severance tax would 
greatly augment present revenues, and it holds forth much 
promise for the future as new enterprises are developed. 
Forty-two million tons of coalé were mined in Kentucky in 
1923. This coal has a value of about $3.50 per ton at the 
mine. If Kentucky had assessed a 2-per-cent production tax 
on this coal, it would have produced $2,940,000 in revenue. 
There is still another source of revenue which the state

  84 A State’s Elementary 
has not used—the sales tax. This tax is usually levied on 
luxuries. In some cases, however, as in West Virginia, it 
is levied on practically all commodities. This form of tax- 
ation is usually condemned by students of taxation. It is 
probably not as well adapted to Kentucky as the income and 
severance tax. 
There are possibly other sources from which considerable 
revenue could be made available without crippling industry. 
But since it is not the object of this study to investigate 
questions of taxation, the subject will not receive further 
consideration. That Kentucky has resources abundant for 
the maintenance of professionally prepared teachers is so 
obvious as hardly to require argument. The state has suf- 
ficient wealth and income to support any kind of educational 
program which the people desire. 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
1. The median salary paid normal-school graduates is 
$908 annually, with $804 and $1,028 for the lower and upper 
quartile, respectively. It is assumed that if the state should 
adopt a salary schedule with $1,028 as the median salary, it 
could employ professionally trained teachers. It is also as- 
sumed that public sentiment could be developed to such a 
degree as to make this possible. 
2. The cost of maintaining elementary schools on the 
above-named salary weuld ai :ount to $38.65 per capita for 
each child in average daily attendance, or $17,839,912.40 
annually. 
8. When this cost is compared with what California and 
New York are spending on public elementary schools, it is 
recognized as conservative. 
4. Several available sources for securing additional school 
support are suggested. A 2-per-cent ungraduated income 
(above $2,000) tax would amount to $18,699,585. A 2-per- 
cent severance tax on coal alone would produce an additional 
$2,940,000 in revenue. 
5. Kentucky has abundant resources for employing pro- 
fessionally prepared teachers.

CHAPTER VI 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
From this study certain facts stand out clearly and fur- 
nish the basis for a critical analysis of Kentucky’s elemen- 
tary teacher-training problem. These facts have been 
stated, and some discussion of them has been made in pre- 
ceding chapters. It is the purpose of this chapter to bring 
together the most important of these facts and conclusions. 
1. Kentucky has accepted, in principle, the state’s respon- 
sibility for the training of the teachers for the public schools. 
The acceptance of this responsibility came after a long and 
desperate struggle. No better evidence is needed that the 
state has at last assumed this obligation than the fact that 
it now maintains seven teacher-training institutions, be- 
sides the summer schools conducted under the supervision 
of the State Board of Education, at a cost for the school 
year 1924-25 of $851,313 for maintenance and $500,000 for 
capital outlay, making $1,351,313. 
2. Kentucky has a high percentage of men teaching in 
the elementary schools when compared with other states, 
but the number is rapidly decreasing. At present 26.7 per 
cent of the teaching force are men, and 73.3 per cent are 
women. 
3. Fifteen per cent of the elementary teachers of the state 
have adequate training. The rural teachers are more de- 
ficient in training than the teachers of the independent 
graded-school districts and cities. Practically no normal- 
school graduates teach in rural schools, and two-thirds of 
them have abandoned the elementary field altogether. The 
colored teachers have spent more years in school above the 
eighth grade than the white teachers. 
4. Three out of every four of the elementary teachers of 
Kentucky secure licenses to teach by passing an examina- 
tion; the remainder are licensed on credentials. 
5. Half of the elementary teachers have been in the serv- 
ice fewer than five years. The rural teachers are the most 
unstable. Nearly one-fourth of them are teaching for the 
first time. The tenure of city teachers compares favorably 
with the tenure for city teachers in other states. 
6. Forty-two per cent of the elementary teachers are 
teaching for the first time in their present position. Teacher 
transiency in Kentucky is no worse than Sharp found it for
-P-A-G-E-86
  
86 A State’s Elementary 
five Southern States, and not as bad as Anderson found it 
for Wisconsin. 
7. Eighty-six per cent of the rural teachers are teaching 
in schools where the term is seven months in length. Teach- 
ers in graded-school districts are employed for eight or nine 
months, and city teachers for nine or ten months. Inequali- 
ties of educational opportunities are forcefully illustrated 
by these facts. 
8. The median salary paid elementary teachers in Ken- 
tucky is $585. Rural teachers receive a median salary of 
$545, which is exactly $300 less than the median salary paid 
rural teachers of the United States. The city teachers are 
paid a median salary of $933, which is from $175 to $271 
less than the salaries paid teachers in other cities of this 
country of the same size and character. 
Colored rural teachers receive a slightly higher salary 
than white teachers of the rural schools, but the colored city 
teacher is paid less than the white city teacher. 
9. A salary schedule based on principles commonly ac- 
cepted as fundamental was not found in operation in any of 
the schools of the state. 
10. The economic status of teachers constitutes Ken- 
tucky’s outstanding educational problem. The indications 
are that conditions will remain static until the state pays its 
teachers a salary which will make it possible for them to in- 
vest more in their preparation for teaching. 
11. The student-teachers at one of the normal schools 
who are high-school graduates are a selected group. They 
make a median raw score of 115.7 points on the Alpha Army 
Intelligence Test. Those students who are not high-school 
graduates are only slightly above an unselected group. 
Their median score is 83.3 points. Only 16.9 per cent of 
these reach or exceed the median of the graduates of high 
schools. 
12. It appears that the normal schools are wasting con- 
siderable time and money in attempting to train some un- 
promising material. 
13. Different standards of practice prevail in the several 
administrative units. These standards are revealed by a 
characterization of the typical teacher employed in each 
school unit. These data would indicate that Kentucky does 
not maintain a system of schools as enjoined by the Consti- 
tution, but systems of schools—at least six in number. The 
differences between the systems of schools within the state 
are as marked as the differences would ordinarily be be- 
tween states.
-P-A-G-E-87
Teacher-Training Problem 87 
14. Kentucky needs, exclusive. of Louisville, 11,246 ele- 
mentary teachers. 
15. The white elementary teachers of Kentucky have a 
shortage of training amounting to 19,657 teacher-training 
years, and the colored teachers a shortage of 543 teacher- 
training years. 
16. Kentucky maintains seven teacher-training institu- 
tions, besides the county summer schools under the supervi- 
sion of the State Board of Education. At present the Col- 
lege of Education of the university directs its efforts toward 
the preparation of administrators and secondary teachers. 
The other four white teacher-training institutions have fa- 
cilities for producing 833 graduates of the two-year curricu- 
lum. 
17. The maximum production in teacher-training years 
for these institutions is 2,221. It would require 8.4 years 
for the present teacher-training institutions, operating at 
maximum capacity, to bring the teaching force up to desir- 
able minimum preparation for elementary teachers. 
18. The median salary received by the normal-school 
graduates teaching in Kentucky is $908 annually, with $804 
and $1,028 for the lower and upper quartile, respectively. 
19. If the state should adopt a salary schedule with the 
median salary equal to the upper quartile ($1,028) now 
paid normal-school graduates, the cost of maintaining ele- 
mentary schools, with trained teachers in charge, would 
amount to $38.65 per capita for each child in average daily 
attendance, or $17,839,912.40 annually. 
20. There are several sources for producing revenue for 
the support of public education that have not been tapped. 
A 2-pver-cent ungraduated income tax would produce ap- 
proximately $13,699,585. A 2-per-cent severance tax on 
coal alone would amount to $2,940,000. 
FINAL SUMMARY 
There are four major questions which this dissertation 
attempts to answer. 
First, what has been the history of teacher training in 
Kentucky? It is shown in Chapter II that it was many 
years before the state assumed any obligation in the train- 
ing of teachers. The idea that the training of teachers is a 
function of the state slowly evolved. Kentucky has at last 
accepted in principle this responsibility. 
Second, what is the present status of elementary teachers 
in Kentucky? A survey of the teaching staff is made in 
Chapter III, and a number of factors regarding the teachers 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
88 A State’s Elementary 
are studied. This general conclusion appears justifiable: 
That the present status of elementary teachers in Kentucky 
is unsatisfactory. 
Third, what is Kentucky’s need for professionally trained 
elementary teachers, and what facilities does she have for 
preparing them? A study of this question is made in Chap- 
ter IV, and data presented which indicate that the state, 
exclusive of Louisville, is in need of 11,246 trained elemen- 
tary teachers. The state has seven teacher-training insti- 
tutions, four of which give the major portion of their time 
to the training of elementary teachers for the white schools. 
The maximum annual production of these four institutions 
is 2,221 teacher-training years. 
Fourth, what will it cost Kentucky to employ profession- 
ally trained teachers for the elementary schools? It ap- 
pears from data presented in Chapter V that the cost of 
employing professionally trained elementary teachers would 
be $17,839,912.40 annually, or $38.65 per capita for each 
child in average daily attendance. It is pointed out that 
there are resources available for the purpose of raising suf- 
ficient revenue to meet this cost.

  CHAPTER VII 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
1. The present teacher-training institutions are not oper- 
ating at their maximum capacity; therefore, no additional 
normal schools are recommended at this time. The state 
should support the established schools generously to the end 
that they may be able to produce the maximum number of 
graduates for which they have facilities for giving practice 
teaching. 
The normal school should discontinue the practice of re- 
ceiving students who have less than high-school education. 
The time and resources of these institutions should be util- 
ized in the training of high-school graduates for teaching. 
As a temporary measure only, a limited number of high 
schools should be authorized to offer a teacher-training 
course for rural teachers. Those students who have less 
than high-school education and are now attending the nor- 
mal schools could then be directed to these local high schools. 
It is suggested that the teacher-training high-school courses 
be under the supervision and direction of the normal schools 
as a part of their extension program. Twenty-three states 
are now employing the high-school system of teacher train- 
ing.| There is ample precedent for Kentucky’s acceptance 
of this suggestion. 
2. Kentucky needs a sound certification law. Different 
kinds and grades of certificates should be granted for each 
type of school work. Certificates should be granted on cre- 
dentials representing the completion of specific academic 
and professional courses. The grade and character of the 
certificate issued to each candidate should depend on his 
training. The certification law should be tied up with a 
graduated minimum salary schedule so arranged that those 
who have the least training would receive the minimum sal- 
ary. Certificates of lower grades should be discontinued 
after a certain specified future date. 
3. A sound minimum-salary schedule based on the princi- 
ples worked out by the Salary Committee of the National 
Education Association should be provided for the schools of 
Kentucky. 
4. A survey should be made for the purpose of determin- 
ing how rapidly teachers may be trained for all the schools

of the state. With such information available, an educa- 
tional program should be planned which would require defi- 
nite minimum preparation of all new teachers by certain 
future dates. (Example: four years high school, 1930; 
one year normal school, 1935; two years normal school, 
1940.) 
5. Kentucky’s outstanding educational problem is a finan- 
cial one. Further educational development is conditioned 
in a very large measure on the state’s willingness to invest 
more in educating the children of the commonwealth. It 
is recommended that new sources of revenue be tapped for 
the purpose of providing greater funds for the support of 
the schools. An income tax and a severance tax on coal 
appear to be the most available resources. 
6. Educational opportunities should be equalized in the 
distribution of state funds. Moneys should be apportioned 
to the end that Kentucky may have a system of schools as 
enjoined by the Constitution instead of many os each 
operating under different standards.

Teacher-Training Problem 93 
APPENDIX 
To the Superintendents, Principals, and Teachers of Kentucky: 
Pursuant to the resolution of the Kentucky Educational Association 
at its last meeting, the Legislatvie Committee is drafting a teachers’ 
certification and minimum salary bill to present to the next legislature. 
In order that your committee may know the number of each kind of 
certificate that it, will be necessary to issue under the proposed plan to 
persons in service and the cost of putting the proposed plan into effect, 
it is necessary that we have information on the training, experience, 
and salary of each superintendent, principal, and teacher now in serv- 
ice. No personal use whatsoever will be made of this information. It 
will be tabulated as a whole and used as a whole as a basis for develop- 
ing the new certification system and minimum salary schedule and to 
enlighten the General Assembly of Kentucky. 
Won’t you please fill out the inclosed card (being careful to fill out 
both sides) and return the same to me in the inclosed stamped envel- 
ope at your very earliest convenience? 
Thanking you for your coéperation, I am, 
Sincerely yours, 
J. VIRGIL CHAPMAN, 
Chairman, Legislative Committee.

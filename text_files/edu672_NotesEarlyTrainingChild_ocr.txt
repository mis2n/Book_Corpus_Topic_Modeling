EARLY TRAINING OF CHILDREN. 
CHARTER. I, 
INTRODUCTORY. 
“The problem is, ‘to train up a child in the way’ he should 
grow. Grow he will in any case; what we want is, so to control 
the circumstances that call forth his activity that he shall grow 
as straight as possible, as much as possible, in as many direc- 
tions as possible, but as harmoniously as possible.” 
James Ward, 
TuereE are few gifts to man more precious, and 
at the same time more common, than the gift of 
‘children; and yet the art of education, of train- 
ing the young into useful and virtuous men and 
women, is widely misunderstood or neglected. In 
how few families do we see the result of thoughtful 
and careful practical education! in how many do 
we find that want of good training which results 
in so-called “spoiled children”! The very

phrase implies an unfulfilled capacity of excellence. 
For all the virtues of childhood, these children 
exhibit the contraries ; in the place of intelligent 
activity, indifference and idleness; of obedience 
and self-control, angry self-assertion and wilful- 
ness ; of loving confidence, irreverent curiosity ; of 
serenity, fretful impatience. These manifestations 
are not the growth of aday. They are the result 
of management uninspired by a guiding prin- 
ciple, of management in which ¢vazwzng has no 
place. 
Yet few fathers and mothers experience the 
first joy of parentage without feeling also some- 
thing of the solemn responsibility it includes. 
What mother folding her arms around her new- 
born infant can wish less than that it should 
become “as much as possible an instrument of 
happiness to himself, and next, to other beings” ? 
What father appreciating the mute contrast of 
his baby’s tender helplessness and his own mature 
strength, can do less than resolve that the silent 
appeal for protection and guidance shall be faith- 
fully met ? But such germs of parental duty do 
not include a definite ideal of education, nor do 
they point out how educational ends are to be 
attained by educational means. “It is a truth 
yet remaining to be recognized,” says Mr. Herbert 
Spencer in his “ Education,” “that the last stage of
-P-A-G-E-7
  Lutrvoductory. 9, 
mental development of each man and woman is 
to be reached only through a proper discharge of 
the parental duties.” And as the present race of 
parents has not found the Art of Education in their 
curriculum of studies, as Mr. Spencer hopes future 
generations will do, they are left to deal with the 
problem of infant life, freshly given for their in- 
dividual study and solution, without preparation, 
and often indeed without the idea that preparation 
is necessary. 
For the average parents the great educational 
thinkers seem to have existed in vain: the wisdom 
of Plato, with its perennial freshness and beauty, 
the noble ideal of Milton, the excellent sense of 
Locke, the originality of Rousseau, the loving 
insight of Pestalozzi, the abundant thought and 
suggestiveness of modern writers on education, 
are guiding lights which exist not for them. They 
are at no trouble to settle which definition of 
education is most satisfactory to them, they are 
not oppressed by the importance of the subject 
with which they have to deal. The child belongs 
to them; its relations to society and humanity 
do not come within the scope of their thought. 
They gather up, in some sort of fashion, the cur- 
rent ideas of their time with regard to the bringing 
up of children, and they act upon these. If they 
are well-to-do, a conventional care and treatment
-P-A-G-E-8

is demanded of them : “experienced nurses” are 
the first necessity; but as a rule they are not 
engaged like other functionaries, because they are 
specially qualified to handle the material entrusted 
to them. Grooms and gardeners are supposed to 
know something about the nature of the horses, 
or the conditions of plant life, with which they 
have to deal: valuable property might be injured 
by their ignorance or want of skill. Children 
alas! demand, as most parents think, no special 
understanding or management. It is not recog- 
nized that their sensitive and tender natures 
require to be dealt with by persons qualified by 
temperament and instruction; so that nurses as 
a class, though they may have some small know- 
ledge of the physical bringing up of children, are 
wholly unfit to deal with the complex life given into 
their charge. They are even too blind and ignorant 
to be aware of the difficulties of their task. They 
govern by rule of thumb, kindly if they are kindly 
women, harshly and oppressively if they are the 
reverse; their nursery management consists 
mainly in repressing activity, levelling individuality, 
obtaining obedience at any cost when possible, 
and fostering vanity and emulation. Ordinary 
nursery life is a tissue of dreariness, ennui, and 
repression. 
The life of the schoolroom, which succeeds
-P-A-G-E-9
  
Introductory. 9 
that of the nursery, is after the same pattern. A 
governess is engaged to teach probably two 
languages besides her own, music, arithmetic, 
history, and every other subject needed for the 
curriculum of schools. In her there will probably 
be more ability to treat the children, but she will 
doubtless share the educational perplexity of the 
parents, and it will soon be found that the boys 
of the family are “beyond the management of 
women,” and must be sent to school ; while the girls 
are left to submit to or to rebel against, the rule of 
the schoolroom, as the case may be, and to pick » 
up what knowledge is possible under such imper- 
fect provision of instruction. And the same want 
of guiding principles of action is shown in the 
choice of schools. How few parents carefully 
inquire into the government and methods pursued 
at any school they select; how few consider in 
what. way the ends of parental care will be 
furthered by school-life ; how few choose this or 
that particular school for reasons of a vead educa- 
tional value! 
In families where there is less material wealth 
and an equal ignorance of practical education, 
some of these evils are intensified: the nurses are 
of a commoner type, the governess less capable, 
the schools of a presumably lower class. On the 
other hand, where the scale of wealth is still 
 
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 Notes on the Early Training of Children, 
lower, the children get the advantages, such as 
they are, of State education joined to a closer 
family life, and also the training in usefulness, 
intelligence, and self-dependence often to be found 
where every member of the household is expected 
to contribute to the common good. 
But in all classes we find a fatal want of 
educational ideals, with an equally fatal powerless- 
ness of adapting educational means to ends. A 
definite aim, however, a clear knowledge of what 
is desirable to attain in the training of children is 
essential ; for their education must be accomplished 
in the life of minutes and hours, in infinite small 
degrees; and the great division of the work 
makes it difficult to keep the goal of the 
labour always in view, and to see how each part 
will tell on the whole’ The author of “ Natural 
Religion” forcibly states this first need in rational 
and successful education :— 
“Look, then, how the English people treat 
their children. Try to discover, from the way 
they train them, from the education they give 
them, what they wish them to be. They have 
ceased, almost consciously ceased, to have any 
ideal at all. Traces may still be observed of an 
old ideal not quite forgotten: here and there a 
vague notion of instilling hardihood, a really 
decided wish to teach frankness and honesty, and
-P-A-G-E-11
  Lntroductory. Il 
in a large class, also good manners; but these 
are, after all, only negative virtues. What 
do they wish their children to aim at? What 
pursuits do they desire for them? Except that, 
when they grow up, they are to make or have 
a livelihood, and take a satisfactory position in 
society, and, in the meanwhile, that it would be 
hard for them not to enjoy themselves heartily, 
most parents would be puzzled to say what they 
wish for their children ; and, whatever they wish, 
they wish so languidly, that they entrust the 
realization of it almost entirely to strangers, being 
themselves, so they say—and, indeed the Philis- 
tine or irreligious person always is—much engaged. 
The parent, from sheer embarrassment and want 
of an ideal, has in a manner abdicated, and it has 
become necessary to set apart a special class for 
the cultivation of parental feelings and duties. 
The modern schoolmaster should change his 
name, for he has become a kind of standing or 
professional parent.” 
But no schoolmaster, however wise, can supply 
the omission of early parental care, which must 
begin at least with the life of the child in the 
cradle. It is true I have known enlightened 
people who rated so highly the special gifts needed 
in the early training of children that they were 
sceptical of finding them in ordinary families, and
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
advocated children being sent from home (I do 
not know at what age) to the care of those who 
possessed these peculiar qualifications for training ; 
but in modern life, where numbers of homeless 
little ones have been collected together, it has 
been found that the best way of training them even 
into useful human beings, has been to put them 
into small groups under the guardianship of a 
factitious mother or father, and thus imitate in 
some sort the essential features of family life. 
As far as we can see there is, and should be, no 
escape from the sacred obligations of parental 
duty. We must look to parents and to none else 
for radical improvements in the early training of 
children : we can appeal to none, if not to them, 
for a truer justice towards those who are involun- 
tarily dependent on them; and we must trust that 
with a finer conception of their duty to offspring 
they will see a first obligation in preparing them- 
selves for the duties of parents. 
In the following “ Notes” I address myself 
with some confidence, though with due humility, to 
parents. I believe so much in both the nobility 
and the difficulty of their duties to their children, 
that I think they will be willing to weigh the 
results arrived at through the experience of 
another educator, that they will receive with 
some interest her views concerning the aims to be
-P-A-G-E-13
  Introductory. 13 
striven for in the daily education of children, and 
will consider with some attention the methods 
she suggests for obtaining certain desirable 
results. Both the ideals I would present to my 
readers, and the methods I urge should be 
employed to attain them, will best be seen in deal- 
ing with the several divisions of my subject. I 
will only put in condensed form here what I shall 
try to elaborate in every one of the following 
pages. 
The main point is to perceive clearly the 
ideal to be striven for. It can never be satis- 
factory in education to aim at less than the 
highest; the child given to us to deal with 
may have within him (I use the masculine 
form throughout as inclusive of both sexes) all 
the capacity of excellence to be found in the 
best of the race: educate him at least as if he 
had. Do not begin with limitations, they will 
force themselves upon us soon enough. That 
must always be a poor ideal that reaches no 
farther than a repetition of ourselves, or narrows 
the ambition of the educator to fitting the child 
for some small niche in the industrial world. We 
have to educate, as far as is permitted us, a 
perfect man or woman, nothing lower or smaller ; 
and in proportion to the faithfulness with which 
we keep this standard in view will be our measure 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
14 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
of success. In pursuance of this standard, we 
must do our best to secure to our child health 
and full physical development, that the body may 
be as far as possible a perfect instrument of the 
mind. We must train the senses to be acute and 
accurate, the intellect to be keen and clear and 
strong, disciplined to the power of concentrated 
attention and the love of work: we must make 
the moral nature courageous, truthful, loving, and 
unselfish ; we must foster those spiritual qualities 
which link ordinary daily life with what is per- 
manent and eternal. Our task is, to train for life, 
for useful, honourable life, worthy in being and in 
doing, begun in mortality but to reach, we hope, 
beyond and above it.

Screntiric and unscientific opinion agree that

birth, I do not know how far physiologists 
believe it will ever be possible to control. and 
direct these influences; but it seems probable 
that, with the advance of knowledge and reflection 
in this regard, men and women will be more 
impelled by latent physiological convictions, and 
consequent instincts, into unions good for the 
possible offspring of their marriage. We see 
these instincts now operating against glaring 
physiological unsuitability, such as hereditary 
madness ; and it is scarcely too much to hope 
that sooner or later secondary influences which 
now determine marriages will be repudiated, and 
unions made which satisfy the whole natures of 
the men and women who contract them; unions 
in which “ falling in love” shall be evidence that

while the senses and the fancy are pleased, the 
intellectual and moral aspirations of both are 
satisfied, and the sanctification of noble passion 
follows the mutual attraction of each and every 
part of the two natures. 
It may be that the most powerful influences 
affecting the unborn child will always continue to 
be the fitness of the parents for union, the strength 
of their love, and their desire for offspring. In 
the present state of opinion, when these influen- 
ces are scarcely recognized, others which are ac- 
knowledged are not strongly enforced. Expectant 
mothers are enjoined to live hygienic lives for 
the sake of the coming child; but they are 
not educated to think it right or expedient to 
alter the tenour of their lives in more important 
particulars for its sake. Yet I think weighty 
reasons might be advanced to show that the life 
of the expectant mother should be filled and 
governed by a sense of responsibility to the child; 
and that not only should she avoid whatever is 
injurious to her physical health, but, regarding 
herself as the appointed medium of influence to 
her babe, should actively guard her own mental 
and spiritual health, “ possess her soul in patience,” 
and, serenely receptive, keep herself sensitive to all 
ennobling influences. It has been divinely ordered 
that the mother shall wait many months for her
-P-A-G-E-17

child. This time is obviously meant to be one 
of preparation in several directions. We think 
even a poor mother strangely careless if she does 
not then provide shelter and clothes. But how 
more than equally necessary is it that she should, in 
addition to material comforts, prepare herself to re- 
ceive the coming gift! If the loveliness and holiness 
of such gifts were not obscured to ordinary vision 
by their commonness, could parents ever receive 
them without befitting humility and reverence ? 
Training, defined to be “directed growth,” 
begins with the birth of the child. It is im- 
mediately sensitive to impressions of outward 
things; these cause it pain or pleasure, and it 
manifests its resistance to the one and its desire 
for the other. It feels hunger, and the shock of 
cold air, and it cries; it is soothed by food and 
warmth, it is quiet and sleeps. It very soon shows 
a sense of its own helplessness and need of human 
protection and sympathy; and this need should 
not be disregarded. I know that some good 
nurses point with triumph to infants “who give 
no trouble,” who will allow themselves to be laid 
in their cradles, and fall asleep, who are “spoiled” 
by no rocking or over-much dandling. But I 
maintain that the traditional lullaby is the natural 
satisfaction of a natural craving, and cannot be 
abandoned without proportionate harm. Love is

essential to an infant’s well-being ;——“a babe is 
fed with milk and praise,” tender Charles Lamb 
reminds us,—and the mother naturally manifests 
hers in brooding over it, in giving up time to it, 
in rocking, and moving, and soothing her child 
in many manifold ways; and if “beauty born of 
murmuring sound shall pass into” its “ face,” 
how much more subtly shall love pass into the 
spiritual seedling, and nurture it into ampler life ? 
Again, we are often told that crying is good for 
the child; but we have to remember that crying is 
its protest against pain, in a greater or less degree, 
and this warning cannot be neglected with impunity. 
We may take it as an axiom, that the healthier 
and the better managed the babe is, the less it 
will cry. I do not pretend to give here directions 
for the physical care of infants; these can be 
found in many good treatises devoted exclusively 
to the subject ; I wish only to touch upon one or 
two points where the physical management of the 
infant involves its moral training, and I regard 
the avoidance of crying as a very important step 
in the latter. The baby should have its wants 
anticipated, to prevent its crying to express 
them, and attention should be given to it quietly, 
promptly, lovingly ; it should never be needlessly 
thwarted in its desires, never made passionate 
by inattention or resistance; it should be kept
-P-A-G-E-19
_Lnfant Life. 19 
serene and happy, and this care should extend to 
every moment of an infant’s day. With a recur- 
rence of actions at stated times, habits are formed, 
and the child will soon fall into sleeping and 
taking its food at regular intervals. These should 
be carefully, though not too rigorously, observed. 
I have known conscientious mothers prefer to let 
infantscry with hunger, rather than feed them before + 
the allotted time; but it is reasonable to believe that 
the physical wants of even new-born infants may 
be subject to some variation, and the sympathy of. 
the mother will lead her to study and gradually 
interpret the baby’s desires. This subtle guide— 
sympathy—is first awakened by very simple needs. 
The mother’s first lessons are comparatively easy ; 
accepting them, she will find they increase in 
cong with the growing life of the child; and 
thencéforth, while education goes on, a watchful 
study of the nature before her will be required of 
her, until, helped by her own wonderful affinity 
to it, she learns to put herself in imagination into 
the place of the child, and to understand what it 
feels and needs. 
It is difficult to say how soon a baby may cry out 
of wilfulness, for ends beyond the imperative satis- — 
faction of its wants; the needs of hunger, cold, sleep, 
change of position, the necessity of movement. 
I am inclined to believe that Rousseau, with
-P-A-G-E-20
  20 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
subtle perception, has touched upon a truth, when 
he says that the baby, while experimenting on its 
surroundings, tries to discover, amongst other ex- 
periments, how far the power of its own person- 
ality can reach, how much it can obtain “de 
Yempire, et de la domination.” Very soon, I 
am sure, the mother has-to make it feel that she 
herself follows a higher law than her own will; 
that she seeks the baby’s welfare, body and soul, 
and, having found the path to it, she cannot yield 
to influences which would lead her to disobey this 
direction. I believe this to be a fundamental 
principle of influence. The child soon recognizes 
that its mother is swayed by no, variable mood, 
by no self-will, anger, or impatience, but by a 
steadfast love and devotion to duty; and this 
becomes in time to z¢ a guiding force. 
Thus the training begun even in the first month \ 
of its existence, continues as its life unfolds into a 
larger consciousness of the external world around 
it; its senses become alive to more numerous and 
to different impressions; it suns itself in the love 
shown it, and soon answers the smile upon its 
mother’s face ; its education is fairly begun. 
And now, following the example of the gar- 
dener who places the plants committed to his 
care in the situation and soil which suits them, we 
have to arrange that our human nursling shall rd
-P-A-G-E-21

have the best conditions for growth that we have 
power to command or to mould. And the first of 
those conditions must be the continued personal 
care of the mother for the child. It seems 
strange that there should be any need for dwell- 
ing upon such an apparently obvious duty ; and 
yet, as Rousseau insisted upon the obligation of 
French mothers to nurse and tend their infants at 
the latter part of the last century, so at the end 
of this, it is necessary to protest against those 
customs, those claims of “society,” which make 
many mothers give over entirely to others the 
personal care of their children. I know many 
young mothers will say, “I know nothing about 
babies ; I should be afraid of the responsibility 
you say I ought to take ;” or, “If I turn nurse, I 
should destroy my husband’s life, and my own 
too.” I maintain, nevertheless, that the first 
duty laid upon mothers is to make themselves 
fit for their responsibility. Young mothers natu- 
rally must always lack experience; but thought 
and thoughtful observation, guided by a conscien- 
tious devotion, will go far in this, as in all other 
human obligations, to make up for actual expe- 
rience, and the life of every day removes the 
want little by little. Then, as to the second pro- 
test, I take it as theoretically acknowledged that 
both parents have joint responsibility in the edu-
-P-A-G-E-22
  22 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
cation of the child; and that though the mother 
is pre-eminently fitted for the chief care of the 
offspring, the best powers of both minds will be 
needed for the gradual and complete develop- 
ment of the young creature. In proportion as 
this is granted, the father will be prepared to 
make some sacrifice of time and comfort for the 
sake of his child, and the mother, as guardian of 
the household comfort and happiness, will do her 
best to harmonize, when her babe is born, the 
new and old duties. Her husband’s brain is 
active and hard-worked ; she must take care it is 
not worried by a baby’s crying, or incessant need 
of attention. The man’s evenings are his time 
for rest and recreation; however devoted to the 
baby both may be, she must ensure that his 
quiet reading or music is left undisturbed. It is 
one of the hardest yet most necessary duties of 
a woman's life to carry on with attention, har- 
mony, and serenity the several parallel threads of 
her household life ; every one demands her con- 
stant care, the relation between every one must 
be kept, and she must be strong enough to fulfil 
hourly, even momentarily, claims upon her intel- 
lect, heart, and patience. 
.I do not propose, however, that the mother 
should have no assistance in the care of her child, 
but I do urge that the assistance she chooses
-P-A-G-E-23
  Infant Life. 23 
shall be entirely subordinate to her. She must 
never give up to any one the personal oversight 
of all that concerns it. Whatever assistant she 
selects should be primarily healthy, and equable 
and gentle in temper, child-loving and capable of 
devotion, truthful, refined, and intelligent in com- 
prthending and obeying the spirit as well as the 
letter of directions. I know young women pos- 
sessing such qualities are difficult to get, but they 
are to be found; and when such a nurse is met 
with, the mother should treat her with a consi- 
deration and kindness which will render her life 
contented and happy. She must remember that 
even the subordinate care of the best child is a 
strain upon the powers of mind and body alike, 
and that the more devoted and excellent the care, 
the greater is the need of change and recreation, 
Locke wisely says, “ Children should, from their 
first beginning to talk, have some discreet, sober, 
nay, wise person about them, whose care it should 
be to fashion them aright and keep them from 
all ill, especially the infection of bad company. 
I think this province requires great sobriéty, 
temperance, tenderness, diligence, and discretion, 
qualities hardly to be had for ordinary salaries, 
nor easily to be found anywhere. As for the 
charge of it, I think it will be the money best laid 
out that can be about our children; spare it in 
XN

24 i Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
toys, in silk, and ribbons, laces, and other useless 
expenses, as much as you please.” 
Having secured the right kind of help, the 
mother should arrange that the room, or rooms, 
set apart for the child’s special use should be as 
near, instead of as far removed from her own 
as possible; indeed, that with due regard to 
other claims, it shall live, as we have said, with 
her, and that her eyes, ears, and_ intelligence 
should take cognizance of all details of its food, 
exercise, and rest, so that the routine she sets 
about it may be subject to the immediate modifi- 
cation or re-adjustment of her informed judg- 
ment. The wind is cold, or in the east, and the 
infant must be taken out of doors where it will 
have shelter; the heat is great, and customary 
clothing must be exchanged for cooler ; its appe- 
tite flags, or its sleep is less quiet than usual, and 
the mother should be instantly roused to the im- 
portance of increased watchfulness. No detail in 
baby life is too trivial for such daily observation. 
It is needless to say that the nursery of a child 
must be in harmony with the means and style 
of living of its parents; but assuming this, the 
child’s room should be arranged after an ideal of 
simple beauty. The room should be carefully 
selected for its cheerfulness and sunniness; a 
south aspect is above all others desirable. The
-P-A-G-E-25
  
Lnfant Life. 25 
walls should be covered with soft, delicate colour, 
or a paper of good design above a serviceable 
dado of wood. Walter Crane’s paper of the 
Sleeping Princess is, I think, quite a model for 
a nursery paper. The sleeping beauty discerned 
by careful looking, in her screen of leaves, with 
her attendants, and pet dog in deep repose, 
awaiting the fresh stir of life typified in the prince 
who is parting the concealing branches of her 
bower, sometimes hidden, sometimes revealed, 
must offer to a child endless occupation and 
delight. In some of the illustrations of children’s 
books, designed by Walter Crane and others, 
there are charming suggestions of what an ideal 
child’s room should be. A seat in the window, a 
low cupboard to which children can have access 
for their own possessions, may be surrounded 
with associations of delight which last a lifetime. 
When carpets of excellent colour and design are 
easily procurable, there can be little excuse for 
putting in the child’s room a gaudy old-fashioned 
covering. The present fashion of putting a car- 
pet in the middle of the room with some border 
round it, should remain permanent for a nursery, 
as it renders extreme cleanliness and nicety easy. 
But if the border be of stained or polished wood, 
it should not be wide, as children are apt to slip 
on such margins, and may strain themselves,

Indian matting might be used if the wood were 
discarded. Before the carefully guarded fire a 
soft rug should be placed, an emblem of comfort 
for the little one. Another rug of soft material 
that can be easily cleaned should be at hand for 
the child to crawl on, and lie on with a cushion. 
Besides the toys and occupations of the child, 
the other furniture should be chosen with regard 
alone to the needs and happiness of the child ; , 
as much space as possible should be kept, and 
nothing put into the room which the child may 
not handle or touch. Ugly forms in furniture, 
sharp corners and edges, against which the tod- 
dling infant may fall, should be absolutely 
avoided. The coal-box should be kept out of 
the room, while tables made to the height of tiny 
sitters (such as are used in Kindergartens), and 
chairs to match wth backs, and presently modern 
school desks, adapted to the age of the child, 
should be found in all good nurseries. Pictures, 
or good photographs or engravings, should hang 
on the walls : some of birds and animals, which 
the child can soon understand, and some, I ven- 
ture to suggest, above its quick comprehension, a 
fine face, some early Italian Madonna, a copy of 
Holman Hunt's “ Christ in the Temple,” or a bit 
of some Greek frieze, about which the child’s 
thought will gradually twine,
-P-A-G-E-27
  
Infant Life. 27 
In arranging in every direction for the right 
training of the child, it is important that all the 
servants of the household should be persons 
capable, at least, of respecting the educational. 
ideas of the parents, and incapable therefore of 
falsehood or passion towards it, or of rousing its 
fear. The child should see nothing but goodness 
and kindness around it. Ruskin has said lately : 
“ All education to beauty is, first, in the beauty of 
gentle human faces round a child; secondly, in 
the fields, fields meaning grass, water, beasts, 
flowers, sky ; without these no man can be edu- 
cated humanly. If the child has other things 
right round it, and given to it—its garden, its cat, 
and its window to the skies and stars—in time 
pictures of flowers, and beasts, and things, in 
Heaven and heavenly earth, may be useful to it. 
But see first that its realities are heavenly.” 
And in pursuance of this fine teaching, let us 
be careful by all manner of means not to trammel 
the child with our merely conventional modes of 
thought. It is perhaps too much to expect that we 
can preserve the balance of its judgment wholly free 
until the intellect acquires force to judge justly, but 
it should be our endeavour not to impose on it our 
prejudices, our conventional customs, our class 
distinctions ; we shall do it a serious injury if we 
destroy its freedom from bias, its lowliness of heart.

CHAPTER IIL 
NURSERY MANAGEMENT, 
“The most important part of education is right training 
in the nursery.” : , 
Plates Laws, Book I. ( Jowett). 
One of the first conditions of good nursery man- 
agement is to make the child’s routine of duty 
pleasant to him. Abundant opportunities will 
occur later on, to test and strengthen his virtue ; 
at first establish a habit of goodness. Take care 
that the child wakes to a cheerful day; do not 
rouse him brusquely, let him finish out his sleep, 
speak to him on waking cheerily, associate your 
coming with pleasant words and tones, remember 
how soon may be struck the key-note to a Rosa- 
mund’s “ Day of Misfortunes.” Have the bath 
and dressing things ready in orderly fashion ; un- 
readiness in these small things is certainly bad 
for him morally as well as physically. Let all 
your movements and your handling be gentle and 
caressing. A child has a right to use even pas- 
sionate remonstrance if soap is smeared into his 
eyes, or his skin is left half wet, or is rasped with 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
  Nursery Management. 29 
a hard towel, and if his hair is combed roughly ; 
such treatment would try the patience of an adult, 
and is quite enough to fill a child’s morning with 
a vague sense of trouble. 
With our endeavour to make the small duties 
of the day pleasant to the child, we must simul- 
taneously create a sense of their znevitadleness. 
There should be no question as to the necessity 
of those things we consider good for him. We 
must have a clear idea what this is, and this should 
be carried out without debate, unless,exceptional 
circumstances, such as illness, come to disturb 
the daily routine. In some households every 
action of the child is allowed to raise discussion : 
“Oh, must I go out ?” “Must I wash my hands ?” 
“T don’t like my hair brushed.” “I don’t want 
to go to bed.” A gentle, loving firmness in such 
matters will soon make the youngést child accept 
the routine we mark out for it as a matter of 
course, and there will be no crying or discontented 
remonstrance about each act. If there is, we 
may be sure, in the case of a well-trained child, 
there is something wrong with its physical health, 
which should be investigated and set right before 
the routine of its life in ordinary health is resumed ; 
for there is nothing to which human nature either 
in young or old more cheerfully submits than the 
inevitable.
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 Wotes on the Early Training of Children. 
I cannot insist too strongly upon the necessity 
of refinement in all dealings with the child. Even 
refined mothers and good nurses are too prone to 
disregard the personal reserve which is usually 
strong in the children of educated parents. This 
feeling, on the contrary, should be carefully 
cherished, and trained to control the expression 
and gestures of the little child. I am far, how- 
ever, from wishing to make it prudish; we need 
not lead it to think the beauty of its little body 
something disgraceful, because it is the custom in 
civilized communities to wear clothes; But it is right 
for the adults surrounding it, and for the little one 
itself, that it’ should be trained in all ways of per- 
sonal decorum and perfect modesty. The same 
refined watchfulness should be exercised over the 
child’s eating. When it begins to take food, it 
should be taught to wait patiently for its bread 
and milk to get cool; it should expect it by slow 
mouthfuls, and pause between them. All eager- 
ness and greediness should be checked by the 
mother, who sees that the little one has the food 
proper for it, nicely prepared, while gentle words 
present pleasant images to its mind. The best 
lesson in manners is to banish all nursery meals 
as soon as possible. As soon as the child can sit 
up to the table of its parents in its high chair, it 
should take its food with them, become accus-
-P-A-G-E-31
  Nursery Management. 31 
tomed to see delicacies it is not to have, or even 
ask for, and behave with the refined quietness 
and reserve of those about it. It is true, the 
mother will be more taxed by the presence of her 
child at meals, for she cannot relax her watchful- 
ness while it is very young. I have seen mothers, 
at table with their children, attending to every- 
thing but them, and the little ones behaving in con- 
sequence more like a set of young puppies than 
children of decent parents. The mother has to 
contrive to carry on many threads of life together, 
but the consequent strain will be repaid in this 
direction by the good manners of her children. 
There are few things more degrading to the 
moral nature than fear, “the expectation of 
pain.” Healthy being is impossible under its in- 
fluence, and one of our earliest cares must be to 
prevent its even entering the atmosphere of a 
child’s life. Timidity and courage are alike easily 
developed, and it is the business of parents to 
foster the latter while avoiding in every way to 
call the former into growth. Itis perhaps not too 
much to say, that upon the impressions and influ- 
ences of the first seven years of our life depends 
our possession of the virtue of courage, or our 
servitude to the demon of fear. 
Man, both in his early and later years, has a 
dread of the unknown; to an infant everything Law

32 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
is unknown, and it behoves its parents to watch 
that no new experience should come to it with 
fear. A sudden sense of helplessness in solitude 
may be dangerously terrifying to a baby. The 
dark is terrible, unless always associated with a 
sense of security and the mother’s encircling arms. 
Children should never be put to sleep in a room 
without some shaded light, and the nurse within 
hearing of the slightest noise. If not thus quickly 
reassured on waking by light and attendance, they 
may suffer agonies of fear long before they can 
explain what they are feeling. No children, how- 
ever young, should ever hear disagreeable or 
frightening things said in their presence. Ghost 
and goblin stories, murders or terrible descriptions 
of every kind, such as those in “ Blue Beard” and 
the “Forty Thieves,” ugly, uncanny, mysterious, 
or painful pictures, everything capable of exciting 
fear, must be avoided by the entire household. 
An imaginative child will contrive to build an 
image of dread on the smallest mysterious sug- 
gestion, which may haunt him for years. I have 
known a very young child lie awake night after 
night in agony after hearing two nurse-maids 
speak of a murder ; the same child had a terror 
she never forgot from a ghost story told her by 
an indiscreet governess. Cases of other children 
are known to me, who, after having been kepe
-P-A-G-E-33
  Nursery Management. SU38) 
from all fear in their own home, heard ghost 
stories told, for the first time, while visiting, and 
grew to dread, all through the day, the approach 
of bed-time, and the dark lonely bedroom in which 
they lay awake. Many people who look back to 
similar experiences in their childhood, hold that 
some such “hardening” process is inevitable and 
salutary. The battle between unreaSoning instinc- 
tive fear and reasonable courage must indeed 
come in every young life; but we should strive 
that it should come when the faculty of reason and 
the virtue of courage are cultivated into strength, 
not when, as in early childhood, the instincts are 
uncontrolled by any higher faculty, and unchecked 
by any experience of fact. 
Equally vicious but more visible in result, is the 
influence of fear inspired by threatened punish- 
ments, cross words, and angry gestures. We all 
unhappily know the leaden look, the timid eyes, 
of children subject to these evils. I have known 
a sensitive child dread scolding and impatient 
tones, even when not addressed to herself, with a 
shrinking which almost made her a coward for 
life. But the question of the punishment of 
children has not its place here; for the moment 
we have not to deal with faults already engendered, 
and in need of correction, but with the training 
of the first blameless years of infancy; and in this 
c

34 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
training the perpetual sunshine of the moral 
atmosphere, the light and warmth of tenderness 
and love, is of all things first needful. 
I have said that a child should be kept in 
ignorance of fear until it is old enough to learn 
to be brave; but the experience and the lesson in 
courage may come unawares with some of the 
first impressions of the external world. I saw the 
other day a baby of ten months old touch with 
her tiny finger some fur on a dress. It was a 
new sensation to her, and she shrank from it with 
a comical horror, rubbing her little hand on her 
‘dress as though to get rid of some visible im- 
purity. But the habit of examining new things was 
strong in her, and she presently touched the fur 
again and again, at first with a recurrence of her 
horror, then with diminishing dislike. The un- 
known became familiar to her, and gradually she 
came to touch the passive “ pussy” with almost 
liking. The same child learnt to stroke a gentle 
spaniel with complacency and love. 
Patient exdurance should be trained in the 
youngest children by encouraging them to bear 
pain well and bravely. If the infant tumbles 
down, or knocks itself against a sharp edge, 
sympathize with it, distract its attention, but do 
not make a fuss over it, do not let the child 
exaggerate its pain, A few encouraging words, a
-P-A-G-E-35
  Nursery Management. 35 
kiss, will make it proud to bear its trial bravely ; 
and with the approval of its parents it will grow 
even Spartan in its power of endurance. I have 
known little children beg for the fearful pleasure 
of being put on the narrow wainscot ledge of the 
room, to learn to balance themselves, their father 
standing near to catch them in his arms when 
the balance could no longer be kept. It is im- 
portant in this, as in all training, that children 
should see the example of courage around them. 
If their mother bears illness, and their father sharp 
pain, without a murmur, they will feel a respect 
for endurance which will lead them to imitate it. 
I have known children sustained by such courage, 
who, in times of childish illness, took medicine 
without a word of protest, and wrung their mother’s 
heart, while they rejoiced it, by the perfect patience 
and self-containment with which they endured 
pain and restlessness. Stories of heroism touch 
the imagination of children, and awaken in them 
a desire to make experiments in their own courage; 
and these experiments form a tradition from which 
a brave child will be ashamed to turn. A little 
girl, upon hearing some tales of the voluntary 
endurance of pain by some Huguenot ancestors, 
emulated their example by dropping lighted 
sealing-wax upon her own hand behind a screen 
which hid all but her face from her sisters. She 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
36 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
succeeded in showing that she could bear pain 
without the least sign of betrayal, and she carries 
the scar to this day. Another little girl of six 
was watching a swarm of bees by the side of her 
father. A bee flew round and round her, and at 
last settled on her face. “Be quiet, H.,” her 
father said, “don’t stir, and then it won’t hurt 
you.” So she remained perfectly still for some 
seconds until the bee flew away, remarking, “that 
if she were so quiet the bee would think she was 
a post.” I remember an old gentleman who had 
come of a race of courageous ancestors, telling 
me, that the one fear of his boyhood was the mill- 
stream that ran near his father’s house. He 
longed to plunge into it, as into other streams, 
but his dread of it withheld him. At last, 
ashamed of his fear, he determined to conquer it 
once for all, and one cold morning, when the light 
was just coming, he got up from his bed, ran 
hastily to the stream, and plunged in; he no 
longer acknowledged a fear. It was consistent 
with this act of bravery, that the after-life of this 
boy was remarkable for its moral courage. 
I now come to the consideration of one of the 
fundamental conditions of nursery, as well as of all 
other management—the requiring and giving of 
obedience. One often hears great lamentations over 
the difficulty of getting obedience from children.
-P-A-G-E-37
  
Nursery Management. 37 
A mother will say, without.apparent shame, “ Oh! 
I can’t manage him, he is beyond me!” or one 
hears a child flatly refusing to go to bed, and 
carried screaming and kicking upstairs. I am 
strongly tempted to say that obedience will always 
be given to those worthy of exacting it; or rather, 
that it is given to reasonable claims enforced in a 
right way. Parents must take care that they are 
fit to rule, that their government is good for the 
child, good for the home; their personal influence 
should then be strong enough to obtain what 
they wish with their children. They must not 
be despots, demanding acquiescence in arbitrary 
decrees made for their pleasure merely ; the child 
must feel that every wish of his parents is in 
harmony with their consistent and never-failing 
endeavour to secure his welfare. I think even 
an infant feels this, and that its mother, in grant- 
ing or denying it the gratification it cries for, is 
acting in obedience to a higher law than caprice. 
Any infringement of this law is soon understood 
to be not a matter of question, it is impossible. 
But a mother may sympathize with the pain her 
denial causes, and she should soften the refusal 
by her loving words and gentle manner. Thus 
the child grows to recognize, day by day, the law 
by which she and he are governed, and the habit 
of obedience is begun. 
L 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
38 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
We still unhappily hear of “ breaking” a child’s 
will, but I hope the expression is only used by 
very narrow or very ignorant persons. For it is 
to the will, the outcome, the energy of the whole 
nature, that we must look for all that is strong 
and valuable in the future life of the young crea- 
ture; it is criminal to speak lightly of “breaking ” 
such a force. What we have to do with it in 
early training is to direct it to desire what it ought 
to desire, to strengthen, and to develop it. Let 
us consider the way of doing this in very young 
children. Take a time when the mother and the 
child wish different things, say the hour for going 
out, and he is intent in watching the kitten, or 
is interested with a new toy; he objects to be 
dressed for his walk. Do not hastily snatch away 
the plaything, or disturb his rapt attention; turn 
his thoughts to something different, something 
which interests him in another direction, speak 
gently in an animated, loving way, remind him 
of the pleasures he will find in his walk ; and the 
proof of your management being wise will be in 
the child’s will acting with yours. Again, if a 
child in the drawing-room discovers an attractive 
employment in pulling threads off a fringe, or 
‘tries to draw towards him some bright china on a 
shelf or low table, do not hastily take him up, and 
put him down at the other end of the room, call- 
 
-P-A-G-E-39
  Nursery Management. 39 
ing him naughty and “tiresome.” Do not put 
physical obstacles of any kind in the way of 
his returning to his destructive amusement ; but 
gently shake your head, and say, “No, no!” And 
immediately give him his own toys to occupy him. 
Have blocks at hand, or let him play with a paper- 
knife, or something new to him which he can- 
not hurt; make, in short, his obedience to your 
rule pleasant and unconscious, and you will be 
strengthening a habit which will assert its power 
when obedience cannot be made agreeable. 
If you do not succeed in dealing with the 
child’s wilfulness at any one time, do not be afraid 
to acknowledge you were less wise than the 
occasion demanded; another time you will do 
better. Training children is so great an art, that 
with every desire and effort to get proficient in 
it, some mistakes are almost unavoidable, and 
you must not be unduly discouraged by them. I 
repeat—make the daily routine of the child’s life 
pleasant to him, its duties inevitable, and you 
will find obedience will follow your just demand 
of it. 
With children whose training has not begun in 
the cradle, respect certain considerations in the 
exaction of obedience. Do not make a multitude 
of laws. With children, as with adults, legis- 
lation, unless absolutely necessary, is pernicious.
-P-A-G-E-40
  
40 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
Do not command what you have not the power 
to enforce: in a struggle of wills the adult is 
always liable to defeat. A child, as the weaker, 
can certainly be turned out of a room, or locked 
into a closet, but you cannot control its muscles 
or its inclinations by force; unless you can touch 
the motive power within it you are actually 
powerless. Almost before it can understand the 
full force of what you say, explain to the child 
the reason of the obedience you claim. The 
youngest healthy child is a reasoning creature, 
and if he sees why a thing is or is not to be 
done, his obedience will not only be more readily 
given, but he will gradually gather the faith that 
those about him are guided in their claims upon 
him by a loving desire for his welfare. In saying 
this I do not forget that the finest obedience is 
given in faith, supported only by the authority 
claiming it; but the reason is a valuable aid 
in training towards the unreasoning, soldier-like 
form of the virtue. Do not ask of a child tasks 
beyond his strength. Remember his weakness, 
and that every power and virtue in him is neces- 
sarily feeble : if you do not apportion his trial to 
his powers, active or passive, you deserve defeat, 
and run the risk of injuring the growing goodness 
of the little one. When it is hard for him to 
give up his will to yours, encourage him by your
-P-A-G-E-41
  
Nursery Management. 41 
loving approbation ; let him feel the sunlight of 
your love in his struggle to do right. 
There is another, and too much neglected, in- 
fluence in the management of children which 
we should not fail to exercise—keeping faith with 
them. They ought to be able to have entire re- 
liance upon our word. I need scarcely say there- 
fore, it is eminently necessary we should promise 
nothing rashly, either of good or evil. We hear 
a child confide to his companion, “ Mamma said 
she'd punish me if I slid down those banisters, 
but I’m sure she won't, you know.” Or, to 
encourage a child’s effort at self-government in 
some direction, the mother promises to carry him 
up to bed; and we hear, “ Mother promised to 
carry me up to bed her own self, but she has 
forgotten and gone out!” Adults are quick 
to acknowledge the necessity of steadfastness in 
government for themselves; it should not be 
difficult to recognize the same necessity in the 
management of children. 
There is another form of keeping faith with 
children which will present itself to the educator. 
Their minds, as we have seen, soon become 
occupied with some of the mysteries which sur- 
round them—death, immortality, but especially 
their own origin, moves their wonder and curiosity. 
And in answering their questions, we have very  
-P-A-G-E-42
  
42 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
often to face the impossibility of telling them 
all the truth about things unfitting their age, 
while it is incumbent upon us to guard the trust 
existing between them and us, and equally ne- 
cessary that we should respond to their desire 
for information in such a manner as to set their 
minds at rest. The ordinary way of dealing 
with these difficulties is either to say, “ Little 
children must not ask questions ;” or to try the 
effect of evasion, “The storks bring little chil- 
dren ;” or, “ Your baby sister was found in the 
cabbage bed;” or, “The doctor brought baby 
in the night.” To either mode of answering, 
the objections are obvious. To a child whose 
questions are habitually encouraged, the first is 
_ absurd, while evasion will scarcely satisfy intelli- 
gent children. Loyal to the faith existing be- 
tween parents and children, I think it is better to 
explain that there are many things we will gladly 
tell the child when he is older, but that we must 
both wait for that time. Or we may make him 
feel that the new baby is a heavenly gift to his 
mother, in such a manner as to arrest further 
questioning. But different children require varied 
treatment; I have known one sweet mother who, 
with a directness and courage peculiarly beauti- 
ful, gave her child, in answer to his questions on 
this subject, something of the facts in simple,
-P-A-G-E-43
  Nursery Management. 43 
grave words, impressing him at the same time 
that it was a matter sacred to him and to her, 
and not to be lightly spoken of. Her confidence 
was rightly taken and justified. Children have a 
wonderful instinctive tact which may be relied on 
to check questions on such subjects, if once we 
communicate to them the serious reverence with 
which we ourselves regard them. 
We must habitually train ourselves to remem- 
ber that our intercourse with children must always 
be guided and controlled by a sense of our 
educational responsibility to them: they are so 
completely in our power, so unable to alter in- 
fluences affecting themselves. Grown-up ‘people 
are too apt to ignore the presence of children. 
They are perhaps full of their own interests and 
wishes, and forget that children are not bits of 
inanimate furniture. I need hardly point out the 
many injurious ways in which this forgetfulness 
acts. The acute little listeners hear perhaps in- 
formation and gossip, harmless enough in itself, 
but not fitting their age or discretion; or things 
are said in their presence which are destructive 
of their reverence for others, or of their freedom 
from conventional prejudices. This is irreparable 
mischief. In other instances the results are less 
morally harmful, but more embarrassing. ‘Oh, 
Mr. S.” a child may say, “I heard mother say 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 Notes on the Early Training of Children, 
you was going to marry with Miss A.;” or, “1 
heard Uncle R. say that Mr. D. was an old cur- 
mudgeon.” And it is whispered (also in the pre- 
sence of the children) “that little pitchers have 
long ears,” and we must beware of “les enfants 
terribles.” I have known a sensitive child suffer 
a small martyrdom from having subjects unfit for 
her to hear discussed in her presence, both her 
conscience and her sense of refinement being 
outraged. Children of even four or five years 
old are fairly reasonable creatures, and are cer- 
tainly full of sensitive feeling. Their selfpoise 
and self-respect are grievously wounded by their 
very existence being ignored. You hear a not 
unkind mother say of the child at her knee, “ Oh, 
don’t ask what is the matter; Mary is sadly out 
of temper to-day;” or, “She has been sulking 
ever since the morning.” Now, if we try to under- 
stand either state of feeling in the child, we may 
discover it is suffering physically, or has been 
jarred mentally by some stupidity on the part of 
its nurse, or is smarting under treatment it be- 
lieves to be unjust. It wounds it deeply to have 
mis-statements made concerning it to indifferent 
visitors, or to feel that the grown-up world about 
it has no comprehension of it, and is full of 
injustice. 
Again, granting that a child is sulky and ill-
-P-A-G-E-45
    
Nursery Management. 45 
humoured, we are bound to shield his dignity, his 
reputation, so to speak, from indifferent visitors ; 
and he has a right to feel hurt and angry if we 
fail in this consideration. Moreover, our influ- 
ence is seriously impaired if the child finds that 
we can speak lightly to others of some fault 
which to him we have made of grave importance. 
M. Taine, in a sketch of Prosper Mérimée, tells 
how once when, as a boy, he was severely scolded 
for some fault, and had been sent out of the 
room in tears and deep dejection, he heard 
through the door, a laugh, and some one saying, 
“THe poor child! how angry he thinks us!” 
“Liidée d’étre dupe le revolta,” adds M. Taine ; 
and he refers Mérimée’s self-repression, his suspi- 
cion of confidence in after-life, to such treatment. 
“To act and write as though always in presence 
of an indifferent or mocking spectator, or be 
himself that spectator,” was a marked trait of his 
character.

education. It is true we are shocked to know 
that Swift could read a chapter of the Bible 
at three years old, and that John Stuart Mill 
learned Greek at the same age; but there still 
obtains a great deal too much anxiety, at home 
and at school, to press children on to learn from 
books, and very little apparent content with the 
period of fruitful idleness that every child should 
enjoy. The fact that Professor Bain thus men- 
tions, would seem meant to teach us, that we 
must watch with the greatest care external mani- 
festations of the development of the brain; that 
we must avoid stimulating a growing intelligence; 
and, content to let it grow after its own fashion, 
hesitate to press upon it our means of develop- 
ment. 
Guided by these fundamental rules, we shall 
come to recognize these first years as a time 
above all valuable in the child’s education. It is 
a time given him to learn directly from objects, 
instead of at second hand from books; a time of 
practice for the senses, when through the concrete

the child arrives at ideas of the abstract ; when he 
is, in’ act, learning after his own fashion to spell out 
* the Universe, aad discovering, bit by bit, his rela- 
tion to the great system of shied Our parental 
care can assist the child to learn these first great 
lessons : how can we dare to mar them ? 
This, then, is the task set before us : to see that 
the infant is supplied with material for its obser- 
vation, to help its experiments upon this material 
when help is needed, and to secure free exercise 
for its activity in all possible directions. 
During the first two years of his life the child 
takes matters pretty much into his own hands. 
He is learning nearly all through his waking hours, 
but he learns almost independently of us. The 
light, and colour, and sounds which attracted his 
earliest observation, continue to be his study as he 
grows older; indeed everything which his senses 
discover awakens his wonder, becomes food for 
his experiments repeated over and over again, and 
the results are laid up in the storehouse of his 
memory. The use of every muscle, and combi- 
nation of muscles, has to become familiar, and 
then perfect, by constant repetition; he first 
‘grasps the finger extended to him, then he draws 
the object grasped to his mouth, but he has to 
learn, through many mistakes, the distances that 
lie between his hand, or his mouth, and surround-

  -

ing objects. When he first tries to ‘crawl, to 
stand, or to walk, when he begins to make-articu- 
late sounds, his activity is again increased, and 
his days are full of the new accomplishments. We 
have to do little more than to encourage his self- 
sought lessons indoors, and out of doors, to learn, 
as Dr. Abbott' wisely warns us, not to distract 
his observation by a too rapid change of objects, 
and to be ready with tender patience to carry him 
again and again to one spot or another, to let him 
handle, or smell, or hear the same thing over and 
over again. The other day I showed a baby of 
eleven months a vase full of chrysanthemums of 
varied colours. The sight was so full of interest 
to her it occupied gher delighted attention for 
nearly an hour. She watched the flowers solemn- 
ly ; then I lifted the vase close to her little face, 
and bade her smell them. She wished to grasp 
one of them, but I showed her how to touch one 
and another lovely disc of colour with her tiny 
finger without harming it. We put the vase in 
its ‘place again, but once more she wished to have 
the flowers near to her; once more the examina- 
tion of them went on; again her sight, and smell, 
and touch went through their pretty exercise, and 
her sweet attention was given with a grave, pleased 
happiness. It was a typical example of a child’s

undisturbed, but assisted, learning from the objects 
around it. 
When the child seems to demand fresh material 
for his activity, we must be guided by the interest 
he shows in what we present to him, and furnish 
him with that which seems next in the order 
demanded by his natural development. Size, 
form, number, weight, spaces, will probably next 
attract his curiosity, and lead him to comparison. 
Pictures, particularly those in colour prepared by 
the good artists who have taken this department 
of education into their hands, Walter Crane, the 
Caldecotts, Kate Greenaway, show the child in 
another form, the objects which are his alphabet, 
and he listens with delight to the stories we tell 
about the cats and dogs, the trees and children, 
in the favourite books. His sympathy is awakened, 
while his eyes are instructed and charmed. 
But very soon the little one will demand more 
of us; observation, however fascinating, will not 
alone satisfy him ; he must himself be busy. Toys 
and games become his serious occupation. With 
perhaps an inherited sense of the dignity of labour, 
he begins to foreshadow the employment of his 
later years; his imagination is impressed by the 
work of the grown-up world, and he invents 
mimic imitation of it. Supply a boy with wooden 
bricks, and he will build towers, and” bridges
-P-A-G-E-51
  Employment and Occupation of Children. 51 
’ farm-buildings, and railways. Give him a Noah’s 
ark, and he will arrange a_ stock-farm, or 
Zoological Gardens ; a cart, and he becomes the 
carrier, or the miller. With a doll, the girl 
simulates the mother’s labour of love; she car- 
ries it in her arms, she rocks and sings to it, 
presently she will wash and sew for it; no 
trouble is too much for her. Give a ‘child 
a garden, and though he may first begin by 
pulling up the plants to see if they are growing, 
he will: presently become a landscape or market 
gardener. Children will find and make for them- 
selves in games an infinite variety of employment 
if we leave them to themselves with constant 
regard to their spontaneous activity. 
And ¢raining in all directions should go on 
with new activities. It costs a child less effort, 
perhaps, to destroy than to preserve or construct. 
The baby is tired of its pictures, and throws them 
hastily away, creasing or tearing the pages, 
perhaps. It lies with us to smooth the rumpled 
paper, to put away the book for another time, with 
a playful word, to show the little one its mother’s 
love for useful or beautiful things. The blocks 
that have been used in the creation of homesteads 
and railways are scattered over the floor, a new 
interest has come, and with a child’s natural want 
of foresight, the toys so cherished a few moments

    52 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
before, are now only troublesome, and to be got 
rid of at any cost. The mother must remind him 
that he will need his darling bricks again, and she 
will lovingly encourage him to bravery and the 
’ effort to put them back in their box, helping him 
the while. Or the little one, from perhaps some 
physical cause, is restless, and bemoans himself. 
“Tam tired of playing at this.” “What shall I 
do now ?” or, “ I want something todo, mummie.” 
Kneeling on the floor beside him, the mother can 
re-awaken his flagging pleasure in his game, can 
rouse his imagination about it, direct it with fresh 
interest. The cart can be travelling to and from 
a new place, or it can become, in the wonderful 
colour of a child’s fancy, the instrument of another 
merchant. Presently, when the effort has been 
made, the mother, if she be wise, will avoid strain- 
ing the patience too far, and will herself suggest 
some fresh game. 
Self-dependence, patience, perseverance, steady 
effort to understand a thing, to get the best out of 
it, determination to overcome difficulties, should 
be first learned by children in their play, when 
they become old enough to make conscious effort ; 
and these beginnings of character should gain in 
power every day. 
In the Kindergarten, we have a system which 
recognizes the necessity of activity in little chil-
-P-A-G-E-53
  Employment and Occupation of Children. 53 
dren, and formulates their occupations ; and when 
nurses are trained for their business, and have at 
command some of Froebel’s wise and beautiful 
ideas, the life of tiny children will, doubtless, 
gain enormously in intelligence and happiness. 
The ideas conveyed in concrete form, the gentle 
leading from one mental step to another, the asso- 
ciation of children in games and occupations, are 
all delightful training, if kept subservient to a 
paramount conception of education. Lut one of 
the great difficulties in this period of life is to avoid 
making occupations obligatory, and over-systema- 
tizing. We have to respect the spontaneity of the 
child; we have to be careful not to disturb un- 
necessarily its healthy absorption in its own ideas. 
Children “grow in sun and shower,” in “the 
silence and the calm of mute, insensate things ;” 
they have spiritual food imperceptible to our 
coarser sight, and we must often stand aside and 
meddle not. I remember one of my own children, 
a little girl of six, being taken to the sea-side one 
summer, and her spending not only hours, but 
days in delighted contemplation of the new beauty 
around her. Sitting under the foliage of some 
tamarisks, she looked down at the sunny sea, 
talking to herself and her doll ; she could scarcely 
be persuaded to come in to her meals. I have 
another vivid picture of a period, when another

child seemed to live in his own thoughts, sitting 
on early summer mornings, in his little chair, under 
a verandah, watching the exquisite life of green 
things and animals around him. One such morn- 
ing he looked so quietly happy, that I put my arms 
round him, and said, “You're a happy little boy to 
enjoy this sweet day.” He replied, as though he 
had been pondering deeply on the subject, “ The 
cows are more amusing animals than the sheep, 
mummie.” The sheep were lying resting in the 
shade. 
A young teacher, experienced in High School 
and other teaching, was remarking to me the other 
day, that this sort of quiet life, when the child is 
allowed to grow after its own fashion, receptive 
of the best natural influences, is almost lost now 
in the pressure of intellectual instruction. The 
modern children are sent in their earliest years to 
Kindergarten, and then to High Schools, or their 
equivalents ; examinations begin early, and follow 
one another in rapid succession. The little ones 
have no time to think their own thoughts, select 
their own intellectual food, or develop after their 
own pattern, They have not even time for real, 
refreshing play, this young lady lamented, “It 
makes me quite sad. We are no longer bringing 
up real, sweet, fresh children.” 
If this opinion is justified by wide experience, 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  Employment and Occupation of Children. 55 
and that it is so there is some evidence to show, we 
may be assured that no possession of knowledge, 
no intellectual cleverness, will compensate for that 
want of assimilation of influence which is neces- 
sary to the growth of fine human beings. It is 
with the higher life of young creatures as with 
their purely animal life: we can supply the body 
with food, but it is the chemistry of the digestive 
apparatus which converts this into nutrition; a 
more subtle chemistry is at work to assimilate 
instruction, knowledge, influence, into material 
for the development of faculty, of character, of 
spiritual nobility. 
As one means of combining occupation and 
training with no stress upon the brain, we may 
bring into our service the desire to be useful which 
is so strong in children. This is shown indirectly, 
as we have noticed, in the nature of their play. 
It is observable in walks, which are apt to be very 
monotonous and dull, if taken merely as a duty 
to health. In the country, it is true, they may 
become delightful, informal rambles in search of 
flowers, ferns, or other natural objects ; but in bad 
weather, a purpose in going out, a commission for 
their mother, shopping, something which makes 
the child of use, is as valuable in satisfying the 
moral sense as it is in giving interest to physical 
exercise. Easy household work, adapted to the
-P-A-G-E-56
56 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
strength of children, is another excellent factor in 
training. Nothing is more delightful to children 
than exercise of this kind; brushing with a toy brush, 
dusting (learning delicacy of handling the while), 
giving out stores with their mother, filling tea- 
caddies and sugar-basins, all fulfil this sense of ser- 
vice. I have watched the delight of little maidens 
of five, six, and older, who were allowed on holidays 
to have a wash of dolls’ clothes, and who, under the 
shade of a tree, with their tub, and soap and water, 
went through the various stages of the process 
with happy industry, stretching their delicate dry- 
ing lines, and afterwards ironing the tiny clothes 
with toy irons, heated safely by their nurse. A 
little cooking stove, given to these same children 
by a German friend, was also an incitement to great 
efforts of skill; Liliputian pancakes, puddings, 
&c., were produced by its help, to the triumph 
of the small cooks, who doubtless learned in the 
amusement something of order, patience, and 
contrivance. 
Reading aloud to children occupies them in the 
most fruitful manner at this period of life. To 
those little ones who have been accustomed to 
listen to stories from the time they could under- 
stand a simple narrative at all, the effort of listen- 
ing with intelligence and attention is slight; to 
those with whom this has not been a habit, some 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  
Lmployment and Occupation of Children. 57 
little effort is required to listen with pleasure. 
But some of the most cherished associations of 
the family life often cluster round the “ children’s 
hour” of reading; association with the father 
and mother’s time of leisure, with the bright fire- 
side, or the sunny afternoon under trees, with the 
scent and sounds of happy summer around, when 
the. children sit entranced with the stories of 
Grimm or Andersen, the “ Feats on the Fjord,” or 
the “ Water Babies.” Perhaps to such readings 
may be traced the beginning of a love of books, a 
delight in literature, which is one of the supreme 
happinesses of life. In the same educational rank 
I would also put the learning of poetry by rote, 
the learning it from the lips of the mother. I do 
not mean the repeating of mere rhyme. I have a 
great objection to giving children inferior litera- 
ture. I shrink from teaching them doggerel of any 
description after they can understand anything 
better than the couplets we sing to them in lulla- 
bies. Fortunately, in the abundant collections of 
poetry that have been made for children, while 
there are many poems entirely beyond their inter- 
est, there are a number of our finest poems which 
appeal to the world of children as thoroughly as to 
older readers. There are others scattered amidst 
the treasures of English literature, and it is these 
which should be taught to children. The delight  
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
in rhythm is strong in little children, and simple 
ideas clothed in this form appeal very quickly to 
them,—I have often been surprised to notice how 
quickly and strongly. I have found children be- 
tween four and six years of age, love, and repeat, 
with touching emphasis and beauty, a large variety 
of English poems, the Percy Ballads as a matter 
of course, and Macaulay’s fine modern ballads; 
. some of Browning’s lyrics, many of Tennyson’s, 
and scattered simple gems of Shakespeare, Cole- 
ridge, Wordsworth, Keats, and many others.’ 
To this time of learning without lessons I 
should point as the period of all others for 
acquiring fluency in speaking foreign languages. 
Never again will it be so easy for the little ones 
to learn a language, as it should be learned, by 
hearing it spoken. The time will probably come 
when the speaking a modern language will be put 
in its natural place, defore, not after, the learning 
it from books, and when opportunities of ac- 
quiring modern European languages will be made 
a matter of international educational ‘ interest. 
1 As there exist many opinions as to what is fit for very 
little children (witness the numerous collections and selections 
made for them), I may mention some poems which I have 
always found great favourites:—Tennyson’s “When cats run 
home,” Wordsworth’s ‘Lines written in March,” Browning’s 
“The Year’s at the Spring,” from “ Pippa Passes,” Ariel’s Song 
Coleridge’s “What the Birds Say.”
-P-A-G-E-59
  
Employment and Occupation of Children. 59 
For the present, parents will do wisely to make 
great efforts to give to their little ones the real 
possession of French and German that can be got 
from the companionship of French and German 
maids or teachers. Few acquirements will prove 
in after-life more useful or enjoyable; and lan- 
guages can be learned with perfect ease in the 
ordinary daily life of the household. A child so 
taught may sometimes translate a French idiom 
into English speech, or give a German turn to a 
sentence; but this is a slight disadvantage in 
comparison with the knowledge of the language 
gained, and the natural ease with which it is 
acquired. 
Singing, as a training of ear and voice, and as 
a health-giving exercise, should be encouraged in 
young children. We cannot tell how early the 
pleasing sense of musical cadence affects a child. 
In some children it is blended with the earliest, 
haziest recollection of life at all, as though they 
had been literally “cradled in sweet song;” and 
we may be sure that the hearing of musical sounds, 
and singing in association with others, are for the 
child, as for the adult, powerful influences in 
awakening sympathetic emotion, and pleasure in 
- associated action. 
Drawing and painting, from the first rude daubs 
of colour and primitive scratches which children  
-P-A-G-E-60

delight in, are employments which have educa- 
tional value. With a little encouragement the 
sight may be trained to notice slight agreements 
or differences in form and colour, and the hand 
led to use both as primitive means of expression. 
For guidance in the more direct teaching with- 
out books, which will almost inevitably be de- 
manded by children in cultured homes, parents 
should read the early chapters of Rousseau’s 
ats Emile;”? for with all the writer's faults of con- 
ception and practice, no one I know of has more 
thoroughly insisted upon the child’s learning 
directly from nature and natural laws. Treading 
in Rousseau’s steps, we must seize the occasions 
which arise in the daily life of every family, for 
giving assistance to such learning; and this assist- 
ance is given best of all in the country, where, if 
it were possible, all children should live for the 
first ten years, at least, of their lives. A child 
should only be employed or amused indoors 
when the weather, or the time of year or day 
makes it impossible for it to be out of doors. The 
physical exercises which belong to out-of-door life 
have immense fascination for children; and the 
educator will do wisely to teach and encourage 
every physical art or skill in its due time and 
season, Dancing, swinging, ci:mbing, riding, 
rowing, swimming, for girls as well as for boys,

will not only promote physical development and 
health, but will foster courage and those mental 
and moral qualities necessary to the acquire- 
ment of any skill, or the practice of it in asso- 
ciation with companions. 
The animals in the home of the child will fur- 
nish many self-sought lessons: the examination 
of “pussy’s” teeth and fur, and retractile claws, 
will suggest comparison of the differences to be 
found in the spaniel or retriever; and the child’s 
interest will be led to the big cats and dogs—the 
larger carnivora—to be found in the countries 
away from England. The horses and cows will 
be examples of other kinds of animals, and grad- 
ually the whole zoological divisions, with their 
classes and families, will be almost imperceptibly 
learned. The mother will illustrate each step by 
pictures, visits, when possible, to the Zoological 
Gardens, and descriptions of the habitat of foreign 
animals. The same process will go on with the 
familiar birds, reptiles, insects, and plants. The 
rice pudding at dinner may suggest questions as 
to the food stuffs, or where rice comes from ; and 
the mother will procure pictures or examples of 
the cereals: she will tell the child of the cultiva- 
tion of rice in the plains of Lombardy and Patna, 
and will try to make him realize, in a picturesque, 
simple manner, the wonders which lie under the
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 Notes on the Early Training of Children, 
familiar objects of home. Plants and animals 
will lead by an easy association of ideas to 
geography. The mother will try to make the 
child realize in this direction also what is dif- 
ferent from his own experience. She will set his 
imagination to work, she will give him material for 
geographical ideas in the concrete; she will take 
him to a common and show him what a miniature 
plain is, and allow him to make for himself a 
range of mountains, with its spurs and valleys; or 
let him picture, in an old gravel-pit, the level of 
the sea, with bays and capes, islands and isth- 
muses. Then a map, first of the room, then of 
the village or town, then of the country, and so 
on, becomes a symbol illuminated by ideas. 
Sets of real measures are one of the most de- 
lightful of toys, and teach in another direction. A 
child will enjoy measuring a room or a lawn, when 
he has mastered the divisions of the foot or yard 
measure. He will be happy in proving for himself 
that eight ounces equal the half pound of sugar, 
and two pints one quart of water. Fractions are 
no difficulty when thus taught in the concrete. 
The idea of square and cubic measures are at 
once clear, if both are shown by a wooden box 
made a cubic foot in size, with a lid divided 
into the 144 inches. Number early attracts the 
attention of children; and Mr. Sonnenschein’s
-P-A-G-E-63
  
Employment and Occupation of Children. 63 
“Number Pictures” will illustrate, in ways de- 
lightful to them, numbers up to twelve. The 
use of his cubes and staves will carry them fur- 
ther in the appreciation of number; but every 
step in this, as in all other subjects, should be 
taken upon the child’s lead, never before. Simple 
geometrical ideas will be helped by the use of 
the Kindergarten sticks and cubes; and the 
placing of these will exercise the imagination 
and tax the ingenuity and patience of the child, 
besides giving him occupation day after day. 
Children taught in this way invent endless games 
for themselves. They will cause rivers to flow 
through their gardens and create fountains ; they 
will make locks and deltas ; and though they may 
perchance neglect to turn off a tap, and will often 
cover themselves with mud, what happy hours 
will be spent by them, in learning, or verifying a 
few facts for themselves ! 
The easy, natural teaching of physical laws 
in obedience to the child’s demand for it, can be 
pursued indefinitely. The only barrier to such 
instruction lies in the scientific ignorance of the 
generality of parents. Indeed, such lessons de- 
mand of parents a great deal besides knowledge. 
The teaching must be clear, simple, natural, pic- 
turesque ; it must be given in’ answer to questions, 
and by encouraging, not stifling, the child’s desire

for information. It must not be given in preach- 
ing; the formal didactic fathers and mothers of 
the type to be found in the books of Mrs. Marcet 
and Miss Edgeworth are happily out of fashion, 
and we do not desire to revive the school. 
Parents will be assured of their success in this 
kind of teaching, by the vivid interest with which 
their children will pursue these beginnings into 
the wider studies of the years that come after ; 
and by the happiness which attends the acquisi- 
tion of ideas, and tends to make the life of every 
day joyful in activity, love, and reverence.

CHAPTER V. 
SOME CARDINAL VIRTUES.—REVERENCE, 
“Let parents then bequeath to their children, not riches, 
but the spirit of reverence.” 
Flato’s Laws, Book V. (Jowett). 
In the story of Christ placing the child in the 
midst of the disciples disputing who should be 
greatest, we have a typical example of the ideal 
attitude of childhood. Without a thought of 
self-aggrandizement, wholly unconscious, humble, 
receptive, the little one stands by the side of the 
great Teacher, a rebuke to those who were full 
of selfish thoughts, an example of that mental 
state that must be reached before the adult mind 
can approach perfection. In its earliest stages 
of development we see that the child exhibits 
this ideal attitude. It is helpless, and it seeks 
protection ; it is ignorant, and it seeks to learn, 
and seems to the vision of those older— 
“Trailing clouds of glory . . . 
From God who is our home.” 
But soon its individuality asserts itself, its activity 
E

  66 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
increases, and with the exercise of new powers, 
its sense of importance to those around it, and 
delight in their appreciation keeps pace. In 
more or less degree, it becomes cognizant of the 
false estimates and conventional standards of the 
world outside it. 
A new task lies before us; we have to guard 
its humility, to teach it the true proportion of 
things in the mental and moral worlds; we have 
to maintain its childlike attitude by training its 
reverence, that mental state in which the spiritual 
nature is fit to receive new truth and new influ- 
ence; that state in which individuality perceives 
its small and lowly place in the great scheme of 
things, in which self is lost in some great idea.* 
It is a significant fact that neither of the two 
prominent modern writers on education—Mr. 
Herbert Spencer and Professor Bain—treats of 
reverence in its relation to moral education. I 
believe the word does not occur in the chapters 
treating of that division of their subject. The 
1 “Yet, however doubtful may be its position, if estimated 
by its bearing on happiness and progress, there are few persons 
who are not conscious that no character can attain a supreme 
degree of excellence in which a reverential spirit is wanting. Of 
all the forms of moral goodness, it is that to which the epithet 
‘beautiful’ may be most emphatically applied. Yet the habits 
of advancing civilization are, if I mistake not, on the whole, 
inimical to its growth.” —Lecky’s “ History of European Morads.”
-P-A-G-E-67
Reverence, 67 
omission may be characteristic of the modern 
spirit, and the critical attitude which is born of 
it, or it may be that the ideal of human excel- 
lence conceived by these writers on education 
does not correspond with that standard which 
exists vaguely in men’s minds. It is true Pro- 
fessor Bain says,’ ‘“‘ The briefest glance at moral 
teaching must not omit the topic of moral ideals. 
It is in morality more especially that the teacher 
works by putting forward grand, lofty, and even 
unapproachable ideals ; the supposition being that 
the charm and attractiveness of these will make 
a far more powerful impression than any un- 
varnished statement of consequences.” But we 
fail to find in his “classification” of “cardinal 
virtues,” his apprehension of “ motives,” or his 
survey of the “relationships of society,” any 
strong stimulus to the approach of these ideals. 
We rise from reading his chapter on “ Moral 
Education” with the melancholy impression that, 
just at the most critical point of our task, we arc 
left by our guide without any sure support, and 
with no fixed aim for the guidance of our steps. 
“ The earth is salted by the heroism of the few,” 
he says; and we must be content, we read be- 
tween the lines, if we produce average men and 
women; we shall then be sure to have well-in-

structed, intelligent, honest citizens, in whom the 
self-regarding and social motives will be well 
balanced, the emotions admirably controlled, and 
the affairs of life conducted with a due regard of 
all obligations. “Remember,” says Mr. Herbert 
Spencer, “that the aim of discipline should be 
to produce a self-governing being.” “The inde- 
pendent English boy is the father of the in- 
dependent Englishman.” “What is it that we 
aim to do? Is it not that education, of whatever 
kind, has for its proximate end to prepare a child 
for the business of life—to produce a citizen who, 
while he is well conducted, is also able to make 
his way in the world ?” 
But, alas! for the results, if we educate for 
what may be safely compassed with an eye open 
to the mete “business of life.” It is true, we 
must train so that our boy will grow up to take a 
useful and honourable place in the world, that he 
should be self-restrained, governing himself by 
the help of his conscience, that he should be- 
come a good citizen with sufficient will, foresight, 
and prudence to shape circumstances, rather than 
be shaped essentially by them: but we desire 
this for him because we aim at the greater which 
includes it. We will, with God’s help, try our 
best to train the boy for manhood, fitting him 
for work and usefulness in the century in which
-P-A-G-E-69

he lives, but otherwise possessing character and 
aspirations which belong to human excellence at 
any time, and in any position. We cannot as- 
suredly educate him, with all our pains, into a_ 
finer human being than he is planned to become ; 
but when can we assure ourselves we have ful- 
filled the original plan of his nature? When can 
we say we have reached the limits assigned to its 
development in any one direction? It is a re- 
verential attitude towards the possibilities in the 
child’s nature which will make great results in 
education possible. 
Going back to a time of perhaps less doubt 
and criticism than the present, we find Milton 
holding this attitude, and speaking with far less 
uncertainty either of what we should attempt in 
education, or of the means to attain it. ‘“ The 
end then of learning is . . . to know God aright, 
and out of that knowledge to love Him, to imi- 
tate Him, to be like Him, as we may the nearest 
by possessing our souls of true virtue.” And 
again, “ Here the main skill and ground-work will 
be to temper them with such lectures and expla- 
nations upon every opportunity as may lead and 
draw them to willing obedience, inflamed with the 
study of learning and the admiration of virtue; 
stirred up with high hopes of living to be brave 
men aud worthy patriots, dear to God and famous
-P-A-G-E-70
  70 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
to all ages.” And again still, “ Being perfect in 
the knowledge of personal duty.” 
We find the same thought expressed by Plato,? 
“ Every man ought to make up his mind that he 
will be one of the followers of the God; there 
can be no doubt of that.” “Then what life is 
agreeable to God and becoming to His followers ? 
One only, according to the old saying that ‘like 
agrees with like, with measure, measure. . . . 
Now God is the measure of all things in a sense 
far higher than any man, as they say, can ever 
hope to be. And he who would be dear to God 
must, as far as possible, be like Him, and such as 
He is.” Now here we have given to us “ grand, 
lofty, and even unapproachable ideals,” which 
touch the noblest chords of the human spirit “ to 
fine issues.” 
I know we get on very difficult ground when 
we seek to discover how far the present want 
of fixity and earnestness in religious beliefs has 
affected the ideal in human excellence. But what 
we have to do as educators is undoubtedly to 
find an ideal of perennial grandeur, and to train 
towards it; whatever we then attain will be at 
least in the right direction. And parents, whether 
they believe in a personal God, or in Humanity, 
or Law, or Natural Religion of any kind, provided 
\ Plato’s Laws, Book IV. (Jowett).
-P-A-G-E-71
  
  Reverence. 71 
that they have a real, earnest belief which 
governs the secret springs of their life, possess 
the true source of influence. 
The first dawn of reverence comes vaguely to 
the child through its relation to its parents; it 
can conceive no abstract notion of goodness, 
love, wisdom. But the time comes with a larger 
horizon, when the young creature is forced to 
measure his parents against other standards. 
Another idea of perfection arises in him, an idea 
his parents themselves have fostered, and gra- 
dually and naturally his love and respect grows 
into another and bigger, but more indefinite 
emotion — reverence. A child will very early 
touch upon the mysteries: of its being, it will not 
long be content with the small horizon of the 
visible and the concrete. It will seek with its 
infant intelligence to dive into the origin of things, 
and to grasp with its childish thought—death, 
immortality, omnipotence. Here again is a begin- 
ning which shall lead him, a child-like learner, 
through the wonders of life, and even to the por- 
tals of the grave. How infinitely beautiful and 
touching is the duty laid upon parents in dealing 
with this growth of spiritual life! How sacred 
is the obligation to deal with it in perfect truth! 
I have known parents imbued with the doubt and 
scepticisms of the modern life, who yet thought
-P-A-G-E-72
72 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
it good that their children should believe, while 
they could, the orthodox religious views of the 
time, supposing it to have a healthy influence 
upon character; and so the Bible reading, and 
grace, and prayers were continued in the family 
life with a sort of fetish devotion. 
I have little doubt that this want of truth 
between parents and children must come to a 
disastrous end. We can only really teach what 
we believe ourselves, and, whether that belief 
embraces much or little, the reality with which 
we hold it will make it a religious influence, or 
the reverse. Let parents be assured that young 
human creatures crave for spiritual food and 
_ guidance under some form or other. I have 
known parents who have ignored such craving, 
believing, in their own well-poised philosophy, that 
it came only from the teaching of priests or bigots. 
And they have lived to discover their children 
taking theological yokes and burdens of belief 
upon them, which far transcended in severity and 
narrowness the theology they first feared for them. 
But reverence is not to be limited to the atti- 
tude towards one great idea or personality. It is 
the very basis of human excellence, and we have 
to foster it in the training of all intellectual and 
moral qualities. Throughout every stage of in- 
struction, we must guard the humility of the
-P-A-G-E-73
  
Reverence. 73 
child; we must impress him through his percep- 
tion and imagination with the vastness of know- 
ledge, and the small amount he can ever hope to 
master. So impressed, he is not likely to think 
himself very clever or very grand if he makes a 
little step in attainment. Do not criticize people 
before him, particularly those who supply any of 
his needs—servants or teachers. J have known 
children so prone to dwell on the small details 
and. defects of those about them, that larger 
virtues and goodness were entirely lost sight of. 
A child should live as much as possible in “ ad- 
miration,” and should be taught that respect for 
humanity which is the basis of all true courtesy, 
In many small ways this may be made apparent 
to the child. The old type of “ manners” is re- 
placed by a more natural and more affectionate 
relation between parents and children, who no 
longer stand with formal respect behind the chairs 
of their fathers and mothers and address them 
as “Sir” or “Madam.” But if Punch is a true 
mirror of manners, the change has been made 
with a vicious jerk. Fathers are too often old 
* Governors,” who “ fork out” liberal supplies of 
money, and are looked upon as the convenient 
source of much luxury. The mothers are a dif- 
ferent edition of the same type, chiefly anxious 
for the worldly prosperity of their children, and
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 Notes on the Early Training of Children 
possessing little claim upon their respect or real 
love. It is obvious that we as parents must be 
worthy of respect, or we cannot claim it with 
much expectation of getting it. Nevertheless, it 
is hurtful to the training of reverence if we permit 
unchecked, as many fond mothers thoughtlessly 
do, any want of the outward respect due to parents. 
In words and manners we must teach the child 
reverential courtesy to the old, the weak, and to 
those who serve him. Service must be regarded 
as a favour, a kindness done to him, to be re- 
quested, never a right to be ordered. Guard a 
boy’s chivalrous respect for women; for servant- 
maids as well as for his sisters; in literature and in 
life seek that his ideal of womanhood claims all 
that is most worthy of reverence in him. Stimu- 
late reverence for great living men and women, 
The reverence of people who are realized to be 
alive at the present moment is a stronger motive 
for noble aspirations than a feeling awakened 
towards heroes whose lives can be less easily 
- compared to those of the children. It is said 
that Pope never forgot the distant sight of Dryden 
at a book-sale, and it is a great happiness to allow 
children some personal knowledge of those they 
are prepared to reverence. To take an intelligent 
child to a lecture by a great scholar or discoverer 
is not wasted trouble.
-P-A-G-E-75
  Reverente, ’ aes 
Little children suffer greatly from shyness or 
fear in the presence of strangers; but if they live 
much: in their mothers’ rooms they should be 
led to overcome the first impulsive rudeness, to 
continue their occupations, and receive kindly 
advances with respectful quietude. It is bad 
training for the child, to let it stand with pouting 
lips, or its fingers in its mouth, sullenly defiant, 
or intrusive with offensive remarks such as, “I 
don’t like that lady, she’s ugly.” The mother 
will do well to remark upon the kindness of her 
friends who make advances to the children, to 
notice some pleasant trait in them, and encourage 
the little ones to do some small office for the 
visitors; the handing of a tea-cup, or moving a 
book, will make the children lose their self-con- 
sciousness in another feeling. 
The want of reverence which is often declared 
to be most characteristic of modern children is 
attributed to the undue importance given by 
anxious parents to their position in the household. 
It is true that the welfare of their children, even 
in the slightest particular, is of the greatest 
moment to conscientious parents; but it is the 
interest of their moral and spiritual natures which 
should be paramount, and these will never require 
the sacrifice of other people’s convenience. They 
will never allow the peace and comfort of guests

to be ignored in attention to trivial concerns of 
the children of the family. And if these best 
interests were always kept in view, we should not 
see, as unhappily we often see now, the teacher 
whose intellect the parents profess to admire, 
served at table ‘after a child of six years old, or 
permitted to step into a carriage after her. Per- 
haps the best training in reverence the children of 
a family can have{yuillbe in sharing in the life of 
their parents, in being allowed to understand, as 
far as possible, their aims and hopes in life, in seeing 
them always ready to give up their own gratifica- 
tion, even the pleasure of their children’s society, 
for the sake of some duty, or in allegiance to 
some idea. If they see that the life around them 
is something better than the gratification of selfish 
pleasures, or even the fulfilment of immediate 
duties, if they see that it means losing self in de- 
votion to what is higher and better than oneself, 
they will be helped to keep in mind the unapproach- 
able ideal, and, fulfilling the truth contained in 
Hawthorn’s beautiful story of the Great Stone 
Face, they will gradually grow in its likeness, and 
learn the truth that Ruskin has expressed, “ This 
is the thing which I know. . . that in reverence 
is the chief joy and power of life.” ?

CHAPTER VI. 
SOME CARDINAL VIRTUES.—TRUTH. 
“Truth is the beginning of every good thing, both in heaven 
and on earth.” 
Plato's Laws, Book V. (Jowett). 
Tue apprehension of truth is an intellectual effort, 
not an impulse of the moral nature; and it’ is 
necessary to bear this in mind in judging correctly 
of the virtue of truthfulness. “Truth is the 
beginning of every good thing:” ‘Truth is the 
summit of being,” says Emerson, “ Certainly it is 
heaven upon earth to have a man’s mind move in 
charity, rest in providence, and turn upon the 
poles of truth,” writes Bacon in his Essay. Such 
sentences come into our mind when we ask 
ourselves, how it is that truthfulness should be 
regarded by the thoughtful educator, and by the 
popular sentiment, as such an essential goodness 
in character as to be the salt wherewith every- 
thing else shall be salted. Truth in character 
consists of that quality of mind which seeks to
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
recognize the ultimate reality of things—the 
facts which have their origin in God—and at- 
tempts to form a harmony between this great 
background of final truth and the individual 
life. It is this mental quality in man, this at- 
tempted interpretation of the highest and best 
he &uows, which claims our reverence and re- 
liance, and leads us to put so high a value upon 
the expression of his knowledge, of his inter- 
pretation, 
We seize here the idea that lies at the found- 
ation of the anxiety about truthfulness which 
pervades most parental minds. We need not be 
surprised that this anxiety is generally unpercep- 
tive and unreasoning. Few discern what essential 
truthfulness implies, or trace its alliance with the 
simple telling of truth. But the educator perceives. 
that while his supreme duty lies in cultivating | 
the spirit of truth in the child, in securing that 
clearness of the intellectual vision, that purity of 
the moral nature necessary to the reception and 
transmission of truth, he must also obtain the 
accurate expression of his knowledge, z.¢., he must 
train him to be habitually truthful ; he must “ tell 
the truth.” And indeed, unless a little child has 
inherited some crookedness of character, or is in- 
fluenced by any of the motives we shall presently 
examine, it is natural to him to express in words
-P-A-G-E-79
  Truth. 79 
truth as he perceives it. It is after-influence 
which causes him to become an_ unfaithful 
medium. At the same time we cannot expect 
that the precious nature of truth will appeal to 
the understanding of very little children; even 
in the maturity of mortal life we only “see 
through a glass darkly,” and while their intellec- 
tual powers are immature and feeble, it is folly to 
look for anything like true appreciation of that 
which lies at the foundation of human and eternal 
relations. Such appreciation must grow with the 
growth of the whole being. We must be content 
to see it in its earliest and in its imperfect form, 
to tend it, and strengthen it. In the course of its 
growth we must be even prepared to see it waver 
and falter in its allegiance, and must still sustain 
our faith in patience, that eventually with the 
consolidation of character, it will become steady 
and strong, and, flame-like, embrace “the summit 
of being.” 
I have known parents seriously unhappy at 
the activity of the imagination in their children, 
Thei dramatic power has seemed to them sad 
evidence of untruthfulness. But such unhappi- 
ness is ill-founded. Before the child is burthened 
with duties and responsibilities, while its own life 
is unshaped before it, it is free to live in the dear 
delights and beauty created by its own fancy.
-P-A-G-E-80
  80 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
With the fairy wand of his imagination, he can be 
an Aladdin rubbing his lamp, or Robinson Crusoe 
building his hut in the shrubbery, or a hunter 
stalking buffalo in the copse of the meadow. He 
will act out for days or weeks the little drama 
that has seized his fancy, recounting his ad- 
ventures to his brothers and sisters the while. 
Or, to enliven a dull walk, he will imagine lions 
and tigers in the familiar paths near home, and 
will tell his mother, on his return, with innocent 
gravity, that he has seen a lion on the common! 
But the lines between. reality and drama are 
generally clearly defined in the mind of the little 
actor, and we must playfully enter into the spirit 
of his play. 
‘In this mimic world of imagination children 
get an activity of feeling and of intellectual 
exercise which is fitting them for the life of 
the big world presently to open to them, and 
are provided with a wealth of happiness to be 
found, I believe, in no other way. It is a great 
mistake to narrow the mind of childhood to the 
grooves of our sterner and more commonplace 
existence. The grooves will be formed all too 
soon, and with them, we will hope, will come the 
larger horizon, the deeper insight, belonging to 
increased years. But with the appearance of 
every new power, we must faithfully maintain our
-P-A-G-E-81
  
Truth. 81 
reverence for nature, and as carefully obey her 
dictates in leaving the child to live in the charmed 
world of his imagination, as presently we must 
set before him the duties which belong to his real 
‘position in a world of lessons and other human 
obligations. We cannot readily limit the part 
imagination is intended to play in the child’s 
development. It begins to show itself in games 
and little dramas, but it is the handmaiden of 
reverence, and helps to shape the “ unapproach- 
able ideals” by which, and for which, men live. 
Even in practical life it may grow to “put a girdle 
round about the earth in forty minutes,” or steer 
Columbus-like to unknown lands of thought. 
In exaggeration we get a mild form of untruth- 
fulness which claims our attention ; for if the habit 
is indulged, a child not only becomes accustomed 
to careless observation and inaccurate statements 
of facts, but grows to confuse linés of thought. 
He will tell you, ex fagon de parler, “There are 
a hundred rooks on the lawn,” or, “ That snail is 
half-way down the wall.” He does not mean to 
be untruthful, and it would be very wrong to treat 
him as though he did. Nevertheless, as a matter 
of training in observing the fact before him, and 
of stating his impression of it, we shall do wisely 
to recall him to the rooks and the snail. ‘“ You 
don’t mean a hundred rooks ; see, we can count 
F 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  82 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
1” them easily. There are only thirty!” or, “You 
said half-way down the wall; let us measure.” 
The moral nature becomes more dangerously 
involved when an untruth is told or acted to gain 
a purpose. Here a variety of motives come into 
play, and to judge at all correctly of any departure 
from truthfulness it is necessary to unravel its 
motive. With very little children, who cannot 
yet understand why the obligation of strict truth- 
fulness should be laid upon them, any small 
motive of convenience, idleness, or desire is 
sometimes sufficient to evoke from them a false 
statement, or a misleading colouring. But 
parents must not lay stress upon these childish 
aberrations. The inaccuracy probably belongs 
to a very passing phase in: well-trained children, 
and it will often disappear with better health, or 
with stronger development of the intellectual 
faculties ; and though we must watch well in such 
cases, and always keep in view the relation of 
small things to big, we may do a child a serious 
wrong if we make much of these childish errors 
of speech. Our training as a whole will justify 
itself. 
Among motives which instigate a serious want 
of truthfulness, perhaps the most common is fear. 
I have endeavoured to show before that this 
should have no presence in a child’s life. In
-P-A-G-E-83
  
Truth. 83 
every direction it degrades the moral nature: in 
this especially it tends to prevent him remaining 
a medium of truth. He is guilty of some piece 
of carelessness, he disobeys an order or breaks 
a bit of cherished china, and under the influence 
of fear he denies the fact, and runs the risk of 
becoming habitually untruthful if the dread of 
punishment is held over him. There are few 
children who are made of such naturally heroic 
stuff as the late Sir Henry Lawrence, who, when 
enticed by his school-fellows to follow their ex- 
ample and throw a ball in dangerous proximity 
to a forbidden window, went straight to his mas- 
ter, “doubtless amidst roars of laughter,” says his 
biographer, with, “I have come to say, sir, I have 
broken a window.” Indeed we have no right to 
expect heroism from average young creatures yet 
unfledged in morality. We may be happy if our 
training eventually leads to it. 
Love may be almost as powerful a motive to 
untruth as fear, and some of the best children are 
tempted by a mistaken idea of chivalrous gener- 
osity to screen a companion from the consequences 
of a fault by an untruth in word or deed. A boy 
is asked about some wrong-doing that has gone 
on in his presence, and refuses to state what he 
knows about it; indeed, he is proud if by some 
semblance of untruth he can lead his master off
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 Notes on the Early Training of Children, 
the scent of discovery. Or a school-fellow uses 
a “crib,” or copies the sum of a companion and 
passes it for his own; or a boy has spent his 
allowance, and makes a false excuse to get more 
money from his father. Here we have another 
variety of motives leading to untruth in several 
forms, and the educator cannot shrink from facing 
the problems brought to him as results of early or 
mistaken training. : 
The generality of the world believe that punish- 
ment can correct untruthfulness; no discrimina- 
tion of motive is thought necessary. Unreason- 
able as it is, the several kinds of the evil are 
treated in the same manner. Now, an intellectual 
perception is not made clearer by punishment, 
although pain may possibly quicken a child’s 
attention to a fact, or may deter him from making 
a false statement concerning it. But can we 
reasonably hope to make by punishment a radical 
change in the mind of one who allows various 
trivial motives to swerve him from the truth ? And 
this is what we have to set ourselves to do. Sup- 
pose we accept as reasonable and discriminating 
Mr. Herbert Spencer’s theory of punishment, and, 
when a child tells an untruth, refuse it credence 
for a given period. Would not the child soon 
get to feel that it was of little moment whether it 
speke truth or falsehood, since the consequences
-P-A-G-E-85
Truth, 85 
were the same? And would not a bitter sense of 
injustice and anger and despair rise in its heart, 
to the shutting out of any germ of better 
life ? 
A different result follows from trusting a child. 
I knew a little girl of three or four who found the 
first frequent use of her tooth-brush very irksome, 
and when her mother one day asked her whether 
she had brushed her teeth, answered “ Yes,” when 
she had neglected the duty. Her mother believed 
her as a matter of course; but the child® imme- 
diately woke to a sense that she was untruthful 
to her mother who ¢rusted her. She straightway 
ran to her room for the duty she hated, and after- 
wards fully deserved the trust she had abused. I 
knew a French cook once who, after living two 
years with her mistress, said, like the Rugby boy 
of Dr. Arnold, “You cannot tell lies to Mrs.——, 
she always believes you.” 
Canon Farrar, in the course of a lecture de- 
livered at Cambridge, under the direction of the 
Teachers’ Training Syndicate, told the following 
story. I take it from the report in the Journal 
of Education :— 
“At Harrow, two boys brought me exercises, 
marked by the same grotesque mistakes. It 
seemed certain that those exercises could not 
have been done independently. Both boys
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
assured me that there had been no copying. One, 
whom I had considered a boy of high morale, 
assured me of this again and again with passionate 
earnestness. I said to him, ‘If I were to send up 
those two exercises to any jury in England, they 
would say that these resemblances could not be 
accidental, except by something almost like a 
miracle. But you both tell me that you have not 
copied. I cannot believe you would lie to me; 
I must suppose that there has been some extra- 
ordinary accident. I shall say no more.’ Years 
after, that boy, then a monitor, said to me, ‘Sir, 
do you remember that exercise in the fourth 
form?’ ‘Yes,’ I said. ‘Well, sir, I told you a 
lie. It was copied. You believed me, and the 
remembrance of that lie has remained with me, 
and pained me ever since.’ I am inclined to think 
that boy was more effectually taught, and more 
effectually punished, than if I had refused to ac- 
cept his protest.” A well-known educationalist 
took exception in the next number of the Journal 
to Dr, Farrar’s treatment of the boy. But I think 
the result proved that his judgment, however 
painfully tried, was fully justified. 
But again and yet again the question will be 
pressed upon us, “If ordinary punishments are 
useless in dealing with untruthfulness, what are 
we to do? All children cannot come into ow 
 
-P-A-G-E-87

hands free of the taint of untruthfulness ; how can 
we make a liar truthful ? for it is not to be borne 
that he remains a liar.” First let us begin by 
banishing from him as far as we can every possible 
temptation to untruth, whether of fear or desire; 
foster his courage, first physically, giving him 
tone. Then, fear being withdrawn, cultivate his 
first feeble attempts to be morally courageous. 
Let him see how you rejoice in his efforts to be 
brave, and lead him from one step to another in 
courage. In your intellectual teaching impress 
him with the majesty of truth, and let him feel the 
heroism of those men and women who, in their 
simple fidelity to an abstract idea, have chosen 
martyrdom rather than the gains of unfaithfulness. 
Lead him to see how by painful labour and en- 
thusiastic devotion investigators and discoverers 
have added grains of truth to the sum of human 
knowledge. But, above all, address yourself to 
his moral nature; strengthen in it the seeds of 
rectitude. Hold up to him noble standards of 
life, and so set yourself to develop the goodness 
you find there, that the weak, the cowardly, the 
untrue fades away.

CHAPTER VII. 
SOME CARDINAL VIRTUES.—LOVE. 
“ O’er wayward childhood wouldst thou hold firm rule, 
And sun thee in the light of happy faces ; 
Love, Hope, and Patience, these must be thy graces, 
And in thine own heart let them first keep school.” 
Coleridge. 
Few things in ordinary life are more touching 
than the faith shown by children in human good- 
ness. I suppose that foundlings and children 
from bad homes must be deficient in it, but that it 
is widely distributed is patent to us all. Persons 
have little virtue indeed, if they disappoint this 
faith, or do not justify the appeal made to them 
by the immaturity and dependence of childhood, 
The child’s relation to its parents first awakens 
this trust. At a few weeks old it begins to show 
happy satisfaction in the presence of its mother, 
and even distinguishes its father (who does not 
supply its physical wants) with something of a 
 
-P-A-G-E-89
Love. 89 
dawning affection ; so soon does the young crea- 
ture put out the feelers of its love. Members of 
the household, especially other children and kin- 
dred with a family voice, or resemblance of man- 
ner to its parents, readily engage its attention ; and 
thus in the centre of family life tender germs of 
love awake and grow, and show promise of those 
intense emotions which form the supreme hap- 
piness or misery of after-life—emotions which 
should widen into the love of humanity, and, 
stretching beyond the visible stimulants of feel- 
ing, expend themselves in religious admiration, 
and love of the unseen Spirit of the Universe. 
In this direction again, we touch in earliest edu- 
cation tiny threads which stretch beyond the 
small and the transitory to what is eternal. 
At first sight it seems that the natural exercise 
of the child’s affections has been so well provided 
in its instinctive love for its parents, and in the 
area of its home, that the educator has little to do 
in developing this side of its nature; but we pre- 
sently discover that a larger capacity of emotion, 
a finer quality of feeling, lies within our power of 
training. Affection can never be purely selfish, 
for its very existence demands a certain surrender 
of self to an object out of self. But the parental 
tie in its rudimentary form, only manifests, in com- 
mon with the mother animals, devotion, protect-

ing care, perhaps passionate attachment. Guided 
by neither intellectual perceptions nor moral pur- 
poses, parents alternately caress and strike their 
children, and behave to them in every phase of 
their growth with similar wants of consistency. 
The higher manifestations of the parental relation- 
ship can only be attained by careful self-restraint 
and culture; it has to grow fit for the obliga- 
tions laid on it by thought, by insight, by stead- 
fast intention ; it has to outgrow the selfishness of 
love, and see inchildren, not objects ministering 
to the gratification of its affection, but put under 
its care for far other and higher purposes. 
In children, too, we have first to take care that 
their affections grow strong and healthy ; next, 
that they widen, and touch in sympathy many 
points of life, and lead in aspiration many chords 
of feeling. How is this to be done? It is 
tacitly but universally acknowledged, that while 
other powers of the child may grow under coercion, 
its affections must develop spontaneously, or not 
at all. Asa general rule I think it is considered 
of no great consequence if they do not develop. 
Those who believe in the value of precepts tell 
children they must “honour their father and 
their mother,” that “ Little children (must) love 
one another,” and so on. It is taken for granted, 
in the case of parents at least, that the affection 
 
-P-A-G-E-91
  Love. gI 
of the child for them should spontaneously follow 
the demand for it. But the sweet gift of love does 
not come in obedience to a command, nor as a 
necessary consequence of relationship, and though 
nature is beneficent in making the first tie between 
parents and children so close and ready for 
growth and further development, parents must 
cultivate these germs of love, and earn their place 
with their growing children. 
I shall shock the susceptibilities of some parents 
in saying this, but I think upon reflection they 
will agree with me. They will recall the many 
cases where no real love, no actual confidence, 
exists between children and their parents; cases 
where obedience, reverence, the happy companion- 
ship which friendship creates, are all absent, and 
a hollow semblance of these things shows that an 
acknowledgment of the actual truth is too painful 
to face. 
/ Love begets love; and though we sometimes 
see a child passionately attached to those who 
care little for it, this is an exception to the rule. 
Kisses, caresses, the sweet little ways in which 
tender fathers and mothers give relief to their own 
feelings of happiness in their children, have not 
only deep meaning, but real educational influence. 
They do their part in creating that atmosphere of 
warmth and love in which the tender feelings ex-

pand and develop.. I have known persons of 
really warm hearts, who seemed to think it their 
duty to exercise such Puritan self-restraint of feel- 
ing towards their children as to make their home 
so cold, so joyless, so irresponsive, that the exist- 
ence of “sweetness and light” there seemed 
impossible. Let us be assured that as plants turn 
for very life to the sun, the child seeks his nurture 
in love. We must not be niggards of its expres- 
sion. We must not be afraid to show him how 
much we love him, what joy his presence is to 
us, how dear is the return of his love to us. 
Is it necessary, in saying this, to guard against 
the confusion of ideas which commonly prevails 
between the love which acts with constant and 
conscientious regard to the moral welfare of the 
child, and that form of it which, being chiefly 
selfish, seeks first its own gratification irrespective 
of moral considerations ? Under the sway of the 
first, “spoiling” is almost impossible ; under that 
of the second, it is nearly unavoidable. 
In conscious and unconscious nurture of the 
affections, we intensify the natural feeling of the 
child, we lead its growth, but we reflect what he 
gives us; he is happy in the return of his love. 
We have next to encourage in him another form 
of the affections, where he will get little or no 
return : to lead him to love those who have no 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
Love. 93 
natural claim upon him, in a word to cultivate in 
him the “social” affections. In this direction lie 
the noblest planes of moral life, in which the indi- 
vidual feels for the suffering, the joy, the welfare 
of others as for his own; and would project his 
own happiness into the life of thousands unknown 
to him; or in self-sacrifice lay down his mortal 
life that others may truly live. To the little 
child these sublime heights of life are veiled; but 
we, his guides, who see them dimly afar off, shall 
fail in our responsibility to him if we do not lead 
him by gentlest steps on the shining road towards 
them. : 
A little child of five or six years came to. me 
one day with a tender expression on her face, and 
said, “I had a new thought in the village just 
now when I saw the girl in a blue hood crying, 
I thought I should like to be of use to every one 
in the world.” I tried to show her that, with all 
our wish, this was impossible. “ We can help one 
at a time, though,” she said, “and that is many 
altogether.” Here is an example of the right 
chord of unselfish feeling being struck; such 
~ vibrations will guide us in our educational work. 
In the care of animals we shall find an excel- 
lent instrument. In these dumb “brothers and 
sisters” of his race, the little child has one of his 
earliest and best interests. In their activity, their

  94 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
playfulness, their attachment, the child finds a 
part of the living world at once at the level of his 
comprehension, and responsive to his sympathy. 
The home of every child should provide some 
animal for his playfellow. Whether in motion or 
at rest, the kitten, a bird, even a guinea-pig, will 
afford abundant scope for protracted observation, 
and the needs of its life will lead affection into 
active kindness, the doing something to promote 
the welfare of a living thing. The earliest sense 
of responsibility will grow side by side with this 
affection ; and though it is unwise to rely too much 
on this sense in young children, as their protective 
care of animals is necessarily apt to be impulsive 
and unreliable, they will gradually learn in the 
companionship of their parents the importance of 
feeding the cat, or of giving fresh water to the 
bird. Many indirect advantages will follow the 
exercise of such responsibility. The child will 
learn the value of patience, of punctuality, of thrift 
in the care of animals. He will not need experi- 
ence like Maggie Tulliver’s with the rabbits com- 
mitted to her charge, to make him estimate the 
importance of duties towards living animals. The 
sympathy and imagination of children can be 
easily awakened towards their dumb companions, 
and this should be purposely done: it is the defi- 
ciency of both capacities which leads them to the
-P-A-G-E-95
  
Love, 95 
cruelty so often said to be natural to children.’ I 
have known a small child made so unhappy by 
realizing the grief of a mother bird robbed of her 
young, that she could not be pacified until the 
nest was restored to the tree whence it was taken. 
I know another child who grieved intensely for 
days at imagining the sufferings of her foreign 
bird, that had been allowed to fly out of the room 
into the dangers of a town garden. The mother 
will encourage this sympathetic imagination by 
making the child observe that his gentle offices 
are needed by the favourite dog who requires the 
door opened, or water given him when he cannot 
supply either want himself. 
As part of this training, little children who live 
in the country should be carefully prevented from 
knowing anything or seeing anything of the neces- 
sary killing of animals. Like many other things 
in life, this must hurt the tender susceptibilities 
of children, and should be kept from their cog- 
nizance until other considerations can put it in its 
true proportion. A boy thus guarded will shrink 
so much from the infliction of pain, that the love 
of sport, in after-years, will with difficulty over- 
come it. 
I am inclined to think that tenderness to women 
1“ Most cruelty, however,” says Lecky, “springs from cal 
lousness, which is simply dulness of imagination,”
-P-A-G-E-96
  96 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
and little children is most often cherished by 
gentleness begun to dependent animals; and 
though I know there are loving men and women 
who have little affection for them, there are few who 
are notably good and loving to animals who have 
not special kindness for dependants of higher race. 
Educators have rarely disregarded the duty of 
calling out in children the “social motives.” We 
all remember how Mr. Barlow and the mothers 
and fathers in Miss Edgeworth’s stories, rather 
ostentatiously encouraged the relief of distress 
by alms-giving. The study of Political Economy 
has somewhat changed and widened our present 
ideas of philanthropy; and the children of to-day 
are not incited to give their pennies or coats to 
beggars. At the same time we generally recog- 
nize that little children can only understand 
charity applied to individual cases. Larger plans 
and reforms which affect individuals in masses, is 
a conception of active kindness which appeals -to 
mature, not immature life. And I am sorry when 
I see the names of children in the lists of sub- 
Scribers to charities. This seems to me a prema- 
ture forcing of ideas, which is unhealthy, and 
likely to encourage, not a wise benevolence, but 
rather self-righteousness and vanity. 
The social affections can be abundantly exer- 
cised in the homes of most children; they have
-P-A-G-E-97
  
Love. 97 
little or no property to give away, but they have 
as real possessions their thought, their activity, 
their personal trouble to use in the service of 
others. Children discover the value of these gifts 
with delight. There is almost always in the 
household some old, some very young, or delicate 
person, to whom such service is acceptable. 
Even the saving of trouble to others, fetching or 
carrying, running errands to save the ringing of 
the: bell, is the small giving of one’s self for the 
sake of others ; and the details of daily life should 
be sanctified by this idea, so that it becomes as 
natural to the child to live for others as to seek 
his own pleasure without reference to them. If 
we have to deal with a child in whom the selfish 
predominate strongly over the unselfish motives 
of action, we must seek in the remote corners of 
his nature for some regenerating spark of feeling. 
We may find it in reward of patient search, in the 
child’s love for something or somebody; it may 
lurk even ina love of approbation, or sensitiveness 
to pain, or even in restless activity. However 
difficult it may be to find it, we cannot but believe 
the germ of unselfish life exists, and that even 
“the poorest poor” in spirit can be brought 
to become “the givers out of some small bless- 
ings.” 
Hard trials often come to little children in their 
G

intercourse -with young companions. However 
much they enjoy the society of other children, 
there inevitably comes with it a clashing of wills, 
the rousing of anger, perhaps jealousy, envy, and 
other forms of uncharitableness. The presence 
of the mother or of some older companion is 
necessary to smooth matters at such times. Two 
children desire the same toy, and quarrel over the 
right each has to it. The mother can stop the 
rising indignation and sense of injustice, by a 
gentle appeal to the generosity or the perception 
of justice in the children. I have often seen, in 
such cases, both children melted into kindness, 
and rivalling each other in their willingness to give 
up the cherished plaything. In well-trained or 
finely-organized children, in whom the social 
motives are as strong as the selfish, the mere 
appeal for the claims of others is sufficient to 
bring out the one set of feelings and abase the 
other. 
Sympathy is to the moral world what genius is 
to the world of intellect ; with a like delicacy of 
insight, with imagination, and impersonal love, it 
reads the secret truth of lives and understands 
natures wholly different from itself. It is so fine 
an attribute that it seems almost a gift rather than 
the result of any training. But as educators we 
must assume that every power may be latent in
-P-A-G-E-99
    Love. 99 
the child, and by taking for granted his posses- 
sion of it, and by habitual appeal to it, we shall 
doubtless develop more or less of answering feel- 
ing. _We often see how the living with finely 
organized persons, sympathetic themselves, and 
looking for sympathy in others, results in this effect. 
One of the most powerful influences, however, in 
the cultivation of the unselfish side of the child’s 
nature lies in the ideals of benevolence and self- 
sacrifice presented to him in literature and life. 
He reads of the labours of Howard and Mrs. Fry 
in prisons, and determines, some day or other, to 
imitate them; or he is moved to tears over the 
sufferings of noble martyrs, and thrills with desire 
that he may be called upon for similar, though 
humbler trial. And if he has been made to feel 
the transcendent beauty of Christ’s life, he will 
have enshrined in his mind and spirit the noblest 
example of perfect love, of absolute self-sacrifice 
by which to shape his own faltering steps in 
life.

Tue various theories concerning the origin and 
nature of the conscience do not greatly affect 
our work of practical education. Whether the 
instinct we call conscience is innate to human 
nature, or is inherited from generations who have 
lived in obedience to their moral sense ; whether it 
is a swift act of the judgment dividing right from 
wrong, or is the result of authority or punish- 
ment, it is a power in the nature of children

which, sooner or later, faces us, and with which 
we are bound todeal. And we appeal to it almost 
involuntarily from the earliest moments when the 
child begins to exercise independent action. We 
find ourselves saying, even to an infant, “You 
must not do this,” “You must try to be good.” 
This appeal, half-conscious as it is, joined with the 
conscious moral training which is ‘prompted by 
our own allegiance to a standard of right, sets up 
boundaries round the child’s life. He gradually 
learns there are some things he ought to do, some 
that he ought not to do; lines of simple morality 
are marked out, all the influences of his little life 
lead him gradually to form a standard of right 
which will be ready for guidance ina time of need. 
While life is easy, and it is pleasant to the child 
to do what is required of him, this time of need 
will be postponed; the conscience—“ the some- 
thing in our bodies,” as a little girl of six once 
put it to me, “which tells us when we are doing 
right or wrong,’—Will remain latent. But with 
the growth of the child, and the increase of his 
powers, conflicts will arise between his inclination 
and the sense of right we have been quietly 
nurturing ; some power must decide between the - 
recognized under the various names, conscience, the moral 
sense, the sentiment of obligations."—Bain on the “Emotions 
and Will.”  
-P-A-G-E-102
  102 Wotes on the Early Training of Children. 
two, and assign the victory. In this power we 
recognize a force which, if respected, will both 
“guide and govern life.” For if we once “admit 
that the conscience is that in a man which points 
to what is above him, which declares the supremacy 
of a right that he did not mould, and cannot 
alter,” ® we shall accept the decrees of this power 
as binding. ‘That “right,” whether accepted as 
representing the will of a perfect and loving Spirit, 
or laws which may or may not interpret this 
power, lays obligations on us. Various impulses 
of love, imagination, judgment, also suggest pos- 
sible duties. The conscience reviews these with 
her clear vision, and decides whether they ought 
or ought not to be adopted as part of the obliga- 
tions of our lives. And if moral excellence is the 
final aim of true education, our labour of train- 
ing must be in a fair way of success when we 
arrive at any period of that training, and see the 
1 “Right conduct is felt to be something which we are not 
free to do or not to do, but which imposes itself on us with 
the force of some authority. It includes a distinct reference to 
a law or command outside of us, to which we owe allegiance 
er conformity ; whether conceived as imposed and enforced by 
a human or by a Divine will; or regarded in a more abstract 
manner as something independent of all personal volitions, a 
law imposed by the very nature of things.”—/ames Sully.

young human being accepting in a large and 
fine sense the obligations naturally imposed upon 
him. 
In notes which treat only of the ear/y train- 
ing of children, I can but indicate what belongs 
to a period beyond that I am dealing with, and 
show how the foundation is to be laid for that 
excellence of character which should crown the 
humble educational labours of every day. The 
chief training of the conscience belongs to that 
more distant period. With young children it 
must be so gentle, so almost imperceptible, that 
we keep latent the very power we are strengthen- 
ing. I reiterate that the aim of all our early 
training must be to develop the child’s nature in 
such a manner, that he loves goodness, and finds 
it not only most pleasant, but most easy and 
natural to do right; and our success in this first 
duty will be shown in the postponement of the 
time of difficulty, of struggle and conflict. Typi- 
cal childhood means this postponement of op- 
posing desires, of imperative obligations ; a time 
when the stern duties of life lie in the distance, 
and the young human creature shares the enjoy-. 
ment of other young animals, and rejoices with 
all nature in existence and development. It 
would be too much to hope that during this 
period there will be xo conflict of inclination and
-P-A-G-E-104
  104 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
higher obligation; but our object should be to 
defer the time of questioning and doubt, to let 
the child’s nature remain quiescent as far as may 
be. It is possible to imagine that even adults 
in a higher plane of existence may live without 
conflict between the higher and lower impulses 
of their nature, and will always spontaneously 
choose the right and act it. Conflict between 
right and wrong has its nobility, it is necessary 
and beautiful, but only asa means toanend. The 
activity of the conscience, aroused by conflict, in- 
volves self-consciousness and self-contemplation, 
and although some periods of growth seem to 
originate in these mental states, I am inclined to 
believe they shut out the highest aspects of truth, 
which we apprehend when self is held most quies- 
cent, and are detrimental to healthy growth in the 
very young. 
We must rejoice, then, when the little child 
remains in the period of childhood as long as 
possible. During this time his parents, their 
standard of right for him, their wishes, may form 
his external conscience. This can only happen 
when the sympathy is strong between parents 
and children, and when the education has been 
wise; but as the result of these conditions it is a 
beautiful aspect and effect of training. The child 
has absolute faith that his parents know the
-P-A-G-E-105
  
Obedience to Consctence. 105 
right, and he accepts the decrees made for him 
without question, It is enough for him that 
“mother wishes me to do this;” or “father 
says I must not do that.” There is no conflict, 
no unhealthy self-consciousness, in this sort of 
conscientiousness. The appeal to his parents 
is for the time infallible; and, guided by their 
obedience to duty, he learns, step by step, alle- 
giance to moral obligations. I have known little 
children accept this direction so entirely, that no 
absence of their parents, no temptations, had 
power to make it falter. They have often denied 
themselves even harmless gratification, in their 
scrupulous desire to be faithful to the duty they 
believed was expected of them. 
Under such guidance the child’s appreciation 
of moral law becomes stronger, and he gradually 
begins to interpret it for himself, and apply it in 
practice. The relinquishment, however, of the 
standard and conscience of his parents for his 
own is so imperceptible, that we can scarcely 
mark it; the one fades before the other, and at 
some time the child shows us, often to our sur- 
prise, that he has learned his lesson, that.his own 
sense of right is awakened, that his conscience is 
no longer latent, but ready to guide him. Our 
training has led up to this time, and it is reason- 
able to expect the activity of this nascent
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
faculty, in common with all the other powers of 
the child; and yet it is essential, I think, for 
its healthy growth that it should be allowed to 
develop only in its own time and fashion. Every- 
thing like over-stimulus must be avoided. I know 
there are excellent parents who consistently try 
to stimulate the conscience of their children, and 
strive to render their young lives governed chiefly, 
if not wholly, by its rule. Perhaps most of us 
have witnessed scenes where childish faults have 
been magnified under such a system, where re- 
peated efforts have been made to cause a child 
to come to, or at least to acknowledge, a sense 
of wrong-doing. Our hearts have ached to see 
the continued punishments, the confinement, the 
meals of bread and water, or blows, to get the 
confession of a lie, or repentance, as it is called, 
for an act of insubordination or disobedience ; 
while on the part of the offender we have seen 
pride, anger, shame, obstinacy, all rise up to 
meet the irrational and mistaken discipline, and 
we have been left doubtful whether the conscience 
itself has ever been really touched. These 
parents, in their efforts to make their children 
virtuous and pious, are trying to awaken in them 
a state of feeling belonging to their own mature 
age, when every word and deed is governed by 
the severe rule of the conscience.
-P-A-G-E-107
  Obedience to Conscience. 107 
We learn in Dr. Arnold’s biography that “one 
of the chief questions on which his mind was 
constantly at work,” in face of the difficulties of 
moral training in public school life, was (Serm. 
vol. iv. p. 19), “Can the change from childhood 
to manhood be hastened without prematurely 
exhausting the faculties of body or mind?” 
His biographer adds, ‘‘In the judgment of some 
he was disposed to answer too readily in the 
affirmative.” The same question, framed to 
suit a younger age than those Rugby boys, is 
constantly presenting itself to other educators, 
and it is too frequently answered practically by 
attempts to antedate development. In _ the 
dilemma between the necessary exercise of the 
moral sense, and the danger of its over-stimulus, 
what course can we pursue? I am well aware of 
the difficulty of this part of our parental labours, 
and that we must depend greatly on our educa- 
tional instincts and our reverence for the child’s 
nature, for guidance in the matter. Under this 
direction we shall find abundant material for the 
exercise of the child’s moral nature, whether he 
is living under the influence of his parents’ -con- 
science, or has himself awakened to feel his own 
moral power. Were the life of little children less 
natural, less free from affectation, we might often 
imagine they had been born moral philosophers,
-P-A-G-E-108
108 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
with a mission to investigate and settle difficult 
questions in ethics, for their interest is prone to 
wander from the small examples of right and 
wrong in conduct immediately before them, to 
abstract problems. Every one who lives sympa- 
thetically with little children is aware of this ten- 
dency in them. And this freshness of interest is 
probably one of the appointed means of educa- 
tion for their moral nature. If we mentally for- 
mulate the manner in which the conscience should 
ultimately develop, we shall recognize that its 
perception of the right must be prompt and ready, 
while it is not morbidly susceptible ; swift and 
unerring in its decision, resting upon judgment 
which: is cultivated and balanced, and feelings 
made delicate and strong through love—love for 
others, love of ideas. These qualities cannot be 
of speedy or of early growth, although they are 
the fruit of gradual development. Following 
upon the perception of the right, “the moral 
feeling thus touches the springs of the will, and 
instantly sets it in movement. To see and feel 
what is wrong in ourselves or another, is to shrink 
from it. The thought of what is good, morally 
worthy and noble, is immediately attended with 
an impulse of desire or aspiration.”*

-P-A-G-E-109
  Obedtence to Conscience, 10g 
When the child is ready to take this second 
step in moral training, he becomes obedient to the 
moral law, yielding up, if need be, to its demands, 
personal inclination, comfort, pleasure. But this 
obedience can only be shadowed forth in the 
life of the little child. His conception of duty is 
happily proportioned to the level of all his powers, 
and it is only as life advances that the sense of 
obligation grows with the growth of the whole 
nature, and seeks not only to fulfil claims, but to 
assume fresh yokes and burdens of duty. 
The highest development of the conscience is 
attained when this larger conception of obligation 
is reached, and the individual becomes a factor 
in the world of morality. Towards this final and 
ideal development, then, we have to work. And 
we shall best attain our end, I think, by using 
means as zmpersonal to the child (if 1 may use 
the expression) as possible. Fill his soul with 
ideals of moral life, lead his imagination to dwell 
on them, his love for goodness will cling to them, 
and he will approach them by almost insensible 
degrees. In the literature used by the child 
every day of his life, we shall find abundant 
material for the impersonal exercise of his judg- 
ment, the awakening of his feelings in morality. 
In the simple scenes of life represented in good 
stories for children, their indignation is moved  
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
by wrong-doing, their enthusiasm is roused by 
heroism or patient ‘virtue, far more strongly than 
in their elders, to whom right and wrong are 
not such fresh problems. The actual experience 
of children is naturally very limited, and one 
of the intense fascinations to them of suitable 
literature consists in the enlarged horizon it 
affords them. I have known children apply the 
lessons taken in this way from books with wonder- 
ful clear-sightedness. 
A little girl of six or seven was talking to me 
about some mammas she had read of, who “ tell 
their children some things that are not true, to 
please them.” “G.’s mamma,” for instance, who 
“told her a little bird would fly out of the curtain ; 
but it wouldn't, you know. I don’t like such 
mammas,” she added ; “they may be very com- 
fortable and agreeable mammas, but I don’t like 
them when they say such things!” The same 
little girl had been interested in a French book 
which had been read to her and her sisters, and 
said after it had been finished, “I hope you'll get 
us another story like it : we like it so much better 
than ‘Sophie.’ ‘Sophie’ is for little children: it 
shows them how they get punished when they 
don’t bey their mammas ; because, you see” (with 
much gesticulation), “Sophie’s mamma told her 
she must not go into the lime: but when Sophie

went into the yard she said to herself, ‘ What 
beautiful lime! I must walk through it!’ and she 
was nearly burned.” “But,” I said, “do you 
think you don’t want showing that you should 
obey your mother?” “Oh, no,” R. said, with 
much quiet scorn at the question; “we kzow we 
must, but it’s only little children like baby who 
want showing.” 
A child, after being strongly moved by the 
Parable of the Talents, said to me, ‘I have been 
thinking a great deal to-day about the ‘talents :’ 
I mean to try‘and use my talent well.” 
I had been reading with my own children some 
story about obligations, and in the course of 
conversation upon it afterwards, asked whether 
they thought grown-up people really could do 
what they liked. ‘“ No,” said one of them, ‘’cos 
they’ve got duties.” 
In proportion to the faithfulness with which we 
have carried out the principles of early training 
laid down in these “ Notes,” will be the value of 
the impersonal exercise of the conscience. For 
in this proportion will be habits of “ unconscious 
goodness” in our children, and their freedom 
from faults. In association with other children, 
also, they will learn many practical examples of 
moral teaching, Parents who arrange as far as 
they can all the influences which affect the early

life of their children, will take special care as to 
the character of their young companions ; but, let 
the care be ever so great, it often happens that 
the society of associates introduces quite new 
elements into the atmosphere of the children, 
suggesting fresh problems in morals. It is well 
when these are brought to the mother for dis- 
cussion or solution: but I have known cases of 
undesirable influences set to work amongst chil- 
dren by their companions, which were not dis- 
cussed with the mother because they were con- 
sidered too trivial or absurd. It behoves mothers 
to be especially watchful of new influences upon 
their children. 
It has been nobly said, “ Without hope there is 
a thing called duty.” It is this feeling of the 
supremacy, the steadfast support of duty through 
all the changes and troubles of life, we must 
inculcate in our children, and Chatham’s words 
even to the young may sometimes prove a blessed 
remembrance. Times of intense depression come 
to all human beings, even to those full of faith 
and hope and strength. * The light of the sun is 
hidden, joy is gone from the daily life, long de- 
votion to duty, perhaps, has exhausted the very 
springs of patience and energy, and life is not 
worth living. At such times the poor human 
creature is like a shipwrecked sailor, who sees

one only chance of recovering a hold on life, of 
realizing again the faith and trust that lie for the 
moment dormant. That hold is something that 
must be done—that #e must do, and if he clings 
to the obligation even blindly, helplessly, it will 
lead him into quieter waters; he will presently 
fee] the ground again beneath his feet, he will 
again feel his patience revive, he will see the 
flowers bloom once more in the sunlight: the 
springs of his life will be renewed, and existence 
will grow full and sweet and radiant with God’s 
grace. We may indeed be thankful if our train- 
ing results in a moral fibre which resists, and 
grows above such common shocks; but we shall 
demand yet more of our child. It is not enough 
that his conscience makes him strong to bear, 
we expect that it will make him strong to do. 
We shall not be content if the “right,” to him, 
as he grows onward to man’s estate, means the 
current morality of his generation, in views of 
trade, politics, social ethics. In accordance with 
our training, we shall demand higher conceptions 
of his duty. These, as the outcome of the whole 
being, necessarily partake of the character of that 
being. If his nature includes deep and warm 
affections, if his imagination is active, his intellect 
enlightened, his conceptions of duty will be broad, 
and wise, and sympathetic, and he will enter into 
a

the life of his time under their guidance. He 
will not be satisfied with the grudging employ- 
ment of one talent; ten talents may be given 
him, and he will use them with loving eagerness, 
“as ever in (the) great Task-master’s eye.” 
His conceptions of duty will enlarge with every 
increase of moral and intellectual elevation, his 
love and power of activity will grow, and he will 
see with truer eyes how desired ends can be 
attained. : 
If he has a spark of the genius of the seer, 
the artist, the reformer, the philanthropist, in him, 
he will acknowledge a constantly enlarging circle 
of obligations, and, fulfilling faithfully the duties 
claimed in the intimate relations of family life, he 
will not be content without moving influences 
which affect far larger areas. And in following 
his ideas of duty, the opinion of others, of the so- 
called “world,” will not disturb his steps, for in 
the under-current of his life will abide the know- 
ledge that—

And trouthe thee shalt deliver, it is no drede.”

CHAPTER IX. 
REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS. 
“The best way of training the young is to train yourself at 
the same time; not to admonish them, but to be alway carry- 
ing out your own principles in practice.” 
Plato's Laws, Book V. ( Jowett). 
WE very rarely, if ever, see education emanci- 
pated from the conventional ideas of reward and 
punishment. Moralists and experience teach that 
obedience to the moral and physical laws govern- 
ing the universe is followed by happiness, disobe- 
dience by pain, and this teaching has so affected 
educational practice, that extraneous reward and 
' punishment have come to be considered an integral 
part of the training of children. 
Most educators would agree that children 
should be educated from their earliest life in such 
a way as to avoid the necessity of punishment, 
that this at least is the ideal to be striven for ; but 
whether from “inherited defects,” or the bad early
-P-A-G-E-116

training of children, the majority will consider 
such a standard of moral education as impossible. 
Mr. Herbert Spencer states that “any ideal 
system of discipline is hopeless. Parents are not 
good enough.” Nor are the children. “We are 
not,” he says, “among those who believe in Lord 
Palmerston’s dogma, that ‘all children are born 
good.’ On the whole, the opposite dogma, un- 
tenable as it is, seems to us less wide of the 
truth.” He lays great stress on the “inherit- 
ance of defects by children in the average of 
cases.” 
The only discussion which appears allowable, is 
the mode of punishing or rewarding. The ordinary 
use of both is seldom anything but empirical. 
Educators have but vague ideas how “ moral 
excellence” (the chief aim of all education) is to 
be attained. They agree that wrong-doing must 
be followed by pain, right by pleasure; but how 
the arbitrary administration of either can effect 
desired changes, is scarcely analyzed. 
The traditional methods are those used in the 
hope that they will produce the expected result. 
And what are these ? 
The stern doctrines of the Old Testament have 
maintained a strong influence in the bringing up 
of the young. ‘ Chasten thy son while there is 
hope ; and let not thy soul spare for his crying.’
-P-A-G-E-117
    Rewards and Punishments. 1t7 
“Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt 
deliver his soul from hell.” And this idea of 
saving the soul by the pain of the body, gratifies 
so naturally the imperfect impulses of most 
educators, that we find it believed in, and 
practised, not only by those who are ignorant and 
passionate, but by all grades of educators and for 
all kinds of faults. 
Corporal punishment is given in anger when 
it must seem to the child as a consequence: of 
personal annoyance or indignation, or it is dealt 
out with judicial calmness and deliberation, when 
it must be necessarily more impressive. A child 
at an elementary school cannot do his sums; his 
hands are caned by the teacher. Why? to make 
him see an intellectual problem with more acute- 
ness? Another child disturbs his father by making 
a noise when quiet is necessary; he is sternly told 
to be quiet, but he presently forgets the command, 
and, busy in his own way, repeats the annoyance. 
The father takes it for granted he intended to be 
disobedient, and boxes his ear. A little girl breaks 
into open rebellion against her governess, or, be- 
lieving that some injustice is done her, bursts 
into a tempest of passion. Both are met by 
sharp blows, or by banishment to bed, with hun- 
ger, for the remainder of the day. A boy tells a 
lie to his mother, or deceives her by pretending

  118 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
to go to school and absenting himself; or, with 
confused ideas, takes, as his own, some property 
of his parents. A “sound flogging” is sup- 
posed to be the means of teaching him ‘the 
value of truth and the rights of property. A 
little sister is found by another child an incon- 
venient competitor for toys, and she slaps her to 
remove her out of the way. Her mother slaps 
the offender by way of teaching her kindness to 
her sister. There does not seem much sequence 
between this kind of punishment and these typical 
offences—between disobedience and the tingling 
of a blow, untruth and insubordination and a 
larger dose of physical pain. The pain is believed 
to be strongly deterrent in its effects, and that 
is held to be sufficient. Outward conformity to 
established rules of order can at least generally 
be attained, and there is hope that some inward 
change of the volition follows upon the outward 
conformity. Much questioning as to the actual 
effects of physical pain on the moral nature is 
useless and undesirable. If the corporal punish- 
ment proves less efficacious as a deterrent than is 
expected, educators trusting in it are very much 
at a loss. 
I know that one of the common arguments in 
favour of corporal punishment over those that 
appeal more directly to the moral sense of the
-P-A-G-E-119
  Rewards and Punishments. 119 
offenders, is that it is healthily restricted in its 
effects, and can leave behind it no morbid sense 
of wrong, no irritating self-measure. The child 
has done wrong, it has paid for it in physical 
pain, and the memory of the pain will prevent the 
recurrence of the offence. 
I doubt whether the account is so easily set- 
tled. Physical violence is hurtful to the moral 
nature; it rouses as a rule opposing physical 
violence and fear, and too often leaves in the 
mind of the victim a sense of injustice or anger 
and hatred, instead of a true repentance. In 
David Copperfield’s history of his relation with 
his step-father, we have a sad and touching 
account of punishment which had these effects, 
with the yearning for the active influence of love, 
which he instinctively felt would have brought 
opposite spiritual results. Boys, in talking of their 
school-life, will tell you, as another effect, that 
they get so callous to the indignity and shame of 
physical chastisement, that it produces no other 
result than to make them rather glory in bearing 
it with decent courage. They grow to prefer it 
to tasks, and other modes of punishment, because 
it is soonest over. : 
When education is better understood, there is 
little doubt that corporal punishment will be con- 
sidered singularly irrational and unphilosophical,
-P-A-G-E-120
120 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
and that educators will then seek and find 
intellectual and moral means for producing intel- 
lectual and moral results. 
The theory which advocates those punishments 
which are the “true consequences” of conduct, 
seems a far more reasonable guide. But it is 
reasonable within very narrow limits. It is impos- 
sible, as I have shown elsewhere, that the theory 
as lately expounded by Mr. Herbert Spencer can 
be carried out with logical consistency. “It is 
the function of parents,” he says, “to see that 
their children habitually experience the true con- 
sequences of their conduct—the natural reactions ; 
neither warding them off, nor multiplying them, 
nor putting artificial consequences in place of 
them.” 
In some cases, no doubt, it is possible to let 
a child learn the value of judgment and foresight 
py allowing her to choose a wonderful “ purple 
jar” instead of a useful pair of walking shoes ; 
but I have never read Miss Edgeworth’s story 
without bitter resentment against the cruelty of 
Rosamond’s mother; and I think most readers 
of to-day will agree with me, that the child’s 
love for her mother, and faith in her wisdom 
and goodness were dangerously jeopardized by 
such a lesson in the smaller and self-regarding 
virtues. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  
Rewards and Punishments. 121 
This theory of punishment is, however, sup- 
ported by the child’s sense of its justice. If the 
noisy child, just now cited, had been sent to 
play in a cold room by himself; if the untruth- 
ful boy were to be steadily disbelieved until 
he became convinced that it was bad policy to 
tell or to act lies ; or the juvenile communist had 
had his own jacket or toys taken away from him, 
the children would have received some ideas, 
however crude, of the moral laws they had dis- 
regarded. The question to be considered is, at 
what cost would these ideas have been gained ? 
We cannot safely deal with one part of tHe child’s 
character in the giving of our lessons without 
relation to the whole, and if we act to the child as 
he has acted to others, will not his faith in our 
goodness, his reliance on our judgment, his ideas 
of right and wrong, receive a serious shock, which 
no minor advantage will counterbalance ? 
But if we discard both these modes of punish- 
ment, what help can we get in our task of training 
moral excellence in the child? I shall be told 
that some punishment is absolutely necessary 
for those children who have had no good early 
training. 
In a very fine passage of the “ Remorse,” 
Coleridge contrasts the two ways of treating the 
wrong-doer, and after drawing a powerful picture
-P-A-G-E-122
  
122 Notes on the Early Training of Children. 
of the conventional treatment of the criminal, 
exclaims,— 
“With other ministrations, thou, O Nature, 
Healest thy wandering and distempered child, 
Thou pourest on him thy soft influences, 
Thy sunny hues, fair forms, and breathing sweets, 
Thy melodies of woods, and winds, and waters, 
Till he relent, and can no more endure 
To be a jarring and a dissonant thing 
Amid this general dance and minstrelsy ; 
But, bursting into tears, wins back his way, 
His angry spirit healed and harmonized 
By the benignant touch of love and beauty.” 
Here the wrong-doer is regarded as sick in spirit, 
and he is brought back to health,—z.e. goodness, 
—by the natural educational processes. We are 
not considering, as Coleridge was, the wrong- 
doing of adults, but I think the conduct of 
erring children may be thus estimated. The 
child’s action when out of harmony with the 
higher moral laws is wrong (wrung from the 
right). His nature, as part of humanity, is 
designed to love goodness, to do right; we must 
treat his failing from the law of his nature as 
abnormal, and seek for influences, as we do in 
the case of bodily sickness, which will restore 
his soul to health. Nor can we be content with 
outward conformity to goodness. We must be 
assured that the character of the child zs what it
-P-A-G-E-123
  Rewards and Punishments. 123 
seems to be, that its will is governed by the best 
part of its nature. 
In as far as reward is the antithesis of punish- 
ment, what is true of the one is true of the other, 
with the difference, that it is always more safe to 
appeal in children to the love of pleasure than to 
the fear of pain. At the same time, while punish- 
ment brings in its train certain evils, extraneous 
reward of good action stimulates vanity, pride, 
all forms of self-love, and the development of the 
selfish, as opposed to the unselfish part of the 
nature. We may safely and freely allow the 
natural rewards to follow upon good conduct; 
but it shows weakness in education to supplement 
these by extraneous pleasures. A child learns 
under a good teacher with extreme industry and 
eagerness: he is rewarded by the pleasure he 
feels in the acquisition of new knowledge, in the 
exercise of his faculties, in the sympathy of his 
teacher: it is something like “gilding gold” to 
offer this child further stimulus in the shape of 
prizes. Prizes for intellectual work have been 
the invention of bad teachers; certainly they are 
not needed by those who thoroughly understand 
their business. The same may be said of the 
taking of places, and the system of “ marks,” when 
not used as a means of recording the progress of 
pupils,
-P-A-G-E-124
124 Notes on the Early Training of Children, 
At Dunmow, I believe, the flitch of bacon is 
still given to couples who claim it for their year 
of marriage passed without a quarrel. In French 
stories we read of the virtuous girl of the village 
being publicly rewarded. The inadequacy of such 
rewards pointedly shows the mistake of the prin- 
ciple ; while the common proverb, “ Virtue is its 
own reward,” puts into shape the truth I am 
trying to enunciate. The exercise of the moral, 
no less than the intellectual, faculties, is followed 
by the reward of pleasure, and the satisfaction 
of the moral sense; and we strengthen the child’s 
moral nature, we keep its purity intact, when 
we rely on this natural pleasure: we weaken it 
inasmuch as we encourage in its exercise mixed 
motives. 
No doubt extraneous rewards are admissible 
sometimes, when we are trying to stimulate a 
sluggish disposition, or are endeavouring to esta- 
blish a habit. I have known the offer of small 
pleasures act extremely well in such cases; but 
they were only used as leverage, and the 
moral conduct aimed at was of so moderate a 
‘pitch, that it was not degraded by an inadequate 
measure. 
To the order of natural rewards and punish- 
ment belongs one of the most powerful forces 
in the training of children—the approval or dis-
-P-A-G-E-125
Rewards and Punishments. 125 
approval of those they love. In proportion to the 
excellence and beauty of the relation between 
parents and children, in proportion to the love 
between them, and the reverence of the younger 
for the elder, will be the strength of this force. 
It becomes an external conscience to the child, 
but a conscience so tempered by mutual love 
as to be a healthy, almost unconscious moral 
sense. 
Indeed, with the sort of training I have endea- 
voured to describe in these pages—training be- | 
gun in the cradle, and continued throughout the | 
growth of the child, with the love, and thought, 
and devotion to ideals in education which may 
be exercised by every parent, punishment is 
wholly unnecessary. But I am well aware that 
this early training is still rare, and that conse- 
quently the dealing with faults in children is 
almost inevitable. If the ordinary means of 
meeting these moral difficulties is irrational and 
unphilosophical, what other methods are left to 
educators ? 
In previous chapters I have endeavoured to 
show how some of these faults should be treated 
—how untruth will fade away under the growth 
of courage and a truer conception of the nature 
of truth—how anger and selfishness must be con- 
quered by gentleness and appeals to unselfish-  
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 WVotes on the Early Training of Children. 
ness —how disobedience must not be risked, 
as obedience can never be enforced, and can 
only be obtained by demands upon right feel- 
ing—and so on. I am quite aware that 
special cases will require special educational 
treatment, that the variety given us to deal 
with by nature is so abundant, that in spite 
of acknowledged resemblances and differences, 
every child is individual in certain particulars, 
and requires some treatment peculiar to itself. 
In the family such treatment is possible. We 
often see in schools how individuals suffer by 
being part of a system which must be adapted 
to the needs of the majority. 
As a general principle, in dealing either with 
“inherited defects” of children, or the results of 
their bad training, I urge that we should lay as 
little stress as possible upon faults. We must 
studiously avoid to rouse them: for in activity 
they grow and strengthen as virtues do, in rest 
they may grow weak and die. 
We must fix our attention and our loving 
energy upon all the good traits in the faulty child, 
we must watch every tender germ of better life 
in him; we must love his soul, even if he is not 
personally dear to us—we must so love it that 
we rescue it from the power of evil, and give our 
unwearied devotion to its development in good- 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  
  Rewards and Punishments. 127 
ness. We must not be suspicious of evil motives,\ 
we must avoid the temptation of watching for 
wrong-doing—encourage the child’s efforts to do 
right by accepting them as what we expect from 
him. What priests do in the heights of their 
office, educators must do on the lowly plains of 
their duty, in faith, and hope, and a. humble 
patience.

FOREWORD 
  
Previous to the last session of the Legislature the school laws of Ten- 
nessee consisted of more than one thousand different acts. The demands of 
the various communities of the State had influenced legislation suited to 
their respective needs so that the entire system was largely a series of . 
private acts or amendment to general acts. The need of a codified school 
law was so imperative that the General Education Bill was prepared for 
the purpose of gathering the main provisions of the acts passed since 1873 
into one uniform bill written in simple, clear and concise form. 
The bill was introduced in both houses of the Legislature. Several hun- 
dred copies were printed and distributed throughout the State and a special 
committee of the Legislature was appointed to study its provisions during 
the recess. The committee was in session two weeks and made a careful 
examination of the entire bill, but, naturally, there were points of variance 
between the judgment of the authors and the committee. For example, the 
original bill provided that the office of County Superintendent be abolished 
at the expiration of the present term and that the office of executive sec- 
retary, to be filled by the County Board of Education, be substituted. The 
legislative cémmittee feared that the bill could not be passed if it included 
this provision. Therefore, the part pertaining to the office of Executive 
Secretary was stricken out by the committee and a new bill, which was 
practically the same as the old with the exception that this provision was 
omitted, was substituted. As a result of this change, there are some incon- 
sistencies found in the Act as passed. The original bill provided that the 
County Board of Education should assign certain duties to the Executive 
Secretary. This list. of duties was not stricken from the bill by the com- 
mittee and it is now-one of the duties of the County Boards of Education:to 
assign certain duties to the County Superintendents. Some other incon- 
sistencies in this section may also be found. 
In both houses of the Legislature the bill was very bitterly fought for 
the reason that many representatives attempted to make it include certain 
provisions that would be more favorable to their respective communities. 
Many amendments were offered, but they were not always inserted at the 
proper place, for it seemed impossible for any member to keep all the pro- 
visions of the bill in mind and to know at what point an amendment should 
be placed. This statement is not intended to criticise any member of the 
Legislature, but to enable those who are not acquainted with the situation 
to reconcile the inconsistencies in the published Act.

elementary schools of said county according to the State salary 
schedule for a period of eight scholastic months. Provided, how- 
ever, that all counties which meet the requirements of this sec- 
tion, and then do not have sufficient funds to maintain all ele- 
mentary schools for eight months, their funds shall be supple- 
mented sufficient to enable them to maintain an eight-month 
school term according to the provisions of this Act, out of the 
Equalization Fund, and it is further provided that should there

Fund for that year shall be proportionately reduced or a pro- 
portionate amount shall be deducted from its share of any 
State fund for elementary schools the following year. The resi- 
due of the State School Fund after the apportionment of the 
Equalizing Fund as hereinbefore provided shall be distributed

authorized to levy such additional taxes as may be necessary for 
high school purposes. The additional taxes levied by the County 
Court for high school purposes, as herein provided, and the

fund to be known as the County High School Fund, which shall 
be kept separate and apart from all other funds and applied 
exclusively for high school purposes. Superintendents of the

enter into new contracts under prevailing conditions, or to 
renew existing contracts, said Commission may investigate

of the public schools of this State of sustituting new books 
for those now in use under existing contracts.

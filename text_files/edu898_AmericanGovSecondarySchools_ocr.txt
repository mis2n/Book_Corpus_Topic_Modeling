PREFACE 
Ix most secondary schools the time devoted to the study 
of American government is so limited that especial care is 
necessary in selecting the topics to be considered and the _ 
methods to be used. The chief aim in studying our govern- 
ments is unquestionably the preparation of our high school 
students for the proper exercise of their duties and privi- 
leges as American citizens. In the opinion of the author, 
this preparation must include’ at least three things. First 
of all, the pupils must gain an adequate knowledge of the 
structure and functions of our system of government. In 
the second place, they should be to some extent familiar 
with the affairs of to-day which are connected with the 
work of government, in order that our political system may 
become real, and not be a lifeless organization to be studied 
chiefly in books. Last, but perhaps most important from 
* the standpoint of life as well as the school, some training 
must be given which will enable the pupils to look upon 
both sides of public questions, to weigh arguments, and to 
judge for themselves whether reasons given for a particular 
policy may be satisfactory. This training of the judgment 
in connection with practical subjects must not lead the 
pupils to imagine that they are solving or can solve the 
problems of government, but should enable them to learn 
and understand the truth about each one which they con- 
sider. 
In rewriting the book the author has placed much more 
emphasis upon ‘the activities of government than in the 
: v
-P-A-G-E-7
vi PREFACE 
earlier work. This has made it necessary to change the 
arrangement of many topics and chapters, as activities have 
been grouped according to their relations with one another 
rather than connected with the governmental officials 
through whom a special phase of the work may be per- 
formed. It is hoped that the introduction of new material, 
the shifting of emphasis still further to the more practical 
features of our government’s work, and the new special 
helps for students will make the text even more acceptable 
than the original American Government. 
The author acknowledges with great pleasure the many 
helpful suggestions made by teachers and friends. Correc- 
’ tions of errors will be received gladly from those who have 
occasion to use the volume.

SUGGESTIONS 
Many teachers may prefer to study the parts of the book 
in an order different from that in which they are now 
arranged. Although the author advises that the present 
arrangement be followed, little difficulty will probably be 
found in studying Part II before Part I, though it is proba- 
bly more difficult. The author has found it advisable to 
make a careful examination of the written Constitution of 
the United States in connection with the work of the Con- 
stitutional Convention, Chapter XV. The pupils can then 
distinguish much more easily between the constitutional 
and the extra-constitutional features of our national gov- 
ernment, This distinction ought to be understood on all 
important subjects, but should not be over-emphasized, ~ 
When classes devote a year to American history and 
government, all authorities agree that the two should be. 
correlated as far as possible. Under ordinary conditions, 
however, naturally the major part of the work in civics 
would follow the regular course in history. It therefore 
may be necessary to study the text-book on government as 
a whole after the historical discussions have been completed. 
In this part of the class work the historical facts can be 
reviewed to advantage, and at the same time used to illus- 
trate the topics of the text. Such a correlation of the two 
subjects will make both of them more vital and interesting. 
As stated in the preface, no course in American govern- 
ment can be satisfactory which does not give opportunities 
to investigate the actual work of government in its many 
practical phases. For this investigation, many of the 
vii
-P-A-G-E-9
viti SUGGESTIONS + 
“Questions” at the ends of the chapters can probably be 
used to advantage. Every pupil ought to do sonie addi- 
tional outside work every month,‘in order to gain skill in 
discriminating between important and unimportant facts, 
in making notes, and in formulating reports. With this 
end in view the marginal references and those under the 
head of “Studies” at the ends of the chapters have been 
selected carefully from books and magazines that are easily 
accessible. It will probably be possible, also, for each pupil 
to prepare a more formal paper or give an extended oral 
report upon one of the “ Topics.” 
Much can be done in the class room in studying consti- 
tutions, charters,.sample ballots, and other papers almost 
as useful which can be obtained at but slight expense. In- 
terest may be quickened by holding a legislative session, at 
which bills are presented, debated, and brought to a vote. 
Trials with a judge, jury, attorneys, and witnesses may be 
possible by a little extra preparation and help from outside, 
“f£ necessary. 
The following suggestions may be given for the school 
ibrary. This should have several copies of the state con- 
titution and of the city charter, if the school is located in 
a city. A recent copy of the Congressional Directory and. 
some good newspaper almanac for the current year are 
essential, No library should be without several copies of 
Bryce’s The American Commonwealth, abridged edition, nor 
Hart’s Actual Government; Hinsdale’s The Amertcan Gov- 
ernment, and the author’s American Federal State will un- 
doubtedly be found helpful. The Century series of eight 
volumes entitled “The American State,” edited by Wil- 
loughby, are exceedingly valuable. Some good text-book 
upon the government of the State in which the class resides 
is almost indispensable. Those recently published in Mac- 
millan’s Handbooks of American Government series are excel- 
lent. In fact, if there is no text-book of this character, the 
author would suggest that a copy of Morey’s The Gover
-P-A-G-E-10
SUGGESTIONS ix 
ment of New York be purchased, unless the institutions of 
the State are much more like those described in one of the 
other volumes of that series. Many exceedingly useful 
government publications can be obtained gratis through 
application to the congressman from the district or from 
the bureau by which they are published. They may be 
purchased also from the Superintendent of Documents in 
Washington at a low cost. Among the many other books 
that might be mentioned, The New Encyclopedia of Social 
Reform, Schouler’s Constitutional Studies, Harrison’s This 
Country of Ours, and Wilson’s The State are particularly 
recommended. If the classes are at all large, several copies 
of some of these books may be necessary. 
For other suggestions upon methods and material, the 
student may use to advantage Hart’s Actual Government or 
Hart’s Manual of American History, Diplomacy, and Glovern- 
ment, or the author’s American Federal State. The guides 
to periodical literature are indispensable for reference to 
recent magazine articles.

INTRODUCTION 
CHAPTER I 
GENERAL CHARACTER OF AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
L ‘Purpose and Nature of Government.— Although the pri- 
mary: purpose for which government exists is the protec- 
tion of our lives and property, its work includes so much. 
more that we may truthfully say the object of government 
is t0 ‘protect the citizens of a country and to promote their The primary, 
object'of.” 
government. 
    general welfare. Not only do our governments punish the | 
persons who rob us or do us personal injury, and so prevent 
others from committing similar acts of violence; but they 
make and carry out laws under which we may buy and sell 
goods, loan or borrow money, and make contracts. They 
care for the public health and develop communication with 
other sections by constructing roads and building bridges. 
‘They give a common school education and sometimes col- 
legiaté training at public expense, and often provide us with 
free: Libraries, with free parks, and art galleries. Further 
than that, they conduct great business operations where the 
’ business is of such importance to all the citizens that it ought 
not to: be left to private parties. For example, the national 
government collects, transports, and delivers letters, periodi- 
cals, and books at charges so low that they do not cover the 
cost:-of doing this work. The governments of many cities 
have'established systems of waterworks, and furnish a supply

of pure drinking water at the lowest possible charges. These 
and many other things our governments are doing for our 
protection and benefit, not at intervals, but every day in the 
year. 
Two distinct uses of the word “government” should be 
noted carefully. In a narrow sense, government may mean 
simply che ORGANIZATION composed of sets of officials who care 
Jor the public interests of the citizens. When the word is 
used in that way, we speak of the national government, the 
state government, the local governments, town, county, or 
city, since there are as many distinct organizations as there 
are territorial divisions to be governed. In a broader sense, 
the word is employed, as in the first part of the preceding 
paragraph, to indicate the aurHority to which the task of rul- 
ing is assigned. 
2. Government and the Citizens. — By our forefathers who 
declared their independence of Great Britain, government 
was looked upon somewhat as a necessary evil. They em- 
phasized the dangers of government and minimized its 
benefits. So many of the prejudices of that day have been 
removed by a century and a third of self-government that we 
often go to the other extreme. To-day the benefits and 
advantages are extolled, because we have government “ for 
the people” as well as “by the people.” We often fail to 
appreciate the real needs of our governments and the neces- 
sary support we should give them. We fail to discriminate 
between the governmental work that is wise and that which 
is unwise, between governmental tasks well performed and 
duties ill-performed or neglected. Instead of protesting 
against extravagance on the one hand, and on the other pay- 
ing cheerfully the taxes for necessary work or improvements, 
we either grumble at the financial burdens placed upon us 
by our governments, or indifferently submit to waste and 
bad government. When popular interest is lacking and the 
public offices become filled with selfish or corrupt men who 
use their power for their own advancement, or sacrifice — ' :
-P-A-G-E-32
  GENERAL CHARACTER 3 
the public good for favored interests, we close our eyes to 
facts and assert that our government is the best in the world. 
If the benefits which we should derive from government are 
often lost, and the disadvantages alone are apparent, it.is 
because we fail to draw the line between the duties which 
our government can perform and the work it cannot do, be- 
cause we neglect political duties for those of business or 
society, or because we consider misgovernment normal and 
unavoidable. 
Tae Nerep or GovERNMENT 
3. The Essential Functions of Government.—Some people 
have asked the questions, “ Why do we need governments ?” 
“Cannot most or all of the duties enumerated above (§ 1) be 
performed as well or better without the aid of govern- 
ment?” Even those extremists who believe that govern- 
ment should do as little as possible, freely admit that life and 
property must be fully protected by it, for, if every man may Protection 
of life and 
property. 
take the law into his own hands, we should soon return to — 
that condition of barbarism where might makes right. 
Government is also necessary to enact laws which define 
our legal relations to one another, or which allow us to make 
with other parties contracts or agreements, which the govern- 
ments will compel both them and ourselves to perform. In 
so complex a civilization as ours, the laws relating to these 
subjects must not only be fixed and clearly understood, but 
the rights of every individual under them must be guarded 
zealously, and these duties government alone can fulfill. 
In his admirable book on The State,) Woodrow Wilson 
enumerates eight “constituent” or essential functions of 
government, 
QM The Keeping of order, and providing for the protection of 
pergons and property from violence and robbery. 
(2) The fixing of the legal relations between man and wife and 
between parents and children.

(8) The regulation of the holding, transmission, and interchange 
of property, and the determination of its liabilities for debt or for 
crime. 
(4) The determination of contract rights between individuals. 
(5) The definition and punishment of crime, 
(8) The administration of justice in civil causes. ZZ 
(7) The determination of the political duties, privileges, a and rela- 
tions of citizens. 
(8) Dealings of the State with foreign powers: the preservation of 
the State from external danger or encroachment, and the advance- 
ment of its international interests. 
4 The Optional Functions of Government. — Very few 
people object when government performs these duties; but 
some persons doubt whether government should attempt to 
look after such things as the construction of roads, the 
maintenance of schools, the care of the poor, and many 
others which in times past have been done by each indi- 
vidual for himself, or by voluntary organizations. If we 
consider the difficulties encountered by individuals or as- 
sociations in deciding upon necessary improvements, and in 
securing funds for the work, we shall see why it has been 
found advisable to leave matters of common interest to our 
governments, which are fitted for this work both because 
of their organization and by virtue of the authority which 
they possess, 
As a partial list of these optional or “ministrant” fune- 
tions, Woodrow Wilson gives the following: !— 
(1) The regulation of trade and industry. Under this head I would. 
include the coinage of money and the establishment of standard weights 
and measures, laws against forestalling and engrossing, the licensing of 
trades, ete., as well as the great matters of tariffs, navigation laws, and 
the like. 
(2) The regulation of labor. 
(8) The maintenance of thoroughfares, —including state manage- 
ment of railways, and that great group of undertakings which we em- 
brace within the comprehensive term “ Internal improvements.” “...5: 
1 The State, § 1479.
-P-A-G-E-34
GENERAL CHARACTER 5 
(4) The maintenance of postal and telegraph systems, which is 
very similar in principle to (3). , 
(5) The manufacture and distribution of gas, the maintenance of 
waterworks, etc. : 
(6) Sanitation, including the regulation of trades for sanitary 
purposes. 
(7) Edueation. 
(8) Care of the poor and incapable. 
(9) Care and cultivation of forests and like matters, such as the 
stocking of rivers with fish. 
(10) Sumptuary laws, such as “ prohibition”’ laws, for example. 
5. The Proper Scope of Governmental Duties. — The ex- 
tent to which any country shall permit its governments to 
undertake any or all of the functions just mentioned. depends 
upon its history, its needs, and the wishes of its people. 
In colonial times, when villages were few and smail, when 
there was no manufacturing and little commerce, when a 
simple farm life was the rule, very little governmental su- 
pervision was necessary. Large cities, great trusts, railways 
of continental magnitude, and entirely different standards 
of living have changed all this. At present our govern- 
ments must control and regulate many more actions of the 
citizens than formerly, in order not only to promote their 
welfare, but to give them protection. For example, no one 
doubts the right of the government to pass and enforce all 
proper measures for the health of the community. This 
may lead in crowded cities to regulations for individual 
householders that are very obnoxious. Dealers may be 
obliged to submit to inspection of goods which might injure 
members of the community, and factories are continually 
under supervision to see that the health of the operatives is 
in no wise endangered. “Too little regulation is, like too 
much, a mark of poor government. We must see that there

form a minimum of functions ; the socialist that the State should do every- 
thing for the individual or society. Most people occupy an intermediate

is just enough, and that it is never applied arbitrarily- 
History shows that it will be better for a community to 
Jeave something undone than at one stroke to alter its 
policy radically and undertake important duties for which 
it has had no proper training. In no case should a people 
undertake lightly duties which may seem necessary that cam 
only be performed at a loss to individual freedom. 
6. The Need of National, State, and Local Governments. —— 
No one government can do all the things needed by the 
people, for some subjects, like the making of treaties with 
foreign nations, must be intrusted to a single government 
for the whole United States, in order that the people of New 
York may not have one treaty with France, those of Mlinois 
another, and those of California a third. Other duties, 
such as the making of roads and care of schools, can be prop- 
erly performed only by governments of small districts, like 
towns, cities, or counties. We have, therefore, local govern~ 
ments to look after purely local affairs; state governments to 
make laws on all subjects that ought not to vary greatly 
from county to county, and yet need not be the same 
throughout the United States; and a national government 
which represents us in our dealings with other nations, 
cares for trade relations between the States, coins money, 
and makes the laws that should be the same in Maine as in 
Texas.

7. Our National and State Constitutions. — All of the 
governments in the United States are popular governments — 
that is, the people, acting through the qualified voters or 
legal representatives, decide what the form of each govern- 
ment shall be, what power it shall possess, and in what way 
the government and its powers shall be changed at any 
time. In order, however, that the form and the powers of 
the governments shall remain’ the same until the people

wish them changed, the people of the Nation have adopted ~ 
the very important document called the Constitution of the 
United States, and the people of each State have adopted a 
similar constitution for their State. By these written con- 
stitutions the people have created such governments as they 
think are best fitted to care for the public interests of the 
States and the Nation. The constitutions may be amended 
to meet new needs of the people, but by their rigidity pre- 
vent hasty changes. They cannot be altered by the govern- 
ments, neither can the governments make any change in and canbe 
their own powers. All changes in an old constitution must be ii ar 
_ made by the people, who made that constitution, and who may people. 
abolish the old constitution and have a new one in its place.*

8. Representative Government through Political Parties. — Representa- 
The governments created by the constitutions comprise not oot oa 
only the national government and the central governments of 
the States, but the local governments of the States as well, Hart, 
All of these governments are composed of representatives aons 20. 
who are elected by voters in the territory governed, or of _— 
officials who are appointed by some direct representative of 
the people. Some of the representatives, as the President 
of the United States or the governors of the States, represent 
the whole Nation or State. Others, like the members of the 
lower house of Congress, or practically all members of the 
state legislatures, are chosen from districts. It is the Ameri- 
can practice, when representatives are chosen for any legis- 
lative body, to divide the State into districts which shall 
have, as nearly as possible, the same population. In short, 
1The exact method by which the people are to change any existing con- 
stitution is prescribed in the constitution itself. There is considerable 
variation in the process used to amend the present state and national con- 
stitations, as we can see by consulting §§ 162, 197. .

representative government in America means the representa- 
tion from territorial districts of equal populations. 
These representatives, and officials appointed by them, 
are members of some political party. Whenever an election 
occurs to fill a position, each political party attempts to 
persuade the voters to select a man from its party as the 
people’s representative. Although some elections, especially 
in cities, are not party contests, it can truthfully be said that 
government in the United States is representative government 
of the people acting through political parties. 
9. Citizenship and Its Rights. — Our constitutions not only 
give the form and the powers of the governments, as de~ 
scribed briefly later in this chapter ($$ 13-19), but they treat 
of the very important subject of citizenship, enumerating 
the rights which all citizens possess, rights with which no 
government may interfere. 
The national Constitution in the Fourteenth Amendment, 
adopted in 1868, gives this definition of citizens: “ All 
persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject 
to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States 
and of the State wherein they reside.” Citizenship may ~ 
be acquired therefore by birth in this country or by a process 
of naturalization (§ 291) for natives of other lands. Practi-~ 
cally all of the men, women, and children in the United States 
are CITIZENS. 
The rights of citizens are of such importance that many 
of them are mentioned in the constitutions, in order that no 
one chosen to represent the people shall arbitrarily interfere 
with citizens in the performance of their everyday duties. 
Among these are the right to free speech, religious freedom, 
exemption from search of a home unless accused of crime, 
freedom from arbitrary arrest or extended imprisonment 
without trial, and the right to a free and fair trial by a jury 
of citizens. 
10. The Privilege of Voting. — These constitutions also 
state who may take part in the work of government by
-P-A-G-E-38
GENERAL CHARACTER 9 
voting. Not all citizens are allowed to vote, as some people 
imagine, because most of them are not old enough nor 
sufficiently trained to do so intelligently. Accordingly, only 
those classes of citizens who are especially qualified by 
maturity, experience, and their daily contact with the world, 
are allowed the privilege of voting. At the present time no 
one less than twenty-one years of age is granted this privi- 
lege, and in only four States are women.allowed to vote. 
The qualifications of voters are given in the state consti- 
tutions, as the United States Constitution allows those who 
may vote for state officials to vote also for national officials. 
Aliens who intend to become citizens enjoy the elective 
franchise in some States. (See § 30.) 
11. The Departments of Government.— In order that any 
government may perform properly the work for which it 
has been created by the people, it must have three depart- 
ments. First of all, there must be some body to make laws, 
and this body is called the legislature or the legislative de- 
partment, Then, we must have officials who see that the 
laws are obeyed, and those officials who enforce the laws 
constitute the executive department. Finally, a system 
of courts is necessary so that proper punishment may be 
meted out to those who break the laws, and that persons 
who have suffered loss or injury at the hands of others may 
have an opportunity to secure redress for the wrong done. 
Those courts which interpret the laws are known as the 
judicial department. One of the most distinguishing charac- 
teristics of American government is the almost complete 
separation of these three departments. This separation has 
been made because our people have always believed that the 
liberties of the people would be endangered, if the depart- 
ments were united. 
12. Our Federal System of Government. — Our country is 
governed under two great systems of government, each of 
which has its own constitution or set of constitutions.

people are the Narion and the Srarzs.' Such a division of 
power between state and national governments, which look after 
different interests and work independently, although simply 
supplementing each other, is called a “FEDERAL SYSTEM” Of 
government. This division of the work of governing leaves 
to the national government such matters as making war, 
raising an army and navy, making treaties with foreign 
countries, regulating foreign and interstate trade, admitting 
new States to the Union, and many other things that no one 
State can do for itself, while the governments of the States 
are allowed to make and carry out laws concerning the hold- 
ing and transference of land, laws dealing with marriage 
and divorce, education, the punishment of crime, the incor- 
poration of industrial and most other corporations; in fact, 
with an almost innumerable list of subjects for which uni- 
form laws are not necessary throughout the United States. 
This federalism is perhaps the most distinguishing and im- 
portant feature of our government. 
In some countries, most or all of these subjects last 
named are looked after by the national government, which 
is. then called a centralized government. In the United 
States, however, these powers of government are left with 
the States, and the States cannot be deprived of them ex- 
cept by the people of the whole United States in the cum- 
bersome way provided for the amendment of the national 
. Constitution, so that we have a system that is not central- 
Summary. ized, but which constitutes a form of federalism. - 
The most important characteristics of American govern- 
ment may be summarized as follows: The United States 
has (1) popular government (2) based on the written constitu- 
tion and (8) carried into effect through a system of repre- 
sentation. It is distinguished by (4) a broad citizenship with 
    
be ample protection of citizens’ rights, (5) manhood suffrage,

governed under a central government usually called the “state” govern- 
ment, and under local governments.

and (6) the separation of the departments of government. 
(7) Although the people of the nation are sovereign, the 
Federal System provides that part of the work shall be 
performed by distinct governments, the national and the 
state. . 
Tue National GOVERNMENT 
13, The United States Constitution. — Our national govern- 
ment derives its authority from the people of the United 
States through our national Constitution, which was drafted 
by a convention held in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787, 
and was ratified by conventions elected for that purpose in 
the thirteen States that then composed the Union. This 
Constitution enumerates the different powers that: may be 
exercised by the three departments of the national govern- 
ment, and tells how Congress shall be organized, how the 
President shall be chosen, and what the national judicial 
system shall be like. By it the States are prohibited from 
making war, treaties, or alliances, in order that the States 
may not be able to interfere with the work of the national 
government, Fifteen amendments to this Constitution have 
since been adopted. It will be well to consider the organi- 
zation of the different departments of the government, 
although we shall not study until later the more important 
subject of their powers. 
14. Congress.— The legislative power granted to the na- 
tional government is vested in a Congress of two houses, the 
smaller of which is called the Senate, and the larger the 
House of Representatives The Senate is composed of two 
members from each State who are elected by the state legis- 
lature for a term of six years. The representatives, on the 
contrary, are elected for a term of two years by the voters 
from districts into which the States are divided, the num- 
ber of districts in a State depending upon its population. 
In addition to its gerieral legislative powers, each of the

houses is given certain special powers, for which it is thought 
to be particularly fitted. For example, when the President 
appoints an official to a position, the Senate has the right 
to confirm or reject the appointment, although the House 
of Representatives has nothing to say about the matter. 
15. The Executive Department. A'The execution of the 
Jaws made by Congress is intrusted to the President of the 
United States and assistants appointed by him with the con- 
sent of the Senate. Presidential elections occur in Novem- 
ber of every year divisible by four, and the successful 
candidates for the offices of President and Vice President 
are inaugurated upon the 4th of March in the following 
spring, holding office for four years. ‘he chief assistants 
of the President, such as the Secretaries of State, War, and. 
the Treasury, and others, form his Cabinet and aid him in 
performing his duties. 4 
16. The National Judiciary. All judges connected with 
the national courts are appointed for good behavior by the 
President with the consent of the Senate. Our chief court, 
called the Supreme Court, consists of a chief justice and 
eight associate justices who sit as a single body at Wash- 
ington; but the judges of the lower courts— the Cireuit 
Courts of Appeals, the Circuit Courts, and the District 
Court— try cases in the various cities of the country, so as 
to be nearer the places where the parties to the suit reside. 
State ann Loca GovERNMENT 
17. The State Constitutions. — Each State makes its own 
constitution, the voters electing delegates to a state consti- 
tutional convention, which frames the constitution, and 
then, usually, gives the voters an opportunity to accept or reject it. The state constitution cannot give the state 
government power to do anything denied to the State by the national Constitution. Subject to this limitation, it may grant the state legislature as much or as little power as it
-P-A-G-E-42
GENERAL CHARACTER 13 
pleases, may make the legislature large or small, may have 
the governor elected for a long or short term, and may 
arrange to have the judges either elected by the voters or 
appointed by the governor or the legislature. All of which 
shows that the people of each State havea great deal of 
freedom in looking after their own affairs, though they 
must be careful not to do anything forbidden by the Con- 
stitution of the United States. 
18. Organization of the State Governments. — All of the 
States in the American Union have governments that are 
very much alike. State legislatures are invariably made up 
of two houses, one of which is larger than the other, al- 
though the members of both are elected by the voters in 
districts into which the States are divided. The people 
also elect the governors and the other chief executive 
officials, the remainder being appointed. State judges are 
not so universally chosen by popular election, and their terms 
are apt to be longer than those of the legislators and the 
governors ; but even with the judges, short terms are the 
rule and appointment the exception. 
19. Forms of Local Government.— Local government is 
of several kinds— that of the county, the city, the town, 
the village, and the school district. All of the States are 
subdivided into cownties, but the officials elected in the 
counties devote as much of their time to carrying out state 
Jaws as to looking after purely local affairs. Every city

similar to that of the cities. In the New England States 
and a few others, every county is made up of several towns. 
Each town holds a mass meeting of the voters, at which 
most of the local laws are made and town officers are se- 
lected. In many States the principal political subdivisions 
of the counties are the school districts, which care for the 
most necessary local interests.

CHAPTER II 
THE SELECTION OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS 
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
20. The Two Methods of Selection. — To perform the leg- 
islative, executive, and judicial duties which all of our gov- 
ernments must undertake, several hundred thousand persons 
must be chosen. In general, the most important officials 
are elected by the voters at regular elections, but many 
higher offices-and most of the minor positions are filled by 
persons appointed by some higher elected official or set of 
officials. © 
The system of appointment is used much more in connec- 
tion with the national government than with those of the 
States, counties, cities, and towns. Only the President, Vice 
President, and members of the national House of Represent- 
atives are elected directly or indirectly by popular vote, 
although the United States senators are chosen by the state 
legislatures. All national judges, and national executive 
officials and employees, numbering more than 350,000, are 
appointed. Members of lawmaking bodies are invariably 
elected by the people. These include congressmen, state 
legislators, city councilmen, county supervisors, and town 
selectmen. Election is used for almost all state or local 
judges, and for the most important executive and admin- 
istrative officials of the States and localities. Yet the 
number of persons appointed for state or local positions, 
aside from those connected with schools, probably out- 
numbers the elected officials three to one? 
1 Not all persons connected with any government are called officials, for 
most of them are merely employees whose work involves comparatively 
little responsibility.

21. Terms and Compensation. — It is one of the principles 
of American government that public servants shall be 
elected for short terms of office. It is one of the practices 
that, as far as possible, changes shall be made at frequent 
intervals. This custom, best known as “rotation in office,”? 
satisfies a desire deeply ingrained in American nature, for 
popular rights seem to be protected if any person is pre- 
vented from holding one office several terms in succession. 
We shall notice later that this desire is not realized at all 
fully in many of the governments that we have, although 
it is true that nowhere else in the world, except in Switzer- 
land, are the governments really so dependent on the people 
and so closely in sympathy with them as in the United 
States. : 
In America, to a much greater extent than in other coun- 
tries, public officials are paid. The salaries for the highest 
officers are much smaller than the income that would be 
obtained in other pursuits by the kind of men we wish to 
represent us in these positions, but the salaries attached to 
the less important elected offices are good compared with the 
responsibilities of those positions. One of the results of 
our democratic spirit has been the tendency to make salaries 
equal, so that our lower officials and sometimes appointed. 
employees are as much overpaid as our more responsible 
officials are underpaid? Many offices, however, which 
carry very heavy burdens, are unpaid, the position of school 
trustee being a good example. 
22. Desire for Public Office.— Salary is one of the less 
important inducements offered by the high offices, although 
the principal attraction for the lesser positions. Honor and 
1 The highest salary paid to any official is that given to the President of the United States, $75,000 a year, and, in addition, the use of the White House and payment of many expenses. Cabinet officers receive but $12,000 @ year, and congressmen only $7500. A Tew governors havea salary as high as $10,000 and some expenses, but one gets as little as $1500. Some mayors and city attorneys have large salaries, but, as a tule, the most. responsible local officials are poorly remunerated.
-P-A-G-E-46
THE SELECTION OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS 17 
power count for much more in the chief places of trust. In 
spite of the fact that we Americans dread “one-man power” 
and have arranged our entire scheme of government to pre- 
vent the assumption of despotic authority, prominent publie 
offices offer great opportunities for action. The publicity 
given to a public man makes many an office desirable. 
When the securing of an elective office means the privilege 
of appointing scores or possibly hundreds of men to vacan- 
cies, it will not be neglected, even if the salary is small. 
There are very few elected offices that do not give the in- 
cumbent some share of this patronage, or power of appoint- 
ment, although the position may be so humble that the 
appointee is only a doorkeeper or janitor. It is not strange 
that such opportunities should appeal to the man who places 
private ambition or gain above public service. 
A sum almost as great as the aggregate salaries of all per- 
sons appointed to positions under our governments is dis- 
pensed every year for school buildings and supplies, roads and 
other public improvements, street lighting, transportation of 
the mails, and numerous other subjects. A perfectly proper 
use of these funds which amounts to nearly, if not quite, one 
billion dollars a year, means immense power to those who 
decide for what the money shall be spent. In granting con- 
tracts and in other ways even an honest official may not 
hesitate to increase his influence through the advantages of 
his position. What a dishonest man might do must be 
apparent. 
23. The Steps in Popular Election..-In view of the ad- 
vantages derived from public office, it is not surprising that 
there should be two or more candidates for most positions, 
even though the place bring strife, criticism, and hatred. 
The importance of the subject to the citizen, and especially 
to the voter, becomes apparent when we reconsider the impor- 
tance of the work done by our governments, the number of 
officials elected at the oft-recurring elections, and the dif- 
ficulties of selecting the right men who will continue to

perform their duties in a satisfactory manner. In the fol- 
lowing paragraphs we shall examine the general process of 
election. It will be well to note first the four steps in the 
process. 
When voters goto the polls and cast their ballots, they 
vote for those only who have been nominated for that. office. 
These nominations are made several weeks before the elec- 
tion by conventions held by the political parties or in pri- 
maries of the voters composing the political parties. In the 
campaign, between the nominations and the election, these 
‘nominees or candidates, aided by the very complete organi- 
zation of their party, make every effort to win over the voters 
to their side. After the voters have expressed their prefer- 
ence in the election, the successful candidates are installed in 
office upon the day set by law for assuming their new duties. 
’ 
Nominations ror ELectrive Orrice 
24, Nominating Conventions.— Most candidates for the 
_ Offices which are filled by popular vote are chosen by nom- 
inating conventions of delegates. If the convention. meets 
to nominate candidates for state offices, the delegates are 
chosen usually in county conventions, The county conven- 
tions are in turn composed of delegates elected directly by the 
voters in primaries, These conventions are ordinarily large 
assemblies, even when the district for which candidates are 
selected is small. The most interesting conventions of all, 
those that select nominees for the presidency, are reserved 
for special treatment later (§ 317). 
When the delegates have gathered upon the day selected, 
the convention proceeds to chose a temporary chairman and 
other officers, and to appoint several committees. One of 
these committees decides what delegates have been chosen to 
the convention. If two sets of delegates have been selected. 
from the same district, the convention must admit only one, 
and the committee, by recommending the exclusion of un-
-P-A-G-E-48

desired contestants, may really decide the later action of the 
eonvention. Another committee reports to the convention 
a set of resolutions embodying the party’s views upon public 
questions, while a third proposes the names of the perma- 
nent officers of the convention. "When it has been organized, 
the convention begins its real business of nominating candi- 
dates. If but one name is suggested for any office, the 
secretary is usually instructed to cast a ballot for that 
person. Otherwise, the delegates vote by ballot until some 
one person has a majority of all the votes cast. If the con- 
vention is controlled by the party managers who have se-— 
lected the candidates in advance, the nominations lack inter- 
est, but when there is any doubt, or a decided contest takes 
place, the excitement is intense. 
25, The Primaries. — Most of the candidates for office in 
the smallest districts and many for larger districts are 
nominated directly in primaries. The delegates to all local 
conventions are chosen directly by the primaries and the 
delegates to state and national conventions indirectly by the 
primaries, so that in a sense primaries are the most vital part 
of the system of popular election. The name “primary” is used 
in two different ways. (1) Originally it meant a mass meet- 
ing of voters of a single party within a precinct, the smallest 
district, for the purpose of selecting delegates or nominating 
local candidates. (2) It is used now also to cover the pri- 
mary elections held for the selections of delegates to conven- 
tions, or for the direct nomination of candidates. In this 
primary election, which is similar to a regular election 
(§ 29), members of all parties take part, but no voter may 
vote for the nominees or delegates of more than one party. 
It would naturally be supposed that every voter would 
attend the primaries to which he is eligible, because his 
only opportunities of securing good men for office are at the 
primaries or at the polls on election day. At the election, 
his choice will be limited to the candidates that have been 
nominated, all of whom may be unsatisfactory; but at the Place of the

interests of the party. It is of the first importance, there- 
fore, that every voter attend the primaries of his party, and 
make sure that the right men are chosen. 
26. Direct Nominations.— Because of the dissatisfaction 
with the older method of nomination through conventions 
* which might be controlled by politicians, and in response to 
the general demand that government should be brought close 
to the people, direct nominations have come into use for 
tocal offices in a majority of the States, and for state offices 
in most of the Southern commonwealths, in almost all of 
the Middle Western States, and in those of the extreme 
Northwest.. The names of ali those who desire or will 
accept the nomination for any office are placed on file with 
the city or county. clerk as soon as they have obtained 
the signatures of a certain number of voters. On a 
day set by law a primary election is held, similar in most 
respects to a regular election (§ 29), and the voters are 
allowed to select their candidates for each office to be filled 
at the coming election, provided that no one is permitted 
to vote for candidates of more than one party, in order that 
the members of one party shall not be allowed to influence 
the nominations of another. The candidate of each party 
who receives a greater number of votes than any other 
- candidates of the same party for the same office is de- 
clared the nominee of that party for that office, and his

name appears as such on the official ballot used in the 
regular election. This system gives the voters a somewhat — 
freer choice, but it does not produce satisfactory results un- 
less they vote, and vote intelligently. 
Many of the States make use of the direct primary to in- 
crease public control of the party organizations, forcing the 
parties to choose their committees at these primary elec- 
tions, This should produce party organizations fairly rep- 
resentative of the members of the party. There is little 
doubt that many of the vexed problems of nominations 
for elective office will be solved by perfecting and reform- 
ing the party organization, and, except in city elections, by 
permitting the party leaders to suggest names for most of 
the candidates to be considered at the primaries. The 
direct primary can then be used as a check to secure the 
nomination of the best possible candidates. 
27. The Campaign may occupy the entire time between 
the nominations and the elections, or it may be limited chiefly 
to the month preceding the polling of the votes, every effort 
being made by each party to elect its candidates. The 
campaign is conducted by the permanent party committees, 
or by special executive committees (§ 36) which represent 
the candidates particularly, if the campaign is of sufficient 
importance. In a presidential campaign, for example, there 
is a special national executive committee whose chairman 
for months directs the campaign, and whose members divide 
- the task of persuading or convincing voters. Money must 
be obtained to pay the expenses of printing campaign 
literature and to secure the services of speakers, while personal 
efforts must be used to obtain the support of the “waver- 
ers,” and bring all of the party’s adherents to the polls. 
In a city election the general conduct of the campaign, in- 
cluding the raising and distribution of funds, belongs to the 
city committee, and the ward committees under its charge 
organize clubs, hold meetings, and perform active duties on 
election day. In the campaigns of to-day, fortunately, less

28, Preélection Requirements. — In one half of the States 
all electors who wish to vote must register their names be- 
fore election, showing where they reside and proving that 
they have a right to vote. In the other States, registration 
is usually required only in cities. These registered electors 
ean then vote only at the election booth of the precinct in 
which they live. This enrollment is necessary to prevent 
men from voting in more than one precinct, as the officials 
in charge of the election usually do not have a personal ac- 
quaintance with the voters, except in country precincts. In 
fact, registration lists do not prevent “repeaters” from reg- 
istering under different names in different precincts. Some 
fraud results from a failure to revise lists at intervals, so that 
repeaters often use the names of persons who have moved 
or died. 
In early elections and in England until recently, votes 
were given verbally. The written ballot came into use in 
America during colonial times, but as elections became more 
numerous and democratic, ballots printed by each party for 
its members and open ballot boxes led to a great amount of 
fraud. Reform began in this country about 1888. Most of 
the States have now adopted, with some modification, a 
form of ballot similar to that in use in Australia. The 
names of candidates of each party or ticket are placed in a 
column separate from the candidates of all other parties. 
Sample ballots are sent to the voters by the city or county 
clerks before election, so that an opportunity is given to 
learn the names and investigate the qualifications of the 
candidates.

He then receives a numbered official ballot, which he

with others. With a rubber stamp he places a mark opp 
site the names of the candidates of his choice (or, if per- 
missible, opposite the name of the party, if he wishes to 
vote a “straight” ticket), folds the ballot, and hands it to 
the election inspector. The inspector tears off the number, 
announces the name of the voter, and then deposits the bal- 
lot in the ballot box. The clerk at the same time records 
the fact that the person has voted. In most States some 
towns or precincts use ballot machines on which the woter 
records his preferences by the use of knobs and levers, the 
vote being recorded mechanically by the machine when the 
voter leaves the booth. 
Each party is allowed to havea certain number of “watch-

feetly regular. Any voter may be “challenged” by any 
other voter.on the ground that the former is not eligible to 
vote in that precinct. He must then take oath that he 
has a right, or he will be excluded from voting.

In many States the use of voting machines is permitted by law. In the one shown above all of the candidates on one ticket are in the same horizontal column, all of the 
candidates for any office being in the same vertical column. After closing the curtains 
the voter turns one of the large knobs shown at the left of the cut, This raises all of 
the little pointers in that horizontal column, and completes the process if the voter 
wishes to vote a “straight” ticket. If he desires to vote for other candidates for any 
offices, however, he turns down the pointer in the column in which the office is located 
and turns up the pointer which is immediately above the candidate preferred. In either case he then opens the curtains and the vote is mechanically recorded.
-P-A-G-E-55
THE SELECTION OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS 25 
For almost all offices filled by popular election, only a plurality of 
votes is necessary to elect. Certain of the New England States for- 
merly required a majority over all others for their governors, but as a 
second election was then often necessary, a majority is no longer de- 
manded, except in Vermont, where the legislature is allowed to elect 
the governor if no one has a majority. 
30, Who may Vote.— The qualifications for voters are 
prescribed by the States in their constitutions. The Fif- 
teenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, how- 
ever, prevents the States from denying to citizens the 
right to vote on account of race, color, or previous condition 
of servitude, so that, although the requirements are not the 
same in all the States, the differences are, on the whole, not 
very great. Two thirds of the States permit only citizens to 
take part in elections, but thirteen give the right of suffrage to 
aliens who have declared their intention of becoming citizens. 
In four States — Wyoming, Colorado, Idaho, and Utah— 
women are allowed to vote on the same terms as men. All 
over the country voters must be at least twenty-one years of 
age, and must have been residents of the State a certain 
period, varying from three months to two years, and, of the 
county and precinct a shorter time. 
Persons who are insane or otherwise mentally incompe- 
tent are universally excluded from voting, as are men con- 
victed of some serious crime, for which they have not been 
subsequently pardoned. Inmates of public institutions 
usually, and paupers sometimes, are debarred from the suf- 
frage, and many States demand the prepayment of taxes. 
Efforts have been made to raise the intellectual standard of 
the voters by shutting out those who cannot read or write. 
Some of the Southern States require ability to read, or pos- 
session of a fairly large amount of property. 
Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Delaware, California, Wyoming, 
and the States mentioned below demand an ability to read. Mississippi 
allows men to vote who can understand the Constitution when read 
to them. North Carolina has an educational test, but does not apply Pluralities 
and 
majorities.

  Carolina does not deprive those intellectually unfit if they-own prop-

must own property worth $300, unless they have seen military serv-

tution, or the payment of a state tax not less than one dollar per 
year, unless the individual has seen military service or is the son 
of an American soldier. In Louisiana those may vote who can 
read or write, or who own property assessed at $300, or whose.an- 
cestors voted before 1867. Georgia permits veterans and their de- 
scendants to vote, limiting the suffrage for others to those who can 
read or understand the Constitution or own taxable property worth 
$500. The clauses in five of these constitutions that really exempt 
whites from the disabilities which are supposed to be the same 
for all, are called ‘‘ grandfather clauses.” The United States courts 
Ihave refused to consider cases which might force them to declare 
whether these provisions are contrary to the Fifteenth Amendment.

31. Historical Changes in the Suffrage. — The suffrage re- 
quirements of to-day are the result of a gradual evolution 
extending over nearly three centuries. For our. purpose, it 
will be sufficient to notice the general characteristics of three 
periods in our history. (1) The first includes the seven- 
teenth and eighteenth centuries, during which the right to 
vote was greatly restricted. Asarule, no man was permitted 
to share in the election of public officials unless he was a 
Protestant who owned real estate. In the North, land of a 
certain value was required; in the South, a freehold “of 
a certain size. (2) During the first half of the nineteenth 
century, these property qualifications were rapidly replaced

in this movement for the extension of the franchise, by

the United States, which in 1870 gave the negroes the same 
voting rights as the whites. (8) Since 1870. great progress Since 1870.

to vote being the same as those for men. : 
32, Hlections from Districts. — Practically all of our law- Form and 
making bodies are made up of representatives chosen for use oF ts. 
short terms from districts into which the States, counties, 
and cities are divided. In these cases the real basis of Hart, Ac. 
representation is population, provision being made usually 56,108” 
for reapportionment of members and redivision of districts , 
every ten years, following the national census or special Dealey,J.Q, 
state censuses. It is supposed that the districts used for Annals 
the same elections are nearly equal in population, and are 29 (1907), 
contiguous and often compact, but it is not always easy to Mar Sup 
make them so. , 
There is always great danger that a partisan legislature Gerryman- 
which has the right to redistrict a state, shall rearrange the ‘rns. 
districts for its own benefit, in spite of the laws requiring 
the districts to be equal in population and to be contiguous 
oreven compact. This practice is called “gerrymandering” ; 
and, if permitted, may thwart the popular will by electing, 
through the gerrymandered districts, a legislature which 
does not represent the majority. A usual method in gerry-
-P-A-G-E-58
   
    ‘ ‘Woodburn, 
. and Prob- 
- ems, 18- 
  Pol. Parties 
  28 AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
mandering is to unite as many strong opposition counties as 
possible in one district, thus allowing the party in power to 
elect its representatives from surrounding districts by fair 
pluralities. Good historical examples of gerrymandered. 
districts are the odd-shaped Massachusetts district, in con- 
nection with which the name “gerrymander” was first 
used nearly a century ago, and the famous “shoestring ” 
district in Mississippi of more recent date. 
33, Proportional Representation.— It is believed by many 
students of political affairs that the evils of gerrymander- 
ing, and those of unequal representation as well, can be 
avoided by some form of proportional representation. By 
having the districts sufficiently large so that many repre- 
sentatives are chosen from each district, each party can elect 
. from this district a number of representatives in proportion 
to the vote cast for its ticket. If the plan can be made 
to work, a much more just representation of parties in 
the legislatures will be the result. The chief obstacle to 
the adoption of proportional representation seems to be the 
strong attachment of Americans to the practice of electing 
from a single district one legislator who is a resident of 
that district —a practice which, in the opinion of a very 
high authority upon the American government, is a chief 
cause of the defects of our legislative bodies. 
Hlinois is the only State that has made adequate trial of propor- 
tional representation for state offices. There are fifty-one senatorial 
districts in each of which one senator and three representatives are 
chosen. Every voter may cast one ballot for a state senator and three 
for representatives, casting all three for one person, or for different 
ones, as he prefers. The districts are, however, too small to afford a 
fair test of the merits of the system.

THE SELECTION OF PUBLIC OFFICIALS 29 
persons whom they wish, is a serious misfortune. If any 
set of men, by using undue influence, bribery, force, or 
fraud, can defeat these wishes of the people, they have to 
that extent injured our political system. For these reasons, 
laws have been made, or have been proposed, which will 
protect the honest many from the corrupt few. Only a few 
years ago, before the Australian ballot was adopted, it was 
almost impossible for a man to vote secretly, as partisan 
workers were allowed free access to the polling places, and 
there was little difficulty in learning for which party the 
vote was cast. The buying of votes, both before and at 
election, was very much more common than it is now. 
Often election returns were tampered with. These and 
other abuses have been largely abolished, because the public 
has been aroused to the magnitude of the wrong and has 
insisted upon better laws and a strict enforcement of them. 
Among the means used to prevent bribery of voters, es- 
pecially prominent are the “corrupt practices acts,’ which 
require the different candidates to file with the state secre- 
taries of state or county clerks after election, a complete 
statement of all money they have expended. Some party 
committees voluntarily publish reports of their receipts and 
" expenditures, because of the popular opposition to the 
abuses of an earlier day. 
35, Responsibility and Removal of Hlected Officials.— All 
popular governments should provide adequate means not 
only for the full and free expression of the popular wishes 
in elections, but for enforcing a proper amount of respon- 
sibility among public officials. The chief dependence in 
times past has been on short terms and frequent elections. 
These have acted as a check on prolonged abuse of powers, 
giving the people opportunity to replace inefficient or un- 
worthy public servants. 
Laws exist for the national government and in most of 
the States which provide for the removal of officials guilty 
of open bribery or other forms of corruption. That these Hart, Actual

When an official grossly betrays public interests intrusted 
to his charge, even though he is not guilty of law breaking 
except by violating his oath of office, resignations are some- 
times, though not often, obtained through the pressure of 
public opinion. Valuable as public sentiment may be in 
enforcing responsibility — and it is undoubtedly the strong- 
. est force that can be exerted —it usually fails to prevent

A comparatively new means of forcing elected officials 
to observe the wishes of their constituents is the “recall.” 
When an official has failed to do as his people wished, the 
recall permits a certain percentage of the voters in his dis- 
trict-to ask for another election in which the incumbent 
must compete on equal terms with other candidates if he 
wishes to retain his position for the remainder of the term 
for which he was elected originally. The recall has not 
been adopted extensively, but is an effective although rather 
dangerous instrument for enforcing responsibility. The 
problem would be less serious than it is, if more care and 
interest were taken in selecting officials.

36. The Importance of Party Activities. —- The importance 
of the work done through the political parties must be ap- 
parent from the preceding sections, for government in the 
United States means government by the people to a large 
extent acting through political parties. The electors must 
organize not only to nominate candidates, but to secure 
their election, and the political party has furnished the

best form of permanent organization for those persons who 
hold the same views on public questions or who desire to 
act together. It would be impossible for the American” 
people to govern our country without some means like 
political parties for developing and expressing public senti- 
ment as well as for the great task of filling the numerous 
public offices. The parties have done and are now doing 
an inestimable service in uniting the people, in preventing 
state isolation and sectionalism, and by creating a spirit 
of harmony in the actual working relations of state and 
national governments — the two great divisions of our fed- 
eral system (§ 12). 
In order to perform its important work in connection 
with the selection of public officials, each party maintains 
a permanent organization consisting of committees, and tem- 
porary nominating bodies called primaries or conventions. 
As we have already abserved how primaries and conventions 
are composed, and what methods they use in nominating 
candidates (§§ 24-26), we need consider only the party 
committees. 
37, The Permanent Party Committees are composed of 
~ representatives elected by the members of the parties for 
terms of two to four years. The ward committees, the city 
committees, and the county committees are supposed to be 
chosen in the primariés, while the members of the state 
committees are selected by county conventions. The na- 
tional committees of each party consist of one member 
from each State, elected by the delegates from that 
State to the national conventions which nominate can- 
didates for President and Vice President. Reélection of 
committeemen is the rule, so that the committees are more 
permanent bodies than our county boards or state legisla- 
tures. As these committees may hold sessions at any time, 
and as the local committees usually act in connection with 
the state and national committees, each party has an organi- 
zation of considerable power and efficiency. Party

Just before each important election, special executive

These may be sub-committees of the permanent’ commit-

lar committees, for political parties, as a rule, subdivide 
the work to be done and secure the codperation of their 
different organizations in such a way as to obtain a maxi- 
mum of results. 
38 The Work of the Party Committees includes the call- 
ing of primaries and conventions, and the management of 
the conventions and election campaigns. They decide what 
voters shall be allowed to attend any “regular”. primary, 
frequently using this power to exclude members of their 
own party who oppose the wishes of the committees. They 
usually propose to the primaries lists of names, popularly 
known as “ slates,” and use every means to secure the élec- 
tion of these men as delegates. Conventions are frequently 
dominated by the committees in the same way, especially 
when a committee is working for itself and not for the 
_ party. During the campaign, the committees are very ac-

votes for the party candidates. Because of the complete- 
ness of the committee organization, and the harmony with 
which the party works together, the whole system of party 
committees is frequently known as the “machine.” 
The task of raising money which is assigned to the 
campaign committees often taxes the utmost ingenuity of 
the party managers. Formerly, speakers and other partisan 
workers gave their services expecting to be repaid by offices, 
if the party was successful, but the gradual abandonment 
of the spoils system (§ 43) has compelled a change of 
methods. A generation ago an important source to party 
revenue was the onforced contributions which all office- 
holders were required to give —a custom broken up by the 
first attacks on the spoils system. Revenue to-day comes

chiefly from disinterested party men of considerable public 
spirit, from the candidates, who expend less personally

party. Many corporations contribute to the treasuries of © 
both grea parties, and are therefore in a position to ask 
favors in any event. The legitimate expenses of some cam- 
paigns are enormous, the expenditures of the national com- 
mittees reaching the millions and occasionally covering 
eight figures. Frequently some money is used for the 
corruption of voters, especially in great cities with a large 
foreign population. . 
39, The Parties and Public Office.— As public office is the 
chief goal of party effort, the success of our republican 
government depends to a great extent on (1) whether the 
party organizations depend on the rank and file of the party 
voters, and (2) whether the “ machine ” uses proper methods. 
If the party managers nullify the will of the party in any 
of the three vital stages of popular election —the primary, the 
convention, or the election —there is no longer truly popular 
government. Little is gained by the enactment of good 
election laws, if few voters are allowed to attend the pri- 
maries, if the primaries are “packed,” or a machine “slate ” 
is “railroaded ” through a nominating convention. Efforts 
have been made in recent years to make the party more 
truly representative of the people by passing primary elec- 
tion laws and direct nomination laws which place primary 
elections under the direct supervision of the government, but, 
as no scheme is self-operating, and as organized effort is essen- 
tial for success under any conditions, good government and 
popular government do not necessarily follow these reforms 
in the methods used. 
An inducement even greater than that offered by elective 
office, because less subject to popular control, is that pre- 
sented by the large number of appointive positions. More

‘The ‘‘ boss.” governments, very few of whom are selected solely or chiefly | 
because of ability. Thus, at present, patronage running up 
into hundreds of millions a year is the reward not so much 
of the persons elected as of the power behind the throne— 
the machine. The immense influence wielded because of 
the control over so many places, coupled with the advan- 
tages that may be derived from expending one billion 
dollars a year for other purposes, has developed and main- 
tained the machine organization. The temptation to turn 
these party organizations into close corporations has, conse- ~ 
quently, been too strong to be resisted, except in the rural 
districts and a few cities, so that the committees that were 
meant to serve their party have more often come to domi- 
nate it. 
40. Bosses and Rings.—-This misuse of power in domi- 
nating appointments and elections, as well as in the making 
of laws, is the great danger of popular government through 
parties. Organization i is essential for carrying on the work. 
Success may require and usually does require that the 
organization be so complete that it responds quickly to the 
commands of its managers, as any army does to the orders 
of its general. If the managers form a “clique” deter- 
mined to use the party organization for selfish ends, these 
partisan dictators form what is called a “ring.” A striking 
instance of the enormous power that may be wielded by a 
ring is given by the famous Tweed Ring, which controlled 
the government of New York City for several years, during 
which more than $100,000,000 from the city treasury was 
, wasted or stolen. 
“Ina ring there is usually some one person who holds 
more strings in his hand than do the others.... His

superior skill, courage, and force of will make him, as such 
gifts always do make their possessor, dominant among his 
fellows. An army led by a council seldom conquers; it 
must have a commander-in-chief who settles disputes, 
decides in emergencies, inspires fear or attachment. The 
head of the ring is such a genera). He dispenses places, 
rewards the loyal, punishes the mutinous, concocts schemes, 
negotiates treaties. He generally avoids publicity, prefer- 
ring the substance to the pomp of power, and is all the more 
dangerous because he sits, like a spider, hidden in the midst 
of his web. He is a boss.” Boss rule is chiefly objection- 
able because it represents an extreme concentration of power, 
with comparatively little chance of enforcing responsibility, 
although in the long run no boss can maintain his position 
in the face of popular opposition. 
41. The Voter and Political Parties.— Every voter must 
decide for himself several important questions regarding 
his relation to the political parties. Shall he remain inde- 
_ pendent of all the parties, voting first with one and then 
with another, or shall he identify himself with one party ? 
Will it be best for him to vote always with his party? If 
not, when shall he espouse the cause of his political op- 
ponents, or vote for some other candidates? Many earnest 
citizens believe that, by holding aloof from all parties, they 
can be independent and vote for the best candidates with- 
out prejudice. They, of course, are debarred from taking 
part in the primaries of any party, as they belong to none. 
Some corrupt men also neglect to ally themselves with any 
party, but vote for the one which offers them the best 
inducement at a particular election. 
The majority of the voters, however, are party men, some 
of whom are bound to their party by the strongest of all 
ties, those of sentiment. Many of these men believe in the 
motto, “our party, right or wrong,” and support it at all 
times and under all circumstances, even when the nominees

THe APPOINTMENT OF PuBLIc OFFICIALS 
42. Appointments and Removals.—In none of our gov-. 
ernments are all officials selected by popular vote, but the 
majority of the persons who hold office through appointe 
ment are employees rather than officials, although many. 
who have duties of the greatest importance are appointed. 
A few of these appointed persons are connected with the 
legislative branch of the government, a larger number be- 
long to the judiciary, but an overwhelming majority have 
executive or administrative duties. Almost all high offi- 
cials are chagen by the chief executive of the government. to 
which the position belongs, that is, by the President, gov- 
ernor, or mayor, with the advice and consent of the national 
or state senate or of the city council. This division of respon- 
sibility frequently leads to real appointment by some mem- 
ber of the legislative body instead of by the chief executive, 
so that no blame can be attached for poor selections and no 
eredit given for meritorious appointments, Less important 
places are filled either by the head of the department or 
. 1 The term administrative will be used as practically synonymous with 
the word executive, although it refers to subjects like finance, education, 
or’public improvement, which involve the execution of law very little, but 
its application to a. marked degree.

and ability to cobperate with a chief are qualities that can 
never be determined by any set of rules. The best results 
will never be obtained until we can trust and depend on 
the judgment and integrity of the men whom we elect to 
manage our public affairs.

STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
CHAPTER ITI 
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 
45, Introduction. — The state and local governments that we have 
to-day are in form not very different from the governments which 
existed in the different colonies before we became independent of 
Great Britain. .The chief difference is that whereas most of the 
officials were appointed then, they are now elected ; that is, the -goyern- 
ments have become more democratic. The-beginning of the local 
governments can, however, be traced through many changes from the 
earliest semi-democratic Teutonic settlements in England. The most 
important periods for both the local and the central governments of 
the States were (1) the seventeenth century, in which English local 
government with important modifications was transplanted to Amer- 
ica and the colonial governments were developed into real governments 
with distinct executive, legislative, and judicial departments; and 
(2) the changes in the half century following independence when. the 
original States remodeled their old colonial governments and new States 
in the West adopted forms of_local and central governments even 
more like those of the present.

meetings of all freemen able to bear arms, in hundreds composed of several 
towns, which had courts composed of representatives from the towns, and 
in shires, each of which had an alderman and a shire court composed of 
representatives from the hundreds. As the kings became more powerful, 
these local officials and bodies were no longer elected. The name county 
came into use in place of shire, while the parishes corresponded fairly well 
to the older towns. .

accustomed to take a fairly active part in local government in their 
parishes before leaving the mother country. In most of their parishes, 
those who paid rates or taxes were allowed to elect the parish officers, 
and to decide how much money should be expended within the parish. 
The chief officials, called vestrymen, had charge of most local affairs, 
both church and secular. Besides these, however, there were local 
police officers known as constables, and the overseers of the poor, the 
latter being chosen quite frequently by the vestrymen. 
Since the king appointed most of the county officers, the people had 
touch less to do with the government of the English counties than with 
that of the parishes. The chief officials were the sheriff, who executed 
the decrees of the courts and attended to financial matters ; the lord- 
lieutenant, who was the king’s military representative in the county, 
and in charge of the militia; and the justices of the peace, who not 
only had the power to try cases as a court or as individual justices, but~~ 
made local laws, looked after the highways and bridges, and super- 
vised the action of the parish authorities. On account of the number 
of its tasks, the government of the counties was of the greatest im- 
portance, but the people had practically no share in the county govern- 
ment, although the king usually selected the officials from the land- 
holding aristocracy of the respective counties. 
47. The Early Settlements in Virginia. — The first permanent 
English settlements in America were made in what is now the State 
of Virginia, beginning in 1607. It was not long before the growing of 
tobacco became the chief industry of the colony, As the valleys were 
broad and fertile, and slow-flowing, navigable rivers were numerous, 
each tobacco plantation had its own wharf from which its tobacco could 
be shipped direct to England. Towns were therefore small and few 
in number, the population being scattered over a wide area. This 
produced two important results. (1) Since people did not live close 
together, county government was necessary, whereas parish government 
was not, and the county government was practically modeled after that 
of England, with justices of the peace and sheriffs appointed by 
the governor instead of the king, the government was very undemo- 
cratic in character, (2) The large estates developed an aristocracy 
of landowners, who in time gained the right to nominate certain per- 
sons for vacancies in the county offices, the governors selecting one of 
the nominees. 
48. The Local Government established in Massachusetts, — 
Massachusetts and, in fact, most of New England was settled by Puri- 
tans who came to this country in order that they might escape the 
arbitrary government of Charles I and his ministers. Between 1630
-P-A-G-E-71
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 43 
and 1640 the Church of England tried to make the methods of con- 
ducting church services more elaborate and more uniform throughout 
England. This was so distasteful to the Puritans that many entire 
congregations emigrated to America. On the shores of the numerous 
Massachusetts harbors, or in the narrow valleys, these congregations 
Jocated, each with a settlement of its own. The homes of the mem- 
bers wereclustered around the meeting-house, and all were surrounded 
by a stockade to protect them from the Indians. Town meetings were 
held frequently at the church to look after both religious and town 
business, all of the church members being allowed to take part. So 
these Massathusetts towns were from the first little democracies, in 
which each man had a@ voice and a vote in regard to subjects so dis- 
similar as the election of a pastor and the building of a bridge. Their 
government in colonial times was not greatly different from that of 
the New England towns to-day (§ 63). 
49. The Township-county Government of the Middle Colo- 
nies.— The middle colonies either came under English rule or were 
settled so much later than those of New England and the South that 
their local government was largely an imitation of and a combination 
of those in use to the north and south of them. In New York, the 
colony was divided into counties before townships were created. The 
latter had town officers and town meetings, but many of the duties 
performed in New England by the selectmen were in New York as- 
signed to @ county board composed of one supervisor elected from each 
township. . . 
In Pennsylvania, the township was introduced even later than in 
New York. It never obtained a very strong hold, for most of the 
duties connected with local government were intrusted to a board of 
three county commissioners elected by the voters of the whole county 
— the only really democratic county government of colonial times.

50. Classes of Colonies. — There were three classes of English 
colonies in America: (1) the Royal, in which the governor was ap- 
pointed directly by the King, and over which the King had direct and 
very great control ; (2) the Proprietary, the governors of which were 
selected by proprietors, to whom the King had granted the land within 
the colony and certain privileges over its government ; and (3) the 
Charter colonies, each of which continued to be governed in accord~ 
ance with charters given them by English kings. The two purely

little republics, for the people elected the governors as ‘well as the 
legislatures, whereas in the other colonies, the upper houses: of the 
legislatgres (except in Massachusetts), the governors, and the judges 
were chosen without consulting the people, and could not be removed. 
or controlled by the people. Most of the colonies, however, had 
charters during the early part of their history, so that practically all 
had had'some experience with these fundamental written laws which 
later grew into the written constitutions now found in all of the States. 
Tn 1760, the only pure Charter colonies were Connecticut and Rhode 
Island. Massachusetts approached the Charter form, but had a gov- 
ernor appointed by the Crown. Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Mary- 
land were Proprietary; the rest were Royal. 
51. Thé Colonial Government.—The powers of the governor 
varied considerably in the different colonies, being greater in the Royat 
than in the Charter colonies, He had very great power in legislation, 
for he usually appointed the upper house of the legislature, and might 
be able to decide how many members each county or town should 
sénd to the lower or popular house of the legislature. Moreover, he 
had at all times an absolute veto upon any bills passed by both houses. 
He usually summoned and dissolved the legislature. All judges and 
most other colonial officials were appointed by the governor. He had 
charge of the military forces, the disposal of public lands and of many 
other important subjects that we should now leave entirely to the 
legislature. These powers were theoretical rather than practical, es- 
pecially during the later colonial period. 
In the Royal and Proprietary colonies, the governors held office as 
long or as short a time as the King or proprietors wished, just as the 
judges of the same colonies held office during the pleasure of their 
respective governors, In the Charter colonies, the usual term for the 
governors was one year, but as reélection was the rule, the governors 
remained in office longer than the ordinary royal representative. 
“Except in three colonies, the legislatures were composed of two 
houses, - The upper.houses, which were small, acted both as part of 
the legislatures and as governors’ councils. In most of the colonies, 
the members of the upper houses were appointed by the governors, 
although in Connecticut and Rhode Island they were chosen by the 
people, and in Massachusetts by the lower house. 
The members of the lower houses of the legislatures, known as the 
assemblies, were everywhere elected for a term of one year by the 
voters of the colonies. Only a small proportion of the population 
voted at all, however, as the colonial laws required that a man be a

52, The Development of the Colonial Assemblies. — The as- 
semblies formed the popular branch of the legislatures, and their strug- 
gle with the governors for power was of especial value in the development 
of our present state governments, The first assembly to meet in 
America was that of Virginia, composed of two representatives from 
each of eleven towns or plantations, and elected in 1619. This and 
the early assemblies of the other colonies sat at first with the govern- 
or'’s assistants, taking little part in the discussions, and only gradually 
exerting an influence upon the making of laws. In time, by asserting 
themselves, they gained the right to si¢ apart from the assistants and 
to vote separately upon all proposed laws. That is, each assembly 
formed a distinct house of the legislature. All obtained in addition 
the right to decide how much money should be raised by the colonies 
through taxation. Many of them tried also to gain the exclusive 
power to expend money as well as to raise it, and some of them suc- 
ceeded. In Massachusetts, for example, the assembly refused to vote 
a regular salary for the governor of the colony, but passed each year a 
bill appropriating an amount for his expenses. Before the Revolu- 
tionary War these popular assemblies had made good their claim to a 
share in the colonial government not second to that of any other branch 
of that government.

When, in 1775, the colonies objected to the way in which Great Britain 
attempted to govern them, and war broke out between the colonies and. 
the mother country,:some of the more unpopular of the royal governors 
and other officials found it necessary to fiee to loyal British possessions. 
The assemblies in those colonies applied to the Second Continental 
Congress,'then in session (§ 177), asking what they should do, Con- 
gress advised them, and, later (May 10, 1776), advised all of the colo~ 
Dies, to, orm complete governments such as the people thought best 
suited to their needs, Acting on these suggestions, the assemblies 
either passed bills which arranged for new governments with which 
the King had nothing to do, or they asked the people to elect delegates 
to conventions whose sole work should be to make constitutions -for 
the néw States —for they were no longer colonies. Connecticut and 
simply kept the charters that they had used for over a 
slight but necessary modifications, the former not

54. The State Constitutions. — The conventions called to frame 
constitutions for the new States had no models to guide them in their 
work except the colonial charters. It was natural, then, that they 
should copy the charters to some extent, and that they should provide 
for governments like those to which they had been accustomed, giving 
their trusted assemblies the power which the King had formerly ex- 
ercised of appointing the governors, and leaving the selection of judges 
as well to the legislatures. Having completed the constitutions, the 
conventions declared the constitutions to be in force, and adjourned. 
Virginia was the first State to be dissatisfied with such a constitution, 
for a week before the Continental Congress passéd the Declaration of 
Independence (July 4, 1776), her convention adopted a constitution, ~ 
including a Dill of the rights of individuals with which the new govern— 
ment should never interfere, and a declaration of independence, as 
well as a frame of governmént. Almost all of the later constitutional 
conventions of the Revolutionary period followed her example by 
adopting bills of rights in addition to articles setting forth the form and 
powers of the departments of government, For Massachusetts, the 
home of the town meeting, the convention went even farther, and swb— 
mitted the completed constitution to the voters of the State for their 
ratification, thus giving the people a real share in the work of constitu. 
tion making. This practice came into use in most of the States after 
1820. 
55. Changes in the State Governments, —in 1776, the people 
were afraid to trust their governors and judges, because of the experi- 
ence they had had with those officials in colonial timés, so they gave the 
legislatures extraordinary powers. At first no law passéd by a legis- 
lature could be vetoed by a governor, To the legislatures was also. 
intrusted almost the whole power of appointing public officials. The 
history of the state legislatures since the Revolution ts to alarge extent 
the history of the restrictions placed upon the lawmaking body. The 
people soon saw the necessity of some check such asa veto; but instead. 
of giving the governors the power to entirely prevent bills from be~ 
coming laws, as was possible in colonial times, they allowed two thirds 
or three fourths of the members in each house of the legislature to pass 
bills over the governor’s veto. The legislature’s power has been still 
farther decreased by forbidding the passage of laws which apply to a 
single locality or to one person, ordinarily called Jocal and special 
laws (§ 90), 
The governors and their assistants, on the contrary, are being given 
a constantly greater part in the work of the state government. All of 
these officials were at first chosen by the legislatures except inthe New
-P-A-G-E-75
HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT 47 
England States, in which the governors were elected by the people. 
Before 1830, however, popular election of the governors became cus- 
tomary, and since the middle of the nineteenth century the universal 
practice has been to elect the secretaries of state, the controllers, and 
other executive officials at the same time as the governor. 
The change from an appointive judiciary, which prevailed every- 
where during the eighteenth century, to the elective one of the present, 
was much slower and less complete than in the case of the executive 
officials. Many of the older States still have some of their judges ap- 
pointed by the governors, or the legislatures, But very few States re- 
tain the older custom of selecting judges for good behavior, the terms 
in a majority of the States seldom exceeding ten years for the justices 
of even the highest courts. 
56, Influences affecting the Local Government established 
in the Newer States, -—~ There are three important influences which 
have affected the kind of local government that has been adopted in 
the Western States. (1) Most of the West has been settled by people 
from the Eastern States, who naturally favored the system of local 
government to which they had been accustomed. As the migrations 
ordinarily followed the parallels of latitude, the Southwest adopted 
the county form of government and the Middle West one with both 
townships and counties. 
(2) At the beginning, villages were nowhere numerous, as the first 
settlers of the West were farmers living upon separate farms of con- 
siderable area, With such a scattered population, county government 
was the only feasible one, even for the men of New England, until 
enough persons were living within a small district to make town gov- 
ernment possible. We find, therefore, that in States like Illinois, 
Towa, and Nebraska, there was at first no attempt to establish town- 
ship government, but Jater the more populous‘sections were allowed 
to organize township governments wherever the majority of the voters 
within the township desired. 
(8) The third influence that has affected Western local government 
is the congressional township. Almost all of the land in the newer 
States was once under the control of Congress, which had it surveyed 
into townships six miles square, cach of which was composed of thirty- 
six sections (§ 279). One or two of these sections in each township 
were given to the States by Congress for the support of schools in the 
township. In fact, the congressional townships were often made school 
districts with school officers elected at school meetings, which were like 
town meetings, only less important. Later, road commissioners and 
overseers of the poor were chosen by the voters of the congressional Schouler,

CHAPTER IV 
NC. TOWN AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT 
57, Local Government in the United States.— At the 
present time, we have three types of local government in 
the United States: (1) the town type, (2) the county type, 
and (8) the compromise type. In the six New England 
States, the town with its town mectings still looks after all 
of the important local needs of the inhabitants. In the 
South, the counties and their officials take full charge of 
local affairs, for many of the counties are scarcely subdi- 
vided even into school districts. But in the majority of 
the States, the compromise system prevails, each county 
having townships with a few unimportant duties, while all 
of the other local public business is transacted by the county 
officers, 
In studying local government, we must not forget that our 
local governments are but parts of the systems of state gov- 
ernment, The local governments derive their authority, not 
from. the people of the localities, but from the people of the 
whole State. The local governments are, therefore, one set 
of. agents carrying ‘out the wishes of the people of the i. 
States; the other set of agents being the central gov 
ments of the States. Our local governments are chi 
cupied with the administration of laws made by 
legislature and of ordinances passed. by the county anditown 
boardg.. Few of the local officials are called upon to deal 
with great questions of public policy, but all are obliged to 
devote their attention to a multitude of details in caring for 
the health of the people, in laying out roads and construct

business, besides looking after numerous other matters of 
More or less importance. 
County GOVERNMENT 
58. The Character of the County. — Every State is divided into 
areas called counties, of a size suitable for applying state laws. In a 
new State the location of county boundary lines is arranged by the 
legislature. After boundaries have once been fixed and the county 
seats selected, a legislature cannot arbitrarily move a county seat nor 
divide a county into two or more counties, as the population becomes 
more dense, but must first obtain the consent of the voters of the 
original county to the change, 
In order that public business may be transacted, power is given the 
counties as public corporations to acquire land at the county seat for 
the erection of a courthouse, a county jail, and other necessary build- 
ings, to assess and collect certain kinds of taxes, to collect their debts 
and enforce demands by bringing suit against individuals or private 
corporations, and to sustain suits if any one has a claim against them. 
As townships do not exist in the South, or are of so little importance 
that they are scarcely worth considering, the county officials are obliged 
to look after matters left in the other States to both the towns and the 
counties. This task is made easier by the small size of the Southern 
county. In Kentucky, for example, the average area of the 119 
counties is less than 340 square miles, while in Minnesota the average 
county is three times as large. 
Just as in Virginia in colonial times, the chief county officers. in 
some of the Southern States are justices of the peace, who are judges 
at one time and who form a county board at another. Most of the 
Southern counties, however, are now governed as in most of the other 
States by commissioners, aided by sheriffs, county clerks, assessors, tax 
collectors, treasurers, and others, The duties of officials bearing these 
names are much the same in the South, the North, and the West, for 
only in New England, where the counties are overshadowed by the 
towns, is the work of the county unimportant. . 
59. The Selection of County Officials. — It is difficult for us to 
realize now that less than a century ago, almost if not quite all of the 
county officials were appointed by either the governors or the legisla- 
tures, Nowadays the important places are filled by popular vote, and
-P-A-G-E-80
TOWN AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT 51 
the lesser positions through appointment by the people’s elected repre- 
sentatives, The state government usually decides what county offices 
there shall be, what duties belong to each, and what salary each carries 
with it, but it cannot interfere with the people’s choice of their offi- 
cials. Because of the administration of practically all of our state and 
local laws by local officials, our counties havea large degree of freedom 
in deciding how severely they shall enforce any state laws, This pos- 
sibility gives them what is usually considered the most vital form of 
local self-government in existence. This is made possible by the 
system of local elections with responsibility to the people of the local- 
ity alone. 
Almost all of the officials mentioned in the following sections are 
elected by the legal voters of the county for periods of two, three, or 
four years, Their compensation varies greatly in different parts of 
the country, but is on the whole more liberal in proportion to the 
magnitude of their duties than is that of the state officials. 
60, The County Board. — Every county has a supervisory 
body which makes most of the county ordinances and over- 
sees the actions of the other officials.. The members of the 
county board may be known as commissioners, supervisors, 
Justices of the peace, or by other names. They usually num- 
ber only three or five, and are elected either from the whole 
county, from districts into which the county is divided for 
the purpose, or in some States from the townships. As a 
board their chief duties are to divide the county into school 
-and road districts and even into townships, to lay out 
public highways, to construct bridges, to look after the Asbley, Am.

poor, to erect public buildings, and, most important of all, . 
to determine the amount of money needed by themselves 
and others to do the work of the county, and to supervise 
its expenditure. 
61, Other County Officials. — There are ordinarily county 
judges who are really state officials (§ 93), although elected 
by the voters of each county. The decisions of these judges, 
and of all higher state courts, that must be executed within 
the county, are carried into effect by the sheriff, who, by 
virtue of this duty and the more general one of maintaining 
peace and order, is the most powerful of the county officials. — Judges and

  Two types 
of town 
ment.° 52 AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
  Most of the revenue needed to maintain the government 
of an American county is derived from the general property 
tax (§§ 149-152). This is usually assessed by township as- 
sessors, but is paid to county tax collectors. When collected, 
the tax money is turned over to the treasurer, who places 
certain amounts in the general fund, in the highway fund, 
the school fund, and various others, in accordance with in- 
structions from the county board. This is not paid out ex- 
cept upon written order from the auditor, or of the county 
clerk in some States. Ifa school janitor is to be paid, he 
first receives from the school trustees a warrant or demand 
which will be cashed by the treasurer when the auditor in- 
dorses it, or issues for it a new demand. 
The records of the county board, the proceedings of the 
eourts, and other official papers are preserved by the county 
derk. When a suit in which the county is interested, or a 
criminal case is being tried in the county courts, the. in- 
terests of the county are represented by the attorney or his 
assistants. Upon the county superintendent of schoola. de~ 
volves the task of visiting schools and regulating: the 
eounty school system, and often of superintending the. dis- 
tribution of school moneys. The coroner, with the aid of a 
jury, investigates the causes of violent or mysterious deaths. 
All deeds, mortgages, and other business papers for whose 
validity a record. is necessary, are copied by the recorder. 
. Many States have county surveyors to look after the publie 
lands, separate overseers of the poor, public administrators 
who take charge of the estates of persons dying without 
wills, and other officials, 
Town Government 
62, General Character of the Town. — There are in the United 
States two distinct kinds of towns. One of these does much or most 
of the work consigned by the state government to the localities, and is 
a public corporation, with the right to do business in the courts and 
outeiie in a corporate capacity. The other, wore often called a town
-P-A-G-E-82
’ 
TOWN AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT 53 
ship, has so few duties that it is scarcely considered necessary to grant 
it the power of a corporation, as it is merely a convenient area for the 
lowest courts and possibly for school or tax purposes. The first type 
of town is found fully developed only in New England ; the second ex- 
ists most commonly in the extreme West and in some of the Southern 
States. 
63 New England Town Government. -—- The essential fea- 
ture of New England town government is the mass meot- 
ing of the voters, held at least once a year in the town hall. 
At the town meeting the men elect public officers, vote taxes, 
authorize important enterprises, and express approval or 
disapproval of the acts of the town officials during the pre- 
ceding year. The voting citizens are thus enabled to keepin 
close touch with the public activities of the town and to in- 
surea careful if not asuccessful management of public affairs. 
The town officials in New England at least are very 
numerous, as the town must perform work that in other 
sections is left to the county. The town in its corporate 
capacity is represented during the intervals between town 
meetings by the selectmen, who have general oversight of: 
town affairs, They number three or nine, and are elected 
usually for three years, but sometimes for only one. Next 
to them in authority are the members of the school com- 
mittee, one third of whom retire each year, As most of the 
state and local taxes are cOllected in the towns, the assessors 
hold very responsible positions, while the tax collector, the 
auditor, and treasurer, the town clerk, and the constable, 
who are elected yearly at town mectings, are equally well 
occupied. To the overseers of the poor and to the overseers 
of the highways are assigned duties performed in most of 
the States by the county boards and their assistants. 
64, The Townships outside of New England. —In New York 
and in two or three of the Northwestern States, town meetings are 
held usually for the election of officials, but the duties and powers of 
the meetings are exceedingly limited, although the town officials may 
‘be numerous and their powers quite extensive. Town

  54 AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
In the other States, when townships exist at all, they are usually 
districts with judicial officers, constables, overseers of the highways, 
and school boards only. As already stated, in most of the newer States 
these townships coincide in area with the rectangular congressional 
townships, whose evolution as a self-governing district was described. 
in § 48. In some parts of the United States, moreover, there are no 
important political divisions of the counties except the school districts. 
‘These may have overseers of the poor and the highways, as well as 
school trustees, and are after all undeveloped towns in fact if not in 
name, 
65. The Work of Rural Local Government.— Town and 
county officials have double duties to perform, as they care 
for all of the purely local interests of their town or county, 
and, in addition, administer almost all state laws within their 
boundaries. Under the former head conie all local improve- 
ments which are not of especial interest to those outside 
of their locality, such as the construction of local public 
buildings, and the laying out of purely local roads, meas- 
ures to prevent the public health from purely local 
dangers, and the enforcement of such local ordinances as 
may be needed. 
A very much greater amount of work is performed in 
carrying into effect state laws. These state laws are usually 
general and may be modified frequently to meet local needs, 
The schools furnish a good example of this combined action 
of the State and the localities; for, while the State creates 
a state school system, in the administration of the general 
state law each locality is able to establish schools that meet 
the wishes of its people (§§ 123-126). Most laws in regard. 
to crime and the punishment of crime are made by the State 
and enforced by local police officers and judges (§§ 107, 112, 
113). Except for the most serious crimes, offenders are 
punished in local jails or other institutions (§ 116). Most 
States have general laws on the subject of liquor license, but 
more than one half permit the towns or counties to decide 
for themselves whether they will have saloons (§§ 134, 135). 
In many States, there are laws for the care of the poor, but
-P-A-G-E-84
TOWN AND COUNTY GOVERNMENT 55 
little attempt is made by the state authorities to administer 
such laws (§§ 127-131). 
It has been the custom to allow each locality to admin- 
ister these general laws in the way that seemed best without 
much attempt to obtain uniform results in different counties 
of a State. Local pride and interest can be counted on 
usually to establish as good a school system as each com- 
munity can afford. Few towns will neglect to preserve 
order, In many respects, however, the best results cannot 
be obtained unless the local officials are supervised by state 
authorities. For example, many States have improved their 
school systems by withholding state school funds from the 
localities if they fail to reach a certain minimum of 
efficiency. There has been a decided tendency in recent 
years to increase state supervision of local activities.

candidates even for the ward offices are probably unknown 
to ninety-five per cent of the voters. The indifference of 
the people to city affairs, due to these causes, is increased 
by the lack of great public questions in connection with the 
municipal government. The vast number of details with 
which city officials are concerned, from their very complex- 
ity, make supervision of city administration by the voters 
all but impossible. Itis well known that our city govern- 
ments have often fallen into the hands of men whose sole 
business is “ politics,’ and whose care for the public welfare 
is less marked than their devotion to private interests. 
This is the more unfortunate because the regulation of a 
city’s business involves the expenditure of a much greater 
amount of money in proportion to the population than does 
that of the county, the State, or the national government, so 
that all citizens ought to be vitally interested in having 
their city’s government as perfect as possible. 
ORGANIZATION oF Ciry GOVERNMENT 
67. City Charters.— All cities are public corporations 
created under state municipal laws. Upon petition from a 
certain number of voters living within the district that 
desires a city government, a special election is called at 
which an opportunity is given to vote for or against incor- 
poration. If the vote is favorable, the city obtains from the 
state government a charter under which it may elect its 
officials and conduct its business. 
For the sake of convenience, we may consider the grant- 
ing of charters under three heads. (1) In most of the 
States, the legislature passes a series of charter laws for 
cities of different sizes. That is, forms of charters are 
enacted for different classes of cities. For instances, all cities 
whose population is more than 100,000 may be called cities 
of the first class, those having between 25,000 and 100,000, 
cities of the second class, and so on. All cities that, by
-P-A-G-E-88
CITY GOVERNMENT 59 
virtue of their population, are of the second class, .have 
charters of the second class which may be amended or re- 
voked in their entirety by the next legislature. . 
(2) In other States, the charters are granted by special 
act, a custom once used almost universally. Instead of hay- 
ing different classes, each city is in a class by itself, and 
each charter is therefore different from every other, although 
all are given to the cities by the legislature and not adopted 
by popular vote, 
(8) Six States, Missouri, California, Washington, Minne- 
sota, Oklahoma, and Oregon, permit their cities to elect charter 
committees, which frame suitable charters.. In some cases, 
these are in force as soon as they are approved by the voters 
of the cities; in others, they must be ratified by the state 
legislature. 
The charters serve the same purpose for the cities that 
the constitutions do for the States (§ 160), that is, they are 
the fundamental law of the cities. The most important part 
deals with the frame of the government for the city, show- 
ing the composition and powers of the city council, as well 
as the term and duties of the mayor and other administra- 
tive officials. 
68 The Organization of the Council.— As a rule, the 
councils of our cities are small bodies of from ten to twenty 
members comprising a single chamber, although in about one 
city in four, there is a second chamber, just as in the state 
legislatures and in Congress. The members of the larger of 
these two bodies, and of the single chambers of the other 
cities, are elected from wards for a term of from one to four 
years. For the upper chamber, the members are usually 
chosen for longer terms, not exceeding four years, and 
are occasionally elected from the whole city, or from large 
districts, each of which elects several of these “ aldermen.” 
In many of the cities, the council, or at least one chamber 
of it, is a “continuous” body, one half of the members 
retiring at a time. In the majority of American municipali- Rowe, Prob-

Philadelphia has the largest council in the United States, its upper 
chamber numbering 47 and the lower 80. For the city and county of 
San Francisco, the only legislative body consists of 18 “‘supervisors.’” 
69. The Powers of the Council. The council is not 
allowed to exercise any power unless that particular power 
is mentioned in the city charter.) The list of enumerated 
powers is apt to be quite long, giving council the right 
to construct public buildings and make ordinances for con- 
trolling the streets, preventing disorder, regulating licenses, 
caring for the health of the community, and for many other 
matters of local interest. The council is usually the chief 
JSmancial organ of the city.? To it estimates of the expenses 
of the different departments are furnished, by it appropria- 
tions are voted, and provision made to meet the expenditures 
through taxation or other forms of revenue. When it be- 
comes necessary to borrow money, the council is authorized to 
issue bonds for the necessary amount, although sometimes 
only after securing the approval of the voters. When com- 
‘panies apply for franchises to lay a street railway, or furnish 
telephone service or gas to the people, the applications are 
made to the council, butin some cities it is not permitted to 
grant’ franchises without first gaining the consent of the 
voters.

branch of our city governments, but many people have ad-

The council has less control over expenditures than these boards. ‘The extradrdinary financial powers are often limited by the re~ quirement that-the expenditure shall be ratified by popular vote, as shown ve.

vocated an extension of the powers of the council: (1) as a 
means of reform for the council, or (2) as the best remedy 
for the defects of city government. In several American 
cities a plan is being tried of concentrating practically all 
power in the council, hoping to make the body responsible 
for the success or failure of the work done by the munici- 
pality. This plan corresponds in some particulars with the 
English form of city government.! 
70, The Mayor with Centralized Power.— An attempt has 
been made in some cities, during the last two decades, to 
remedy the defects of municipal government by concentrat- 
ing in the hands of the mayor the absolute.control over most 
of the administrative officials of the city. Instead of hav- 
ing a great many officials elected by the people, or appointed. 
by the council, as was formerly the case, the mayor ts al- 
lowed to select and remove most of these subordinate execu- 
tive officers, including not only the heads of departments, 
but others such as the city clerk, the treasurer, and the attor- 
ney. He has consequently been held responsible for their 
acts, in the cities where he has this power over them, and 
rightly so, for they must do as he wishes, or he may remove 
them. 
Those cities which have been able to offer their mayors 
large salaries and considerable power have succeeded in se- 
curing as candidates for the mayoralty men of ability and 
of business standing. By thus awakening popular interest, 
a long step has been taken toward securing good government, 
irrespective of any benefits in the new method adopted. 
Whether the concentration of power in the hands of the 
mayor will ultimately prove a blessing, we cannot say ; but, 
judging from the success of the national administration

71, The Mayor with Ordinary Power.— A second ‘kin 
mayor, still to be found in a great majority of our ai 
has general supervision of city administration, but he can. 
not control the actions of any one except himself and ‘hi. 
immediate subordinates. He is aided by associates or: ‘col- 
leagues, all of whom are independent of the mayor, for they 
are chosen without consulting him, and usually cannot.. be 
removed atall. A mayor of this type is usually elected for a 
term of two years by the voters of thecity. As he is not 
called upon to appoint many officials of prominence, his 
chief powers are his right to enforce the laws and his influ- 
ence over the council.’ At the begining of each year he 
sends to that organization a message, showing the condition 
of the city’s finances, and recommending changes in the de- 
partments or their work. But it is his right to veto. bills 
that gives him his greatest power. To pass a measure. over 
his veto, a two-thirds vote of the council is. necessary, so 
that the overruling of his veto is very rare. 
72. City Hlections,— Besides the mayor and the council- 
men, an auditor, a treasurer, an engineer, an assessor, a.tax 
collector, members of a school board, and often other officials 
are chosen by popular vote. The qualification for voters 
are everywhere the same ag those prescribed for all other 
elections (§ 29), differing in this respect from the European. 
custom of restricting the voting in cities to men of property. 
Until the close of the nineteenth century city elections 
were held almost always at the same time as state or congres- 
sional elections. As a consequence, the nominations for city 
office were of a distinctly partisan character, and it was prac- 
tically impossible to select candidates on their merits. - Af- 
ter somé agitation, the fact became generally recognized that 
there is no necessary connection between city government 
and partisan politics, so that voting on party lines was a   
distinct injury to the city. When it was perceived that the

CITY GOVERNMENT - 63 
separation of city elections from other elections was essen- 
tial to good city government, separate dates were selected 
for city elections. 
Separate city elections constituted only the first step in 
reform, as most voters naturally voted party tickets if there 
were party nominations. In some cases, temporary fusion 
movements of all the reform elements gained control of the 
city governments. As the only bond between these elements 
was their opposition to the rule of the corrupt politicians 
who had been in control of municipal affairs, success at the 
polls was followed by dissensions in the ranks of the re- 
formers, since they desired different policies. Real success 
has been achieved in several cities by the permanent organ- 
tzation of citizen movements with definite and practical pro- 
grammes. In some citiés these organizations have followed 
the plan of supporting those candidates of the two parties 
who favored the citizen programme and in this way have se- 
cured a much better class of nominations for city offices. 
In other cities, the citizens’ committees have named candi- 
dates of their own for all offices and have secured the elec- 
tion of these men or have compelled the parties to nominate 
excellent candidates. 
73, Administrative Departments. — Most of the real work 
of a city consists of administration performed through nu- 
merous departments. The school department is in a sense 
distinct from the rest because its members are usually 
elected and have unusual powers in the expenditure of pub- 
lic money. Most of the other departments are managed by 
appointed boards or heads, a few like the police and fire 
departments having both boards and chiefs, Two distinct 
forms of administrative organization are found in American 
cities. (1) The older of these, at. one time practically uni- 
versal, leaves the departments entirely independent of one 
another. There may be forty or fifty departments which 
have no means of codperating. with one another and are, 
not directly responsible to either the mayor or the council. “Good gov-

  (2) In many cities there are four or five grand departments, 
each of which includes a number of bureaus, these: bureaus 
corresponding to the disconnected departments of the“ de- 
centralized” cities. By this means, codperation and the 
fixing of responsibility are secured. 
* City school boards are composed of representatives from 
the wards, except in a few cities where the members are 
elected by all the voters within the city or are appointed 
directly by the mayor. All local regulations for the schools 
originate with these bodies, which elect the superintend- 
ents and all of the teachers. Most of the cities allow 
their boards to expend school moneys, so that they decide 
what the teachers’ salaries shall be, keep the school build- 
ings in repair, and erect new ones as they are needed. 
To preserve the peace and maintain the public health, 
there are, in every city, police, fire, and health departments, 
which are combined often in a single department of public 
safety. Among the other departments for administering 
city affairs are those that look after the streets, the parks, 
the libraries, the water works, public lighting, and proba- 
bly a dozen other matters. These may have boards, but 
usually are managed by commissioners appointed by the 
mayor or the council. 
74. Civil Service in Citles.-The employees in these de- 
partments are much more numerous than would at first be 
thought possible As most of the positions can be filled 
properly only by persons of considerable skill, the methods 
used in selecting employees are of the first importance. If 
the members of the library board may remove any of the 
library assistants whom they please, and appoint their own 
friends irrespective of training, the public library will be 
of little value to the citizens. It. has seemed, therefore, 
necessary to have certain riles to regulate the appointments 
1§0me idea of the number of employees may be given by stating that, 
im 1900, there were 7637 policemen on the pay rolls of New York, that the 
same year Boston employed 730 fixemen, and Philadelphia 3736 school- 
teachers.
-P-A-G-E-95
CITY GOVERNMENT 65 
and removal of city employees. For teachers and librarians, 
a course of training is prescribed, often by state law, while 
for policemen a certain minimum physical standard is made 
obligatory. Very little has been done to establish a regular 
civil service in which appointments shall be made exclu- 
sively on the ground of merit or removal solely for incompe- 
tency, but there is good reason to hope that the popular 
interest taken in this subject will lead to some improvement, 
without which good government is impossible. 
75, Village Government. When the population of any 
rural district becomes fairly dense, the voters may petition to 
have a special election called in order to determine whether 
the district shall be incorporated as a village. Ifthe vote is 
favorable, articles of incorporation are drawn up in accord- 
ance with the law of the State. These articles state the 
boundaries of the village, as well as the number, terms, and 
powers of the village officials. Chief among the officials are 
the members of the village boards, corresponding to the city 
council, whose presiding officer is “mayor” of the village. 
Other duties are performed by the clerk, the treasurer, the 
assessor, and the overseers of the poor. These village gov- 
ernments are therefore quite similar to those of the cities, al- 
though their fasks are less numerous and much easier to-solve.

Municipan Functions 
76. The Extension of Municipal Activity.— There has 
been a decided tendency in recent years for all of .our 
governments to undertake a larger number of duties, and 
this tendency has been more marked with our city govern- 
mentsthan with any of the others. Yeteven with this great 
extension of municipal functions, American cities do much, 
less for their people than all of the. most progressive 
European countries. It does not seem probable, however, 
that the street railways of the United States will soon be- 
come public property, or that many of our cities will main- 
tain pawh shops, as some foreign municipalities do.

  ‘We may classify the duties performed by our cities as 
necessary or business duties. By necessary duties are meant 
those which are invariably performed by American munici- 
palities, The business functions include the business enter- 
prises which are either undertaken by the cities or performed. 
by private parties with the consent of the cities. In the 
following sections the necessary duties will be treated briefly 
because they deal with subjects of interest, though to a 
lesser degree, to the rural communities and to the State at 
large. These are considered in other connections. The 
business duties which deal with the important problems of 
public utilities will be treated in this chapter. 
77. The Necessary Work of a City. — Disorder, evasion 
of law, and crime increase as population becomes more con- 
gested. The problems of preserving order and enforcing 
police ordinances are serious in all large cities ($§ 112, 113). 
The larger the city the greater the menace to health ordi- 
narily from epidemics, the spread of ordinary contagious 
diseases, and the accumulation of filth and wastes (§§ 118, 
120). In self-protection cities must make and enforce rigid 
plumbing. and sewage regulations. They must provide a 
supply of pure water, must prevent the use of preservatives 
in milk or meats, and must keep careful track of other foods 
that are offered for sale ($§ 119, 121). In tenement districts 
the enforcement of regulations for proper air and light 
shafts, and in the centers of all cities proper precautions 
against jire are as necessary as any duties a city performs 
(8§ 119, 122). 
The proper paving and care of streets constitute a task of 
no mean proportions (§ 138). The construction of public 
school buildings, the maintenance of schools of every grade 
from kindergartens to high schools, and the selection of 
teachers require the best thought and effort of one of the 
city’s most important departments (§ 125). Less vital from 
a material standpoint but quite as essential for the social 
well-being of the people is the work of education, culture,
-P-A-G-E-97
  CITY GOVERNMENT 67 
and recreation given by the city libraries and city parks 
($§ 132, 133). 
78, The Cities and Public Utilities. — Perhaps the greatest 
of the problems confronting our city governments is the 
question of public utilities. In cities the householders 
cannot furnish their own supply of water and most of them 
must depend upon others for lights and transportation. 
Among a city’s necessary duties is that of deciding whether 
these utilities shall be provided by private corporations or 
by the city, in other words, whether a city shall have mu- 
nicipal ownership of any or all of these public utilities. 
As public ownership has made so little progress in this 
country, the granting to corporations of franchises giving 
the right to supply water, gas, electricity, transportation, tele- 
phone service, or other necessaries becomes so much the more 
important.. Franchises are usually granted either by the 
city council or the state legislature. If by the former, the 
conditions under which a franchise is possible are described 
in the charter, and may be enlarged by a separate state law. 
It has been customary to give franchises for long periods 
‘without requiring anything in return ; then, as population 
has increased, the privileges conferred by the franchise 
have become of enormous value. So often has this hap- 
pened that cities are now endeavoring to protect themselves 
by restricting the time for which franchises are granted to 
fifteen or twenty years, requiring sale of franchises to the 
highest responsible bidder, and prescribing a minimum per 
cent of the gross receipts obtained from the business per- 
mitted, which shall be paid into the city treasury. Where 
these limitations have not existed, there has often been 
more or less corruption among the councilmen who have 
favored giving the franchise for nothing.. On the whole, it 
" must be said that our municipalities have not conducted 
this. part of their business with economy, and that ‘the un- 
fortunate reputation for municipal misgévernment that we 
have abroad is justified by the facts. The 
problem.

service corporations consists in the power possessed by the 
city councils to fix the maximum rates that shall be charged

81. Transportation Facilities. — With the development of 
better means of urban transportation, the suburbs of Ameri- 
can cities have been brought so near the business centers 
that congestion of population in the central wards is less 
necessary than formerly. This is a distinct advantage 
from almost every point of view, but it makes the problem 
of transportation an important if not a serious one. This is 
especially the case in those cities in which the control of all 
the street railways has been gained by single corporations. 
Most of the street railways now in operation have been 
built and are being managed under franchises granted by 
the city councils for periods of from twenty to forty years. 
The privilege of laying one ar two tracks upon specified 
streets is given for a certain number of years on condition 
that cars should be run every ten, fifteen, or thirty minutes 
as the eouncil considers necessary. At the time the privi- 
leges were granted, the companies might not have been able 
to carry out their part of the franchises and make a great 
profit, but very often in a few years franchises have be- 
come worth immense sums, no part of which has found its 
way to the city treasury. If in addition there has been a 
union ‘of different companies which has avoided the ex- 
penses of competition, the cities may be obliged to suffer 
the inconveniences of poor services as well as to lose what 
should properly be theirs. 
Two ways have been suggested of avoiding these evils. 
The jirst is to have the cities own and manage the street 
railways; the second, to grant, for a short term of years, 
franchises’ which give the cities control over the private 
companies, and which arrange to have a percentage of the 
profits paid into the city treasuries. The second method 
seems to be more popular and the one more likely to be 
universally adopted. The trans-

       82, Conditions affecting Municipal Ownershi; 
reasons our cities must find the best means of- dealing 
this question of public utilities. (1) Our streets are pi 
property and should be used solely for the good ofthe: peo- 
ple. If permission is given to individuals or corporations 
to lay tracks or water pipes, or to erect poles that carry 
electric wires, the benefits accruing to the citizens should. be 
in proportion to the privilege granted. (2) The cities should 
receive a. net income for the use of the streets for these pur- 
poses, whether the business is conducted by the city or: by 
private parties. (3) The citizens should have the benefit of 
good service at reasonable rates. 
Whether these results can be obtained best by private. or 
municipal ownership depends upon circumstances. If:any 
of these business undertakings are naturally monopolies: or 
become monopolies, the need of adequate municipal control, if 
i not municipal ownership, has been proved by experiénce. 
When the original cost of the undertaking is large in pro- 
portion to the annual expense of operation, as is a system 
of waterworks, the advantages of public ownership are es- 
pecially evident. On the contrary, any business of a semi- 
public nature, in which the employment of large numbers 
of men is necessary, has been almost universally left-to 
private parties, unless continued private ownership has been 
a menace to the welfare of the city. Even then, private 
management wnder public ownership has usually been advo- 
cated.

. CHAPTER VI 
THE STATE LEGISLATURES 
83. The Importance of the Legislature.— The legislatures 
overshadow the rest of our system of state government, since 
they not only make laws upon all subjects that are not 
expressly and exclusively granted to the national Congress, 
or denied by the United States or state constitutions to the 
legislature, but may also interfere in many ways with the 
work of the dther departments of the state government. 
All of the general Jaws under which our local governments 
and schools are organized, those referring to the state and 
local courts and procedure in these courts, those dealing 
with the making and enforcement of contracts, the transfer 
of property, marriage and divorce, with the prevention of 
the spread of diseases, with the incorporation of business 
houses — all of these form only a part of the vast number 
under the charge of the legislatures, the whole covering 
aset of subjects of the first importance not only because 
they are so numerous, but because all are of such interest to 
us in our home and business life. 
We can probably get the best idea of the enormous power 
possessed by the legislatures by mentioning the restrictions 
placed upon them (§§ 88-90), but we must not forget that 
the powers still exercised by the legislatures greatly out- 
number the powers denied to them. 
ORGANIZATION 
84, Composition and Sessions.— The universal form for 
the state legislatures is that of two houses, the smaller of 
1The only States that have ever had one-chambered legislatures are 
Pennsylvania (1776-1790), Georgia (1777-1789), and Vermont (1791-1836).

   which is always called the senate, while the larger i 
known as the house of representatives or the assembly.:- These 
houses have practically equal powers, as ordinary ‘bills may 
be introduced in either house, and must be passed by both 
before becoming laws. The difference between the houses 
is therefore principally one of size, as both represent the 
same people, have practically the same interests, and are 
chosen by the same voters (§ 30). 
All of the earliest state constitutions compelled the legis- 
latures to hold at least one session a year, and aimed to 
prevent long breaks between sessions. Gradually the States 
recognized the need of less legislation, and biennial sessions 
became more and, more the rule, until now only six States 
hold annual sessions. ‘Four of these, and a few of the other 
older States, place no time limit on legislative meetings, 
but most of the States think a sixty or ninety day session 
long enough, while three of them make forty days the limit, 
Extra sessions may be called by the governors, either at their 
own wish or on request of a stated proportion of the mem- 
bers of the legislatures. When no agreement can be reached 
as to the time of adjournment for either a regular or a special 
"session, the executives may set a day for that also. 
85, Privileges and Disabilities of Members. — When we 
look over the privileges accorded members of our legisla- 
tures, we are unconsciously carried back to the time when 
the English kings tried to interfere with the action of 
Parliament by arresting its boldest members. When we 
consider the disabilities of legislators, we are just as forcibly 
reminded of the effort made by later Parliaments to prevent 
corruption of their members by the executive branch of | 
their government. Members of the legislatures in all the 
States are privileged from arrest during legislative sessions, 
except for treason, felony, and breach of the peace, and are 
permitted perfect freedom of speech within the halls of the 
state capitols; but no legislator may be appointed. to’ a 
lucrative position created during his term of office.
-P-A-G-E-110
THE STATE LEGISLATURES 79 
" Legislators are not asked to donate their time to the public service, 
although the pay is never large enough to be a great inducement. 
No distinction in salary is made between the senators and repre- 
sentatives. Two methods of payment are used, one set of States 
granting a yearly salary, the other and larger set fixing a per diem 
rate, although both grant an extra allowance of * mileage,” for travel- 
ing expenses. As might easily be imagined, most of the States that 
have sessions of an indefinite length prefer a fixed sum per year, 
varying from $200 in New Hampshire to $1500 in New York, the latter 
being the only State in the Union where the pay amounts to more than 
$1000. The usual daily compensation is $5, no State paying over $10, 
and two but $3 a day. 
86. The Separate Houses. Not only are the lower houses 
larger than the senates, but the terms of their members are 
usually only one half as long as those of the senators, and 
higher qualifications are established for senators. Most 
senates are continuous bodies, one half of the members re- 
tiring at atime. As a rulé, each house has control of its 
own affairs? and each has certain special powers. 
The state senates usually have the right to confirm or re- 
ject the appointments made by the governors, and are often 
allowed to appoint independently of the executive. When 
a state official is impeached (see § 97) by the lower house, 
the senate decides whether he is guilty or not, a two-thirds 
vote being necessary to convict. The special powers of the 
lower houses are relatively less important than those of the 
national House of Representatives. The right of originat- 
ing revenue bills, which the colonial assembly cherished as 
its most valued possession, still exerts an influence, as over 
one half of the States give the lower houses exclusive right

That all-important document tells how many members shall constitute a 
quorum —usually a majority of those elected —shows under what cir- 
cumstances a member may be expelled —ordinarily by a two-thirds vote 
—and arranges that a journal be kept and published. It permits each 
house to elect its own officers, except the presiding officer of the senate,

Tre Work or THE LeGisLATURES 
87. The Process of Lawmaking.— As a rule, the state 
constitutions prescribe the steps to be followed in making 
laws. First of all, a bill, as it is called, is introduced in one 
of the houses of the legislature by some member. The 
character of the bill is indicated by its title, which must 
not include more than one subject. After the clerk has 
read the bill either in full or by the title, it is usually sent 
to the committee having charge of all subjects similar to 
those of which the bill treats——in technical language, the 
billis committed. The committee may not see fit to bring 
into the house a report upon'it, and it is said to have been 
“killed in committee.” If fortunate enough ‘to escape this 
fate, it is reported, read a second and third time, and pos- 
sibly debated or amended. Finally it mgy be brought toa 
vote, and if favored by the majority required by the state 
constitution — usually one half of those elected to the house 
—it is signed by the presiding officer and sent to’ the other 
house, Again it must go through the three readings on 
three separate days, and, if approved, is sent to the governor. 
The governor has from ten to thirty days to decide whether 
he will sign the bill, If it is objectionable to him, he re- 
turns it to the house in which it originated with his reasons 
for vetoing it2 If, however, in spite of his veto, a large 
majority in each house still wish the bill to become a law, 
it is “ passed over the veto” and becomes a law without the 
governor’s signature, 
88, Direct Legislation?-The power of the legislatures 
has been greatly reduced by different forms of direct legis- 
1 The governor has no veto in Rhode Island and North Carolina, 
2The referendum has been in use in connection with constitutional 
amendments and local laws in all of our States for many years. The ini- 
tiative, however, has been less widely adopted, Many States allow it in
-P-A-G-E-112
  THE STATE LEGISLATURES 81 
lation. By direct legislation is meant any lawmaking in 
which the voters participate directly. For instance, when 
the people vote upon a new state constitution which con- 
tains many laws, or upon a constitutional amendment, we 
have examples of direct legislation. If the voters of a town 
decide in favor of prohibition, the legislation is direct. 
This form.of direct legislatibn is known a: rendum.” 
‘There is another form which gives ¢ not only 
the last. word in lawmaking, but the first as well, This is 
called the “initiative,” and permits a certain number of the 
voters to propose laws which the legislature must consider.     
  If the legislature does not pass the proposed measure, the 
' people may vote upon it at the next election. 
The advantages of giving the people the final decision on 
such important questions as those treated in constitutional 
amendments cannot well be questioned. It seems equally 
important that bills or resolutions involving the expendi- 
ture of large sums of public money should likewise be sub- 
mitted 'to the voters, for the action of the state legislature 
or the city council upon these financial bills might be con- 
trolled by a few members, who are willing to sell their votes 
for a consideration. By the initiative, a legislative body 
may be forced to respect the public demand for some law, 
which otherwise it’ would have refused to consider. Acting 
thus 4s.a check upon the legislatures, and as a means of edu- 
cating public sentiment, direct legislation gives us better 
government than we. should have had without it. There is 
no doubt that year by year it is being used more extensively. 
But therein lies a danger, that we shall use it for the or- 
dinary details of government (a task for which the mass of 
the voters are not fitted) instead of considering-it @ check 
upon our councils and legislatures. 
local matters,.and in certain Western cities, especially San Francisco and 
Los Angeles, it may be applied to any subject upon application of fifteen 
and seven per cent respectively of the voters. Chicago permits its use in 
connection with public utilities. South Dakota and Oregon 2 allow five per 
cent of the voters to propose laws for the State.

The bills of rights in the state constitutions (§§ 102-104) have. always 
forbidden the, passage of laws that would interfere with the individual 
rights enumerated in them, but to these prohibitions have been added = 
many others which do not permit the legislatures to invést the State’s 
money in any enterprise, nor make grants to sectarian institutions, 
nor incur debt beyond a certain limited amount. 
Still more has the power of the legislature been curtailed and its 
authority impaired by allowing the constitutional conventions to pass. 
uyion such subjects as the suffrage, education, taxation, railroads, and 
banks, laws which are placed in the constitutions and thus beyond the 
power of future legislatures to alter or repeal. This usurpation of leg- 
islative functions by the constitutional conventions has bean due to 
popular distrust of the legislatures, but it has also increased the dis- 
trust, as less care has been taken to secure competent lawmakers. 
90. Local and Special Legislation. — A great many of the laws 
passed at every session of our legislatures deal with magters of interest 
to just one person or locality. These local and special laws were 
formerly so common that they formed the majority of all laws enacted, 
but abuses became very numerous, and it was found advisable to forbid 
special legislation. For instance, when companies were incorporated 
by special act, privileges of great value were occasionally given away, 
and the people in self-protection, were obliged to demand a general 
incorporation law. : 
The list of titles for which local and special laws may‘not now be 
made is quite a long one in most of the States. The constitutions 
require that all laws relating to these subjects be of 3 general character 
and that means be provided by which individuals or communities may. 
take advantage of the general law. Whereas formerly the legislature. 
might grant a divorce to a particular person, or change the location -of 
some county seat, or give a justice of the peace in one part of the State 
jurisdiction over cases denied to a justice in another part; now the 
legislature provides by general laws for the.granting of-divorce by the 
courts, for the changing of county seats in any part of the State, and 
for uniformity in the jurisdiction of all justices of the same grade. *. 
The legislatures frequently seek to evade these provisions of the 
constitutions by passing laws that are really special, but which they 
call general... In many States where laws dealing with separate cities 
are not permitted, the legislature has first divided the cities into 
classes with one or at most two cities in a class, and then proceedéd     
-P-A-G-E-114
THE STATE LEGISLATURES 83 
to make laws for each class. This evasion of the constitution has 
been permitted in’some States by the courts, but fortunately not 
in many. 
91. The Defects of our State Legislatures.— The lawmaking 
bodies of our commonwealths impress many critics as one of the least 
successful parts of our political system. 
(1) It is claimed, often without just cause, that they are composed 
of inefficient men, and, consequently, fail to command respect. Many 
reasons aré given for this state of affairs, no one of which satisfactorily 
explains it. . The mode of electing residents by districts has been as- 
signed as the chief cause. The absolute control of States by political 
machines is often held responsible for it. Popular indifference to 
state government, due to ignorance of the importance of state duties, 
also plays some part. But, hidden though the sources of the evil may 
be, the results of popular distrust in the legislatures are made plain in 
the general tendency to consider the lawmaking bodies a necessary 
evil. Many important duties have been given to the constitutional 
conventions, the sessions have been made less frequent and ar2 re- 
quired to be short, and a constantly increasing field of legislation is 
being denied them. : 
(2) Charges of corruption are by no means unknown, the influence 
of the representatives of great corporations, especially through the use 
of money, being considered more potent than public opinion in so 
many cases. On account of the necessity of making laws affecting 
corporations, the legislatures are exposed to great temptations, which 
they may n0t be able to resist. 
(8) Though they have such important duties to perform for the 
State, the members are often chosen on account of personal preferences 
for senatorial candidates. 
(4) Changes in the laws are made more frequently than the con- 
ditions demand, i.e. there is too much legislation. The whole sphere 
of state activity is of such a character that any change in the law in- 
terferes with many business or other operations. But instead of being 
sure that every change means improvement, the legislatures are con- 
stantly amending the statutes, when the alteration does more harm than 
good. . 
Fortunately, all of these criticisms do not apply to any one of our 
state législatures. Of some legislatures no one of them is trae. Cer- 
tain it ia that they are due quite as much to popular apathy as to any 
defect inherent in the state government. “ It is claimed

THE STATE EXECUTIVE 
Tus GovERNOR 
92. The Governor as State Executive. — The enforcement of 
state law is intrusted either to’ certain persons connected 
with the state government or to the officials of the cities, 
towns, and counties of the State. Most of the laws are car- 
ried out by local officers, so that comparatively few duties are 
left to the governor, the secretary of state, and other state 
officials, who are mainly occupied with routine work. 
The governor is by far the most prominent and powerful 
executive official of the State. Around his election the 
chief interest in state politics centers. More than any 
other one person, he determines what the policy of the state 
government shall be, and he usually receives the praise and 
bears the blame for success or mismanagement in the differ- 
ent executive departments. Yet he is often unable to con- 
trol the actions of more than a small proportion of the state 
administrative officers, for very few state officers are: ap- 
pointed by him or are responsible to him. Many of them, as 
the secretary of state and the auditor, are elected by the 
people. Others are selected by the legislature or by the 
heads of departments, and the larger number are local offi- 
cials, chosen by the voters of the counties, cities, or towns, 
who are in no way bound to execute a law in the way the 
governor wishes. There is at the present time, however, a 
very strong movement to concentrate more power in the 
hands of the governor, giving him greater control over his 
colleagues, and making him responsible for their acts.

  THE STATE EXECUTIVE 87 
93. The Position of the Governor.—In most parts of the 
Union, state elections for the governor, legislators, and 
others are held on the Tuesday after the first Monday of 
November. There is apt to be a great deal of electioneering 
. before the meeting of a state convention, as the candidates 
for the nomination for governor are usually numerous and 
active, and each desires to have delegates favorable to him- 
self chosen in different counties. It may therefore be known 
before the convention convenes who the candidate will be, 
and the voting in that body is more often than not purely 
formal. In a close State, the campaign following the nomi- 
nations will occasionally awaken all of the interest of a pres- 
idential year, and, in fact, the two campaigns often coincide. 
In about one half of the forty-six States, the governor is 
chosen for a term of four years, and in most of the rest for 
two years. 
The States have never felt it wise to allow the voters to 
elect as governors whomever they please, but have given 
certain minimum qualifications for the office. As a rule, 
the governor must be at least thirty years of age, and have 
been a resident of the State for not less than five years, 
and a citizen of the United States for an equal period.! 
Ability, popularity, and availability count much more with 
the politicians who select gubernatorial candidates. 
As with the legislators, the governors are expected to re- 
ceive a part of their compensation in the honor accompany- 
ing the office,’ for the average salary is less than $5000 
and.in no case over $12,000. 
94, Powers of the Governor: General and Military. — Al- 
though the executive power of the State is divided among 
1Minnesota demands that her governor be not less than twenty-one, 
and requires a residence of but one year in the State, her requirements be- 
ing the most modest of any of the States. Louisiana and Arkansas, on 
the other hand, require ten years’ residence in the State, and New Jersey 
and Mississippi allow only those who have been citizens of the United States 
for twenty years to hold the office. Mlinois gives her governor $12,000 a 
year, Vermont pays the smallest salary, $1500 per annum. Election,

  so many officials, the governor retains by far the largest 
share.’ The offices to which he may make appointments 
(usually with the consent of the state senate), are both nu- 
merous and valuable, and his power of removal, while not 
great, is constantly increasing. If a vacancy occurs, he may. 
select some one for the office until the legislature or the 
people can fill the position. In all but a very few of the 
States, the governor is allowed to grant reprieves and par- 
dons except for such crimes as treason. 
Being the commander in chief of the military forces —the 
militia — in all of the States, the governor may in time of 
disorder add greatly to his usual power. The Constitution 
of the United States permits him to organize this force into 
an army in case his State is actually invaded, and, if a wide- 
spread insurrection exists, he may use the militia in putting 
down the disorder. More frequently, the militia is likely to 
be called out to prevent destruction of life and property by 
the lawless element of society during strikes. If the sheriff 
of a county finds that he and his deputies cannot cope with 
the tumult, he calls upon the governor, and that official with- 
out delay orders a suitable number of companies to the scene 
of disorder.’ . 
95. The Governor's Legislative Powers. —The most im- 
portant powers of the governor are those relating to the 
legislature and to legislation, At the beginning of each 
session of the legislature, he sends to it a message showing 
the condition of the different executive departments and 
suggesting needed legislation. Only in rare instances, how- 
ever, does this message exert a marked influence upon the 
1In Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts, the governor shares his powers 
with an executive council, although the two together usually have some 
additional duties given in other States to separate boards and heads of de- 
partments. 
2 Where there is a state police, it can readily be seen that the governor 
is able to control the execution of state laws in the localities; but none of 
our States has as yet created a complete state police system, and in only a 
very few has this been attempted even in a modified form.
-P-A-G-E-120

action of the legislature. When the two houses fail to agree 
upon a time for adjournment, he may adjourn them until 
some reasonable future date. He usually possesses the great 
power of calling all special sessions of the legislature, al- 
though in some States it is obligatory for him to do this 
when a certain number of legislators desire it. 
His right to veto bills is undoubtedly that of most value to 
the governor. As we noticed (§ 87), when a bill has been 
passed in both houses of the legislature, it is sent to the 
governor, who has usually ten days in which to affix his 
signature or return it with his veto. Only two of the States, 
Rhode Island and North Carolina, do not allow the governor 
to veto bills, and all except four others require a much 
larger majority to pass the bill the second time than the 
first. Ag it is next to impossible for both houses to obtain 
these majorities when the governor has publicly expressed. 
his disapproval of the bill, unless the feeling between the 
governor and legislature is most unpleasant, the wishes of 
the governor are likely to be considered upon any bill of 
importance. He is able to make his influence felt still 
further, as he is allowed to veto particular items in appro- 
priation bills in nearly one half of the States. 
Strate Orricrats AND ADMINISTRATIVE Boarps 
96. The Governor’s Colleagues. — In about three fourths of the 
States there is a lientenant governor, who takes the governor’s place 
when the latter is called away from the State, or when the governor’s 
office becomes vacant by his death or resignation. His ordinary duties 
consist merely in presiding over the deliberations of the state senate, 
during its short sessions. 
The Secretary of State is little more than the chief clerk of the 
state government. He has charge of the state seal, keeps a record of 
all official acts of the legislative and executive departments, looks after 
the election returns for all state and national elections, and aids the 
legislators and governor when the records are to be consulted. 
The finances of the States are relatively less important than those 
of the Nation and the cities. Nevertheless, several of the States find ‘The veto.

perform their work properly. The supervision of the financial system 
is left to the controller, by whom every order drawn upon the treasurer 
must be approved, before it can be paid by the latter from the state 
funds. If the state government expends a large amount of money 
through the counties, for schools and for public institutions, the con- 
troller frequently has the right to audit the accounts of the local officials 
who handle state money. 
Among the other state executives who are usually chosen by the peo- 
ple, though often by the legislature or the governor, are the superin- 
tendents of public works and of public instruction, the surveyor-general 
and the attorney-general. he first has charge of the erection of all 
public buildings and such enterprises as canals and irrigation dams. 
The last, the attorney-general, is the legal adviser of the governor and 
of the legislators, and the public prosecutor in all criminal or civil suits * 
in which the State has an interest. 
97, Removal of Civil Officers of the State.— All important 
officials connected with the executive or judicial service of the States 
may be removed by impeachment through the lower house of the legis- 
lature, and conviction in the state senate; most minor officials being 
removable by the person or the body that appointed them. To impeach 
a person in the house requires usually only a majority vote; but con- 
viction cannot follow unless two thirds of the senators elected believe 
the official guilty of the charges brought against him, 
In afew States unsatisfactory or incompetent officials may be re- 
moved by the governor without using the unwieldy process of impeach- 
ment, but with few exceptions there is little opportunity to make 
“state” officers work in harmony with the plans of the head of the 
state government and practically none for securing uniform enforce- 
ment of the laws by the local officials, who, being responsible to no 
** state’? officer, do as they or their constituents desire. : 
98. The State Administrative Departments.— Our state 
governments have numerous duties to perform in overseeing 
thé administration of state law. At the head of the school 
systems of the States are state superintendents and state 
boards of education. The regulation of the raihwvays within 
any State is intrusted to a railway commission. State 
boards of health and of charity, state labor bureaus, and 
many others, constitute separate departments which aid in 
administering state laws.
-P-A-G-E-122
id 
THE STATE EXECUTIVE 91 
  As a rule, the boards in charge of these administrative 
departments are appointed by the governor of the State for 
terms of several years. Many of the boards are bipartisan ; 
that is, composed of an equal number of members from each 
of the two great political parties. In a few States, some of 
the boards are elected from districts. 
In several States the general oversight of the administra- 
tion of the poor laws and the penal laws is intrusted to a 
single state board of charities and correction. Much more 
frequently the States have separate boards of charity, prison 
boards, commissions for the insane and others. In other 
words, the departments are not completely organized, or well 
centralized, as in the case of the national departments 
(§ 315) and of some city administrative departments (§ 73). 
To each of these distinct commissions is assigned but a 
single set of duties, and it makes no effort to work in har- 
mony with the other boards which have charitable or cor- 
tective work.

THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE 
Tue System or Courts 
99. The Highest State Courts. — Our state and local gov- 
ernments have a much larger number of duties to perform 
than the national government, and these duties bring them 
into close touch with the citizens in their everyday life. 
Because of this condition of affairs, almost all of the civil 
and criminal suits brought for trial in the United States 
are tried in state courts, rather than in those of the Nation. 
Not only are these suits begun in state tribunals, but if they 
do not involve points of national law, the decision of the _ 
highest state courts to which the case may be carried is final, 
for the case may not be appealed to any other court what- 
soever. . 
At the apex of every state judicial system is a single 
court, to which all important cases are appealed for final 
decision.1. This court has, as a rule, no original jurisdiction ; 
that is, it considers only those cases tried first in a lower 
court. The number of judges? in these courts is usually 
three, five, or seven, and they are ordinarily chosen for a 
long term of years by the voters of the entire State. Occa- 
sionally they are elected by the voters of districts equal in 
1 Some of the States call the highest court the Court of Appeals, and 
have in addition another court for the whole State, which is known as the 
Supreme Court; but most of them have only one court for the entire State, 
the name Supreme being usually applied to this. 
2 Constitutional qualifications for these positions are rare, although 
many of the States demand that all of the higher judges be men of ‘‘ ex- 
ceptional intellectual fitness.’’

number to the number of the judges, but in six States they 
are appointed by the governors, and in five by the legisla- 
tures. 
100, Inferior State Courts.— For the set of courts below 
the highest court, each State is divided into a suitable num- 
ber of circuits or districts over each of which presides a 
court, called a circuit or district court, as the case may be. 
The judges are ordinarily elected by the voters of this cir- 
cuit or district, and hold office on the average about six 
years. These courts have original jurisdiction in important 
cases, and try on appeal cases coming from those next lower, 
the county courts, whose judges are in one sense county 
officials, because they are elected by the voters of the 
counties, although the cases tried before them involve state 
Jaws more frequently than local laws. 
The base of the judicial pyramid is formed by the country 
justices of the peace, or by the city courts, criminal and civil, 
whose jurisdiction is of necessity wholly original and con- 
fined to miner-eases or those involving local laws. Except 
the voters of the section within which the court has juris- 
diction, and, with a few, notable exceptions, elections are 
held atleast every four years. a“ 
As the business of the inferior state courts is more vo- 
luminous than important, each judge holds court separately, 
whereas in the higher courts all the judges constituting the 
court usually sit together for the trial of cases. That all of 
these judges are really state officers, even when elected by 
the localities, may be shown by the statement that they 
are removable in most of the States by the legislatures, 
either through impeachment or by a majority vote of both 
houses,

little less dangerous to the public welfare and to individual

tion must be taken to secure men of ability and judicial 
temperament as well as of integrity. When, as is the case 
in most of the States, the salaries paid the highest judges 
are but a tithe of the income of prominent lawyers, the honor 
of holding the position must be made the chief attraction to 
jurists of ability. If we elect as judges men of inferior stand- 
ing, men whose business is politics rather than the law, or 
men who seek places on the bench through dishonorable 
means and who use them for personal or partisan ends, we 
must expect a judiciary that does not command respect, and 
which, in the long run, will defeat the popular will and 
bring our free institutions into disrepute.

—@) the acts of other individuals who wish to do us bodily 
injury or gain, by unjust means, possession of our property, 
and (2) arbitrary or despotic action on the part of govern- 
ment officials, chiefly executive officers, who invade people’s 
homes, arrest or imprison men arbitrarily, or rob them 
under disguise of collecting taxes. All history shows the 
peril and the disadvantages of governmental interference 
with individual liberties. The means of protecting individ- 
uals from government we shall consider first. 
‘When the American colonies separated from Great Brit-
-P-A-G-E-126

ain in-1776, they felt the need of protecting individual 
rights from the arbitrary action of any government. In 
consequence, the States adopted as parts of the new state 
constitutions “bills of rights,” which aimed to prevent 
oppression of the citizens by the new state governments. 
The provisions of these bills of rights have been made more 
and more specific, so that those of to-day are valuable safe- 
guards of personal liberty. When we realize that, under our 
federal system of government, the state and local govern- 
ments make and execute almost all of the laws that are con- 
‘eerned with our everyday affairs, we can appreciate the need. 
of guaranteeing to the individual freedom from interference 
in his home, his religion, and his business, by local and 
state authorities, as well as the need of assuring him every 
opportunity to secure justice in civil or criminal suits. All 
of this the state bills of rights are intended to insure to the 
citizens, 
103. Civil Rights in State Constitutions. — While the right 
peaceably to assemble and petition the governments is one 
not likely to be interfered with, most of the state constitu- 
tions expressly prohibit its denial. A still larger number — 
in fact, all—assure freedom of speech and of the press, although 
many of them explicitly assert that persons who seek to 
injure the reputation of others shall be liable to punishment. 
These also specify that in a suit for libel, the truth may be 
introduced as evidence, and that malicious intent on the 
part of the speaker or writer must be proved. 
It is eminently fitting that in this country, where religious 
freedom was permitted when restrictions existed everywhere 
else, our state bills of rights provide for the fullest liberty in 
religious matters. No State allows its governments to dic- 
tate to any one what church he shall attend, or compels 
him to contribute for the support of any church, the 
establishment of state churches being everywhere forbidden.

   few of the older States make belief in the Deity a requisite 
for holding certain state offices. Such practices as polygamy 
are, however, punished as crimes, even when permitted by a 
religious sect. 
104. Constitutional Rights of a Person accused of Crime, —- 
In all of the States the great safeguard for a person accused. 
of crime is the constitutional provision that the trial be held 
as soon as possible in open court before a jury of his peers. 
Further, no one can be held for trial unless a written charge 
has been filed against him. This charge may be merely an 
information, which is a document drawn up by the public 
prosecutor; but if the crime is murder, no person can be 
held for trial until the evidence has been considered by a 
grand jury and the person indicted by the jury. Except 
for crimes punishable by death, the accused has the oppor- 
tunity of offering bail, which is forfeited if he fails to 
appear on the day appointed. He is never required to 
testify against himself, and cannot be punished if a single 
juryman believes him innocent. In fact, the constitutional 
safeguards for persons accused of crime, supplemented by 
others in the statute law, protect accused persons so well that 
many undoubtedly guilty men escape, and society is there- 
fore inadequately protected. 
105. The Distinction between Civil Suits and Criminal 
Cases.—The courts aim to administer justice by consider- 
ing all cases brought before them by some person or body 
of persons who claim to have been injured by the act of 
another. (1) If the act is of such a character that it affeats 
the general public as well as the party directly wronged, 
the law treats the act as a crime, and the prosecution of the 
alleged wrongdoer is begun by the representative of the 
people. For example, robbery, arson, and murder are so 
inimical to the public, that the punishment of the offender 
could not wisely be left to private parties, however griev- 
ously they had been wronged. It is very unfortunate that 
many offenses or practices which are exceedingly injurious
-P-A-G-E-128
THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE 97 
to the public either are not or cannot be treated as crimes. 
For example, it is not only absurd, but criminal, that persons 
or corporations of great wealth or influence who steal im- 
mense sums or defraud thousands by the use of “high 
finance” cannot be dealt with as criminals, while the petty 
pickpocket and swindler are imprisoned for long terms for 
minor offenses. (2) Disputes over land titles, failure to pay 
promissory notes, or neglect to perform a contract, involve 
comparatively little injury to the public, and cases relating 
to these subjects are termed civil suits. 
106. Procedure in Civil Suits. —- When a party begins suit 
against another before a court of law, he is known as the 
plaintif, the party against whom action is brought being 
called the defendant. The first step is taken by the plaintiff 
in a paper called the “writ,” in which are set forth the injuries 
alleged to have been done by the defendant. The reply of 
the defendant contains a statement presenting the facts of 
the case from his point of view, or it may admit that the 
facts are as stated by the plaintiff, but assert that they do 
not constitute sufficient ground for the lawsuit; in other 
words, that the defendant has done the plaintiff no legal 
wrong. Additional replies may be necessary to determine 
exactly what is in dispute between the parties. When all 
of these have been given, the “pleadings ” end, and the case 
is ready for trial in court. 
Lawsuits are usually tried by judges, although in most 
of the States either party may claim the right-of jury trial. 
Evidence is presented, first by the prosecution .and then by 
the defense, witnesses being called and examined by the 
attorney who brought them to court, and afterward cross- 
examined by the opposing counsel. An opportunity is then 
given each side to refute statements brought out in the 
latest evidence of the other, and for the arguments of the 
attorneys. If there is a jury, the judge gives it his 
“charge,” showing what the law of the case really is, and 
what bearing the evidence has on the law. In that event,

furnished later with a writ of execution to cover costs, - 
or costs and damages. This writ may be enforced by 
the executive officer of the court against the property of the- 
party named, so as to satisfy judgment. In almost all of, 
the States, however, homesteads and personal property are. 
exempt from seizure, 
107. Procedure in Criminal Cases.— Persons suspected of 
having committed crime are arrested upon warrants which _ 
state the cause of the arrest, or without warrants, if caught . > 
under suspicious circumstances. After a brief period in 
jail, they are brought to trial either upon an information, . 
or upon indictment. 
The trial of an aécused person is begun by reading in open : 
court the charge against him and giving him a chance to plead... 
guilty or innocent. If his-answer to the question is “nol 
guilty,” the court provides him with counsel— unless he 
has already retained the services of a lawyer— and a jury 
selected at once. Many citizens have already been summoned 
for jury service, and, as.the names of these are drawn 
lot, each is questioned by the attorneys for the State 
the defense, in order to learn whether he has already form 
an opinion regarding the guilt of the accused, or is biasef 
in any way that would affect his vote on the final verdict. 
If objectionable, he is dismissed. When twelve men sat 
factory to both sides. have been selected, the prosecutit 
calls its witnesses and the trial proceeds as in a lawsuit. 
‘When the evidence is all in and the closing argumen’ 
have been heard, the judge instructs the jury as to the law, 
and the jurymen withdraw until a verdict has been reach 
If declared innocent, the accused is at once set free;: 
found guilty, his lawyer will probably appeal the case to 
higher court, or ask for a new trial; and, if the jury di 
_ agrees, he will be held for another trial, as legally no trial” 
has taken place.

If guilty, sentence is pronounced by the judge, usually 
without delay, the court having discretion as to the advisa- 
bility of giving the convicted party the maximum or the 
minimum punishment provided by the law for crimes of 
that class, No American can well be proud of failures in 
our courts to treat alike all offenders — great or small —or 
their inability or unwillingness to punish accused persons 
whose guilt is unquestioned. One of the greatest reforms 
needed in America to-day is a remedy for defects in the 
administration of justice. 
Tus Jury System 
108. Juries and Jurymen.— Juries are of three kinds. 
(1) Grand juries, which are composed of from twelve to 
twenty-three men, hold secret sessions, and either investi- 
gate the causes of crimes that have been committed, bringing 
indictments against those they believe guilty, or investigate 
the condition of the departments of government and their 
expenditures of money. (2) The petit or ordinary jury 
of twelve men settles most civil disputes and decides 
criminal cases. (8) The police jury consists of six men and 
determines the guilt or innocence of persons accused of 
committing misdemeanors. When any of these juries 
serves for the entire term of a court, they are known as 
term juries; otherwise they are special juries. 
Only eétizens are allowed to sit.on juries. On account of 
the inconveniences of jury service, practically all profes- 
sional men are exempt by law from jury duty, and on account 
of the annoyance caused by being taken from their business, 
most of the other prominent men of the community shirk 
jury duty as far as possible. In some States, juries are 
“drawn” from a list of those liable to service, and a sum- 
mons served upon those chosen to appear at court, on a certain 
day. In other States jurymen are selected by jury police- 
men, who serve the summons on those whom they find on 
the streets or at their places of business. Sentence.

109. Ihe Extensive Use of the Jury System.— The credit 
for maintaining so satisfactorily the rights of individuals 
before the law in England and America belongs, to a very 
great extent, to the jury system. When popular participa 
tion in the work of government was much less common than 
at present, when judges could not possibly be influenced 
directly by the wishes of the people, and when the principal 
characteristic of the criminal laws was their harshness, the 
tight of trial by jury was almost the sole source of justice 
for the common people. With the changed conditions: of 
the present, it is no longer the one thing indispensable to 
the oppressed, but its extensive use bears witness that its 
value is not purely historic. Although jury trial may be 
waived with the consent of both parties in sutts at law, and 
although certain suits which deal with complicated matters 
are tried without juries in courts of equity, nevertheless the 
decision in the great majority of important civil suits tried 
in the United States still rests with juries composed of 
citizens. 
In criminal cases, jury trial may not be required by the 
defendant, but, in trying persons for misdemeanors, or 
minor erimes, it is customary to have juries, while in cases 
where the crime amounts to a felony, the guilt of the ae-- 
cased is always determined by a jary.’ 
110. Advantages of Jury Trial — Juries are an advantage 
both to the aceused and to the juryman. To the former, 
because the facts connected with his guilt and innocenes 
are viewed from the standpoint of common sense rather 
than of law. The jury disregards technicalities, bat places 
the emphasis upon the right or wrong involved. It takes 
inte account the circumstances, the motive, and the conse- 
t Nevada, California, Washington, Idahe, Utah, Montana, and Nebraska 
do not require a unanimous vote to render a verdict in civil suits, and 
four States allow 8 to 10 members of the jury to decide cases involving 
anitor ctimes. tn aft of the other States an unanimous vote of the jury= 
men is essential to a verdict.
-P-A-G-E-133
THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE 101 
quences, so that if it errs at all, it errs on the side of leni- 
ency. 
To the citizen, the jury gives opportunity for civic edu- 
cation. It brings him into touch with the work of admin- 
istering the law, and makes him part of it ; and, in so doing, 
gives him clearer conceptions of legal rights and methods, 
and fits him to exercise his duties as a citizen with greater 
knowledge and to better purpose, 
111. The Disadvantages of Jury Trial.— The main ques- 
tion is whether these advantages are worth what they cost, 
whether they apply to all forms of jury trial, and whether 
they are not, after all, but partially secured on account of 
the numerous exemptions from jury duty. Certain it is 
that the exemption of professional men, and the frequent 
refusals of attorneys to accept as jurymen men who have 
- formed opinions regarding the case to be tried, have given 
tise toa popular belief that only the ignorant are desired 
as jurors —a belief not well founded in most localities. In 
any civil case involving knotty problems of law, the ordi- 
nazy juror is almost of necessity incompetent to render a just 
decision, while in a lawsuit or criminal case where a strong 
appeal can be made to the emotions or to prejudice, the 
jury is likely to be unduly inftueneed in its verdict. The 
fact that a lawyer who has a weak case almost invariably 
asks for a jury trial is an indication that the jury errs 
- often on the side of leniency. In short, unrepresentative 
of the communities as our juries must be under present con- 
ditions, they often defeat the ends of justice, in civil suits, 
through their ignorance, and, in criminal cases, through 
their prejudice.

THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC 
Tae Enrorcement or Law 
112. The Preservation of Order. — The administration of 
justice is connected closely with that most fundamental of 
governmental functions —the preservation of order. Yet 
this is a task which rests upon the general public rather 
than upon the peace officers who enforce the laws. It is 
quite essential that our laws should define clearly and cover 
fully the offenses that individuals may commit against 
society; it is necessary that suitable, yet severe, penalties 
be designated for each crime; it is indispensable that of- 
fenders should be arrested and convicted for their crimes; 
yet all of these are inadequate without that public senti- 
ment which not only discourages but condemns law break- 
ing, which supports our criminal laws and their enforcement 
without question or hesitation. This can be seen by com- 
paring the attitude of any community toward different 
laws. A law that the people dislike is disregarded with 
impunity, although the community may be noted in gen- 
eral as law-abiding. . 
It is usually a matter of local pride that laws should 
be enforced and order kept within a locality, since the 
States do not maintain:a state police, but leave the protec- 
tion of life and property to the local officers. The problem 
is much more difficult in cities than in rural districts, for 
it is a fact of common observation that there is a great deal 
more rime in cities than in the country. This is not so 
much’ the fault as the misfortune of great centers of popu-

Tue TREATMENT or CRIMINALS 
115. Punishment of Crime in the Past.— As the purpose of’ 
punishment for offenders has changed in recent years, the methods. 
now in use are distinctively modern. In colonial times imprisonment ~ 
was almost unknown, death being the penalty for the most serious 
offenses, and some species of public torture, like the stocks or the 
whipping post, being used for minor crimes. During the early na- 
tional period there were prisons for the incarceration of criminals ; 
but- these were always of the worst description, the prisoners being 
herded together irrespective of age, offense, and other conditions, 
while often the prisons were nothing but cellars or mines. The 
gradual introduction of state prisons and more enlightened public 
interest did away with the worst of these evils. As the world began 
to realize that severe and arbitrary methods increased rather than 
diminished crime, greater attention was paid to reforming the crimi- 
nal, while schools for the care of neglected children and youthful 
offenders sprang up on every side. Repeated efforts have been made 
to raise the standard of the local prisons, or jails ; but, in spite of the 
progress made by a few States in some directions, the conditions in 
local institutions are still serious. 
116. Treatment of Adult Criminals. — State prisons are 
reserved for the worst classes of criminals sentenced by the. 
courts, the persons convicted of minor offenses being con- 
fined in local jails or penitentiaries. The methods used in 
the prisons vary greatly, but the discipline is of necessity: 
fairly rigid. Ordinarily employment is provided, chiefly 
for the purpose of keeping the prisoners busy, but partially 
to help pay the expenses of the prisons. A premium is 
placed upon good behavior, by reducing the length of the 
sentences from ten to thirty per cent for satisfactory con- 
duct. Quite frequently indeterminate sentences are used, 
the judge fixing a maximum and a minimum limit’ for the 
sentence, and the prison authorities deciding when it is 
wisest to release the prisoner. 
When a person is sentenced for a short time, he is usually. 
sent to the county penitentiary, of which there are a great 
number. If awaiting trial, or held as witness without bail,

he is confined in the same or in some local jail. Most of 
these institutions seem to have taken no share in the great 
advance movement for better prisons and better methods. 
Ordinarily they are unhealthy ; often they are worse. No 
work is provided in most instances except possibly on a 
chain gang, neither is there any classification of pris. 
oners according to age or crime. As all are thrown to 
gether, and idleness prevails, local prisons cannot be said 
to be effective agencies in the prevention of crime. 
In some States no prisons, state or local, are provided for 
the permanent retention of prisoners, and the labor of the 
convicts is sold to contractors who take entire charge of 
them, often giving them the poorest of food and treating 
them with barbarity. The usual results are all that even 
a system of punishment should not include, and the only 
attempted justification of the disgraceful system is the 
annual sum paid for the services of the convicts. 
117. Reform of Juvenile Offenders. — Society’s change of 
attitude toward criminals is nowhere so conspicuous as in 
its treatment of youthful citizens who break the laws. 
Since the crimes of even adults are considered to some ex- 
tent the results of disease, an effort is made to correct in 
children physical defects which may cause lawlessness, 
and to give them incentives to better living. In most of 
our large cities youthful offenders are now tried in special 
juvenile courts, where justice is tempered with so much 
mercy that first offenders are almost invariably placed upon 
probation for several years, during which they are kept 
employed, if possible, and required to report regularly to a 
court officer. The value of. the work of reformation being 
accomplished by the famous “boy’s judge,” Ben. B. Lindsay 
of Denver, and other conscientious and able jurists in these 
courts cannot be estimated. 
When a youth can no longer be allowed his freedom on 
probation, he is sent to one of the state reformatories for 
juvenile offenders which are found in almost every part of Wines, Pun-

boys and the girls to use their minds and their hands to 
advantage, and by teaching them self-control and. the rights

by these schools to change them into useful citizens: Often 
their later careers are watched to prevent the graduates 
from reéntering a career of crime, for the difficulties en-

follow the right path.

118. Contagious Diseases.— There has been a great ad- 
vance during the last quarter century in the demand for 
more complete Jaws protecting public health. Those now 
in use include laws to prevent the introduction or apread of 
contagious or infectious diseases, laws requiring the adoption 
of strict sanitary regulations in cities, those which prescribe 
standards for food of different kinds as well as laws regulat- 
ing the sale of drugs and the practice of medicine. 
There is comparatively little danger from great epidemtes 
as in the past, first, because people realize that these have 
been fostered by filth, and, second, because at all our ports 
strict quarantine ig Sstablished, if there is possibility of 
introducing any plague. This combination of removing 
probable causes and of exclusion has proved quite effective. 
The destruction in swamps of mosquitoes that carry yellow 
fever germs has eradicated to a large degree that terrible 
scourge. The national government does an important work 
in preventing the introduction of disease from abroad by 
medica] inspection of immigrants (§ 290), and by supple- 
mentary quarantine regulations. 
When people are crowded together as in large cities, extra 
precautions are necessary to prevent the introduction and 
spread of disease. The city health department, with its phy-
-P-A-G-E-140
THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC 109 
sicians and inspectors, has especial charge of all cases of 
contagious or infectious diseases, which are carefully iso- 
lated so that others may not be infected. When epidemics 
are raging, an entire city or some section of itis subjected 
to very strict quarantine to confine the danger within a 
limited area, So successful have these sanitary regulations 
become that the proportion of deaths from the mere com- 
mon infectious diseases is now very much smaller than a 
few years ago, while the terrible curse of smallpox has 
almost died out, owing largely to the use of vaccination. 
119. Sanitation. — In cities, particularly, there is especial 
danger from diseases like typhoid fever, which are developed 
from an impure supply of water, or which come from de- 
fective plumbing, an inadequate supply of fresh air, the 
accumulation of dust, rubbish, or filth in yards or streets, 
and, more than all else, a defective system of sewage dis- 
posal, 
In the country and in cities a century ago each house- 
holder had his own well, but allowed refuse to collect on 
his premises or to drain into the nearest depression. If 
Tots are large and near neighbors are not numerous, the 
risks of contamination may be considerable, but not serious, 
In cities a failure to keep the water supply free from tm- 
purities produces quickly disease and death. Where cities 
depend on near-by sources of water supply, as do many of 
those near the Great Lakes or on large inland rivers, some 
wastes of that city or other cities are sure to be found in the 
water used for drinking. Some cities aim to secure pure 
water by carrying it long distances from lakes whose water- 
sheds are cleared of possible impurities. Others use some 
system of filtering the water, following the lead of many 
European cities. Others seek only to remove the chief 
sources of contamination by disposing of their sewage in 
some less dangerous way, 
To the plumbing and building inspectors fallsa share of 
the life-saving work, for, particularly in large cities, a fair General

  percentage of the mortality, particularly among children, 
can be traced to defective plumbing or to dark, crowded, sun- 
less tenements, As we have begun to realize the curative 
powers of sunlight and fresh air, new interest has been taken 
in the crusade waged, especially in New York and other 
“arge cities with an extensive slum district, against the old 
style tenement. In some cases, the buildings covered seventy- 
five per cent of the ground area of an entire block, all air 
shafts being small and a large percentage of the rooms stin- 
less. The notable work performed by the New York Tene-- 
ment Commission and its friends is well known. The abate- 
ment of the smoke nuisance and the destruction of dangerous 
gases from factories is a necessary measure for the public 
health in many Eastern cities. : 
120. Disposal of Wastes. — Clean streets are necessary for 
the health of city dwellers, for every wind carries multi- 
tudes of germs from the dust or filth of pavements. The 
improvements wrought in New York, 1894-1898, by one 
man, Colonel Waring, with his “white angels” was marvel- 
ous. Even more remarkable was the work begun under his 
direction in Havana during the three years the Americans 
controlled the government of that Cuban metropolis. 
The collection and disposal of rubbish and garbage is, 
of the serious problems of American cities. Although: this 
necessary sanitary work is performed usually by city agents, 
the usual process of mixing garbage, ashes, and rubbish, the 
leaving of odorous cans on sidewalks, sometimes for hours, 
the offensive burning of the refuse near the cities without 
properly constructed crematories, all of these are small 
credit to Americans who wish only healthy, clean, and. 
modern methods. 
The most important of the city’s sanitary problems from 
the engineering and health points of view is the disposal of 
sewage. Practically all large cities have adopted a network. 
of sewers through which the sewage is carried from higher 
to lower ground through outfall sewers to some place fairly

distant from the city. This removes the immediate danger 
from accumulation on small city lots, but it may not solve 
the entire problem. Chicago found that her sewers emptying 
into Lake Michigan ruined her water supply. At great ex- 
pense a drainage canal was constructed to carry most of the 
sewage into the Illinois river. Some cities are following a 
European plan of separating the solids in refuse, garbage, and 
sewage, using the residue, after treatment, for fertilizer. One 
has established a sewer farm on which alfalfa and English 
walnuts are raised. 
121. Pure Food Regulations. During recent years there 
has been a marked advance in the regulation of food products 
by our governments. This has led to pure food laws en- 
acted by Congress (1906) and by the majority of the state 
legislatures. Most of these laws require the manufacturers 
of foods and drugs to state the ingredients of their product, 
giving in detail the amounts of substances that may be poi- 
sonous or might be considered injurious. Investigations had 
shown that most jellies and flavoring extracts, for example, 
did not contain any of the article mentioned on the label. 
Coal tar dyes that were misleading rather than harmful were 
used in great quantities, preservatives like benzoic acid were 
to be found in considerable proportions, and a great deal of 
thebuttersold was oleomargarine. There were no restrictions 
on the patent medicines sold everywhere. The new laws aim 
to give each consumer a chance to ascertain the real nature 
of the article he is purchasing—-they do not guarantee the 
excellence of any food or drug. Their efficiency depends Zueblin,

chiefly on the provisions made for the inspection of goods _ 
and enforcement of the laws. 
Besides these general laws, there are numerous local regu- 
lations. Most cities require that all milk furnished by 
dairies shall be of a certain minimum quality, that dairies 
shall be inspected and kept clean, and that no preservatives 
shall be used in the milk. Meat inspectors are supposed

‘With houses close together, as in cities, and great danger 
that a fire in one will be communicated to the next, building 
laws are. necessary to prevent fires altogether, and fre 
departments equipped with modern apparatus must be main- 
tained. If most of our buildings were constructed of brick 
or stone, as in Europe, nine tenths of the risk would be 
removed. As it is, there is usually a “fire limit” within 
which wood may not be used for construction. Permits are 
required. before any building is erected or an addition made, 
but our laws are lenient and laxly administered, and in 
many cities our fire departments are totally inadequate to the 
needs. In 1871 the business sections of Chicago and Boston 
were practically destroyed by fire, and in 1904 a large part 
of that in Baltimore suffered similar loss. In 1904, also, 
nearly 600 people lost their lives in the Iroquois. Theater 
at: Chicago because the fire rules of the city had not’ been 
enforeed properly. The terrible experience of San Francisco, 
where eight square miles of buildings were destroyed after 
the earthquake, with a total loss of more than $ 200,000,000, 
should teach a wholesome lesson. The United States gov- 
ernment. buildings were built so substantially as to withstand 
the terrible heat which destroyed many so-called fire-proof 
structures. The failure of the water supply, which eould 
not be blamed ‘entirely on the earthquake, was the chief 
canse of the great loss of life and property.

     123. The State Systems of Education.— There is no task 
of state and local government which outranks in importance’ 
that of providing a common school education at.public.ex- 
pense. This subject illustrates admirably the relation exist- 
ing between the State and the localities everywhere, since 
the general plan of the school system is arranged by general 
state laws, administered by local school officials. 
The state school law determines whether the district, the 
township, or the county shall be the unit for school adm 
istration, and what officers it shall select, with the powe: 
of each. It also prescribes a minimum list of the subjec’ 
which must be taught in every school, the minimum nus 
ber of months in the school year, and the qualification 
teachers of the different grades. 
The state departments of education have superintendents; 
aided in most of the States by state school boards. The _ 
school boards are usually appointed by the governors,- the * 
superintendents being elected more generally than appointed. 
The chief work of the state boards consists in arranging -.. 
and revising the state school law for submission to the. 
legislature, and in adopting other means for improving the 
schools of the State. In a few States provision is made for 
state text-books, published under the direction of the state 
board by the public printer, or selected by the board from - 
the regular text-books. In several States, text-books are 
furnished at public expense. 2

: The state superintendents usually visit the different coun- 
ties, examine schools, and gather information for the state 
boards. In several States, the boards or the superintend- 
ents may suspend teachers for cause, or revoke certificates 
issued by the state or county boards. 
124. State Schools.— The public school systems of most 
of the States include (in addition to the local schools), 
normal schools, agricultural colleges, and state universities. 
The rormal schools are institutions for the special training 
of teachers. Until these normal schools were established, 
teachers were not only poorly prepared for their work, but 
were only half educated, as a rule. The majority of the 
present. normal schools are well equipped, and are doing 
much to raise the standard of efficiency among the teachers 
of the, country. Many of those that rank highest now 
require a high school education for entrance. 
Agricultural colleges have been established in most of the 
States. By a law passed by Congress in 1862, 30,000 acres 
of public land were given to each of the States for every. 
congressman to which the State was entitled, the proceeds 
arising from the sale of these lands being devoted to agri- 
cultural education. Experiment stations are often con- 
ducted: in connection with these institutions, the national 
government. granting appropriations each year for every 
agricultural.school and experiment station (§§ 284, 286). 
' The state universities found in nearly one half of the 
States.are.among the largest and best in the land. They 
are co-educational institutions, offering an exceedingly varied 
number of courses, in engineering work as well as in pro- 
fessional schools. They represent the highest development 
of. the American idea that education should be at public ex- 
pense,:for instruction is ordinarily free for those students 
who'live within the State. Many of these universities have 
rendered especially valuable.service to the cause of educa- 
tion by aiding the grammar and high schools, and by intro- 
ducing better and more uniform methods in local education, State

118 AMERICAN GOVERNMENT ‘: 
  125. Local School Administration. — The officials who look 
after school matters are usually three trustees for each dis. 
trict or township, and above these the county board of edu- 
cation and the county superintendent. In all of the States 
in which townships do not exist or are not well developed, 
the county boards have important duties in granting certifi- 
-. "Boone, Zdu- cates to teachers, selecting text-books for the county schools, 
TS ne a6, providing for uniform courses of study, and raising money 
for school purposes. In most of the other States, the bur= 
den of-school duties falls upon the trustees of the districts or ~ 
townships, who almost invariably have charge of selecting _ 
teachers and of erecting school buildings, and who may.be 
obliged to assume part or all of the tasks mentioned above -. 
in addition. The district system is still more common than. 
that of the township, but, if the districts are small, it is im: 
possible to secure a satisfactory grading of pupils, or care- 
ful supervision by local superintendents, which is one of’. ~ 
the greatest aids to successful work. 
Our cities are likely to have better opportunities for good 
schools. than the country. districts, because a more perf 
--system of grading is possible and because greater induce. 
ments are offered to teachers. ‘To what extent.these op 
tunities are utilized depends chiefly upon the public spit 
of the school board. Most of our cities have, however, g 
much farther than the laws require. Almost all have: 
tablished free Kindergartens, and high schools with mai 
different courses of study. Some give instruction in man-_ 
ual training throughout the higher grammar grades, and a 
few have established separate technical high schools. Me 
A custom which is practically uniform throughout the 
country, and which is, perhaps, more than anything else,:. 
xesponsible for inefficiency in the schools where that exists, 
/ consists in electing new teachers for a term of one year only, 
and sometimes of dismissing them without good reason. 
In a few cities a fair permanency of tenure is assured, and 
appointments are made by the superintendent.

126, School Finances. The public interest taken in our 
schools is shown by the large sums expended annually, for 
the common schools cost more than $300,000,000 annu- 
ally, about $3.50 for every person in the United States 
and nearly $17 for each pupil enrolled in the schools. 
The aid given by Congress to the newer States has un- 
doubtedly exerted a healthful influence in quickening this 
popular interest. Ever since 1802 Congress has given 
as the basis of an educational fund to each of the States 
formed out of the “ public domain,” i.e. the land directly 
controlled by Congress, one section of the thirty-six in each 
township (see § 279), and since 1848, two sections. These 
school lands have been’sold and the proceeds devoted to 
developing the schools inthese States. By far the larger 
part of the school revenue: is, however, obtained from 
regular taxation (§§ 149-152). Many States collect state 
school taxes and then distribute this sum to the count- 
ies or townships in proportion to the number of scholars in 
each who attend school regularly. In this way help is 
given to the poorer districts and to those which are most Sources of 
revenue.

earnest in their school work. In most of the States, the © 
taxes are purely local and are as large as each community 
thinks it needs and can afford. 
Pusric CHARITIES 
127. The Problem.—-There are in every community cer- 
tain persons who are unable or unwilling to provide for 
themselves. Most of these have relatives who see that they 
are provided with a home and the necessaries of life. The 
rest are a burden on society in general, and must be sup- 
ported by private charity or at public expense. The first 
duties of the public are to separate them into classes accord- 
ing to their disability, to distinguish between the deserving 
‘and the unworthy, and to provide suitable help for those 
who may be entitled to receive it. Features of

These tasks constitute a problem of no mean proportions 5 
for although we may determine easily what classes deserve 
aid and which require punishment, the separation. of those 
who are worthy from those who are not is sometimes im- 
possible. An impostor may remain long undetected and 
have become a social parasite, whereas funds may be with- 
held from needy families. ‘There may also be very great 
difference of opinion about the best way of aiding any par- 
ticular class of dependents. Especially is this the case with 
the most general problem of all— the question of public, 
or private, charity. 
We do not question the justice of the doctrine that these 
unfortunates should be a public charge. Society is a unit, 
and we believe that society is under obligation to care for 
its poor and for those to whom nature has denied some fac- 
ulty, just as a family is expected to provide for those of its 
members who are unable to care for themselves, ‘This does 
not mean that most of the expenditures for charitable pur- 
poses should be made through government officials, for 
private organizations can often much more easily learn 
whether those applying for help are deserving. In fact, 
government now does little more than care for those depend> 
ents who live in charitable institutions. 
128, Care of Dependent Children.— Two classes to whom 
society owes the best possible care are those children who 
have no one to look after them, and the children who have 
some notable physical or mental defect. If private enter- 
prise fails to provide suitable children’s homes, public in- 
stitutions must be constructed for the purpose of keeping 
orphaned little ones out of the streets and away from evil 
influences. This is felt to be a most: necessary step in the 
process of preventing crime, and consequently should be 
undertaken by the localities for their own safety, if not for 
the sake of the children themselves. 
A second class of dependent children includes ‘those 
afflicted with some physical defect —those that are blind,    
-P-A-G-E-155
CARE FOR PUBLIC WELFARE 121 
deaf, or dumb. If society owes the advantages of a free 
education to its normal children as the best safeguard of its 
free institutions, surely the education of these unfortunates 
is a duty rather than a form of charity, not to be neglected 
under any circumstances. Although these “defectives” 
may not be prepared for a full measure of the activities 
of citizenship, this education opens to them many of the 
opportunities and enjoyments of life, of which they would 
otherwise be deprived by their infirmity. The equipment 
furnished, the methods used, and the instruction given in 
these schools are usually of a high character. 
Publie institutions for weak-minded children are even 
more essential than those for physical defectives, because 
weak-minded children are so much more helpless and more 
apt to be public charges. Although society does not be- 
grudge the care necessary for such unfortunates, it is seek- 
ing to prevent the multiplication of those whose existence 
can be only a burden to themselves and their fellows. The 
existing schools are maintained with an idea of training 
these children to do well a few mechanical duties and of 
developing in them a stronger mentality. 
129, Care of the Insane. One class of dependents whose 
care is left to the government exclusively is that of the in- 
sane. Our government performs this task, not only be- 
cause it is a necessary charity, but, as many insane people 
are dangerous, for the sake of protecting the public. No 
person is, however, placed under the control of government 
officials until he has been examined and declared to be of 
unsound mind. Otherwise it would be possible for people 
that wished to be relieved of some eccentric relative who 
was perfectly sane, to have the latter placed under restraint. 
Public care of the insane varies greatly from State to 
State. (1) Many of the States compel each loculity to 
look after its own, insane persons-being left in poorhouses 
where they are systematically neglected or even maltreated. 
(2) In other States, the most violent patients are sent to Schools for 
the deaf, 
dumb, and 
blind.

the prison authorities of the State. 
130. Care of the Poor.—-Very much the largest number © 
of those dependent on the publie for charity become public 
charges because of their poverty. The character of the 
help given to the poor depends on the degree of their 
> need. If they are not only destitute, but also aged or in- 
firm and without relatives to whom they may look for sup. 
port, they must be placed in public institutions, Few in- 
deed are the localities that have no poorhouse, the care. of . 
these classes being left entirely with the local governmen’ . 
In the northeastern part of the United States it is are 
the towns which care for the poor, but in other parts of tlie’ 
country the counties must assume this duty. In a f    
  _ poorhouses, those capable of working are compelled - te | 
contribute something toward their own support. Often. 
poor farms are maintained, which are managed without 
help from outside, so that the institution is largely self- 
supporting. In many of these institutions the. practical 
management is seriously defective, and often unpardonably 
brutal. This is especially the case where the aged, the 
young, the blind, the insane, the feeble-minded, and the 
sick are herded together. 
Outdoor Relief is often granted by the overseers of the 
poor to those not destitute but needy. The chief danger of

this entire system of relief is thatit is likely to increase the 
poverty it is supposed to alleviate, because shiftless individ- 
uals will look to the government for help, when they should 
support themselves. For a few people most of the time, and 
for many people part of the time, some assistance of this 
kind is necessary. Provisions, clothing, and fuel are the 
articles most commonly furnished, much more being done 
in winter, or when work is scarce, than at other times, A 
few cities have established public lodging houses, wayfarers 
being furnished with beds for the night in return for a rea- 
sonable amount of work. Sometimes temporary employment 
is furnished through the government to those in great need, 
or in order to rid the community of those tramps who will 
leave if forced to find employment. 
131. Other Forms of Charity. There is perhaps no set 
of persons so deserving of sympathy and help as the sick 
poor, Needing skilled care, delicate food, and expensive 
medicines, or still more costly surgical attention, they are 
unable to protect themselves against the ills which, if un- 
checked, will cause death or lives of unending pain. For 
the care of such unfortunates, public hospitals are maintained 
in most cities and by many counties and towns. Physicians 
and nurses are paid by the public to look after the inmates 
of the hospitals. Visiting physicians, in addition, may spend 
a large part of their time without pay in attendance on the 
needy sick who are in their own homes. Those whose ailment 
is less serious can often obtain treatment gratis at the Ordinary -

It is customary, especially in cities, to make appropriations 
of large sums of money annually for the benefit of private

private institutions or organizations are able to discriminate 
better and are less likely to be imposed upon or defrauded,

  GENERAL WELFARE 
132, Parks and Playgrounds.— Certain activities of our 
cities particularly have been extended for the -purposé of 
developing a better and healthier class of citizens. Among 
these are the beautiful public parks, which appeal to. public 
pride and the ssthetic taste of all citizens, with their drives, 
lakes, zodlogical gardens, and numerous forms of free 
amusements. Still more important are the children’s. play- 
grounds that have been established as breathing spaces in 
the tenement districts. In our larger cities playgrounds” 
have been created on pleasure wharves, in roof gardens on 
the tops of school buildings, and in squares where rookeries 
have been demolished, For the children of the poor they 
have replaced the old playgrounds of dirty streets and dark 
alleys; they give room for sunshine, spontaneous play, and 
healthful sports. With the public swimming pools and 
bath houses, their influence for health and cleanliness te- 
makes many lives. Band concerts and other forms of amuse 
ment on Sundays and evenings attract large multitudes ‘of 
adults, to whom innocent amusement is a necessary form 
of recreation. To the multitudes whose days are spent,in 
grinding toil, whose homes offer little or no attraction, whose -. 
vacations come as periods of enforced idleness when times 
are hard, the ever increasing number of parks and play- 
grounds.are an inestimable blessing: 
133. Public Libraries.— A silent,-uplifting force but little 
inferior to the public schools is exercised by the free libra- 
ries that have been established in probably one half of the 
cities and villages in this country. Their work is valuable, 
even through the distribution of the lighter forms of fotion, |

which comprises at least one half of the volumes in circula- 
tion in most libraries, for most of these books are whole- 
some, interesting, and amusing. Through the circulation of 
the better classes of fiction, biographies, histories, scientific 
treatises, and many others, general readers have opportunities 
denied to them a quarter century ago. Where the patrons 
of the libraries are permitted access to the shelves and are 
allowed to examine books, the circulation is increased, and 
interest is awakened in other classes of reading. Most 
libraries have juvenile departments, from which books may 
be drawn by children of a reasonable age. They also 
help to awaken a taste for a better class of literature by 
loaning a large number of books at one time to the dif- 
ferent schools of the city, where they are read freely by the 
pupils. 
Almost as many magazines and books are consulted at 
the libraries as are withdrawn for circulation. Large num- 
bers of the popular magazines and newspapers attract many 
to the reading rooms, while the scientific papers and well- 
selected works of reference are consulted by large numbers 
of scholars. Some of our finest libraries limit themselves 
to reference and consultation work, distributing no books 
whatever. 
134, Control of the Liquor Business.— As intoxicating 
liquors are believed to be responsible for a large part of the 
poverty and crime in existence, governmental control of the 
liquor business is less for the development of public moral- 
ity than for the protection of the public. The general policy 
of. each State is decided by the entire State, either through 
the vote of the people registered in the constitution or by 
the legislature. Three systems may be distinguished: (1) the 
tax license system, under which saloons may be established 
in any town or city of the State under certain conditions; 
(2) the license system with a local option which permits any

boundaries; and (3) state prohibition, under which the manu. *

throughout the State. In all cases the administration of . 
laws relating to the sale of liquors devolves chiefly upon’ 
local officers. eds 
States which depend exclusively upon a system of licens-* 
ing saloons may be classified according to the amount 
the fee paid i in return for the permission or license given. 
If the fee is low, e.g. $50 or $100 a year, the State is said. 
to have a low license system, but high license is used if the. 
fee is that amount per month. The fee varies in different 
parts of all States of course, being higher in the larger.’ 
cities, where a more extensive business is possible. Other. 
conditions are considered in granting licenses. Saloons 
must not be opened near churches, schoolhouses, or public 
parks. In many towns licenses may be revoked if liquor 
is sold to minors, or to any one on Sundays, but even when 
the law provides for these regulations, they are not enforced. 
unless the general public really so desires. One of the 
chief objections urged against high license is that the high 
fee leads to evasion of the law and to illegal selling, © 
for perfect enforcement of any liquor laws seems. difficalt - 
to obtain. . 
135. Prohibition and Local Option.— More than one th . 
of the States at some time have prohibited the manufacture 
and sale of intoxicating liquors within their limits. At the * 
present time, nine have such laws, and in one of these, 
Maine, the law has existed in various forms for sixty. year: 
So far as manufacture is concerned, prohibition actually: pro- - 
hibits ; but a different result may be noticed in connection 
with the question, of sale, and the result is easily summa. 
vized: where the community earnestly favors prohibition; 
public sale is impossible, while private sale is difficult, . 
and usually punished; where the community is indifferent,-~ 
illegal traffic is common; but where prohibition is distaste.

ful, as in many cities of size, there is little attempt to con- 
ceal the places where liquor can be obtained. 
In about two thirds of the States, the towns, districts, or 
counties are permitted to decide, by popular vote, whether 
they will have “license” or “no license.” By this method 
local prohibition exists over at least one half the area of 
the United States, but only in those parts where it is favored 
for personal or business reasons. It can readily be seen 
that the enforcement of the law in these localities is likely 
to be better than those of prohibition States, but the difi- 
culties of enforcement are apt to be greater, because impor- 
tation from neighboring towns or counties is easy. Al 
though free from the glaring defects that characterize the 
administration of the anti-saloon law in some States that 
have prohibition, local option, nevertheless, encounters much 
the same class of difficulties as those found under prohibi- 
tion.

SUPERVISION OF COMMERCIAL INTERESTS 
136. Government in its Relation to Business. — Modern 
governments are very closely connected with the business 
interests of the people, although there is considerable dif- 
ference of opinion regarding the closeness and character of 
these relations. Many people believe that government 
should limit itself to warding off dangers from which a busi- 
ness man cannot possibly protect himself; others advocate 
the greatest amount of aid to business, in the form of fuvor- 
able legislation and actual money subsidies; but the majority 
believe that business should be protected and promoted as . 
much as may be demanded by the bestinterests of the whole 
people. 
So much of our ordinary business is transacted through 
corporations, which are really artificial persons created by 
the State, that supervision of corporations is essential. So 
much business, at least ninety-five per cent, is done not-with 
cash, but on credit, that safeguards are necessary to preserve . 
a credit system. Contracts, written or unwritten, play so 
large a part in commercial transactions that indefiniteness in _ 
the law of contracts or laws affecting parties engaged in 
business, or uncertainty in the enforcement of such laws, 
would be fatal to industry and commerce. Moreover, every 
line of activity is depressed by unjust, discriminating laws, 
and is benefited by the wise, fostering legislation. 
Many undertakings are of such a nature that they must 
be performed or specially supervised by our governments. 
Canals or railways are semé-public enterprises or common 
carriers which cannot be allowed to manage their business 
180 :

to the disadvantage of any person or community. Improve- 
ments of a public nature, like the location and improvement 
of highways, should not be left to private parties. Essentials 
like water for cities should be owned and managed by the. 
public. Government must have special power of regulation, 
and, if necessary, prohibition over necessary but dangerous 
or objectionable industries such as powder factories, gas works, 
or garbage incinerators. In its final analysis the power 
to regulate must include, if necessary, the power to prohibit. 
TRANSPORTATION 
137. Public Highways.— Among the most necessary im- 
provements made by our governments or under their super- 
vision are the streets of our cities and the rural roads. 
The location is the first question to be considered. City 
streets are usually laid out in convenient rectangular blocks, 
civic beauty having been disregarded in most of our cities. 
Washington is a notable exception, since its avenues con- 
necting the public buildings give an impression like that 
created by Paris or Vienna. Very often, streets are located 
according to no definite plan, so that not only beauty but 
convenience is lacking. 
The problem of locating city streets is much less serious 
than that of rural roads, the latter having been neglected 
even more than that of city streets. The earliest good 
roads in this country, constructed by private turnpike com- 
panies, usually connected important villages or cities, but. 
since private construction has given place everywhere to 
government construction, which means ordinarily mainte- 
nance by towns or small counties, no definite principles of 
engineering or public policy have been followed. There has 
been no proper classification of rural highways as through 
roads or local roads. Little attempt has been made to find 
the best route between two centers of population, or have its 
feeders constructed at the right points, or along the hest Laying out 
city streets.

course. No account is taken of hills, which are crossed with 
heavy grades on both sides, or even rivers, which must be 
forded or bridged at considerable expense. 
The right to lay out streets is given to the city council, 
‘and for rural highways is conferred usually upon the county 
boards. Streets are ordinarily cut through before the prop- 
erty becomes valuable, but at times it is necessary to open 
.@ new street or widen an old one at great expense. When 
streets or roads are needed, rights of way are obtained from 
the property owners if possible, at a price acceptable. to the 
owners and the officials. If they disagree concerning the 
value of the right of way, the government exercises the 
right of eminent domain, which permits some court, after 
investigation, to condemn the property and to appoint refer- 
ees, who fix a reasonable price which the government ahall 
pay. 
138. Improvement of Highways.— We Americans have 
not yet learned that, particularly in road making, the best-is 
the cheapest. “Most of our rural roads are broad, flat stretches 
of dirt, with heavy grades, and in rainy weather or in’ the 
‘spring, an appalling amount of mud. We are beginning: to 
realize that a team can haul several times as heavy a load 
over a hard-surfaced road with minimum grades as it. car nm 
the ordinary. dirt road in fair weather. At present, the cost 
of the property required for a road, of grading it and of 
surfacing it, is usually borne in the form of a road t 
all the property owners of the road district in which 
located. In many parts of the United States, farmers 
allowed to “work out” their road taxes, contributing: a 
certain number of days’ labor with or without teams. - This 
custom is becoming rarer, for gradually road making is being 
reduced to a science, Since good roads are in the end found 
to be more economical than poor roads, the surfacing of ‘the 
highways is now quite frequently left to engineers and 
their assistants. The national government has sent road- 
makers to different parts of the country, giving object les-

sons on the means of improving highways and showing the 
folly of poor roads even in thinly settled territory. Some 
of the States have expended large sums of money building 
good thorough roads, and some are following the lead of New 
Jersey, which grants to the localities from the state treas- 
ury a sum equal to the amount expended by each for good 
roads. : 
’ City streets are used so much more than rural roads that 
the need of surfacing is much greater. Streets are improved 
usually in such a way and at such a time as the majority of 
the owners of the abutting property may desire. For 
central streets the major part of the expense incurred in 
these changes is ordinarily borne by the city, the remainder 
being paid by special assessments upon the property on 
either side of the new street. Owners on most residence 
streets pay the entire cost of their improvements except for 
corners. The pavements in residence districts are much 
less costly than on business streets, as the wear and tear is 
much less. Macadam pavements of crushed rock are used 
frequently, wood blocks are often satisfactory, and a scien- 
tifically oiled pavement-is found cheap and excellent if the 
travel is light. Business streets require asphalt pavements 
with deep concrete bases, or heavy stone blocks. Cobbdie- 
stones are still used in some localities. Pavements are 
supposed to be kept in repair by the street department, 
and sprinkled by the sprinkling department, while the

Street improvements are usually made by private con-

139. Rivers and Canals.— All rivers and canals within a 
single State are controlled by the State in which they are 
located. Canal construction has been either supervised or 
undertaken by the state authorities, as local canals. are 
seldom built unless they are of such importance in state or 
interstate trade that local officials cannot be permitted. to 
interfere. Navigation on streams or private canals is super- 
vised by the States, although a minimum amount of state con- 
trol has been exercised, the regulations dealing ordinarily 
with such matters as the licensing of boats, boiler inspee- 
tion, provisions for the safety of passengers and wharf regu- 
lations. Occasionally rates are controlled as well, but as 
these are likely to be lower than on stages or railways that 
may be brought into competition, very little supervision 
seems necessary. Comparatively small sums have been ex- 
pended by state authorities in improving natural waterways. 
During the quarter century following the War of 1812, 
when interest in state enterprises was very great and there 
were at first no railways, many state canals were built, espe- 
cially in the region south of the Great Lakes. The most 
famous and most important of these is the Erie Canal from 
Buffalo to the Hudson River, a canal which has been widened 
and deepened many times. Some of these canals never paid 
a fair interest on the money invested. Others, like the 
Erie Canal, repaid the original cost and improvements until 
they were made free. As freight can be carried by water 
from the head of Lake Superior to New York for one-fourth 
the cost of transportation by rail, this canal at least has 
had and has now a great influence in reducing freight rates. 
The project of making ship canals of the Erie Canal and 
others is really a national question (§ 259), too expensive 
an undertaking for the State, to which only part of the 
benefit would accrue. 
140, Control of Railways.— The control of commerce on 
railways or highways exclusively within one State, 1s a task 
to be performed:solely by that State. According to the Cun-
-P-A-G-E-173
SUPERVISION OF COMMERCIAL INTERESTS 135 
stitution of the United States, Congress may regulate com- 
merce between the States, but it cannot in any way interfere 
with a State’s supervision of state commerce. On account 
of the multiplication of railways after the Civil War, there 
arose the need of state railway commissions to settle dis- 
putes between shippers and railways. As railways are 
quasi-public corporations and have received not only privi- 
leges but help in the form of land grants and concessions, it 
is just that the state governments should demand in return 
that the railways charge reasonable rates for all distances, 
and that they do not charge one shipper more than another 
for similar services. 
State railway commissions, which seek to protect the 
shippers and the public, are to be found in more than two 
thirds of the States. Not all use the same methods for the 
control of the railways, and it is customary to distinguish 
two classes of commissions. (1) Those of the first class aim 
to control the railways by fiwing the maximum rates which 
may be charged for carrying freight or passengers different 
distances. In addition, they usually have power to prevent 
the combinations of railways, which wish to unite for the 
purpose of preventing competition. (2) Railway commis- 
sions of the second class do not have power to fix rates, but 
devote their energies to investigating the cost and the profits 
of transportation. When these railway statistics are published, 
if the charges are exorbitant and the profits unusual; public 
sentiment is relied upon to reduce both to a reasonable 
amount. Some regulation is certainly essential to prevent 
the unnecessary and unwise multiplication of railways, to 
avoid the worst forms of mismanagement, and to keep the 
great transportation companies from sacrificing the public 
to their own ends. Yet neither of these classes of commis- 
sions seems to have solved satisfactorily the question of 
properly controlling state commerce. The whole subject 
of railway control will be considered much more fully 
later (§§ 259-262). : Two classes

give the national government the right to control industrial 
Hoyt, A.M., corporations, except so far as they are also engaged in inter- 
in Annals state commerce (§ 262). The whole task of controlling 
Pol. Sci, ordinary corporations is therefore left to the States. This 
aos has proved to be serious, because most of the important 
° corporations of the present day are engaged in business in 
several States and obtain their charters, i.e. take out incor- 
poration papers, in the State which will give them the 
greatest number of privileges and require the least from 
them in return. A corporation is allowed, then, to transact 
business in any part of the Union under its liberal charter, 
and the other States in whieh it transacts business find 
difficulty in protecting the interests of their people, because 
the privileges possessed by the corporation give it unusual 
powers. If the control of one State is more lenient than that 
of others, large companies will take out their incorporation 
papers and maintain offices in that State, although most or all 
of their business may be in other States. This makes it 
possible for a corporation to evade a strict incorporation 
law, and makes it impossible for any State properly to 
enforce a reasonably severe corporation law, much.to the 
loss not only of the State, but of the entire country. 
Regulations Comparatively little control is exercised over corporations

142. Regulation of Savings Corporations. — Special regu- 
lations are provided for those corporations which are de- 
voted especially to the care of the people’s savings. These 
include the savings banks, trust companies, and insurance 
companies, similar regulations being established for the 
commercial state banks, which receive checking deposits and 
-loan money on short-time notes. Banks are not allowed to 
take out incorporation papers unless they have a reasonable 
amount of paid-up capital. In most States they cannot buy 
stocks or speculate in other ways. They are required to 
keep a certain percentage of all their deposits as a reserve, 
and are permitted to loan money only on certain securities. Savings and

The savings banks are well restricted in most States, but 29-42, 
the laws regarding trust companies have been alarmingly 
lax. Those for the commercial state banks have been none 
too strict, although vastly ‘more severe than the laws under 
which banking was permitted before the Civil War! A 
plan tried by Oklahoma of government guarantee of bank 
deposits has been considered by a number of other States, 
Life insurance companies ave a form of savings institutions 
which the state jaws are supposed to regulate carefully. 
The danger from lenient laws, carelessly administered, 
was shown by the extravagance, speculation, and cor- 
ruption brought to light by the insurance investigations in 
New York and other States in 1905. Most of the States 
in which large insurance companies have their headquarters 
have revised their laws carefully since 1906, but constant 
vigilance is required to insure the protection of savings 
which have been intrusted to insurance companies or 
banks, |

trusts. Combinations of capital have been found so much 
more profitable than attempts to do business under com- 
petition, that in more than one line of activity a single trust 
has gained control of almost all of the output of the article 
which it manufactures. As it has almost a monopoly, it 
can raise prices, discriminate with impunity against indi- 
viduals or cities, and crush small competitors by the use of 
unfair means. To protect the people from a trust which 
charges exorbitant rates, or otherwise controls business for- 
its own interests, is not easy. 
The different States have attempted to solve this problem 
in one of three ways. (1) Many States by declaring trusts 
illegal have sought to destroy them. (2) Other States have 
tried to keep the trusts within bounds by compelling them 
to publish complete accounts of their expenses and earnings. 
(3) Some of the States have done nothing, either from fear.. 
that no law against the trusts could be enforced, or because’ 
they believed a trust to be a distinct public benefit, since: it 
abolishes the wastes of competition. Judging from our .+ 
experience in this matter, the attempt to control trusts by . 
very radical legislation is likely to do more harm than good, 
as harsh laws will injure ordinary corporations and cannot. 
easily be enforced against the more powerful companies,

144. The State Labor Laws.— Most States have laws 
for the benefit and protection of the laboring classes, since 
employees cannot easily protect themselves. These are: 
administered by labor bureaus or special officers such as 
factory inspectors. Among the laws are those regulating 
the hours of labor, and others compelling employers to pro- 
vide for the health and safety of their employees, or mak- 
ing employers liable for injuries received by employees... 
Many of the States limit the number of hours required 
for a day’s labor on public work to eight or ten, and assert. 
that the same number shall be a legal day’s work for private 
     
-P-A-G-E-177
SUPERVISION OF COMMERCIAL INTERESTS 139 
parties, but by contract any employee may agree to work 
any number of hours he chooses. In the case of minors and 
of women, however, the laws are more strict, most States 
prescribing a minimum age limit — usually fourteen, butsome- 
times twelve—-at which children shall be employed in 
factories, and fixing the maximum hour limit per week for 
which women and children may be employed. 
Very. few of the commonwealths where manufacturing is 
prominent have failed to demand that every company shall 
do certain things in order to protect the health and safety of 
JSactory employees. Overcrowding is prohibited, fire escapes 
are required, and boiler inspection is made obligatory. In 
those cities where sweat shops are common, statutes seek 
to prohibit them entirely or reduce their disadvantages as 
far as possible. 
A partially successful crusade has been waged against 
the use of child labor in factories or mines, because of the 
serious evils which follow the employment of children in 
these injurious occupations. Many advocate the enactment 
of a national law forbidding the shipment from one State 
to another of child-made goods. 
While we have not done as much as some of the States of Europe 
in holding employers responsible for accidents to those in their charge, 
the law ordinarily requires that every precaution must be taken to 
Prevent accidents to employees whose work entails risk to life or limb. 
This is especially true of railways; but, as a rule, the provisions for 
compensation of persons injured in the performance of their duties are 
very imperfect ; and frequently, as in the case of the railway coupling- 
pin, corporations have refused or neglected to adopt life-saving devices 
on account of the expense entailed. 
145. Supervision of other Hoonomic Interests. Most of 
the States have endeavored to protect their natural re- 
sources to some extent. In very few instances has the 
water power remained in’ state control, but many States 
have established forest reserves, especially where these will 
protect the head waters of important streams. Some help Stimson,

has been given to the agricultural interests through the state 
departments of agriculture, which have supervision of the 
pure food laws (§121), encourage the development of 
special products like fruits or sugar beets, and aid farmers’ 
institutes by showing better methods of cultivation. 
More has been done to protect game and: keep up a stock 
of fish. Very few kinds of game can be- shot at any time, 
for in the majority of the States the close season, when 
hunting is prohibited, covers most of the year, the time 
varying for different animals or birds. Many States have 
also fish hatcheries from which the streams are kept sup- 
plied with trout and other native fishes. This work is 
aided by the national fish commission, which has made spe- 
cial effort to develop supplies of cod, salmon, and shad.

of any investment may be met by borrowing money, but 
the money for the ordinary expenditures must be obtained 
from the ordinary revenue, the larger part of which is 
derived from taxation. 
In America, the right to tax and expend money is a power 
left to our legislative bodies, the state legislatures, the 
county boards, and the city councils. Limitations are some- 
‘times placed on the amount of money that may be raised 
in any year, by limiting the maximum tax rate to be levied, 
or in other ways. Although our legislative bodies always 
propose bond issues for extraordinary expenditures, they 
are obliged to obtain the consent of the voters before the 
bonds can be sold, and they are frequently restricted by a 
limitation of the amount of debt that their government may 
ineur. 
148. Characteristics of a Good Tax.—-There are certain 
characteristics that every tax should possess. Among these, 
five are especially important. (1) It should be accord: 
ing to the citizen’s Avinity to pay. It is now generally felt 
that ability should be the test of the amount paid in taxes, 
because it is a social duty for the individual to contribute 
to the support of the government in proportion to his means. 
But there is still a great deal of disagreement over the best 
way to determine ability, some favoring the net income, Powers of

others the gross income, and a third set the value of the - 
property a man owns, (2) The times and methods of 
assessment and collection should not be arbitrary, but fixed 
and known to all. (8) The tax should be as little felt as 
possible. All of the burden should not be placed upon a 
single class, as in many of the French taxes just before the 
great Revolution. An old but defective tax is often less 
felt than a new, though much better, tax. Changes should, 
in consequence, take place only when the good to be derived 
‘clearly overbalances the difficulty the people encounter in 
adjusting themselves to the change. (4) It should be easily 
administered. It should not be so hard to assess the tax

that a premium is placed on dishonesty. No tax can be 
easily administered that does not meet with the support of 
the people, or of which the cost of collection is great. 
(5) It should be suited to the district for which it is assessed. 
The absurdity of allowing cities or even States to levy 
customs duties or internal revenue is clearly apparent, while 
a general land tax would be about as little suited to the 
purpose of the central government. 
By a system of taxes we mean the sum total of all of the taxes levied 
by any one government. In most countries there are two tax sys- 
tems : —the national and the local; in this country we have at least 
three :—the national, the state, and the local. Now, asa matter of fact, 
no one tax is likely to possess all of the characteristics we have just 
enumerated, But if no tax is seriously.defective, and if the system as 
@ whole conforms to these characteristics, the tax system might be said 
to be good. But in order to be satisfactory, a tax system must do 
more than that. The systems of the nation, the state, and the locali- 
ties must not conflict or greatly overlap, while each system must be 
adapted to the peculiar needs of its government, as shown in the ex- 
penditures of that government. 
Tue GEeNrRAL Propverty Tax 
149. Character. Assessment. — At least three fourths of 
all the revenue for the state and local governments comes 
from the general property taw, which is in universal use for 
the support of our local governments, and is used as the 
chief resource of the state governments, except in a few 
manufacturing States. This tax is levied theoretically upon 
everything that possesses value. Itis customary to say that 
one part of the tax is that assessed upon real estate, i.e. lands 
and houses, while the rest is upon personal property, includ- 
ing house furniture, stock of goods in stores, farm imple- 
ments, horses and cattle, notes, bonds, and other forms of 
credit. .

property, with an estimate of its value. He must swear 
that this inventory, known as a statement, contains a com- 
plete and correct list of all his'taxable wealth. . With these Plehn,

statements in their possession, the assessor and his assist~ 
ants make up the assessment rolls, showit'g the total 
assessable value of property within their district, usually a 
town or some other subdivision of the county. 
Certain classes of property are exempt from taxation. 
In most States churches that are used exclusively for re- 
ligious services are not taxed, Taxes are not paid upon 
school buildings or other public property. The list of ex- 
empted property often includes more than a tenth of all the 
property within a town or city. 
150. Difficulties in assessing Property.— There are cer- 
tain difficulties inseparable from the assessment of any 
property. The assessed value of real estate must depend to 
a great extent upon the assessor’s judgment, and, for that 
reason, it is difficult to secure a perfectly uniform assessment 
even by one man. But as no one person is likely to do all 
this work within a town, and as it would be absolutely im- 
possible for all of the property within a county to be assessed 
by a single assessor, the danger that some individuals will 
be compelled to pay more than their share of the tax is 
indeed great. 
With personal property, much more trouble is experienced 
than with real estate. A great part of this form of wealth 
may be concealed easily, so that the assessors are ignorant 
of its existence. Asa rule the inequalities of assessment of 
personal property, and consequently of taxation between 
man and man, are very marked. In many States little 
attempt is now made to search out these more “ intangible” 
kinds of property, and the personal property tax law -is 
practically a “dead letter.” A large number of States are 
seeking to reach this form of wealth through other channels, 
as we shall see (§§ 153-154). Exempted

Boards of 151. Equalization and Collection. — In order to have the assess- 
equaliza- = ment of property in the different towns of a county as nearly uniform 
ton. as possible, county boards of equalization have been formed, The 
principal work of the boards is to decide whether the assessors of any 
: town have been too lax or too strict, If they find that any set of 
Adams, assessors has assessed their town too low, the assessment is raised to 
445-449, correspond with the others, The assessments from the counties are 
treated in the same way by the state board of equalization, which con- 
siders evidence to determine whether the assessment throughout the 
State is uniform, and, if it is not, to make it as nearly so as possible. 
. The chief difficulty that the boards of equalization encounter is the 
undervaluation of property within an entire county, in order to reduce 
the state tax of that county to a minimum amount. In one State this 
process of undervaluation was carried so far that at one time no coun- 
ty’s property was assessed at even one fifth of its value. The attempt 
to equalize assessments is, at the best, but partially successful. 
The tax When the boards of equalization have completed their tasks, the tax 
rate. rate for the coming year can be ascertained easily. The amount of 
money needed to run the city, county, or state government has already 
been established by the legislative body in its total appropriations. 
‘When this sum has been divided by the total assessed value of prop- 
erty within the city or county, the rate of tax upon every dollar's 
~ worth of property is known. All taxes not paid before a certain day 
become delinguent, and a penalty of: from one to ten per cent, besides 
interest at a high rate, is added to the amount of the taxes. If still 
unpaid, the government for which the tax was assessed allows any 
one who will pay the tax to collect the amount, giving him what is 
Virtually a first mortgage upon the property at a high rate of interest. 
Because of these rigid regulations, the prompt payment of taxes is 
customary,

extent to which the general property tax is used must be

taken ag an indication of its value. Indeed, the tax is quite 
satisfactory in agricultural communities that have no large 
cities, and none of whose people are especially wealthy in 
other things than houses and lands. Unfortunately few of 
our States can be said to be of this class, for with the very 
great development of commerce and industry during the 
last two or three decades, the inequalities of wealth have 
become more striking. Our city population has meanwhile 
increased from one fifth to one third of the whole popula- 
tion. The present outlook is that the general property tax 
will be used much less by the state governments than formerly, 
although it is likely to be the financial mainstay of the 
localities for a long time to come. 
The principal objections to the general property tax may 
be stated as follows: — 
(1) It is practically impossible to discover and assess 
“intangible” property through this tax, and the tax is, 
therefore, in reality a real estate tax, although theoreti- 
cally a tax on general property. 
(2) As a result of this failure, the farmer and the poor 
mnan pay more than their proportional share of the tax, and 
very much more than their wealthier neighbors in propor- 
tion to their ability. 
(3) Because of the difficulties of assessing it over a large 
area, it is not a good state tax. 
- If we compare these defects with the characteristics 
noted in § 148, we shall see why the general property tax 
is so unjust and unsatisfactory. 
Orner Forms or Revenun 
153, Corporation Taxes.— Because the general property 
tax has failed to reach personal property, and may be

by means of corporation taxes. Two States have general 
corporation taxes levied on all corporations doing business 
within their limits, but most of the States that are trying 
this form of taxation do not attempt to tax the ordinary 
corporation, for the ordinary corporation is little different 
from the individual whose property and stock in trade are 
reached under the general property tax. They levy their 
taxes principally on the great corporations which do so 
much business and have so little competition that they are 
almost monopolies, or else upon those public service corpora- 
tions upon whom special privileges have been conferred by the 
people. Both classes of these great corporations have escaped 
a large share of taxation in the past. 
Some States try to tax banks by making them pay a 
certain per cent of their stock. Insurance companies are 
taxed on the total amount of the premiums they receive 
each year. Large manufacturing corporations are often 
obliged to contribute a part of their net income, but more 
frequently the tax is assessed upon their capital stock. 
Railways, both within and outside of cities, express compa- 
nies, telegraph and telephone companies, are often taxed 
separately. Sometimes these companies are assessed accord- 
ing to the value of their franchises, which is usually repre- 
sented by the market value of their stock. 
154. Questions regarding Corporation Tazxation.— There 
is little uniformity in the methods used by the different 
States in their attempts to reach corporate wealth, a great 
contrast being presented in that respect to the general prop- 
erty tax, which is alike in most of the commonwealths. 
Not only do the States vary greatly in their views regarding 
the corporations to be taxed, as noted in the preceding 
section, but they have adopted at least a dozen different 
ractices, when they decide whether the tax shall be levied 
a the franchise, the stock, or some form of the earnings. _ 
1Many think that corporations should pay taxes according to the pat 
value of their stock; others assess the market value of the stock. “Some

Corporation taxes will undoubtedly be used more each 
decade, although they may not be adopted extensively on 
account of problems in adininistration. Since our business 
life is not simple as it once was, our present systems of taxa- 
tion in most of the States are unjust and cannot be adapted 
" to our present-day industrial conditions. Most European 
countries have tried and found fairly successful some forms 
of corporation taxes, and the Eastern States that have de. 
pended chiefly on corporation taxes find them superior for 
purposes of state revenue, and more just to the poorer classes Reasons for

taxes. 
than the taxes which they replaced. It has been found ” 
possible to avoid the two great dangers of industrial taxa- 
tion. (1) The chief objection to levying taxes on industry 
is that industry may be injured by the extra burden im- 
posed, In practice it is found that to-day industry can 
afford to pay taxes better than agriculture or labor. (2) Un- 
der our present system of federal government, the States 
must avoid severe laws against corporations (§141) or these 
will transfer their business in some cases to other States. 
This danger has not been realized in the attempts. to tax 
corporations. . 
155, Inheritance Taxes.— Another favorite device of the 
newer systems of state taxation is the tax upon inheritances. 
This is based upon the principle that the State has a real 
claim upon the property of any one who has amassed wealth 
under the protection of its laws, if this property is trans- 
ferred without cost to another who did not aid in its accu- 
believe that the amount of business transacted should be used; others 
approve the gross earnings as the best form for assessment. In some 
cases, the dividends paid are used as the basis of assessments, and in still 
others the net earnings of the corporations are used. Frequently the tax 
is levied upon the franchise, which is supposed to represent the real 
amonnt of a corporation’s business, but the term is very indefinite, for 
different States determine the value of the franchises in turn by consider- 
ing one or all of the bases just mentioned. Most students of the subject 
agree that the net earnings represent best the capacity of corporations to 
pay taxes, but our governments have made little use of that base in assess- 
ing taxes, because it is more difficult to determine net earnings than most 
of the other bases that have been considered. Principle

mulation. It is held that legatees who acquire wealth which 
they have not earned are able to pay a fair percentage of 
money bequeathed to them in the form of a tax. Inkerit- 
ance tames are used in most foreign ¢ countries and in about. 
oue half of the States. . 
Few, if any, of the States require a tax to be paid upon 
small bequests to a wife, a husband, or a child. But if the 
bequest is large, or the legatee not closely related to the 
deceased, a large percentage of the property left must be 
paid into the state treasury. In other words, the tax is 
often progressive, t.e. the rate increases with the amount of 
the bequest or the lack of relationship between the deceased 
and the legatee. This conforms with the tests that persons 
should pay taxes according to their ability and to the demo- 
cratic demand that the State has a claim on bequests, but 
the smallest claim in the case of members of the immediate 
family. 
156. Local Revenue from Business.— A form of revenue 
of some importance is the system of licenses used sometimes 
by the States, but much more commonly by the localities. 
The most profitable licenses, from the standpoint of govern+ 
mental revenues, are those granted to liquor saloons. AS a _ 
+ rule, fortunately, the question of high or low license has 
heen considered not for its bearing upon the revenue of a 
sommunity, but upon the public welfare (§ 134). As would 
aaturally be expected, the income from this source is 
greater under high than under low license. Licenses are 
usually made obligatory for many other kinds of business, 
such as selling drugs and maintaining theaters, and some- 
times for the ordinary professions and occupations. A 
great many licenses, however, are granted for little more 
than the cost of drawing the necessary papers, so that these 
really do not become a source of profit to the government. 
Especially in cities, a part of the revenue is derived from 
business enterprises conducted by the government. Since many 
cities own their system of waterworks, the charges collected
-P-A-G-E-191
_ STATE AND LOCAL FINANCE 153 
from the patrons add to the municipal income. When Bullock

to be small, as the business is usually conducted with a view 
of doing as much as possible for the citizens, rather than of 
making money (§ 79). 
The sale of franchises for public utilities (§ 78) is even now Increasing 
a help in paying a city’s expenses, for in many cities not hou 
only is a sum paid for the franchise, but a percentage of the franchises. 
gross receipts from the business must be paid into the city 
treasury. The gift to corporations of franchises of enormous Municipal

the history of our city governments.

unjust one to the laboring classes. In a few .of these 
States, no elector may vote unless he has paid his poll tax’. 
for the preceding year. 
The cost of local improvements is usually met, in part at 
least, by special assessments upon the property most benefited. 
In grading and paving a street, for example, the owners of . 
the real estate on both sides of the street will be asked” 
to pay for the improvement in proportion to the amount of 
their property. 
An examination of the scheme of taxation in use in the | 
States, cities, and counties show that most of the tax systems 
in use (§ 148) are not well adapted to the social and busi- 
ness needs of the people. This is due chiefly to the great 
dependence placed upon the general property tax. The ex--. 
ceptions are those rural communities in which almost all 
property is visible, the States which, by separating state from 
local taxation, have established satisfactory corporation 
taxes, and the cities which depend upon real estate, profits 
from public utilities, and licenses upon local business. 
158. Borrowing Money. — It is hardly possible that any 
government will borrow money to meet current expenses. 
But when a city buildsa number of schoolhouses, or a county: 
erects a new courthouse, it seems unjust to lay the whole | 
burden of these undertakings upon the taxpayers during the 
year or two in which the work is being done. As authority 
to borrow money is ordinarily given to the different govern- 
ments by the state constitution, it is usual to issue bonds at 
four or five per cent interest to the amount needed for the 
work. These bonds are sold publicly to the highest bidders, the 
government proceeding to collect in taxes yearly enough to 
pay the interest upon the bonds, arid to set aside one twen- ~ 
tieth, one thirtieth, or one fortieth of their face value, which 
goes into a fund for the redemption of the bonds at the end 
of twenty, thirty, or forty years, or is used to redeem part 
of the bonds each year. 
About the middle of the last century, some of our state
-P-A-G-E-193
STATE AND LOCAL FINANCE 155 
and city governments were so anxious to invest public money 
in private enterprises and to expend large sums upon public 
improvements, that they incurred immense debts. To pre- 
vent the recurrence of this extravagance, the state consti- 
tutions have placed a limit on the amount of debt that any of 
its local governments may incur, and in many cases on the 
amount that state governments may contract. They have 
also prohibited the expenditure of money as subsidies to in- 
dividuals or corporations. Very few cities in the country 
are allowed to borrow amounts that exceed five per cent of 
the assessed valuation of property within their boundaries, 
except for investments in public utilities. 
In a large and constantly increasing number of cities, the 
councils are not allowed to borrow more than a small sum 
of money, unless they have first asked and obtained the 
approval of the voters at the polls.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE SPHERE OF STATE ACTIVITY 
189, The Powers denied to the States._-As we noticed 
in the first chapter (§ 11), our federal system of government 
is so constituted that certaih duties are intrusted by the 
people to the national government, while all the other func- 
tions of government are left with the States, to be exercised 
by them through either their state or their local govern- 
ments. The United States Constitution enumerates the 
powers granted to the national government, such as the right 
to levy taxes, declare war and make peace, provide an army 
and a navy, arrange’ treaties, regulate foreign and inter- 
state commerce, coin money, and govern national territory ; 
and the same Constitution mentions which of these powers 
and what others are especially forbidden to the States. 
No State can engage in war or raise an army unless 
actually invaded, nor collect duties upon imported goods 
except for the national treasury, nor make any treaty. 
The States may not coin money, issue paper money, “make 
anything but gold or silver a tender in payment of debts, 
pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law impairing 
the obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility.” 
Furthermore, no State may establish a system of slavery, 
“ make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges 
or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall 
any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, 
without due process of law; nor deny to any person within 
its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” No 
State is allowed to abridge the right of citizens of the

United States to vote on account of race, color, or previous 
condition of servitude. 
Unless, however, a power. is granted to the United. 
States government exclusively, or denied to the States in 
explicit language, it may be exercised by any State as it 
sees fit. This very broad sphere of state activity we shall 
consider under the three following heads: (1) the consti- 
tutions under which these powers are actively exercised; 
(2) the uniformity and diversity in legislation and admin- 
istration among the different States on the subjects left to- 
their control; and (8) a summary of the classes of duties 
performed by the States. 
Tue State Constitutions 
160. The Character of a State Constitution.— A state 
constitution is the fundamental law which the people of the 
State have arranged for their government and protection. 
Unless they have overstepped the limit of the sphere of 
activity left to the State by the people of the whole United 
States, thetr constitution can be modified only by themselves, 
This is but another way of saying that within that sphere 
of activity which we have been considering in Chapters 
VIII to XI, and which is summarized in §§ 167-171, 
the people of each State have the right to complete self- 
government. But if any article of a state constitution is con~ 
trary to the Constitution of the United States, it must be 
revised, because the national “ Constitution and the laws of 
the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, 
and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the 
authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law 
thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any State 
to the contrary notwithstanding.” For the same reason, the ~ 
constitution of a State might be amended by the adoption 
of an amendment to the national Constitution which the
-P-A-G-E-197
THE SPHERE OF STATE ACTIVITY 159 
State did not ratify. For instance, if an amendment were 
adopted conferring upon Congress the power to make a 
national suffrage law stating who might vote for all officials 
to be elected within the United States, the congrecsional 
law authorized by this amendment would supersede all the 
articles in the state constitutions on that subject. 
On the other hand, a law made by the state legislature 
which conflicts with the state constitution will be set aside 
by the courts as unconstitutional and void. ‘The state con- 
stitutions can therefore be changed only by the people of 
the States, acting directly and through special representa- 
tives, except upon those rare occasions when an amendment 
to the United States Constitution affects that of the State. 
161. Formation of a State Constitution. — Several of the 
States have constitutional conventions at regular intervals 
to revise the existing constitutions ;! but most of them give 
the legislatures the right to decide when a new convention 
shall be called.? The first step is taken when the legisla- 
ture passes a resolution asking the voters to signify at the 
next regular election whether they wish a new constitu- 
tional’ convention. Such a resolution is not usually passed 
by. an ordinary vote, as nearly one half of the States demand 
that two thirds of the members elected to each house of the 
legislature shall approve the resolution before the people 
vote upon the question. If, at the next election, a majority 
of the voters favor the convention, the legislature arranges 
for the election of delegates in districts throughout the 
18ix state constitutions require periodical votes upon whether con~ 
ventions shall be called or not. The interval in New Hampshire is seven 
years; in Iowa, ten; in Michigan, sixteen; and in New York, Maryland, 
and Ohio it is twenty years. 
2 Fifteen of the States have had but one constitution each, seven of 
these, however, being the new States admitted since 1888. Only three 
States— Massachusetts (1780), New Hampshire (1792), and Vermont (1793) — 
have eighteenth century constitutions. South Carolina and Georgia have 
had the largest number of constitutions, each having tried six besides 
those adopted during the period of the Civil War. 
Oklahoma permits the voters by use of the “initiative” to propose a 
convention for revision of the state constitution. Bryce, 4m.

State, and designates a time anda place for the convention 
to hold its sessions. The meeting of a convention is an im~ 
portant event, and the delegates are usually selected with 
great care. 
When its organization has been completed, the convention 
may decide merely to revise the present state constitution, 
but frequently the changes are both numerous and radical. 
After completing its work, it may declare by resolution 
that the new constitution goes into force the first of the 
year following, except in about one quarter of the States, 
the constitutions of which make it obligatory for the con- 
ventions to submit the new constitutions to the-voters for their 
approval or disapproval. As a rule, however, the conven- 
tions voluntarily do this, since it has become an unwritten 
law in most parts of the Union that popular ratification 
shall be the last step in the process of framing a state con- 
stitution! Then, if the new constitution is not approved, 
the old one remains in force. 
162. Amendment of the Constitution.— As the state con- 
stitutions are usually quite long and complex, changes are 
constantly being made through the adoption of separate: 
amendments. There are two rather different methods of 
amendment. (1) The proposed amendment is accepted -by 
a fairly large majority in each house of one legislature, and 
is then left for the legislature chosen at the next election. 
Lf the amendment is approved by this second. legislature, 
a vote is taken upon it at the following state election, and 
if indorsed by a majority of those voting, it becomes a part 
of the constitution. (2) Many of the newer States, for the 
purpose of avoiding the serious delays which are inevitable 
with the first method, give two thirds of those elected to each 
legislative house the right to propose amendments, which 
- 1 Since 1838, only five States have adopted constitutions, without popn- 
lar ratification, excluding those framed in the South between 1861 and 
1865. These States were Mississippi, 1890; South Carolina, 189%; Dela- 
ware, 1897 ; Louisiana, 1898 ; and Virginia, 1902.
-P-A-G-E-199

must be ratijied at the polls as by the first method. In order 
that all amendments may stand upon their own merits, they 
are submitted separately. Some States are so fearful of fre- 
quent changes that they limit the number of amendments 
that may be proposed at one time, or within a certain num- 
ber of years. In spite of these precautions, many people 
think that too many changes occur in the constitutions, 
and all know that very few of the amendments awaken the 
popular interest and receive the attention that they should. 
163.. The Contents of the State Constitutions. — The sub- 
divisions of our constitutions. are four in number. (1) 
There are the Bills of Rights which state some general prin- 
ciples of liberty and government, specifying the individ- 
ual rights that shall not be disturbed by the state or local 
governments, or by any public official. (2) The principal 
paris of the constitutions are the frames of government, in- 
cluding the sections devoted to the composition and powers 
of the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the 
state government. (3) We have the miscellaneous constitu- 
tional provisions, the chief of which are the articles upon 
suffrage, the method of amendment and general revision of 
the constitution, and upon local government. (4) In addi- 
tion to these constitutional provisions there are other sup- 
plementary provisions on education, corporations, taxation, 
public lands, and public institutions. Most of the para- 
graphs in the articles last mentioned, and many of those 
in other parts of the constitution, do not deal with really 
constitutional laws, or fundamental laws. They are, in truth, 
only important statutes, supplementary to the constitutional 
laws, which are placed in the constitutions in order that 
the people may vote upon them, and that they may not be 
altered by the legislatures. 
The main differences between the older constitutions and 
those of recent date is that the later constitutions contain 
a larger number of these statutes than is the case with the 
earlier constitutions. The charge has consequently been

164. The Increasing Need of Uniformity in State Laws. —: 
Since the States have the power to make such laws as they’ 
please. in relation to the subjects we have considered in. 
previous chapters, it is quite interesting to ‘know whether-.* 
the laws of the various States are very much alike. 
the States have a dozen different kinds of laws regulat 
ing the making and enforcement of contracts, persons ii 
different States cannot do business with one another. Now 
adays we fee] that these laws not only should be, but mus 
be, more or less similar, for no State is willing to depend’ 
upon its own people for all that it needs. We believe that: 
state boundaries ought not to be division lines between radically: 
different systems of law. Interstate trade or - interstate- 
travel is no longer a thing of rare occasion, but an every-: 
day affair, and the need of uniformity in all of the great: * 
principles of state law is becoming constantly greater. . 
In some ‘cases where the national Constitution has left a 
subject to state direction and concerted action was neces- 
sary, conferences have. been called by the governors in order’ 
to agree upon desirable legislation or improved uniform 
methods of administration, The Annapolis conference 
(1786), which led to the constitutional convention in Phila- 
delphia, was of this character. Many anti-trust conferences. 
have been held by central Western States, and some Western’ 
commonwealths have participated in irrigation conferences. 
The most notable gathering of all was held at Washington”

conference called for the purpose of discussing the need of 
concerted action in the preservation of natural ‘resources —*

water, forests, minerals, and lands. One important object 
of the meeting was the creation of an Appalachian forest 
reserve under national control from lands owned or super- 
vised by the different States of the Atlantic border. 
165. Variations in State Laws on Important Subjects are 
quite numerous, and often objectionable. An illustration 
of the disadvantages due to a lack of uniform legislation 
is furnished in connection with corporations. We noticed 
in §141 the very great difficulty in making and enforcing 
adequate corporation laws under our present system. The 
laws which define crimes and provide penalties for criminals 
vary tosome extent. In one State an offense may be merely 
a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment for a short 
time, while, im an adjoining one, it may be considered a 
felony, conviction for which means from ten to twenty 
years of hard labor. Differences of this nature are not only 
unjust, but lead to a greater amount of lawlessness than 
would be the case under uniform laws. 
Divorce laws are very dissimilar in some of the States. 
South Carolina does not permit her courts to grant divorces 
for any reason whatever, and the laws in a few of the other 
States are very strict. In most sections, on the contrary, 
divorces are granted upon slight pretexts, For many years 
the more conservative States were unable properly to en- 
foree their divorce laws, because their citizens, by temporary 
residence where the laws were lax, could easily obtain di- 
vorees. ‘This practice was at one time so common that the 
courts became more lenient everywhere, but it has been 
discontinued, as the United States Supreme Court has de- 
elared such divorces illegal, unless they are granted to bona 
Jide residents of the State and unless the party. from whom 
the divorce is given receives noticé of the action. 
166. The Degree of Uniformity in State Laws ig much

ordinarily in DETAILS, While the GENERAL PRINCIPLES of state 
law are everywhere much the same. As President Woodrow Corporation

Wilson says: “ We feel the conflicts because we suffer under 
their vexations; while we fail to realize and appreciate the 
uniformities, because they are normal, and have come to 
seem matters of course.” ?! 
* All the States have built up their law upon the ancient and com- 
mon foundation of the Common Law of England, the new States bor~ 
rowing their legislation in great part from the old. Nothing could 
afford clearer evidence of this than the freedom with which, in the 
courts of nearly every State in the Union, the decisions of the courts 
of the other States, and even the decisions of the English courts, are 
cited as suggestive or illustrative, sometimes also as authoritative, 
precedent, Everywhere, for instance, the laws of property rest upon 
the same bases of legal principle, and everywhere those Jaws have been 
similarly freed from the burdens and inequalities of the older system 
from which they have been derived. Everywhere thete is the same 
facility of transfer, the same virtual abolition of all the feudal charac- 
teristics of tenure, the same separation between the property interests 
of man and wife, the same general rules as to liens and other claims 
on property, the same principles of tenancy, of disposition by will, of 
interstate inheritance, and of dower, Everywhere, too, contracts, 
common carriage, sales, negotiable paper, partnership, rest upon simi- 
Jar principles of practically universal recognition.” + 
The United States Constitution has aided in the development 
of a uniform system of state law throughout the country. It 
prescribes that “full faith and credit shall be given in each 
State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of 
every other State.” Decisions of courts in one State are 
often cited and followed in another. If a person dies in 
Colorado, owning property in that State and in New York, 
his will, if approved by the Colorado courts, will also be 
accepted by that of New York. Such an action would be 
improbable without this clause of the Constitution, which 
has made uniform laws on many subjects almost indispen- 
sable.

Cuasses OF DuTIES PERFORMED BY THE STATES 
167. Provisions relating to State and Local Government. — 
It is difficult to realize how very wide is the field of activity 
left to the States; that is, to the people of the States, for 
the “State” is not synonymous with state government. 
This may be made easier by considering briefly a. summary 
of five important classes of duties performed by the States: 
(1) the regulation of state and local government, (2) the 
protection of individual rights from government officials, 
(8) the making of ordinary law, (4) the administration 
of justice, (5) all of the numerous administrative duties 
performed by our governments for the benefit of the 
people. 
First of all, the States absolutely control the governments 
that shall carry on the State’s work, subject to the limita- 
tion of the United States Constitution, that the governments 
shall be republican in character. The people of the States 
ean, therefore, in making their state constitutions, create 
such governments, central, county, and city, as they desire, 
- and use such sources of revenue as they please for the sup- 
port of these governments, provided they do not interfere 
with the system of taxes left to the national government 
exclusively. They can place restrictions, if they please, upon 
the powers of the state legislatures, and they can limit or 
extend the powers of the city and county governments, 
making them wholly subject to the legislatures or largely 
independent of them. In practice, the restrictions placed 
upon the legislatures, although numerous, do not greatly 
hamper those bodies, and the local governments, as we have 
seen, are allowed by law and custom to exercise much the 
same functions in all parts of the United States. 
The people of the States also decide who may take part in 
the work of governing by voting, provided that the right of 
citizens to vote is not denied or abridged on account of 
trace, color, or previous condition of servitude. General.

  168, The Protection of Individual Rights from government 
officials is left almost exclusively to the States, for the work 
of the national government does not bring it into close ¢on- 
tact with our daily life except for the postal service. In 
consequence, it is a matter of considerable interest that every 
State in the Union provides in its constitution that the state- 
and local governments shall not deny us certain rights. Among 
these are the right to perfect religious liberty, to speak and 
write without governmental interference, to have our homes 
free from search, except when we are accused of crime; and 
for every accused person to be tried without delay before a 
: jury of his peers and to be exempt from unusual fines or 
punishment. 
169. The Making of Ordinary Law.—The States have 
practically entire charge of making the laws dealing with: 
our personal relations with one another, and the laws under 
which almost all of our business is done. The legal rela- 
tions of husband to wife, of a parent to a child, of an 
employer to.an employee, of a principal to an agent, are 
determined by the States and not by the national govern- 
ment. For example, all our marriage and divorce laws, the 
laws relating to labor, the laws dealing with contracts which 
one person makes with another, are state laws. Our right 
to hold real or personal property, to buy or sell anything, or to 
inherit a bequest is exercised under state laws. 
The States create corporations, giving them the right to 
do business as artificial persons, so that practically all 
manufacturing corporations, transportation companies which 
do business exclusively within one State, insurance compa- 
nies, loan, trust, and banking corporations, are created in 
accordance with the provisions of state laws, and are subject 
to state and not national supervision. 
170. The Administration of Justice. — The enumeration of 
individual rights in the constitutions, and the making of the 
laws just mentioned, necessarily involve some means for pro- 
tecting those individuals whose rights under the constitutions or
-P-A-G-E-206
THE SPHERE OF STATE ACTIVITY 167 
‘laws have been infringed by others. For this purpose a 
system of courts is created to which the injured party may 
apply for a redress of his grievance. The greatest care is 
taken by the States in arranging the procedure of the courts 
and the methods for trying these civil suits, as they are 
called (§106), in order that the innocent and the defenseless 
may not suffer at the hands of the powerful and the un- 
scrupulous. 
But the administration of justice by the States is by no 
means confined to civil suits, for a great part of the work 
of the courts is in connection with criminal cases (§ 107). 
As comparatively few crimes are committed in violation of 
national laws, practically all criminals are tried by state 
courts and punished in state institutions for breaking the 
laws passed by the state legislatures for the protection of 
the life and property of the citizens. 
No case tried in a state court can be appealed to a national, 
court unless it involves national law. As comparatively 
few cases do, the administration of justice in those matters 
that concern us most closely is a phase of state activity. 
171. Administrative Functions performed by the States. —— 
These duties we have been considering could not well be 
neglected by the States, since they were not granted to the 
national government, and since they touch the foundation of 
our business and social life. Many others are performed 
by the state or local governments which are now considered 
essential to our welfare. The magnificent system of public 
education is a phase of state activity, resting upon a state 
school law, which is administered by the localities. The 
state and local boards of health, which enforce quarantine 
jaws, prevent the spread of diseases, and aid the local gov-. 
ernments in their task of providing more perfect sanitary 
arrangements, are doing a work that benefits every one of

us. Public improvements, like state canals or roads, bridges, 
public buildings, and systems of waterworks, whether con- 
structed by the state or local governments, are parts of the 
State’s work. The elaborate arrangements found in every 
State for the care of the poor, the insane, and the blind 
show that the States are doing their duty toward the needy and 
the unfortunate. All of these functions are becoming more 
important year by year, and are typical of the work which 
the States are now undertaking along other lines for the 
public benefit.

THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT 
CHAPTER XIV 
THE BEGINNINGS OF UNION * 
172. The Development of our National Government.— We 
cannot have a national government without a united people to be gov- 
erned, There was in consequence no national government in America 
during the colonial period, because the colonies were separate from 
one another. During the Revolutionary War, a central government 
for the union of the new States became necessary to raise armies, 
obtain money, and look after foreign affairs, but the government was 
not truly national, It was only in 1787, when the present Constitu- 
tion of the United States was proposed by a convention at Philadel~ 
phia, and ratified by conventions in the States, that a national 
government was formed, which has grown more powerful and more 
nseful to the Nation as the people have become more united, 
Temporary Unions Berore 1781 
173. Colonial Unions.—In colonial times, the chief cause of 
union among the colonies was a fear of the Indian tribes. ‘In 1643 the 
four little New England colonies of Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, 
Connecticut, and New Haven—none of which covered as much as 
two thousand square miles of settled territory — organized The New 
England Confederation for mutual defense against the Dutch and the 
Indians. The central government was nothing more than an advisory 
body, composed of two commissioners from each colony. It was ex- 
pressly forbidden to interfere with the government of the colonies, 
and had only power to suggest how much money and how many men 
were needed for intercolonial protection. This Confederation, which 
nominally lasted about forty years, was able to accomplish very little, 
but showed the colonies that by uniting they might render one another 
valuable help in time of need. 
During the wars that the English were obliged to wage with the 
French settlements in Canada and around the Great Lakes, several 
congresses were held to devise plans for attack or defense. The most

important of these was held at Albany in 1754, to make a treaty with 
the Iroquois Indians which would prevent their aiding the French in 
case of another war. Delegates from seven colonies were present, and 
much of the time was spent considering a proposed Albany plan of 
Union suggested by Benjamin Franklin. As finally adopted by the 
Congress, this plan arranged for a president-general, appointed by the 
English King, who was to be commander-in-chief of the colonial army. 
Money was to be raised and expended for defensive purposes by a 
grand council, composed of a number of representatives from the dif- 
ferent colonies proportional to the amount which each paid into the 
common treasury, This plan was universally condemned by the legis- 
latures of the colonies, and was not considered by the English govern- 
ment. The time was not ripe for concerted action ; nothing less than 
@ great national movement could create a widespread demand for 
Union. 
174. Conditions affecting Union in 1760.— The colonies were 
still as separate and distinct as different nations might have been. New 
England had little in common with the Carolinas, and many of the 
Puritan customs and occupations, as well as the general trend of 
thought, were different from those of the South. Provincial narrow- 
ness and prejudice were very pronounced, for the people of one colony 
had not been broadened by contact with the inhabitants of another. 
Yet all the elements of union were there. Practically all the colo- 
nists were Englishmen, the language was everywhere the same, the 
colonial systems of law were invariably built upon the common law of 
England, and, finally, all were of the Protestant faith. Taken in con- 
nection with the nearness of the colonies to each other and consequent 
unity of interests, these conditions made union natural, and, if a com- 
mon danger threatened, union became inevitable. 
275. The Stamp Act Congress (1765).— A spirit of union 
among the colonists was aroused by the adoption of a new British 
colonial policy. In its effort to obtain from its American possessions 
revenue with which to pay the expenses of maintaining an army for 
their protection, the English Ministry, in 1764, asked Parliament to 
pass a law requiring that stamped paper be used for periodicals, deeds, 
wills, and other legal documents. This was done in 1765, and agents 
‘were appointed to sell the stamped paper, but the colonists protested, 
because they thought that no internal tax could be levied upon them 
except by their assemblies (§ 52). The agents were compelled to re- 
sign, and feeling reached such a height that when Massachusetts sug- 
gested a congress to express their views, nine of the colonies sent 
delegates who met in New York in October, 1765, and drew up.a

by their representatives, that they could not be represented in Parlia-

nies had been growing more and more discontented with the methods 
used by Great Britain in taxing and governing them, In fact, several . 
of the colonies had established (1772~1778) Committees of correspond- 
ence, which kept alive the feeling of hostility to the mother country, 
and formed a powerful, though partially organized, opposition, In 1774, 
the crisis was hastened by the suspension of the charter of Massachu- 
setts and the establishment of a military government inthe colony. So 
great was the feeling at this time that when Massachusetts again called 
for a congress to protest against the acts of Parliament, all but one of 
the colonies, fearful that their own governments might be changed as 
that of Massachusetts had been, managed to send delegates to Phila- 
delphia, although the governors did everything in their power to pre- 
vent the selection of representatives.

ecutive and legislative in one! It organized an army and prepared a 
navy, regulated commerce, sent representatives to France and other 
countries, issued paper money, advined the colonies to form independ- 
ent state governments, declared the united calenies free and independ- 
ent of Great Britain, and proposed.to the States the Articles of 
Confederation, by which the union of the States was legalized. At no 
time, however, did it possess any (egg? authority for the powers of 
sovereignty which it actually used. 
Tue ConFEDERATION 
178, Formation of the Confederation. — The formation of a con- 
federation included three steps: (1) the drafting of articles of union 
by a committee, (2) the adoption of the Articles in Congress, (3) the 
ratification of the Articles by the States. In June, 1776, when Con- 
gress appointed a committee to draw up a Declaration of Independence, 
a second committee of one from each State was selected to write out 
articles of union, which should define more exactly the powers of Con- 
gress and the relation of the States to one another. The Articles of 
Confederation reported by this committee on July 12, 1776, were de- 
bated in Congress during 1776 and 1777. Finally, in November of the 
latter year, they were adopted by that body with many changes, and 
referred to the state legislatures, for the Articles were not to become 
binding upon any State until ratified by all. Most of the States gave 
their consent without great delay, but- Maryland refused to sign the 
Articles until her neighbor Virginia gave up her claims to that vast- 
region in the West which Virginia had considered a part of her domain, 
For this reason, it took from 1776 to 1781 to form the first constitu- 
tional union of the States. ~ 
179, The States under the Confederation. — The objects of the 
Confederation are stated in the third article. « The said States heréby 
severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for 
their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual 
and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other against 
all force offered to or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on 
account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense what- 
ever.’”? In doing this, however, each State claimed to retain * its 
sovereignty, fre: , and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, 
and right which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to 
the United States in Congress assembled.” 
Nevertheless, there were several prohibitions placed upon the differ- 
ent state governments in order to prevent them from interfering. with 
1In this Congress each State had but one vote.

THE BEGINNINGS OF UNION 175 
the work of Congress. They were not allowed to enter into negotia- 
tions, nor to make treaties or alliances, with one another or with 
foreign powers, without the consent of Congress. No army or navy 
could be equipped by. a State, nor could any declare war, except in 
case of actual invasion. Duties were not to be levied by the States if 
they interfered with the enforcement of any commercial treaty made 
by C ongrass 
One of the chief advantages of the new union was the establishment 
of an interstate citizenship. The citizens of every State were ‘entitled 
to all, thé privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several 
States,’ and were allowed perfect freedom to come and go from one 
to another, doing business in which one they pleased. Full faith and 
credit was given in every State to the records and judicial proceedings 
of the courts and magistrates of every other, and, if a criminal fled 
from one State to another, he was to be given up to the officials of the 
State in which his trial was to take place. 
180, The United States Government under the Confedera- 
tion. — The only central government consisted of a Congress and such 
officers and committees as it might appoint. Each State was allowed 
to send to Congress from two to seven delegates, who were paid out of 
the state treasury and might be recalled at will; but no State, however 
large it might be, had more than one vote. Each year the Congress 
selected a president to preside over its meetings, and a committee of 
one from each State which looked after the affairs of the United States 
when the Congress was notin session. In itsexecutive work, Congress 
was also assisted by the three departments of Foreign Affairs, War, 
and Finance, 
In theory, Congress controlled all matters of common interest, such 
as making war or treaties, creating an army and navy, regulating the 
value of coin, arranging treaties with the Indians, and settling inter- 
state disputes regarding land claims, but scarcely any important law 
could be passed without the consent_of nima-Sigtes. To pay its ex- 
penses, it had authority to borrow money or emit bills of credit, but 
most of the revenue was to be obtained directly from the States, each 
contributing the amount which Congress thought just. 
181. The Defects of the Confederation. — In practice, Congress 
was left at the mercy of the States. Jt could gain no revenue from the 
issuance of paper, as it could not redeem its outstanding notes. The 
requisitions made by Congress for money were paid grudgingly or 
ignored entirely, and, as Congress had no means of forcing the States 
to pay their shares, it was compelled to borrow money for current ex- 
penses, Before long even this resource failed it, for it was unable to Alliances

pay the interest on what it already owed, and its credit had become 
gradually poorer, until no one was willing to lend it money. 
In executing the laws which it passed, Congress encountered the 
same difficulties as in collecting revenue. It had been given power to 
make laws not for the people, but for the States. As there was no 
separate federal executive, it would have been difficult to enforce the 
laws of any kind under the most favorable circumstances, but, as 
Congress acted solely on the state governments, it was utterly unable 
to coerce them if they cared to ignore its requests or itslawsa, For 
this. reason, although Congress had the right to pass so many laws, 
there was danger that it might become absolutely helpless. 
The four most important specific defects were: (1) the inability to 
provide revenue for expenses, (2) the lack of an executive or the 
power to enforce laws, (3) the failure to regulate commerce (§188), 
and (4) the impossibility of remedying these defects, because no amend- 
ments could be passed except by a unanimous vote of the States. The 
fundamental defect grew out of the very nature of the Confederation, 
since each State was practically sovereign. . 
182, The Significance of the Confederation.—In order to 
obtain the revenue without which it could not even keep up an ap- 
pearance of activity, Congress proposed amendments asking the States 
for permission to lay duties upon goods imported from abroad. The 
first request was made in 1781 for a tariff of five per cent upon imports; 
but, as the Articles could be amended only by unanimous vote of the 
state legislatures, and as Rhode Island would not consent to granting 
this power to Congress, the amendment failed of ratification. A 
second attempt to gain revenue from a similar source failed because 
only twelve States favored the proposal. Thus Congress, without 
money to pay its debts, without power to enforce its demands, became 
Jess and less useful, and at length not enough of its members attended 
its sessions to do business. Meanwhile each State was regulating its 
own commerce with the other States and with foreign powers in any 
way that its own interests dictated, and a species of commercial war- 
are was being waged among some of the States. The only remedy 
for this condition of affairs was to have free trade within the States 
and uniform regulations for foreign commerce. It was therefore evi- 
dent that more power must be given to Congress, or that a new central 
government must be established. 
Jealousy of any government which exercised its rule beyond the 
limits of any one State led the States toassert their separate sovereignty 
and independence. In every way the Union was sacrificed to the 
States, because of their deep-seated dread of a government that was not

focal. Yet when we consider the situation—the intense spirit of 
localism, the narrowness that marked many of the political actions of 
the people, the fear of oppression through union which was constantly 
present during colonial times, and the inexperience in forming a legal 
union of the states, we cease to wonder that the Confederation was so 
imperfect. Indeed, if we compare the Congress of the Confederation 
with the Second Continental Congress, considering that the latter was 
exercising war powers without any direct legal authority — powers 
that in time of peace might disappear entirely — we can realize, per- 
haps, that the Confederation was a more perfect union than the ne 
existing in 1776.

  CHAPTER XV 
GENESIS OF THE CONSTITUTION 
183. The Annapolis Conference.— The proposal for a re 
vision of the Articles of Confederation came in an unusual 
and quite informal way. Maryland and Virginie, had been 
discussing whether they should appoint commissioners to 
consider the navigation of the Potomac River, the southern 
bank of which formed the boundary between the two States, 
and to arrange a uniform system of tolls and duties. A few 
far-sighted leaders in the Virginia legislature thought it 
would be a good idea to invite the other States to appoint 
commissioners who should meet with these at Annapolis, 
and talk over the subject of interstate and foreign commerce. 
This was accordingly done, but only five of the States were 
represented at-the Annapolis conference, which met in Sep- 
tember, 1786, although nine had selected commissioners. 
Most of these men realized that only by increasing the 
power of Congress over commerce could the existing commer- 
cial difficulties be settled. They consequently adopted the 
suggestion made by Alexander Hamilton, that the Congress 
then in session be asked to call a convention to meet in Phila- 
. Adelphia the next year. After revising the Articles of Con- 
federation, the convention was to submit its suggestions to 
Congress and the state legislatures.

sent. We must bear in mind that this convention was 
called solely for the purpose of revising the Articles of Con-. 
JSederation, and not with any idea of making a new national 
constitution. Fortunately, the States had elected some of 
their ablest men as delegates, and these men did not hesitate 
to proceed at once to form a Constitution of an entirely dif- 
ferent type, because they believed the Articles of Confedera- 
tion could never be amended so that they would be satisfac- 
tory. They thought that the Articles were built upon a wrong - 
Soundation—state sovereignty — and they therefore decided 
without delay to frame a constitution that should rest not 
upon the States alone, but upon individual citizens. The 
foresight, wisdom, and courage of “the Fathers,” as the 
members of the convention are often called, in taking this 
important step, has not been questioned by any succeeding 
generation. 
The first regular session was held on May 25,1787, with delegates The 
from nine States present. All of the others, except Rhode Island, were convention 
algo represented most of the four months during which the convention organized. 
held its meetings. Popular confidence was assured from the start, be- 
cause the delegates included such men as George Washington, Ben- Fiske, 
jamin Franklin, James Madison, Roger Sherman, Oliver Ellsworth, Critical 
John Dickinson, Robert Morris, John Rutledge, Charles Pinckney, area 
and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney. Nevertheless, it was deemed wise - 
to make the sessions secret, in order that the people might not be preju- 
diced because of any differences of opinion in the convention, and 
that they might not be asked to judge of the revision until it was com- 
pleted. Behind closed doors, the convention began its work by choos- 
ing George Washington chairman, and by agreeing that each State 
should have one vote, as in Congress.

   of the lower house to be chosen by the people, and those of the upper 
house to be chosen by the lower from candidates nominated by the” 
state legislatures. This Congress was to have ‘the legislative rights 
vested in Congress by the Confederation, and, moreover, to legislite in - 
all cases to which the separate States are incompetent, or in which the 
harmony of the United States may be interrupted by the exercise of 
individual legislation.’” ‘ 
The new scheme provided for an executive department, which it 
will be remembered the Confederation did not have, but the plan. aid 
not state whether there should be only one executive like our Presi- 
dent, or a council like the English ministry. Finally, there was to be 
a national judiciary to decide cases that came up under the laws madé 
by Congress. This Constitution was to go into operation when 
adopted by conventions chosen especially for that purpose, . 
186. The New Jersey Plan — The convention went into com- 
mittee of the whole and discussed the Virginia plan for several weeks, 
the majority being heartily in favor of its resolutions. But several of. 
the delegates from small States considered it too radical, as they feared. 
to grant so much power to a government that might be controlled by- 
the large States. ‘Fhese men drew up revised Articles of Confedera~ 
tion, which are usually called the “* New Jersey plan,” because offered 
to the convention by William Patterson of that State. This plan 
proposed en enlargement of the powers of the old Congress by giving 
that body the right to levy duties and other taxes, and provided for an 
executive and a system of national courts, After a rather brief de- 
bate, the committee of the whole adopted the Virginia plan with some . 
modifications, and reported to the convention. : 
187. The Connecticut Compromise. — Although a Congress 
of two houses seemed preferable to a single chamber, the 
convention was divided on the question of how it should be 
composed. The large States naturally wanted the number of. 
members in both houses to depend upon the population of the 
States represented, but the small States insisted that one or 
both should be like the Confederate Congress, in which each 
State had one vote. Over this question of representation 
there was a long and bitter debate which was finally settled 
by adopting a compromise proposed by the Connecticut dele- 
gates. By this first, and perhaps greatest, of the compromises. 
for which the United States has been famous, each State was .

to be represented in the lower house according to its popula- 
tion, and the Senate was to be composed of two senators 
. from each State, each of whom, unlike the delegates to the 
Confederate Congress, had a vote of his own. To pacify 
the large States, the House of Representatives was to have 
the exclusive right to introduce measures for the raising of 
revenue. 
188, The Three-fifths Compromise.— The convention -had 
already decided that when direct taxes were levied, each 
State should contribute according to its population, so that 
an enumeration of the people was now necessary for the as- 
sessment of direct taxes as well as for representation in the 
House of Representatives. We might imagine that it would 
be a very simple matter to count the number of people ina 
State, but the convention had trouble with this question be- 
cause of the slaves who were very much more numerous in 
the South than in the North. Were they to be counted the 
same as whites? Of course, the Southern delegates did not 
wish the negroes counted when direct taxes were paid, but 
they did wish them to be enumerated when representatives 
were appointed. The North wanted the opposite in both 
cases, so that a compromise was adopted, by which jive ne- 
groes were counted as equal to three whites when reckoning the 
population for either direct-tazatian_or representation. 
- 189, The Compromise over Navigation Acts and the Slave 
Trade.— The last compromise, as well as the second, deal 
with the question of slavery. The extreme Southern States 
demanded the right to import slaves without restrictions, 
but practically all of the others were opposed to the slave 
trade. In the North commerce was the chief industry, and 
the New Englanders insisted that navigation acts should be 
passed by Congress in the same manner as ordinary bills. 
The South, on the contrary, believed that her agricultural 
interests would be in danger, unless a two-thirds vote was 
required for all laws relating to commerce. ese sectional

190. Completing the Work of the Convention. — For the Presi- 
dency, most of the members favored a single person, because the 
committees of the Confederation had been so unsatisfactory ; but.in 
regard to election, reéligibility, and length of term, the convention 
did not know its own mind. They first voted in favor of a term of 
seven years without reélection, then changed to six, went back to seven, 
and, during the closing weeks of the sessions, decided upon four, with 
reéligibility. ‘The election of the President presented a much more 
difficult problem. They were afraid to make him subordinate to Con- 
gress by leaving the choice to that body, did not dare.intrust election 
to the people, and were unwilling to leave it to the state legislatures, 
After agreeing to two of these plans at different times, they finally hit 
upon indirect election through competent electors chosen by the 
States. 
It must not be thought that all of the time of the convention was 
‘devoted to settling disputes. Week after week the work progressed’ , 
slowly but surely, points bejng settled quickly if little difference of 
opinion existed, but being delayed often by debate and honest diff 
ences of opinion. The Virginia plan was used practically as the foun-. 
dation upon which the new Constitution was erected, and on September    
       
17, 1787, the document was completed-and signed by delegates from. . 
twelve States. 
Madison closes his ‘‘ Debates,” which are our chief source of infor- 
mation regarding the sessions of the convention, with this very sug-. 
gestive account. ‘Whilst the last members were signing, Doctor . 
Franklin, looking towards the President’s chgir, at the. back of which 
arising sun happened to be painted, observed to a few members near’ 
him, that painters had found it cifficult to distinguish in their arta 
rising from a setting sun, ‘I have,’ said he, ‘often and often, in the” ‘ 
course of the session, and the vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to. ~ 
its issue, looked at that behind the President, without being able totell’ 
whether it was rising or setting; but now, at length, I have the hap- 
piness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun.’”” :

RatiFIicaTion AND Provisions 
191. Feeling of the People toward a New Constitution. — 
Before the Constitution could go into effect, if was to be 
ratified by conventions called in the different States for 
that purpose. If accepted by nine of these States, it went 
into effect “between the States so ratifying the same.” 
When we consider, however, that the Philadelphia Con- 
vention possessed no legal authority to frame a national 
Constitution, that the mass of the people did not fully appre- 
ciate the evils of the Confederation, and that even those who 
did, being much attached to their state governments, were 
unwilling to surrender any of the State’s authority to Con- 
gress, we can see that the outlook for ratification was by 
no means bright. 
No sooner had the convention adjourned than the members 
who had returned to their respective States, and other ad- 
vocates of the proposed government, began to organize their. 
followers so as to secure the necessary ratification. Though 
few in numbers at first, they included most of the able and 
progressive political leaders, and, by skillful management 
and forceful argument,’ won over to the side of the Consti- 
tution the doubters, and many who at first opposed the 
change. These men were known as the Federalists, while 
those who favored a government like that of the Confedera- 
tion, in which the States practically controlled Congress, 
were called the Anti-Federalists. The latter had ‘quite an 
advantage, because the people as a whole were prejudiced in 
favor of state supremacy, and did not relish a change that 
strengthened the national government at the expense of the 
States. 
1The discussions over the Constitution produced.a Jarge number of able 
papers from the advocates or opponents of the new plan. Among these, a 
, Series discussing the whole situation and the provisions of the Constitution 
in detail has become famous among political documents under the title of 
The Federalist. The authors were Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, 
and John Jay, and their commentary stands to-day as the ablest exposi- 
tion of the Constitution in existence. Prejudices

   186 AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
The small 192. The First Nine States. — The good work that the convention : 
States and _ had done in pacifying the small States by adopting the Connecticut com-. 
r ‘ennsyi- promise, was shown in the readiness with which the small States ac- 
cepted the Constitution. In Delaware, after a very brief session, it 
was ratified unanimously on December 6, 1787, while in New Jersey. 
ote and Georgia came unanimous votes but little later. Pennsylvania 
Period, was the first of the large States to fall into line, her convention, on 
306-317. December 17, deciding in favor of the new government by a vote of 
46 to 23. 
New The New England States decided a little less promptly. Connecti- 
England. cut gave its approval without great delay, but the New Hampshire’ 
Convention adjourned without action, and the stormy debates in the 
McLaugh- Massachusetts Convention lasted a month. Nowhere was the attach- 
jin, Confed- ment to local government so strong_as in the Bay State, and the oppo- 
a0 208 sition made a strong plea on thé ground that the new Constitution 
. created a consolidated government which would be a menace to state 
rights and individual liberty, The Massachusetts Convention was 
finally persuaded to ratify, on condition that the majority ask Con- 
gress to submit to the States a humber of amendments. New Hamp- 
shire later gave its consent by a close vote, but not until both Mary- 
land and South Carolina had ratified. This was the last of the nine 
States necessary for the establishment of the Constitution. FP

tinued to debate the question for several weeks, during which the 
masterly arguments of Alexander Hamilton converted enough of the 
“ Anti-Federalists to give to the Constitution a majority of three. 
North Carolina.and Rhode Island did not ratify at this time, the 
former entering the Union in November, 1789, and the latter in 
May, 1790. 
Prepara- Meanwhile Congress was making its preparations to inaugurate the 
tions for new government. Almost exactly a year after the members of the 
the new Philadelphia Convention had sighed the Constitution, the Congress of * government. 
the Confederation named the first Wednesday in January, 1789, as 
the day for selecting presidential electors, and the first Wednesday in 
March for the first meeting of Congress under the Constitution.
-P-A-G-E-227
‘GENESIS OF THE CONSTITUTION 187 
194, The Preamble shows that the new government was 
to be radically different from the old, for the Union was no 
longer a “firm league of frieridship” formed by the States, 
but a United States which represented a united people. 
As the preamble expresses it, “we THE PEOPLE of the 
United States, in order to form a more perfect union, 
establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for 
the common defense, promote the general welfare, and 
secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our pos- 
_terity, do ordain and establish this constitution for the 
United States of America.” 
195. Grant of Power to the United States Government. — 
The work intrusted by the people of the United States to 
their new central government was carefully stated in the 
Constitution. It was in a form of a grant of powers made 
to Congress, which that body might exercise by making 
Jaws which the President should enforce and the courts 
interpret. These powers were so much more numerous 
than those formerly permitted to the Congress that the 
new Congress cannot rightly be considered the successor of 
that of the Confederation. The one was a feeble dwarf, 
the other a powerful giant. Under the Constitution, taxes 
of almost every conceivable kind might be imposed, not 
upon the States, but’ upon individuals, so that a failure of 
revenue was not again probable. Foreign and interstate 
affairs, including the regulation and control of commerce, 
were left to the national government. Congress had the 
right to declare war, to raise an army and construct a-navy, 
unhampered by any requirements that the States should be 
consulted before these powers could be used. Many other 
" powers were conferred, among them the right to make laws 
for the public territory, and to admit new States. Congress 
might make any laws that were “necessary and proper” for 
carrying into execution these powers which had been ex- 
pressly enumerated in the Constitution, and all other powers 
granted to any department or officer of the new government.

196. The Departments of the New Government. — The 
machinery of government under the Constitution was as 
much more elaborate than that of the Confederation as the 
new powers were more complete than the old. The law- 
making branch was still called Congress, but there were 
Ashley, 4m. now two houses. In one of these, the Senate, each State 
Fed. State, 
§§ 128-132. had two members ; in the other, the House of Representatives, 
the number depended on the State’s population, although 
every State had at least one. The senators were to be 
chosen by the state legislatures for six years, one third re- 
tiring at atime, but the representatives were to be elected 
by popular vote every second year, The President, who 
had all of the executive power, was to be chosen for a term 
of four years by electors equal in number to the represent- 
atives and senators from the States, and all United States 
- judges were to be selected by the President and confirmed by 
the Senate, holding office thereafter during good behavior.

tures. If these proposed amendments were ratified by three 
fourths of the state legislatures, or by conventions elected in

parts of the Constitution. Strangely enough, all of the fif- 
teen amendments that have been adopted were proposed by 
Congress and ratified by the state legislatures. 
One clause of the Constitution — that giving the States 
equal suffrage in the Senate — cannot be amended except 
with the consent of every State.

CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES SINCE 1787 
198. Introduction. —It is neither possible nor desirable 
that our Constitution or national government should remain 
unchanged during a century which has brought us a great 
expansion of territory, population, and national resources, 
and little less than a revolution in the means of transporta- 
tion, methods of doing business, and in the national feeling 
of the people. As a matter of fact, during the debates of 
the Philadelphia Convention, one of the delegates went so 
far as to assert boldly that no one expected the Constitution 
they were then framing would be in use a century later. 
Yet so well did “the Fathers” do their work that to-day 
the Constitution of 1787, with only fifteen amendments, is 
still the foundation of our federal Union and of our national 
government. We must not suppose, however, that the Con- 
stitution is really the same now asthen. Its form is almost 
identical with that of a hundred years ago, but its spirit has 
been modified greatly. In 1790 the péople were much more 
attached to their state governments than to that of the 
Nation, and, in consequence, the national government was 
not allowed to do many things that we consider perfectly. 
proper, although nominally Congress had almost as much 
power then as now. This simply means that many of the 
chief changes in the Constitution since 1787 have not been 
made by constitutional amendments added to that document, 
but by a more Hveral construction of the powers granted to 
the national government in the original Constitution. How 
the powers of the national government have been enlarged,

by a free interpretation of the Constitution and by usage, 
shall be explained briefly after examining the fifteen regular 
amendments. 
Tue AMENDMENTS 
199. The National Bill of Rights. — As we noticed in the last 
chapter, some of the States ratified the Constitution on condition that 
certain amendments be proposed which would protect the States and 
individuals from any possible invasion of their rights by the national 
government. The first Congress therefore passed, by the necessary 
two-thirds vote of both houses, a number of amendments which, taken 
together, formed a Bill of Rights. Ten of these were ratified by three 
fourths of the state legislatures, and proclaimed by the Secretary of 
State, Thomas Jefferson, to be a part of the Constitution, December 15, 
1791. . 
The provisions of the first eight amendments, which are concerned 
with specific personal rights, may be classified under two heads: 
(1) those that prohibit Congress from restricting individual rights ; 
(2) those which protect individuals brought before or on ¢rial in 
United States courts: The first two amendments make it impossible 
for Congress to establish a state religion, or deny to any one religious 
liberty, freedom of speech and of the press, the right to petition the 
government, and to beararms. The third and fourth prevent Congress 
from quartering soldiers in private homes without the consent of the 
owner, and from allowing national officers to search homes except by 
warrants that describe the property to be seized. The last four of 
the eight give accused persons the right to a speedy jury trial with 
every opportunity to prove their innocence. We should especially 
notice that no one of the eight attempts to prohibit the States from 
doing these things, for they are restrictions upon the national govern- 
ment only. : 
200. The Ninth, Tenth, and Eleventh Amendments. — Lest 
individual citizens should not be fully protected by these detailed pro- 
visions, the ninth amendment goes on to state that ‘the enumeration 
in the Constitution of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or 
disparage others retained by the people.’? To prevent encroachments 
upon the rights of the States as well as upon those of the citizens, the 
tenth amendment declares that ‘the powers not delegated to the 
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, 
are reserved to the States respectively or to the people.” Thus the 
chief objection to the Constitution ; namely, that it was a menace to

  the liberties of the citizens and the rights of the States, was so-far re 
moved that the Anti-Federalists, who had sought to prevent its adop- 
tion, ceased to exist as a political party. 
The States were, however, very jealous of their rights, and when 
the Supreme Court decided in 1792 that a State might be sued in a United 
States court by a citizen of another State or by a foreigner, a resolu- 
tion for an eleventh amendment was proposed, which denied to. the 
national courts jurisdiction of such cases. This was carried through 
Congress without difficulty, and was ratified by three fourths of the 
States before 1798. 
201. The Twelfth Amendment. — It is quite remarkable that only 
one amendment has been necessary to correct defects in the organiza- 
tion or methods of the United States government. According to the 
original Constitution, the presidential electors were to name two-can- 
didates for President without specifying which should be President and 
which Vice President. Then, in case of a tie vote, the House of Rep- 
resentatives was to select the President, the delegation from each State 
haying one vote. Election in the House became necessary in the third 
presidential election (1800), Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr having 
seventy-three votes each in the electoral college. Because of party 
strife, the House did not decide in favor of Jefferson until sixteen 
days before the inauguration. To avoid a repetition of this difficulty, 
a twelfth amendment was adopted in 1804, which made it necessary 
for the electors to name the office for which eath candidate was selected, 
but, as formerly, each State was allowed to decide in what way its 
electors might be chosen. Whenever the electors failed to choose a 
President, the House of Representatives was to select that official from 
the three who had the largest number of votes, and in case no Vice 
President was chosen, the Senate was to select one from the two 
whose electoral votes were greatest. 
202, Later Amendments, — For more than sixty years after the 
adoption of the Twelfth Amendment, there were no changes in the 
written Constitution of the United States. Yet silently but surely, 
through a liberal interpretation of the Constitution and the use of 
powers about which no one had thought at first, the national govern- 
ment gained in power and in prestige. This shows that the Constitu- 
tion was undergoing a change, for the government of the United States 
derives its-authority from the people.through the Constitution. . 
‘We can see how differently the people felt toward the Constitution in 
1789 and in 1865 by noticing that the Jirst eleven amendments restyléted 
the power of the Untrep. SraTes GOVERNMENT in certain respects, 
while the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments placed.

certain limitations upon the Srates, One chief cause of the great war 
that was fought upon American soil during the years from 1861 to 1865 
was the institution of slavery — an institution which was under the con- 
trol of the state governments, except in the territories, and which had 
_ been abolished in the North by the States long before 1861, When, 
therefore, the Southern Confederacy of slave States was beaten in the 
great struggle, the first thought of the North was to give the slaves 
freedom, the second to give them the rights of citizenship, and the 
third to grant them the right to vote. In doing these things, the 
Nation, through the national Constitution, told the States that thence- 
forth they must not countenance slavery, nor deny to any one the right 
of citizenship or suffrage because of his color. 
203. The Thirteenth Amendment. — The first of the war amend- 
ments, the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution, was passed by 
two thirds of both houses of Congress early in. 1865, and was ratified 
by the necessary number of States within less thanayear. It provided 
that ‘‘neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punish- 
ment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall 
exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdic- 
tion.” 
204, The Fourteenth Amendment. — A little later many members 
of Congress felt that some of the former slaye States were trying to re- 
establish slavery by the passage of apprenticeship laws which restricted 
the freedom of the negroes. To avoid the dangers that might arise 
from such a possibility, an amendment was proposed making the blacks 
citizens,' and providing that, if a State did not allow negro men to 
vote, the State’s representation in the lower house of Congress should 
be correspondingly reduced. As the States which had belonged to the 
Southern Confederacy were obliged to accept this amendment before 
they were allowed to select senators and representatives, this amend- 
« ment was ratified by the constitutional three fourths of the States and 
declared to be a part of the Constitution, July 28, 1868. 
The restrictions placed upon the States by the. first section of 
Amendment XIV are very important and are of two kinds the one 
negative, because no State is allowed to abridge the privileges and im- 
munities of citizens of the United States; the other positive, inasmuch 
_88 no State may ‘deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, with- 
out due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction 
the equal protection of the laws.’? In other words, the amendment 
not only prevents the States from interfering with the rights which

any citizen possesses by virtue of his United States citizenship (§ 228), 
but it says to the States, ‘* If you take away from a citizen without due 
process of law any rights which he has because of his state citizenship, 
he will be protected in national courts.” It is impossible to imagine 
such a restriction of state powers at the time the Constitution was 
adopted, and this shows clearly how much more united the people of 
the Nation were in 1868 than in 1787. 
205, The Fifteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitu-- 
tion in 1870, five years after Lee had surrendered to Grant at Appo- 
mattox. Its real and avowed purpose was to grant the ballot to the 
freedmen, for it provided that ‘the right of citizens of the United 
States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or 
by any State, on account of race, color, or previous -condition of servi- 
tude.” A large number of people believed that the only way to pro- 
tect the freedmen properly at the time the amendment was adopted 
was to grant them the privilege of voting, but many now feel that it was 
a mistake to place the ballot permanently in the hands of a large igno- 
rant class. In consequence, Congress has not interfered even when. 
some Southern States have discriminated directly against the negroes 
and the national courts have, as much as possible, left the States free 
to make such suffrage laws as they desire.

206. What the Unwritten Constitution is Like.—As the 
written Constitution is brief and does not go into detail, it 
is supplemented in a great many respects by statutes and 
by customs which deal with important principles of govern- 
ment. These determine how extensive the powers conferred 
by the Constitution really are, and in what ways the work 
of the national government shall be carried on. “It must 
be perfectly evident that if Congress is permitted “to 
~3gulate commerce with foreign nations and among the 
averal States,” to cite but a single case, it makes a very 
reat difference whether Congress may control foreign: 
commerce by prohibiting all trade with-other nations and 
may control all corporations which sell their goods in more 
than one State, or whether the only regulations it can make 
are formal and mechanical ‘rules which simply measure the

volume of trade without affecting it in any way. For this 
reason the interpretation of a written Constitution is fre- 
quently of much greater importance than the original docu- 
ment seemed to be, for it may be altered greatly to meet 
the needs of a later period in the history of the Nation. 
Often the real vitality of a provision of our written Consti- 
tution depends almost entirely on some custom which is not 
necessarily recognized as a part of our written law. The 
importance of our “unwritten constitution” cannot be 
estimated easily, for the UNWRITTEN CoNnsTITUTION includes .

207. The Most Important Features of the Unwritten Con- 
stitution may be stated as follows: (1) The whole body of 
law and custom supplementing the Constitution has greatly 
broadened that.instrument and expanded the powers exercised 
under it. How the national government has been strength- 
éned hy a liberal interpretation. of the Constitution can be 
seen in the succeeding sections. (2) New powers have been 
assumed and exercised by our national government for 
which no authority can be found in the written Constiti- 
tion except by a distortion of some provision of that doem- 
ment. Since the United States is now recognizéd as a 
Nation in‘ which the people of the Nation are unquestion- 
ably sovereign, the central government now does many 
things by virtue of its position, as the governing body of 
a Nation, unless these powers are forbidden by the Consti- 
tution or interfere with the work of the States. (83) The 
national government has become an essentially democratic 
government with its chief officials elected by the men of the 
Nation, “and its principal departments directly responsive 
to the popular will. The history of the change from the . 
government by classes which existed in 1789 to the govern- 
ment by the people of to-day, is the history of the exten- 
sion of the elective franchise from landowners then to men

now. This change has, in fuct, been accomplished almost solely 
by alterations in the srats laws regarding surFRaceE, as the 
Constitution allows the States to decide who shall vote even 
for national officials, The unwritten Constitution deter- 
mines the real nature of our federal system of government, 
defining the spheres of activity of the States and the Nation, 
and showing the working relations of the two sets of gov- 
ernments ($§ 212-216, 219-221). (4) Secession from the 
Union is not possible, although the subject is not mentioned 
in the Constitution, and the right to secede was formerly 
claimed by many of the States located in different parts of 
the country. 
208. Enlargement of the Original Powers of Congress.— 
The Constitution gives Congress the right to make any laws 
that are “necessary and proper for carrying into execution” 
the powers explicitly granted to that body. This elastic 
clause has enabled Congress to make, upon subjects not 
directly mentioned in the Constitution, laws which have 
added greatly to the authority of the national government. 
For example, within less than two years after the Constitu- 
tion went into operation, a bill was passed creating a United 
States bank, which not only issued a national currency, but 
aided the government in doing its work. Fifteen years 
later, Congress, having been given authority to regulate 
foreign commerce, laid an embargo upon all commerce with 
France and England, thus prohibiting instead of regulating 
that branch of business. The power to levy duties on im- 
ports has been made the basis of a tariff which is designed 
to aid industry rather than to produce revenue. Vast sums 
have been spent in improving rivers and harbors, in laying 
out roads, and in giving free mail delivery and other postal 
facilities that the Constitution does not mention. Public 
lands have been given lavishly to corporations for trans- 
continental railways, and to the States for the improve- 
ment of the schools. As those are but instances of an 
extension of authority that is becoming greater with national Relations of 
States and 
Nation.

expansion, the development of the Constitution in this di- 
rection may be appreciated. 
209. New Powers of Congress.—It may be difficult. to 
draw a line between many of the powers. exercised under 
the “elastic clause” } and some for which the original Con- 
stitution makes no provision whatever, but certain acts per- 
formed by the national government are no doubt opposed to 
the wishes of the framers of the Constitution, or are outside 
the sphere of powers originally granted to the government 
of the Nation. Some of these deal with functions which a 
century ago would have been considered exclusively the do- 
main of the States. The valuable work done by the De- 
partment of Agriculture? is of this class. Many necessary 
regulations for the industrial corporations which. do business 
in several States must be justified because of the national 
need for such regulation, and not because Congress may con- 
trol interstate commerce. The issuance of paper money 
during the Civil War was a war measure, but the retention 
and reissuance of those paper notes or greenbacks in time of 
peace was unquestionably opposed to the expressed and im- 
plied views of the men who composed the Constitutional 
Convention of 1787. During the Reconstruction period, also, 
Congress interfered with States which had claimed to be 
sovereign by compelling them to perform certain unpleasant 
duties before they might again take part in the work of the : 
national government or resume their exercise of their nor- 
mal work as States. This interference was justified legally 
because the “United States shall guarantee to every State 
in this Union a republican form of. government,’?’® but it 
was really an assertion, under abnormal conditions, to be 
sure, of the right possessed by Congress to maintain the sover- 
eignty of the Nation, 
In connection with external affairs there has been the 
acceptance of the same wise principle that our Constitution

must be a constitution for to-day and not a narrow one for 
yesterday. Congress has been allowed to annex territory by 
joint resolution of the two houses. It has made for part of 
our possessions, the Philippine Islands, for example (§ 268), 
laws which have placed Congress above the Constitution 
within that territory, because the sovereignty of the Nation 
demanded that the territory be ruled in such a way as would 
serve best the interests of the entire people. 
210, Changes in the Presidency. The members of the 
Constitutional Convention intended to have the President 
chosen for a term of four years by discreet men called 
“electors,” who were to use their own judgmént in selecting 
the chief executive. We all know, however, that only the 
first two Presidents were chosen in that way, and that for a 
long time presidential electors have been partisans who, 
having been elected by popular vote in the different States, 
must vote for candidates nominated by their respective 
party conventions. Nothing in the Constitution would pre- 
vent a President from holding office for several successive 
terms, as President Diaz of Mexico has done, but custom, 
in the form of the “third term tradition,” has fixed eight 
years as the maximum period for any President. 
In carrying out his wishes, every President is aided by 
executive officers, nine of whom form an advisory Cabinet, 
a body not mentioned in the Constitution. The relations 
of the Cabinet as a whole to the President, and of each 
member as a head of his department, are determined entirely 
by the unwritten Constitution. So far as the written Con- 
stitution is concerned, our Cabinet might have become the 
real governing body of the Nation, as England’s cabinet is.) . 
The power of the President has been greatly increased by 
the unwritten Constitution. He was originally allowed to 
appoint all of the important national officials with the con- 
sent of the Senate, but nothing was said about his power of 
removal. Except for twenty years (1867-1886), he has not

been obliged to consult the Senate in removing an official, 
and has thus been able to make all national executive officers 
responsible to himself, greatly to his own advantage. 
By virtue of their right to make ‘treaties, several Presi- 
dents, beginning with Jefferson in 1803, have acquired vast 
territories, although the Constitution is silent on this sub- 
ject. In protecting United States mails and United States 
- property, our Presidents have likewise increased their power 
at home by the use of the military forces. 
211. The National Courts and the Unwritten Constitu- 
tion. —In one sense the most important parts of our unwrit- 
ten Constitution have been developed because at the very 
beginning of our history as a Nation the Supreme Court of 
the United States established its right to decide when the 
other departments of the government had exceeded their 
powers. The Constitution gives to the national courts 
jurisdiction of all cases “arising under this Constitution, 
the laws of the United States and treaties made, or which 
‘shall be made, under their authority.” Many conserva- 
tive people believed that the courts could not affect the 
Constitution in doing this, but Chief-Justice Marshall 
proved that the Supreme Court could not decide cases aris- 
ing under the Constitution without’ nterpreting the Consti- 
tution itself. By doing this he established a principle of 
the unwritten Constitution which was largely responsible 
for the great development of national authority noted in the 
preceding sections; namely, that the people of the Nation, — 
through the Supreme Court, were the final interpreters of 
what powers the national government might exercise. The 
Court, therefore, could decide the all-important question of 
our history — what is the relation of the States to the Na- 
tion and to the national government —a relationship that is 
discussed in the next chapter.

THE NATION AND THE STATES 
212. The Interdependence of the National and State Gov- 
ernments. — By the adoption of the national Constitution in 
1787, the people of the United States created a federal system 
of government. This Constitution recognizes the existence 
of two spheres of government, the one national, including all 
powers which can be properly exercised only by a single 
government for the whole people, the other, state, including 
all other powers of government. Under existing arrange- 
ments, the national government and the system of state 
governments are dependent upon each other, for each does 
half of the work of governing the country, but neither can 
become subordinate to the other, for both are controlled 
directly by the people of the entire Union. ‘To perform the 
task assigned it, each is complete within itself for certain pur- 
poses, but incomplete without the other for the great purpose a 
subserves—the government of the American people. 
GENERAL DistRIBuTION or PowERs 
213. The Classes of Governmental Powers. — We find that 
the Constitution of the United States and its amendments 
define quite clearly the duties of the national government, 
and suggest the duties left in charge of the States. In that 
instrument, the attempt is made to grant the government of 
the United States all powers that the States could not satis- . 
factorily exercise, because united action was necessary.” 
From the nature of the case, these powers belonging to the 
United States government were considered delegated, and were 
204 -
-P-A-G-E-245
1 {THE NATION AND THE STATES 205 
therefore enumerated. Those left to the States were to 
include all others, frequently called residuary powers. 
It is possible to distinguish jive classes of governmental 
powers : — . 
I. Those granted exclusively to the national government 
by the Constitution of the United States. 
Il. Those reserved exclusively to the States. 
III. Those powers which may be exercised by either the 
national government or the States, called concurrent. 
IV. Powers denied to the national government by the 
Constitution. 
VY. Powers denied to the States by the Constitution. 
214. The. Sphere of the National Government includes both 
exclusive and concurrent powers, but these are always dele- 
gated. Yet delegated powers may be either expressed or 
implied powers. No one nowadays denies that the United 
States government has the right to supplement the powers 
expressly stated in the Constitution, by such means as are 
reasonable and wise to carry out these powers. That is, 
we are, in practice, broad constructionists of the phrase 
that Congress has the power “to make all laws which shall 
be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the 
foregoing powers (Constitution, Art. I, §8, els. 1-17), and 
all other powers vested by this Constitution in the govern- 
ment of the United States, or in any department or officer 
thereof.” 
Nevertheless, it is generally admitted that the United 
States government does not have exclusive powers, unless 
(1) the Constitution expressly states that the power granted 
to the United States government is exclusive, or unless (2) 
a power which is given to it is, at the same time, denied to 
the States, or unless, (3) from the very nature of the power, 
it could not be exercised by both the Nation and the 
States.

are excluded, either by express prohibition or by implica- Five classes

tion, from the greater part of national affairs, they control 
all other subjects of government except those denied to all 
governments, and consequently reserved to the people. 
Lest there should be doubt in any one’s mind on that point, 
the Tenth Amendment says, “The powers not delegated to 
the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it 
to the States, are reserved to the States respectively or to 
the people.” In this amendment we have given the means 
of determining whether a power is rightfully exercised by a 
State. This is done by finding out what does not belong to 
the State. Ifa power is given to the central government 
alone, or if it is prohibited to the States by the. Constitu- 
tion, it cannot be used; all other powers belong to the States,” 
and can be exercised by the state governments unless the 
state constitutions forbid. 
As we noticed in Chapter XIII, this fleld in which the State is 
supreme is one of great importance, not only from the variety of the 
subjects included, but from their personal relation to the individual. 
Practically all matters belonging to the criminal and to the private law 
are regulated by the States, including laws regarding property, and the 
business and personal relations of one individual to another. 
The States have complete charge of all local governments, of edu-" 
cation, of the elective franchise, of most corporations, police duties; 
marriage and divorce, the poor, the delinquent classes, and public 
health. Legislation on these subjects, and the administration of the 
laws made upon them, may be left by the States to the state govern- 
ment or the local governments ; but at present the control of the States 
over all of them is exclusive and absolute. In addition, the States ex- 
ercise the concurrent powers mentioned in the next section. 
216. Powers concurrently exercised by the United States or 
the State Governments,-— The general power of taxation may be 
exercised. by either the central or the state governments. Yet there 
are limitations placed upon either one or the other in regard to certain 
Kinds of taxes ; e.g. the United States government cannot levy direct 
taxes except in proportion to the population, neither can it lay a duty 
on exports from the States at all, nor tax state property. The States 
cannot tax external commerce except with the consent of Congress and 
for the national treasury, nor can they tax national banks or national 
property. Otherwise, either government may tax what it. pleases or
-P-A-G-E-247
THE NATION AND THE STATES 207 
borrow money, and it is only by custom that the taxes do not over- 
lap. 
Several classes of concurrent powers are those which are left to the 
regulation of the national government, but in which the States may 
legislate in case the United States fails to take any action. The sub- 
ject of bankruptcies offers many examples of this state of affairs, for 
Congress has not seen fit to maintain a national law during most of our 
history, so the States have in the interim passed laws suited to their 
own needs ; but these become invalid as soon as the central govern- 
ment acts. The case of the militia issomewhat similar. Many details 
of the elections of répresentatives and senators may be controlled by 
Congress, but in default of national laws the States do as they please. 
In the concurrent jurisdiction of the United States and state courts, 
we have an instance similar to these last classes. Many suits may be 
brought in either state or national courts at the option of the plaintiff, 
although the final decision in these suits always rests with courts of 
the Nation. . 
217, Prohibitions on the United States Government. — The 
most significant prohibitions placed by the Constitution upon 
the national government exclusively are for the protection 
of the individual. Those given in the first eight amendments 
we have already considered (§ 199). In addition, the na- 
tional government may not grant titles of nobility, pass bills 
of attainder, which deprive persons of life __ot_property by 
act of legislature, enact é@ post facto laws, which consider’ 
as-crimes offenses that were ‘not criminal at the time they 
were committed, nor may it permit slavery. Congress is not 
allowed to define treason, for a definition of that all-impor- 
tant word is placed in the Constitution itself! The privi- 
lege of the writ of habeas aonpus, which gives an accused. 
person the right of immediate trial, may not be suspended 
except in case of great danger. Individuals are protected 
Srom the arbitrary expenditure of money by the provision that 
1The Constitution provides (Art. III, § 3) that ‘Treason against the

their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted

no money shall be drawn from the national treasury unless 
in accordance with appropriations made by law. They are 
secured against military oppression by the restriction that no 
appropriation shall be made for the army for a period of 
more than two years. They are protected in general by the 
system of checks and balances in the Constitution.’ Accord- 
ing to Amendment V, no one may be “deprived of life, lib- 
erty, or property without due process of law, nor shall private 
property be taken for public use without just compensa- 
tion.” . 
There are other prohibitions or limitations less closely 
related to individual liberty, but intended rather to guard 
the States against discriminating legislation. No export duty 
can be levied by Congress, all duties on imports and inter- 
nal taxes are to be uniform throughout the United States, 
and no commercial preference is to be given one State over 
another. When a direct tax is levied, it must be in propor- 
tion to the population as given in the last census. 
218. The Prohibition on the States. — Prohibitions have 
been placed upon the States by the national Constitution for 
one of two reasons: (1) to prevent the States from inter- 
fering with the work of the national government; (2) to 
protect American citizens from arbitrary action on the part 
of the state governments. In order to protect the govern- 
ment of the United States, the States are forbidden to make 
treaties or alliances with other States or foreign nations, to 
have an army or navy in time of peace, to lay imports, 
coin money, emit bills of credit, make anything but gold or 
silver a tender in payment of debts, and to pass laws 
impairing the obligation of contracts. 
Among the prohibitions or limitations for the protection 
of individuals are the following: No State shall grant a 
title of nobility, pass bills of attainder, or ex post facto laws. 
No state shall maintain any but a republican form of gov- 
ernment, or countenance involuntary servitude, except for 
1See Ashley, American Federal State, § 123.

THE NATION AND THE STATES _ 209 
the punishment of crime, nor deny the elective franchise to 
any citizen of the United States because of race, color, or 
previous condition of servitude. Finally, no State shall 
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United 
States or deprive any person of life, liberty, or property 
without due process of law.

219. The Relation of the State and National Constitutions. Supple- 
— When considering the constitutions of the States (§ 160), Ohta. 
we noticed that the constitution of any State must be 
changed if it conflicts with the national Constitution. The Bryce, Am. 
reason for this is really very simple: the Constitution of Common- 
the United States is justas much a part of the fundamental apr. ed., 
law of every state, as is the constitution of that State. Amy 233-238. 
state constitution is intended to supplement that of the 
Nation within that State, since the United States Constité- 
tion is intentionally silent regarding the greater part of the 
State’s government and work. The law of any State, and, of 
the States taken as a whole, consequently includes five things: 
(1) the Constitution of the United States; (2) laws passed Constitu- - 
by Congress in accordance with the Constitution; (8) treat- or aa 
ies made by the national government; (4) the constitution “ ©” ” 
of the State; (5) the laws made by the state legislature. 
That the Constitution of the United States is a real part 
of the law of every State may be shown by the constitu- 
tional requirement that all members of the state legisla- 
ture, and all executive and judicial officers of the State, shall 
be bound by oath or affirmation to support the national 
Constitution. 
Under ordinary circumstances, these laws and constitu- Conflict of

gives way to the laws of the Nation, the treaties and the 
United States Constitution; for these three are “the supreme 
law of the land, and the judges of every State shall be 
bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of the 
State to the contrary, notwithstanding.” 
220. The Work performed by the States in National Hlec- 
tions. — The close relations existing between the Nation - 
and States is emphasized by the use made of state laws and 
governments in national elections. Congressmen and other 
United States officials chosen by. popular vote are elected 
by voters whose qualifications are prescribed by state and 
not by national law. The only restriction upon the States 
is that contained in the Fifgeen#@@mendment. , 
In the selection of presidential electors, the States are 
allowed to decide whether they shall be chosen by the legis- 
latures or by vote of the people. The choice of United 
States senators belongs exclusively to the state legislatures, 
although Congress may regulate the details of senatorial 
elections, except for the place whet a legislature meets. 
The arrangement of the districts from which members of 
the House of Representatives are chosen, is made by the 
state legislatures subject to national law. It might seem 
as though in all of these respects the national government 
is left at the merey of the ‘state governments, However 
true that may be in theory, in practice the States have 
never sought to prevent the organization of the national 
government. Their failure to make such an attempt is 
sufficient proof that they believe the central government 
would be less injured than themselves, by their refusal to 
take part in national elections. Moreover, it would be ab- 
surd to create, for the choice of a few national officials, 
local districts which had no connection whatever. r with the 
States and their subdivisions. 
221. The Unity of Our Federal System is further em- 
phasized in the working relations of the national and state 
governments. Each has its own duties, which are different,

carried into effect by officials of the States. Every person

them by the people of the whole Union. If, by any possi- 
bility, both try to force him to obey laws which relate to the 
same subject, but which are incompatible, he must deter- 
mine, first of all, whether the national government has 
- authority to make the law it wishes him to obey, and, if 
it has this right, he must obey it without question, If it 
exceeded its authority in passing the law, he must obey the 
’ state officials, Whether the obedience is rendered to officials 
belonging to the state government or to the central govern- 
ment in reality, it is rendered to the people of the United 
States, who are represented by both sets of these officials. 
In other words, a citizen’s allegiance is not divided, for it is 
due to the people of the whole Nation, who are sovereign, and 
to them alone. 
AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP 
222, The Dual Character of American Citizenship. — Be- Citizenship | 
cause of the arrangement for the government of our country of the State 
by two authorities, state and national, it is customary to Ynitea 
speak of the dual character of American citizenship. Every States. 
citizen is said to be a citizen of the United States and a 
citizen of a State. Those rights of citizenship which are Willoughby, 
protected by the national government, because they are Sinem 
directly: connected with its work, a citizen is said to possess 941-949, 
by virtue of his being a citizen of the United States. The 
rights he has under the government of the State belongs to 
him because he is a citizen of the State. With each form of 
citizenship are inseparably linked the obligations of obedi- :

ization. 
Rights pro-

ence to the authority that protects him in the enjoyment of 
his rights, 
The definition of a citizen is given in the Fourteenth Amendment: 
«¢ All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to 
the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the 
State wherein they reside.’? As Indians on reservations are not really 
‘subject to the jurisdiction ” of the United States, they are not citizens. 
All others born in this country or of American citizens abroad, are 
citizens. 
Naturalization is either individual or collective, Collective natural- 
ization occurs when a large number of persons are given the rights of 
citizenship by treaty, constitutional amendment, or congressional Jaw. 
‘The process of individual naturalization is described in § 288. 
223. The Rights of United States Citizenship.— Among 
the privileges and immunities enjoyed by a citizen under 
the national government are the right to transact business 
with that government, “to seek its protection, to share its 
offices, to engage in administering its functions. He has 
the right of free access to its seaports, through which all 
operations of foreign commerce are conducted, to the sub- 
treasuries, land offices, and courts of justice in the several 
States... . 
“ Another privilege of a citizen of the United States is to 
demand the care and protection of the federal government 
over his liberty, life, and property when on the high seas 
or within the jurisdiction of another government. ... The 
right to peaceably assemble and petition for redress of griev~ 
ances, the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, are rights 
of the citizen guaranteed by the federal Constitution. The 
right to use the navigable waters of the United States, how- 
ever they may penetrate the territory of the several States, 
all rights secured to our citizens by treaties with foreign 
nations, are dependent upon citizenship of the United States, 
and not citizenship of a State... . A citizen of the United 
_ States can, of his own volition, become a citizen of any State 
of the Union by a bona jide residence therein, with the same
-P-A-G-E-253
THE NATION AND THE STATES +213 
rights as other citizens of the State. To these may be added 
the rights secured by the thirteenth and fifteenth articles 
of amendments,”! and by the clauses of the fourteenth. 
224, State Citizenship. While no State can create citizen- 
ship by its laws, the larger part of the rights of citizens are 
left to the supervision of the state governments, just as the 
sphere of state activity is larger than that of the central 
government, It would be difficult to enumerate all of these 
rights, but among the most important are protection by the 
state government in matters over which it has control; right 
to life, liberty, and property, except as restrained for the 
general good; right to make contracts; to sue and be sued; 
to inherit, purchase, lease, hold, and dispose of real or per- 
sonal property; and exemption from unjust taxation or un- 
usual fines or penalties. 
The franchise is not a right of citizenship. It is a politi- 
eal privilege conferred by a State upon such of its members 
as it deems fit to exercise such a privilege. Voters and citi- 
zens are not the same. The latter are much more numerous, 
but a State may confer the right of suffrage upon aliens, if 
it wishes. It may also give an alien the rights of state citi- 
zenship, though it cannot make him a citizen.

225, Introduction.— Having noticed the historical de- The three 
velopment of the national government and the relations ex- seniivisions 
isting between the Nation and the States (Chapters XIV-— 
XVII), we shall consider first the powers and duties exer- 
cised by the national government (Chapters X VITI-XXII), 
and complete our study by examining the organization, 
methods, and activities of the different departments of the 
central government (Chapters XXIII-XXVII). 
.The work performed through the national government Activities 
may be treated under five heads: (1) foreign relations, ot ne al 
which are the most distinctive and, in a sense, the most es- govern- 
sential of the tasks performed by a central government; ment. 
(2) national finance, including taxation, expenditure, and 
debts ; (3) regulations affecting internal commerce, especially 
money and interstate commerce; (4) territories, colonies, 
and public lands; and (5) miscellaneous activities, including 
postal service and agricultural activities.

and subjected to humiliations, as we were a century ago,

judgment and opinion becomes of great value. The Senate. 
néver hesitates to reject the whole or part of a treaty, or to 
amendany section. Ifthechange is relatively unimportant, 
the Department of State can usually obtain the consent. of 
the foreign government to it; otherwise, negotiations are 
broken off altogether, or are begun again as for an entirely 
new treaty. . 
Although treaties are made without consulting the House 
of Representatives, they are as ‘much a part of the supreme 
Jaw of the United States as statutes passed by Congress. 
A treaty supersedes a previously existing statute with 
which itis in conflict, although it may in turn be abrogated - 
by a later law. Ifa treaty deals at all with questions of 
finance, the injustice of not consulting the House is evident, 
and the more popular chamber may refuse to grant appro- 
priations to carry such a treaty into effect. 
230. Other Foreign Affairs.-—_ Many Presidents,‘ through 
the exercise of the right to make treaties, have won fame 
for themselves, and given opportunity for national develop- 
ment, by acquiring new territory. This expansion has 
added greatly to the power of the national government, not 
only through the prestige gained for the President by acts 
of such far-reaching importance, but on account of the in- 
creased use of executive and congressional authority made 
necessary in governing the new territories (§ 268). 
The President has the right to send or receive ambas- 
sadors, and to dismiss them. The reception of a minister 
from one of the great powers is an affair of great formality, 
whereas the reception of a representative from a new nation 
is a matter of equal importance, inasmuch as the reception 
of a minister is equivalent to the recognition of the inde- 
pendence of the State which sends him. The President has, 
therefore, the right to recognize the international standing of 
any former colony, and to decide which of the two govern- 
ments of a country in insurrection shall be considered the 
government de facto. He may ask to have a minister with-

drawn, if he has become persona non grata to the adminis- 
tration for any good and sufficient reason. At the beginning 
of hostilities with a foreign nation, unless the minister 
asks for his papers, his passports will be sent to him, this 
act being virtually a declaration of war. 
The messages of several Presidents have been the means 
of announcing new foreign policies, which have been reaf- 
firmed by subsequent administrations. President Monroe’s 
regular message of December, 1823, and President Cleve- 
land’s special message dealing with the Venezuela contro- 
versy, have clearly defined the attitude of the United States 
toward the nations of the Old World in their dealings 
with those of the New. It is well to bear in mind that the 
Monroe Doctrine, which is recognized and respected almost 
as a part of international Jaw, is nothing more than the 
policy of the executive department developed for three gen- 
erations.

American people. The treaty of 1783 may be cited as. a 
good example of the success of straightforward negotiation. 
Except at special ceremonies for which court dress is re- 
quired of every one, our ministers are accustomed to wear 
“the simple dress of an American citizen.” 
The salary paid an ambassador is $17,500, the average 
salary given a minister being about $10,000. As the United 
States does not own buildings in the foreign capitals, and 
social demands make numerous inroads upon a minister's 
purse, only.men of independent means can afford to accept 
diplomatic positions. 
—- Forrtan CoMMERCE 
232, General. — Aside from the inability of the Confeder- 
ation to obtain revenue, the principal cause of its failure was 
its lack of power to regulate commerce between the States 
and with foreign countries, Indeed, the pressing need of 
national control of commerce led to the calling of the Consti- 
tutional Convention of 1787 (§ 183), for the annoying laws 
made by the States regarding interstate commerce had 
caused much bitterness in some sections, and the varying 
state tariffs made it impossible to trade with Europe to.ad- 
vantage. All of this was changed when the Constitution 
gave Congress the right “to regulate commerce with foreign 
nations... and among the several States,” and permitted 
the President and Senate to make commercial treaties. 
Regulations for foreign commerce may be said to be of 
two kinds: (1) those that aim to help commerce in general, 
and (2) those that seek to restrict certain lines of trade. 
Every nation wishes to do as much business as possible with 
other countries, provided it has the best of the bargain. 
This is thought to be the case if it sells abroad more than it . 
buys,’ and consequently many governments make a special

effort to increase their exports, while almost all have tariffs 
which limit the importation of foreign productions by rates 
that are often quite high. According to the Constitution of 
the United States, neither Congress nor the States may lay 
any duty upon exports, but Congress may tax imports if the 
rates are uniform throughout the United States and no pref- 
erence is given to one part above another. 
233. The Promotion of our Foreign Commerce. —As our 
success in trading with other nations is often taken as an 
index of our prosperity at home and our standing as a nation, 
Congress has passed many Jaws with the purpose of benefit- 
ing our trade abroad. Through the efforts of our consuls, 
and under the direction of the Bureau of Manufactures in 
the Department of Commerce (§ 431), information is being 
collected and distributed constantly which will aid in open- 
ing new foreign markets. The promotion of foreign com- 
merce is.accomplished chiefly, however, through such indirect 
means as commercial treaties, ship canals, and harbor improve- 
ments. 
A nation cannot trade with any other nation it pleases, 
but must first arrange with foreign governments for inter- 
national commerce through ordinary commercial treaties, 
some of which contain a provision known as the most fa- 
vored nation clause, or by reciprocity treaties (§ 236). If a 
treaty contains a most favored notion clause, and either power 
making this treaty grants special privileges to any third 
nation, the other power secures for itself the same privileges 
without a special treaty to that effect. During the years 
following the Revolutionary War, we had treaties with 
France, Prussia, and Holland only, so were commercially at 
a disadvantage. Among later triumphs, that of Commodore 
Perry in opening the ports of Japan in 1854. is notable, 
as in the case of the United States, it is due to the fact that we exchange 
our exports not only for imports but for transportation services, money 
expended by travelers, or investments abroad. See Gide, Political Econ.

  222 AMERICAN GOVERNMENT 
The foreign commerce of the United States amounts to more than 
three billions of dollars a year, the average excess of exports over im- 
ports being about five hundred million a year. About sixty per cent 
of the exports are agricultural and meat products,! about one half 
of which are sold to a single country, Great Britain. Manufactures of 
iron and steel exported amount to about the same as the exports of 
grain and flour, and the market is expanding constantly. Our trade 
with Latin America is increasing as we send our Southern neighbors 
each year about three hundred millions, chiefly of manufactures, and 
buy from them large quantities of sugar, coffee, rubber, and other semi- 
tropical products. Nevertheless, South America, the Philippines, and 
eastern Asia still trade with Europe rather than with the United 
States. 
234, Special Improvements and Laws.— The interoceanic 
canal at the southern extremity of North America is the 
greatest of the undertakings of the United States govern- 
ment for the purpose of developing commerce. After a half

century of effort, arrangements were completed in 1903 
which permitted the construction of the canal under Ameri- 
can auspices. Since that time, good progress has been made 
with the work under the direction of the War Department, 
and the canal will be open for commerce in a few years. 
Every year vast sums are spent in river and harbor ti 
provements by deepening channels, building breakwaters, 
maintaining lighthouses, patrolling the coasts, and using 
other means to make navigation profitable as well as safe. 
1 Our exports of raw cotton for the year ending June 30, 1906, were 
$401,005,921, of live stock or meat products $251,376,410, and of grain and 
tlonr $166, 161,160.

Rivers that are used for foreign commerce have been made 
fit for commercial purposes at vast expense One of the 
most satisfactory of these improvements is located at the 
mouths of the Mississippi River, where, by the simple de- 
vice of narrowing the channels, the mud brought down by 
the river is carried far enough out to sea to prevent its ob- 
structing the existing channels, 
Many governments grant subsidies or bounties to exporters forsome 
Kinds of agricultural or manufactured products shipped abroad. For 
example, Germany gives a bounty one third of a cent a pound upon all 
beet sugar exported. The United States has never used this artificial 
means of stimulating trade. 
At the beginning of our history under the Constitution, Congress 
passed several navigation acts. These were intended to aid ship-build- 
ers and commerce. They provided that no American could pur- 
chase ships abroad, neither could any American ship be owned in 
part by a foreigner. Foreign vessels were not allowed to compete in 
the coasting trade. They have been modified recently so that Ameri- 
cans may purchase ships abroad, Bills have also been proposed for 
subsidizing American ships, but the only ship subsidies ever granted 
by the United States were to two lines many years ago, and they were 
temporary. At the present time less than ten per cent of our foreign 
commerce is carried in American vessels, a fact which is objectionable 
to our national pride, 
235, The Consular Service.—- We have representatives in 
all important foreign cities who look after American com- 
mercial interests, endeavoring to promote our foreign com- 
merce,. There are three important classes of these consuls. 
First, there are the consuls general, who are assigned to the 
largest cities, and have general supervision of the consuls 
near them, besides special charge of their own districts. 
The second class includes the ordinary consuls, who devote 
all of their time to the duties of their positions, and ‘the 
third is made up of residents in small cities, who look after 
American interests while continuing their regular business. - 
The duties of consuls are varied and exacting. They are 
obliged to report to the Department of State, giving infor- Gage, L. J.,

mation concerning the amount of foreign commerce within 
their districts, including the character of the imports and 
the destination of the exports. They look after Ameriean 
merchants abroad who may need their services, take charge 
of invoices of goods shipped to the United States, aid travel- 
ers, and send special reports on subjects which any Ameri- 
can citizen wishes to investigate. Among semibarbarous 
peoples, cases affecting citizens of the United States are 
tried in consular courts, because of the imperfect adminis- 
tration of justice in those of the country. . 
During most of our history we were aecustomed to change 
all consuls and consuls general with the incoming of an ad- 
ministration in Washington. This system of political ap- 
pointment, of course, injured the service. The best of men 
cannot do satisfactory work for the first year or two in a 
position where the language and conditions are entirely un- 
known. When the tenure is brief, because a consulship is 
siven solely as a reward for partisan favors, the result is 
lisastrous. The reform of the worst evils of the consular 
system has been accomplished by granting larger pay, by 
training men for the service, by making appointments for 
fitness, and promotions for proved ability. 
236. Tariff Restrictions. —The right to impose duties upon 
imports was conferred upon Congress for the purpose of ob- 
taining revenue, but, especially since the Civil War, it has 
been used quite as much to benefit industry within the 
United States as to gain money for carrying on the work of 
the government. In other words, our tariff now is, and for 
a long time has been, distinctively “protective.”* The custom 
1 The effect of this “protection ” has been to stimulate manufacturing 
to such a wonderful degree that in 1900 the value of our manufactured 
products was seven times as great as in 1860, although our population had 
but little more than doubled during the same period. The restraint upon 
foreign commerce exercised by the tariff and other causes is seen when we 
compare our imports with our exports, the former having been but seventy- 
two per cent of the latter during the year ending June 30, 1906, leaving 
a “balance of trade” in our favor of nearly $ 500,000,000 in a total com- 
mere of three billions.

rates are high upon imported goods which will be sold in 
this-country in competition with American products, while’ 
such articles as tea and coffee, which are not raised in the 
United States, come in duty free. 
The policy of a protective tariff has been opposed by a 
great many Americans who believe that our prosperity would 
have been even greater than it has been if we had made use 
of a tarif{for revenue only, which would allow much keener 
competition with foreign manufacturers. 
The present tariff, known as the Payne tariff (1909), has 
very high protective rates in the form of a double tariff. 
There is a maximum and a minimum rate for each article im- 
ported, the minimum rates forming the regular tariff, and the 
maximum rates being enforced against all nations that do not 
give us as favorable terms as they give any other country. 
Under the Dingley tariff of 1897, it was possible for the govern- 
ment to make reciprocity treaties by which the President and Senate 
(with the consent of Congress) might lower the regular duties levied 
on imports from a country in return for reductions made in her tariff 
schedules for the benefit of our exports to her citizens. In addition, 
if any country paid a bounty upon articles which we imported from 
her, the Dingley tariff permitted the President to increase our duties 
by an amount equal to the bounty. These additional retaliatory du- 
ties were used seldom, whereas a great number of reciprocity treaties 
were negotiated by the Department of State, some of which were 
accepted by the Senate. 
Nationa Derense 
237, General.-—_One of the most serious of all national 
problems is that of defense against other powers. Continen- 
tal Europe has been forced, by the nearness of its great 
countries to one another, into maintaining large standing | 
armies, but England has been able, because of her insular 
position, to depend chiefly on her navy. The United States, 
fortunate in having no powerful neighbors, has given little

Popular 
feeling. if attacked, have been emphasized many times in the last 
half century. Even with the recent development of a peace 
spirit and the establishment of the Hague Tribunal to pre- 
vent armed conflicts between nations, only the most care- 
less statesmen neglect the suggestion, “in time of peace, 
prepare for war.” 
To Congress has been intrusted the right to declare war, 
to raise an army and create a navy, and to maintain the 
militia. War is not ordinarily carried on between civilized 
nations without a formal declaration from one or the other 
that “a state of war exists” between them. Our greatest 
wars, those of the Revolution and of Secession, have not re- 
quired such a statement, because at the opening of each con- 
flict one of the parties to the struggle had no international 
standing. In the minor conflicts, the declaration of war 
has always been made by the United States. . 
The President is commander-in-chief of the army and navy, 
but has never taken personal command of the military forces 
in time of war. 
238. The American Army.— Public sentiment has com- 
pelled Congress to make our army as small as possible, since 
we haveto-day thesame dreadof military despotism that made 
our forefathers insert in the Constitution the clause which 
denied to Congress the power to vote money for an army for 
alonger period than two years, This feeling showed itselfin 
the law which was in force until 1898, that the regular army 
should not contain more than 25,000 enlisted men. In order 
to preserve order in our new colonies, an additional force was 
permitted by the law of Feb. 2, 1901, which placed the maxi- © 
mum at 100,000 enlisted men, and the minimum at 57,000.*

FOREIGN RELATIONS 227 
In time of war the regular force is supplemented by volun- 
teers who enlist usually for a term of three years or the 
war. During the Civil War, the enlistments numbered 
2,859,132, from a loyal population of little more than 
twenty millions, 
The present arrangement of the cavalry and infantry provides that 
every regiment shall contain three squadrons or battalions, each of 
which comprises four troops or companies. General oversight of the 
organization, equipment, and management of these forces is given to 
the General Staff, composed of army officers detailed for that work by 
the President, ‘This Staff aids the President as commander-in-chief in 
the practical control of ail military affairs, the chief of staff occupying 
much the same position as the former lieutenant general of the army. 
The need of technical training of officers led to the establishment, in 
1802, of the West Point Military Academy. Each congressional dis- 
trict or territory is permitted to send one cadet, these being named by 
the representatives when a vacancy occurs; two are appointed by the 
senators from every State, and forty are selected by the President from 
the country at large. After a four years’ course, graduates of the 
academy are granted commissions as second lieutenants in the regular 
army. Non-commissioned officers are also given instruction in schools 
established at the army posts, or in special schools at Fort Leaven- 
worth and Fort Riley ; still more advanced training being given at the 
War College at Washington. 
239, The Militia.—This branch of the military service 
has always been considered a most valuable one, as it theo- 
retically includes all able-bodied men between the ages of 
eighteen and forty-five, a total of over 10,000,000. Only 1 
per cent of these, however, are regularly enrolled and under 
discipline, forming the actual militia known as the national 
guard of the different States. These are in no sense like 
the reserves of European countries, for those reserves are 
composed of trained soldiers who are kept on the reserve 
list for years after they have served the two or three years 
required of them in the regular army. The militiamen 
“may be called upon by the President to suppress insurrec- 
tions and repel invasions, being subject to the same rules 
as the regular soldiers, except that they may be kept in Organiza- 
tion and 
manage- 
ment of

service only nine months in the year and may not be called 
upon to do duty outside of the United States. 
‘The general rules for the militia are passed by Congress, and provide 
for the method of organization, number of officers, method of election, 
and other details. Each State takes charge of all subjects not covered 
by national law. During the Civil War, President Lincoln called 
upon the States to furnish militiamen three times, asking for 475,000 
men in all. 
240. Naval Defense. — Because of our geographical situa- 
tion and our lack of powerful neighbors, naturally dependence 
is placed on a navy rather than upon an army. The long 
coast line with fine harbors giving entrance to our largest 
cities; our insular possessions in the West Indies; our 
interests at Panama on the borders of the sea of great future 
importance, the Caribbean; our colonies in mid-Pacifie and 
at the gateway of the far East, —~ all require naval and coast 
defense of a superior order. If naviés are desirable at all, 
no other country, save England, requires so great a navy as 
the United States of America. 
In these days when wars can be fought in one third the 
time a battleship can be constructed, there seems to be no 
alternative but the continued construction of huge costly fight- 
ing machines which constant improvements make obsolete 
within a few years. Fleets of battleships, armored cruisers, 
and less protected, but faster, cruisers must be supplemented 
by heavily armored coast defense vessels, by marvelously 
swift torpedo boats and torpedo-boat destroyers, by sub- . 
marines and other modern warships. The new American 
navy has been in existence less than thirty years, but it 
is second only to that of Great Britain in fighting strength, 
excelling foreign navies especially in the superiority of the 
American seaman and-gunner. 
1 The construction of an interoceanic canal. (§ 234) has been undertaken 
almost as much for the interest of naval protection as for the sake of 
commerce. The long trip of the Oregon in 1898 around Cape Horn did 
Much to crystallize sentiment in favor of a canal, whose usefulness at that 
time would bave been very great.

war vessels, including battleships. Im 1845 a naval academy was 
founded at Annapolis, Maryland, for the training of officers. As with Long, J. D., 
the military cadets, the midshipmen are appointed by the representa- in Outlook, 
tives, senators, or the President, the latter being allowed to name 73 (1908), 
fifteen from the country at large. The course includes four years at . 
the academy and two years of active service at sea. Training ships 
are also maintained at various places, and a Naval War College gives 
instruction at Washington. 
241. Coast Defense.— In theory, at least, our preparation Land and 
’ for war has been undertaken with a view to avoiding future waren Pro- 
conflicts. This has made it especially necessary to defend our 
coast, because of the great value of the property that might 
be destroyed by war vessels. At all important seaports, Hill, G. G., 
some forms of coast defense are provided. The most impor- in oa 
tant of these are the coust defense vessels, usually heavily (1907), 
armored monitors or floating batteries, and the land batteries, 554-564. 
composed of large mortars and very powerful guns, often 
mounted on disappearing carriages. The channels are well 
guarded by torpedoes or submarine mines, controlled by elec- 
tricity from the nearest fort or battery. Although many 
harbors are totally undefended, or so inadequately that a 
fleet could reduce the defenses without difficulty, there is 
little danger that, with our modern equipment, any foe 
could approach within striking distance of our great cities 
without probability of almost total destruction.

which opens the way to many abuses. 
The pension policy of the United States has passed through two pe- 
riods of changes. Before 1890, only those who had been actually dis- 
abled in service, or who had been left destitute by the death in war of 
the wage earner of the family, received pensions. Since 1890, any sol- 
dier who suffered the loss of even a finger in battle, or has since become 
unable to provide for himself, can be placed on the pension list. By the 
law of 1907 pensions of $12 or more are given to all old soldiers over 
sixty-two years of age, increasing to $20 at seventy-five years. In 1882 
there were but 285,697 persons receiving $54,296,281. In 1907, the 
number had risen to 967,371, and the expenditures to $188,030,894.22.

CHAPTER XIX 
NATIONAL FINANCE 
Narionan Taxes 
243, The National Tax System.— The financial powers 
conferred upon Congress by the Constitution are very ex- 
tensive. In order that the national government may meet 
its expenses, Congress has the right “to lay and collect 
taxes, duties, imposts, and excises,” provided that “all 
duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout 
the United States,” and “to borrow money on the credit 
of the United States.’ Under the Confederation, Con- 
gress had been dependent on the States for its revenue, but 
since the adoption of the Constitution, Congress has been 
independent of the States in financial as in other matters, 
and the powers granted by the Constitution have enabled 
our national government to accomplish the tasks which the 
central authority of every nation must assume. 
A casual examination of national expenditures shows us 
that in times of peace much more than one half of the 
money paid out by the United States government is for 
the army and navy, or for pensions and interest on the 
public debt. This proportion is, of course, greatly in- 
creased in time of war. It is therefore necessary that the 
national tax system be capable of considerable expansion 
during crises, although part of the revenue required for war 
expenses must be obtained through loans. 
The financial needs of the government have been met in 
different ways since the adoption of the Constitution. We 
may distinguish three periods in the history of national tax-

ation.’ The first of these was brief, lasting from -1789.to 
1802. Various forms of customs, duties, and internal reve- 
nue were tried, in addition to direct taxes on land, houses, 
and slaves. The second period, from 1802 to 1861, was 
marked by an almost exclusive dependence upon duties, 
except during the second war with England. The third. 
dates from 1862, when permanent internal revenue taxes 
were created, and temporary taxes upon incomes and manu- 
facturing were used? : 
244, Duties on Imported Goods.— A little more than 
50 per cent of the articles brought into the United States 
from other countries are dutiable.* On many articles, im- . 
ported even in large quantities, no duty is paid at the port. 
of entry, these being placed upon the “free list.” Most of 
the imports subject to duty are manufactured products that 
come into competition with the productions of our American 
factories". Upon these goods the rates vary widely, some- 
times being as low as 25 per cent of what they cost abroad, 
as with common earthenware, and again, as with worsted 
yarns, being as high as 140 per cent of their original pur- 
chase price. 
The chief advantage of custom duties is that the tax is 
not felt by the person who eventually pays it, for the im-

ferent parties. The Federalists controlled the. financial policy of the 
national government until 1801. From that time until the Civil War the 
party which at first was called Republican and afterward Democratic was 
supreme. Since 1861 the policy has been that practically of the present 
Republican party.

* June 30, 1907, were $578,360,592, of which more than 363 millions was for

The revenue for the same year from customs was $333,230,126 and from . 
internal revenue $270,309,388, For the period from 1789 to 1907, the 
receipts from customs amounted to $10,338,196,831 and from internal” 
revenue to $7,544,014,084, in a total of $20,141,734,986. .

porter simply adds the amount of the tax to the cost of the 
goods, and the customer does not realize how much of a tax 
he has paid. Its chief disadvantage is that in times of 
prosperity, when national expenditures would naturally be 
light, the revenue from the tax is great, while in time of 
war, when expenditures are heavy, the imports of goods 
decrease visibly and the duties are correspondingly reduced. 
The duties are collected at ports,of entry in the borders 
of this country.’ There is some smuggling, especially on 
the part of travelers who object to paying duty on articles 
purchased while abroad.? Importers sometimes. seek to 
evade the customs laws by very greatly undervaluing their 
goods, but, if detected, are obliged to pay a heavy penalty.* 
Instances have occurred of connivance between importers 
and the appraisers of customs, resulting in enormous losses 
to the government, but fortunately these are quite rare. 
245, Internal Revenue. — To-day the national government 
obtains as much money from internal taxes as from those 
upon foreign commerce. The rates are quite high, and the 
articles taxed at present include spirits, fermented liquors, 
and the different forms of tobacco. Our present internal 
revenue system is a heritage left us by the Civil War, dur- 
1 There are one hundred and twenty-four ports of entry, which are in 
charge of collectors of customs, assisted by over 5,000 persons. 
2 Travelers returning from abroad are allowed to bring back one hun- 
dred dolars’ worth of clothing purchased in other countries, but must 
pay duty upon everything else. 
8 When an importer purchases goods abroad, he makes out three in- 
voices, or bills of goods. One of these he ships with the goods, one is left 
at the consulate nearest the place of purchase, and the third is sent by the 
consul to the port at which the goods aré to be entered. Incoming vessels 
are met by revenue officers, who take charge of the cargo. After the 
vessel has been ‘‘ entered,’’ the invoices of goods are compared with those 
sent from abroad, a part of the articles being examined by appraisers to 
ascertain whether they correspond in number and quality with those de- 
scribed in the invoices. The assessment is determined by the appraiser, 
and the collection of duties then performed by assistant collectors. The 
consuls ascertain so far as they are able whether the goods actually cost 
the amounts named in the invoices, but this is almost impossible. The 
government relies more upon secret service agents in Europe and at the 
chief ports to ferret out cases of extreme undervaluation of goods. Adams,

Plehn, Pub-

232-239, The ease with which the revenue from this tax can be in- 
creased is quite apparent in the financial history of the 
Civil and Spanish-American wars. At the beginning of 
the Civil War the national government was levying no 
internal taxes, but in 1862 Congress authorized the taxa- 
tion not only of spirits, malt liquors, and tobacco, but of 
manufactures and incomes, as well as levying a stamp tax 
on ordinary business transactions, Later in the war, new 
schedules were added to these taxes, and the rates were in- 
creased on the articles formerly taxed. A process somewhat 
similar, although less extensive, was followed during the 
Spanish-American War. : , 
The tax on liquors and tobacco is a valuable one at. all 
times, since those who use those luxuries can afford easily 
to pay a share of the expenses of the general government. 
The extensibility of internal taxes in times of great financial 
need is undoubtedly its most desirable feature, as industry 
is apt to be stimulated rather than retarded by war. To 
lévy a very heavy tax on industry may, however, seriously 
cripple business and handicap the Nation in its prosecution 
of the war, so that excessive taxation must be avoided, es- 
pecially as it leads to a great amount of fraud.t 
246. Income Taxes.— Although income taxes are not levy- 
ied at present by our national government, their use during 
the period of the Civil War and their extensive use by the 
most progressive foreign governments make the subject 
one of considerable interest and importance. Theoretically 
the tax meets the requirements of a very satisfactory tax 
(§ 148), since net income is the best evidence of ability to 
10n the whisky tax of the Civil War, see Dewey, Financial History 
of United States, § 166.
-P-A-G-E-280
NATIONAL FINANCE 237 
pay taxes. This is especially true when small incomes are 
exempt, since persons with small incomes expend all their 
money on necessaries. The tax is objectionable, because it 
requires investigation into the private affairs of individuals, 
and, by placing a premium on misstatement of incomes, leads 
to a large amount of fraud. The chief objection in this 
country has come from the constitutional standpoint, since 
the Supreme Court holds that an income tax is a direct tax 
that must be levied on the States according to their popula 
tion — a condition that makes the use of an income tax im- 
possible. 
During the Civil War, taxes were levied by the national government 
upon incomes. At one time persons with incomes between $600 and 
$5000 paid a 5 per cent tax, and those over $5000, 10 per cent. In 
1894 an attempt was made to levy a similar tax, exempting those 
whose incomes amounted to less than $4000 annually. This was 
opposed as class legisiation, as a much heavier burden would be placed 
on the capitalists of the East than any others. 
247. Miscellaneous National Taxes.—It was supposed 
when the Constitution was adopted that a large part of the 
revenue of the United States government would come from 
direct taxes levied upon the States in proportion to their 
population, but Congress had not seen fit to gain money by 
this means except five times, four of which were during the 
wars of 1812 and of 1861.1 Unlike the taxes upon imports 
or manufactures, Congress does not decide what the rate 
shall be, but ascertains the total amount of the tax, appor- 
tioning to each State its share. 
A minor source of revenue has been the tax upon Jegacies, 
which was used from 1898 to 1902. Persons who inherited. 
at least $10,000 were obliged to pay three fourths of 1 
per cent of the amount if closely related to the deceased, 
or as high as 15 per cent of the bequest, if not related in 
1 Whenever direct taxes have been levied on the States, they have been 
paid grudgingly and tardily. Adams,

is progressive taxation, which was considered earlier (155). 
A similar inheritance tax has been proposed in connection 
with the Payne tariff (1909) (p. 236). 
The total revenue from all forms of taxation for the fiscal 
year 1906-1907 amounted to more than $600,000,000, 
55 per cent of which came from customs and the re- 
mainder from internal revenue on liquors and tobacco. 
Although these taxes were paid by those who used the 
articles taxed, this burden of more than $7 per capita, or 
about $36 for each family of five, was borne chiefly by 
the workers of the Nation, men with small incomes. 
ManaGement or Nationat Finances 
248, Revenue and Expenditure.—In national finance the 
raising of revenue depends, to a large extent, on the expend- 
iture. A nation is not like an individual whose expenses 
depend upon his income, It has certain governmental 
duties to perform, and in performing them it thinks first of 
carrying on its work, and second of raising the money to do 
it. In other words, expenditure determines the income. If. 
the expense is unavoidable, and the revenue is not forth- 
coming, the government sooner or later goes to pieces. In. 
modern States the question is not whether the money can: be 
obtained, but by what means. In the United States we 
have derived the greatest part of our revenue from duties 
on imports. Under Federalist rule, and since 1861, internal 
revenue has been very important. The public lands have 
yielded some, while temporary income and direct taxes have _ 
been used. Practically every cent brought into the treasury 
has been by indirect taxes, levied almost as much in the in- 
terest of industrial development as for the sake of revenue. 
All of these indirect sources are liable to great fluctua - 
tions, especially in time of war or panic, but so great has 
been the industrial development of the country that the rav- °

over the wild extravagance of a billion-dollar Congress, but 
1908 was signalized by the advent of the billion-dollar 
session. : 
249, Revenue Bills.—The division of responsibility in 
financial matters may be shown by examining the machin- 
ery‘of a single house—the House of Representatives— which 
has special financial powers, since all bills for raising reve- 
_ nue must be proposed by it, although they may be amended 
by the Senate the same as other bills. To care for this part 
of its work, the House has a rather complicated, arrange- 
ment of committees, which includes a Committee on Ways 
and Means, to which all revenue bills are referred, and over 
a dozen committees on appropriations, which consider differ- 
ent phases of the government’s expenditures, When the 
House wishes to debate any measure which deals with 
finance, it resolves itself into a “Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union.” 
The influence exercised by the Committee on Ways and. 
Means is indicated by the fact that tariffs are known popu- 
Jarly by the name of the chairman of that committee, as, ¢.9., 
the McKinley tariff of 1890, or the Dingley tariff of 1897. 
But, although the Committee on Ways and Means ordinarily 
places an indelible stamp upon each revenue measure, the 
original bill is often very different from the one that is en- 
acted into law, for the House in the Committee of the 
Whole may not approve the work of its committee and con- 
sequently favor numerous alterations, while the Senate is 
sure to make many changes which no conference committee 
can induce it to drop. In 1894 the bill reported by Chair- 
man Wilson, proposing a tariff for revenue only, was so 
changed in the Senate that the tariff was not known as the 
Wilson tariff, but as the Gorman-Wilson tariff. 
Many of the bills introduced in the House by the Com- 
mittee on Ways and Means have been greatly influenced by 
the suggestions of the President, or the Secretary of the 
Treasury. This was especially true during Washington’s
-P-A-G-E-284
NATIONAL FINANCE . 241 
administrations, when Alexander Hamilton was in charge of 
the Treasury portfolio. 
250. Appropriation Bills.— Every regular session of Con- 
gress brings with it general appropriation bills, and many 
special bills dealing with the expenditures upon rivers and 
harbors, the army, the navy, and other subjects. At the 
present time fourteen committees have charge of the dif- 
ferent bills upon expenditures. As they are not obliged to 
work together, and do not make a special effort to have 
the appropriations equal the government’s income, there is 
either a considerable surplus or a large deficit shown on the 
Nation’s balance sheet. The President has very little con- 
trol over appropriation bills, because he must accept or reject 
them as a whole, since he does not have the power conferred. 
on most of the state governors (§ 95) of vetoing particular 
items, 
It is customary for the Secretary of the Treasury to have the chief 
officials of the Treasury and other departments make, in the fall of each 
year, estimates of the amount of money needed for the year beginning 
the first of the following July. These estimates are bound together, 
and sent with the Secretary’s report to Congress when it meets. These 
estimates are assigned to the proper committees, and are usually the 
bases of the committees’ reports, but the committees are not bound by 
the estimates of the executive departments, When a bill making ap- 
Propriations is reported to the House, that body considers it in Com- 
mittee of the Whole on the Staté of the Union, In times past this 
consideration has been careful and thorough, but with the maltipli- 
cation of appropriation bills the House has given less attention to the 
subject. It might be stated that the committees usually recommend a 
much smaller amount than that asked in the estimate. In the Senate 
an appropriation is likely to be increased, and, finally, when the con- 
ference committee reports, it is probably the close of the session, and 
the conference bill is passed without much debate on its merits.

—it is necessary for the government to borrow money, This 
is usually done by issuing bonds that bear a certain rate of 
interest and are payable in twenty or thirty years. These 
bonds are sold publicly to the highest bidders. During the 
Civil War, bonds to the value of several thousand million 
dollars were sold, often with great difficulty. Most of these 
bonds bore six per cent interest and were payable after five 
or ten years. At present the public debt of the United 
States includes nearly a billion dollars’ worth of bonds pay- 
able twenty or thirty years from date of issue, Of these 
over three fourths are at two per cent. As the three, four, 
and five per cent bonds are far above par, that is, sell for 
much more than their face value, we can easily perceive 
that the credit of our national government is excellent; in 
fact, no government in the world is able to obtain a lower 
rate of interest or finds its bonds in greater demand. . 
Many people advocate a national debt as a “public bless- 
ing,” but the ablest financiers deplore the increase of public 
debt except for necessary investments or in time of crisis. 
When, as in the case of the United States, the revenues have 
usually exceeded the expenditures, a debt is not serious. 
None of the other great nations have a per capita debt 
smaller than that of the United States, for our national in~ 
debtedness is less than $15 for each inhabitant. 
252. Borrowing Money by issuing Treasury Notes.—If we 
take the pains to examine a $5 “greenback,” we shall see 
that 16 is a promise on the part of the United States to pay 
the holder $5.. It is in reality a note, issued by the Treas- 
ury Department instead of by an individual, but which 
circulates as money. These notes were issued first during 
the Civil War, when the government experienced consider 
able difficulty in obtaining revenue and in selling bonds. 
They were made a legal tender; that is, no person could re- 
fuse to accept them in payment of a debt unless his contract 
called for payment in a certain kind of money. By using 
them, the United States borrowed nearly $450,000,000 dur-
-P-A-G-E-286
NATIONAL FINANCE 243 
ing the War of Secession. After the war, many people 
thought that the greenbacks should be retired because the 
Constitution does not give Congress the right to issue paper 
money, but the Supreme Court decided first that Congress 
night issue greenbacks in time of war, and later stated that 
they might be issued in time of peace, also. Consequently, 
only part of the Civil War issues were retired, and the gov- 
ernment is still in debt to those persons who still hold 
greenbacks, to the amount of more than $200,000,000. 
The continental currency issued during the Revolutionary War was 
in the form of treasury notes. As the credit of the government was 
poor, they became almost valueless, so that the expression ‘‘ not worth 
a continental,” passed into a proverb. During the Civil War, the is- 
sues of treasury notes were so large that a greenback was worth much 
less than a gold coin of the same denomination, and at one time a 
dollar in gold would purchase as much as $2.85 in paper.

CHAPTER XX 
REGULATIONS AFFECTING INTERNAL COMMERCE 
253, Extent of Commercial Powers. —In addition to the, 
control of foreign commerce (§§ 232-236), the national gov- 
ernment has charge of interstate commerce, makes bankruptcy 
laws, and provides a uniform system of currency for the trans- 
action of business. Not only does Congress have the right 
to “coin money,” regulate the value thereof, and punish per- 
sons who counterfeit the currency, but the States are ex- 
pressly forbidden to “coin.money, emit bills of credit, or 
make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment 
of debts.” The currency of the country may be used as a 
means for raising revenue (§ 252) or assisting the govern- 
ment in its operations, but its fundamental purpose is to aid 
in the exchange of goods from one person to another. 
In order that people doing business may have a currency 
upon which they can rely, the whole subject of money is 
left to the charge of government, with the idea of obtaining 
the best results for all concerned. The government must 
1 Although Congress has power under the Constitution to make bank- 
ruptey laws, only four had been passed since 1787, no one of which was in 
force more than eleven years. The States, meanwhile, were permitted to 
pass insolvent laws which could apply only to debts incurred after the law 
was passed and to debts owed by a citizen of one State to a citizen of the 
same State. National bankruptcy laws, on the contrary, absolve a debtor 
from all legal obligation to pay any of his debts, past as well as future, 
upon division of his property among his creditors. 
The present law, passed in 1898, makes a distinction between voluntary 
bankrupts and involuntary bankrupts. Any person in debt, except a cor- 
poration, may voluntarily become a bankrupt unless he has failed within 
the six years preceding. Any persons, except laborers, farmers, and na- 
tional banks, who owe $1000 or more, may be tried in a district court of 
the United States and adjudged bankrupts.

254, Money Standards.—If the government wishes to 
‘give the people both gold and silver coins, it follows one of 
two policies. (1) It allows any one who has gold or silver 
bullion to bring it to the mint and have it made into coins. 
This is called free coinage of both gold and silver, and is 
known as, bimetallism. It must be obvious that under a 
bimetallic system both metals will be coined only in case the 
gold and silver coins of the same denomination are of the 
same real value. For example, if the government says that 
the gold dollar shall contain 23,22 grains of gold and the 
silver dollar 3714 grains of silver, while the 23.22 are worth 
as much as 500 grains of silver in the market, then no one 
will take 23.22 grains of gold to the mint and receive only 
one gold dollar in return, when he can trade his gold for 500 
grains of silver and then exchange the 500 grains of sitver 
at the mint for $1.35 in government silver coins, oo 
If an ounce of gold is worth as much as 30 ounces of sil- 
ver, the market ratio of the two metals is said to be 30 to 1. 
This ratio varies constantly, because gold and silver, like 
other commodities that are bought and sold, change: in. 
value, When a government permits free coinage of too 
metals, it must fix the amount of metal of each i in coins of 
the same denomination, It must therefore have a legal ratio 
between the two. Yor éxample, if the silver dollar contains 
15 times as much pure metal as the gold dollar, the legal 
ratio is 15 to 1. 
(2) The second method which a government may adopt is 
to allow only one metal to be brought to the mint for coin-_

other metal and coins it into money. If there is free coin-

into coins, then the silver in a silver dollar must he of less - 
value than the gold in a gold dollar, otherwise the silver 
dollars will be traded for gold bullion and_the bullion 
brought to the mint for free coinage. But if the silver of 
the silver dollar is worth less than 100 cents in gold, let us 
. say 78 cents, then the credit of the government must be good 
for the other 22 cents if the gold and silver coins are to cir- 
culate side by side. This system of free or unlimited coin- 
age of one metal only is known as monometallism. 
255, History of the American Coinage. — Fortunately for 
us, Congress, even under the Confederation, adopted a deci- 
mal system of coinage, the Spanish dollar being the “ mone- 
tary unit.” In 1792, on the recommendation of Alexander 
Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury, the weight of the sil- 
ver dollar was fixed at 3714 grains of pure silver and of the 
gold dollar at 243 grains of gold,'a legal ratio of 15. to 1, 
with alloy added to make the coins hard and durable. Any, 
one who had those amounts of gold or silver bullion was al- 
lowed to take them to the mint and have them coined for 
his own use. Forty two years later it was found necessary 
to reduce the weight of the gold dollar to 23.22 grains fine, 
as the old gold dollar was worth more in the form of bullion 
than as a coin, so the gold dollars went out of circulation 
and the people did all of their business with silver. After 
hange had been made in 1834, however, people found 
that the silver dollars were now worth more as bullion than 
as coins, so that those who had silver did not go to the mint 
with it, but took only gold, and silver almost disappeared. 
from circulation.’ 
In 1873, Congress decided that there should be no longer 
1In 1854, in order to provide business men with small change, the gov- 
ernment reduced the amount of silver in the 50-cent piece and smaller coins. 
As it could not allow fgee coinage of these lesser coins, it bought the silver 
and minted the coins. Bullock,

«free coinage” of silver dollars. Later, however, in 1878 
and 1890, in response to a demand for silver dollars, Con- 
gress passed laws authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury 
to buy silver bullion, and have it coined into dollars. This 
was a very different matter, of course, from free coinage: of 
silver, for we now had a monometallic standard as explained. 
in the preceding section. The later law was repealed in 
1893 during the panic of that year, and in 1900 the gold 
dollar was made the money unit for the United States. 
Every silver dollar in circulation, the silver of which is ac- 
tually worth about a half of the gold in a gold dollar, is 
guaranteed to be of equal value with gold. 
256. The Process of making Coins.—The different coins in 
use in the United States are coined at the mints operated by the gov- 
ernment. The gold or silver is first refined so as to be absolutely 
pure, and is then mixed with alloy to make it hard, This mixture is 
molded into bars about a foot long, which are rolled repeatedly until 
they become strips of several feet in length and of the required thiek- 
ness for the various coins, These strips are fed into a cutting machine 
which cuts the disks or planchets of suitable sizes for the different 
coins. The planchets are first placed in the milling machine in order 
to raise the edges so as to prevent wear upon the face of the completed. 
coin, and are then taken to the coining machine in which dies are 
pressed agdinst the planchets simultaneously front above and below.2 
257. National Bank Notes. — Besides the gold coins which 
any one can have struck for him at the mints by taking the 
proper amount of gold bullion, and the silver coins made by 
the government from silver which it has bought outright, 
we use in business several kinds of paper money. One of 
1There are three mints—at Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Denver. 
2In the counting room, the more valuable coins are counted by weight, 
and the minor coins are counted by filling the grooves of boards which will 
contain a certain number and no more (see apparatus at left of view on oppo- 
site page). The greatest care is taken to see that every important coin 
weighs exactly what it should, and the planchets are tested for that pur- 
pose. All of the minor coins are made at the Philadelphia mint from 
materials furnished by a private company. .

them consists of the bank notes issued by banks! which re- 
ceive their charters from the national government. (1) 
These banks are allowed to issue regular notes equal in value 
to United States bonds which they have bought and left with 
the Treasurer of the United States. (2) The government 
permits national banks to issue notes temporarily? by paying 
a tax of 5 per cent, increasing 1 per cent a month to 10 per 
cent, in order to insure the retirement of these notes after the 
special need is past. The total amount of this emergency 
cireulation is $500,000,000, distributed among different sec- 
tions of the country. The notes may be issued to 90 per cent 
of the value of approved state, city, or county bonds, or to 
75 per cent of the value of commercial paper accepted by 
an association of ten local banks. This emergency circula- 
tion, permitted until 1914, gives some elasticity to a very 
inelastic form of bank notes. As the government agrees to 
accept all these notes except in the payment of duties, for 
which gold alone is taken, and as the banks must redeem 
them in lawful money upon demand, they circulate readily, 
although they are not legal tender, and people are not 
obliged to accept them in the payment of individual debts. 
Our present national banking system was established in 
1863 for the purpose of ereating a new market for bonds 
which the government was obliged to sell. ‘The national 
bank notes soon replaced the notes of state banks which 
were then in cireulation, for Congress placed an annual tax 
of 10 per cent upon the issues of the state banks. During 
each industrial panic there has arisen demand for a reform 
of our national banking system. The only relief given by 
Congress has been through the emergency circulation act 
just described. Reform of the system has been postponed 
indefinitely. Many people oppose the issuance of any form 
of currency by a private corporation, holding that the gov- 
1The national bank notes are printed by the government at the bureau 
of engraving and printing, the notes being distributed to the banks for the 
signature of bank officials.

258. Gold and Silver Certificates. — As it is much 
to handle a five-dollar bill than five silver dollars, it’ 
become customary for the government to deposit the sif 
dollars in government vaults and issue in place of ther 
silver certificates of one, two, five, and ten dollars. These 
are not legal tender, but the government is willing. to ex- 
change the silver for them at any time, and to give gold in 
exchange for the silver, so that a silver certificate for five 
dollars is worth as much as a five-dollar gold piece. Gold 
certificates are likewise issued in denominations from $20 
to $10,000; but, as we should naturally expect, the amount 
of gold in circulation is three times as great as that. of the | 
gold certificates, whereas five sixths of all the silver in the 
United States is piled away in sacks in Washington or at. 
the subtreasuries. 
The three kinds of paper money — the treasury notes 
(§ 252), the bank notes, and the certificates —- are alike in 
size and general appearance. The certificates are really 
substitutes for the coin they replace, although they possess 
no intrinsic value, but the others depend for their value 
entirely on the credit of the government or the banks. 
Interstate ComMERce 
259. National Aid to Interstate Commerce. — Interstate - 
commerce’ is much more important than our foreign com- 
merce, because it involves a vastly greater volume of trade. 
Until about a third of a century ago, our governments 
believed it their sole duty to aid this inland commerce. by 
opening territories hitherto inaccessible, and by improving 
roads and waterways over which interstate trade might be

carried on. Appropriations have been made for the deepen- 
ing of river channels and the construction of interstate 
eanals. The importance of this aid may be shown by citing 
a single instance — that of the Sault Ste. Marie Canal con- 
necting Lakes Superior and Huron. This canal which 
contains a lock 800 feet long was completed in 1896 at a 
cost of $5,000,000. Since that time the annual tonnage 
passing through the canal has risen to more than $40,000,000 
(1907), more than twice the tonnage entering New York 
harbor in any year. 
As the country has been settled more fully, government 
aid to railways has been discontinued. In the two decades 
following 1850, however, the national government granted 
to railways, most of which were in the West, an area equal 
to that of the two Dakotas and Nebraska. Immense sums 
were also loaned by Congress during this period to the 
promoters of transcontinental railways. : 
An undertaking greater than any yet attempted by our 
national government, except the Panama Canal, is the pro- 
posed deep waterway from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of 
Mexico. By deepening the Mississippi and the present 
drainage canal from Chicago, with deeper channels for the 
tributary streams, freight rates would be lowered and an 
immense impetus given to commerce throughout the Middle 
West. The project, like the proposed ship canal from Lake 
Erie to the Hudson River, is one that will be completed 
probably by the coming generation.!: 
260. Creation of an Interstate Commerce Commission. — 
For nearly one hundred years Congress did not attempt to 
exercise its right to control interstate commerce except by 
the passage of afew minor laws. But with the development 
of trunk railways which did business in several States, regu- 
lation at length became unavoidable. During the period

  following the Civil War many unnecessary railways had 
been constructed. Each of these sought to pay expenses by : 
charging extortionate rates between points that were depend- 
ent on their railway alone, since competition had lowered the 
rates between cities which were connected by more than one 
railway. Asa consequence, the railways often charged. 
more for a short distance than for a longer haul which in- 
eluded the short haul. Not only was there discrimination 
according to distance, but the railways frequently discrimi- 
nated between persons, by giving some shippers rates much 
lower than the advertised schedule of charges. Usually 
this reduction was in the form of a rebate or amount returned 
to the shipper after the goods had been delivered by the 
railway. In order to maintain high rates by protecting 
themselves from competition on the one side and from 
the demands of the shippers for rebates on the other, the. 
railways formed combinations called pools, in which the 
amount of business and profit of each railway in the “pool” 
was determined in advance. This removed any temptation 
to secure extra business by cutting rates. 
Several of the States created railway commissions (§ 140) 
to take charge of railway affairs within their own States. 
One of these commissions, that of Illinois, applied its laws 
to certain trade that was carried on between Illinois and the 
neighboring States, but the Supreme Court of the United 
States declared in 1886 that the Illinois Commission had no 
right to regulate interstate commerce, as Congress alone had 
that power. The next year Congress passed the Interstate 
Commerce Act to protect the public from the unjust actions 
of the railways. 
261. The First Interstate Commerce Commission, created 
by the law of 1887, consisted of five members. The avowed 
purposes of the act were to abolish pools affecting interstate 
commerce and to prevent the railways from charging extor- 
tionate or discriminating rates. The commission sould hold 
sessions, call witnesses, and examine railway accounts when-

ever any complaint was made or it believed that the rates 
were unjust. It might declare rates unreasonable because 
they were extortionate or discriminating, but if the railway 
wished to disregard the decision of the commission, the 
latter was obliged to carry the case before the courts. The 
courts hindered the commission more than they aided it, 
for they permitted the railways to introduce new evidence 
which had not been presented to the commission, thus mak- 
ing the decision of the commission valueless because based 
on incomplete evidence. The courts also prevented the com- 
mission from naming rates that it considered reasonable, so 
that the railways could avoid punishment by lowering their 
rates a very small amount. 
Although this commission did not succeed at all fully, it 
removed many of the old railway abuses. It gave publicity 
to railway management and accounts, it introduced a fairly 
uniform system of railway accounting, it prevented the rail- 
ways from charging grossly unjust rates, and by its con- 
stant appeal for more power, aroused public interest so that 
anew commission was created with more power, 
The commission’s work was especially effective after 1903, 
when a supplementary law was passed, called the “ Elking 
Act.” This made it illegal to give or accept rebates, made 
rebating punishable by fine, and permitted the commission 
to apply to the courts for injunctions which would prevent 
any railway from breaking any part of the interstate com- 
merce laws. 
262, The Present Interstate Commerce Commission. — 
After years of agitation, both houses of Congress agreed 
(1906) on a new Interstate Commerce Act which replaced 
that of 1887, The new commission, composed of seven 
members appointed by the President and Senate, has the 
power not only to declare rates “ unreasonable ” but to fix the 
” ‘macimum rate that shall be charged for the transportation 
of freight or passengers on interstate lines. It brings under 
the supervision of the commission all interstate common Johnson,

   carriers, a term which includes railways, private refrigerator 
cars, Pullman cars, express companies, and pipe lines (except 
for gas and water), in addition to interstate telephone. atd 
telegraph companies. No railway may carry, except for its 
own use, articles of which it is the owner, nor, if a railway 
reduces rates to meet water competition, may it restore water 
competition when the water competition has been removed. 
The problem to be solved by the commission is ‘one of 
great difficulty, because the management of the great rail- 
ways of to-day is exceedingly complicated and would tax the 
skill of the ablest economists and managers, even if our 
statesmen, railway magnates and managers, shippers, and 
the general public were always public-spirited and unselfish. 
The present commission can do much more than its prede- 
cessor, because it may supervise the classification of freight 
and can fix the maximum rate to be charged for transporting 
any class of freight between two points, although it cannot 
make all rates between those points just, nor can it insure 
reasonable rates everywhere for the transportation of similar 
commodities. Its decisions are effective because they..go 
into effect without great delay, and the companies must 
sue the commission if they believe the rate fixed is too low. 
Under the old law the commission was obliged to secure the 
approval of the courts before its decisions were obeyed. 
There were no long delays as formerly, because all evidence 
must be presented to the commission, and the cases are con: 
sidered at once by a special Court of Commerce of five Cir- 
cuit Court judges. Giving or accepting rebates is punishable 
by fine or imprisonment. Passes can be given only to rail- 
way officials, to employees, or to persons engaged in religious 
or charitable work. Private car and pipe line monopolies 
may be broken up. 
The additional requirements of the law of 1906 show 
a decided improvement. The private cars which were ran 
on different railways, and, which before 1906 charged ex- 
tortionate rates with impunity, have been brought under
-P-A-G-E-300
REGULATIONS AFFECTING INTERNAL COMMERCE 255 
control. Pipe lines that were owned by a monopoly must 
now be used, as common carriers, on the same terms for out- 
siders as for the owners. The railways which had bought 
up most of the coal mines of Pennsylvania, thus securing 
a monopoly in producing and transporting that necessity 
in the East, are not able to raise prices as easily as they 
‘did. The present law is imperfect in many ways and 
cannot reach the real evils of many railway practices, but it 
marks a step in the final solution of national control. 
263, The Sherman Anti-Trust Law of 1890.— The national 
government has much less control over industrial combina- 
tions, because the only provision of the United States 
Constitution which deals with the power of the national 
government over commerce or industry within the United 
States is contained in the words, “Congress shall have 
power... to regulate commerce ... among the several 
States.” When the Constitution was adopted in 1787, 
even interstate commerce was not particularly important. 
But the expansion of large corporations which have plants 
in several States and do business in every part of the Union 
presents a problem of commercial and industrial control 
which cannot be solved by the separate state governments. 
The interest of the public, therefore, must go unprotected 
or be secured by the national government. For this reason, 
in response to a popular demand Congress, in 1890, decided 
that “every contract, combination in the form of trust or 
otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce 
among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby 
declared to be illegal.” This act was intended to supple- 
meft the Interstate Commerce Act’ (§ 261) passed three 
years earlier. 
At first comparatively little attention was paid to the 
law either by the government or the corporations. It was 
invoked in 1894 to prevent labor organizations from in- 
terfering with the movement of trains engaged. in inter-

state commerce. Later the Supreme Court broke up sev- 
eral illegal railway combinations,! including the interesting 
Northern Securities Company. In these railway cases the 
Supreme Court made clear its position that the restraint 
‘was not necessarily unreasonable in order to be illegal. 
There has been, in consequence, considerable agitation for 
the amendment of the act, permitting combinations-to make 
agreements that are reasonable, The court, before 18967 
declared that “any agreement or combination which directly 
restrains not only the manufacture but the sale of a eom- 
modity among the several States comes within the Anti- 
Trust Act.”? If Congress were permitted by the courts to 
regulate the affairs of industrial corporations which do 
business in several States, it would,expand greatly its own 
commercial powers and revolutionize the system of indus- 
trial control in this country. . 
264, Recent Anti-Trust Activity.—In 1903 Congress or- 
ganized a new cabinet department known as the Department 
of Commerce and Labor. One of the bureaus created for 
this department was that of corporations, the head of which 
was authorized to investigate “the organization, conduct, 
and management ” of any company other than railways en- 
‘gaged in interstate commerce. ‘The first commissioner of 
corporations believed that the task of investigation would 
be simplified greatly by compelling all corporations engaged 
in interstate trade to secure their incorporation papers from 
the national government. This would obviate many of the 
difficulties due not only to the lenient laws of some.States, 
but to the diversity in different state laws (§ 165). As yet 
(1908) no action has been taken on this suggestion. ° 
Many of the larger trusts have been investigated by this 
bureau, and many reforms have been instituted without 
farther action than the publications of the commissioner’s

reports. Because of these investigations, the attorney gen- 
eral of the United States and his representatives have 
brought suit against the beef trust, the paper trust, the 
Standard Oil Company, and several other monopolies, because 
of the violation of the Sherman Act or other commercial 
laws of Congress. In general, the results obtained in the 
courts have been favorable to the government, although 
these suits have not interfered particularly with the business 
operations of the large corporations. The right of Congress 
to control the actions of trusts so far as they are engaged in 
interstate commerce has been upheld by the courts fully. 
On the other hand, the right of the trust to defend itself by 
refusing to show its books or give evidence in court on the 
ground that it might incriminate itself, has been denied cor- 
porations.

CHAPTER XXI 
TERRITORIES AND PUBLIC LANDS 
265, Territorial Powers.— When the Constitution was 
adopted, Congress obtained the “power to dispose of and 
make all needful rules and regulations respecting the terri- 
tory or other property belonging to the United States,” 
together with the right to admit new States into the Union. 
~ Nothing was said in the Constitution about the right of 
acquiring new territory, but there has never been a time 
when the national government, or any considerable propor- 
tion of the people, has opposed the annexation of territories, 
either by treaty or by joint resolution of the houses of 
Congress. We may, therefore, distinguish four different 
territorial powers of Congress: (1) the right to acquire 
territory ;? (2) the right to govern it; (3) the right to 
admit territories as States; and (4) the right to sell or 
otherwise dispose of any lands the title to which is vested 
in the United States. It will be noticed that the first three 
of these are distinctively governmental; that is, they. are not 
functions exercised by individuals or by private corpora- 
tions, while the last is a right regarding property like that 
of any other owner. 
266. The Expansion of National Territory. —'The first 
territory subject to the control of Congress comprised 
the public lands west of the Alleghany Mountains, to 
which the separate States surrendered their respective 
elaims between 1781 and 1802. In 1803, Louisiana was

with Great Britain in 1846, the forty-ninth parallel of lati- 
tude was made the northern boundary of our part of the 
Oregon country, which had been occupied jointly by Great 
Britain and the United States since 1818. At the close of 
the Mexican War, in 1848, the very extensive territory 
south of parallel 42 as far as the Gila River, and west from 
‘ the Rio Grande to the Pacifie Ocean, called the Mexican 
cession, was annexed by treaty, being enlarged still further 
by the Gadsden Purchase of 1853. In 1867, Russia sold us 
Alaska, and in 1899 by the treaty of peace with Spain we - 
came into possession of Porto Rico, the Philippines, and 
other numerous smaller islands. Hawaii had been annexed — 
during the Spanish-American War (1898) by a joint resolu- 
tion of Congress.

each territory was “organized” upon a more permanent 
basis and governed as described Jater in this chapter. 
The temporary territorial governments, which might 
properly be called colonial, have been left by Congress in 
charge of military or administrative officials selected by 
the President. The territory northwest of the Ohio River, 
for which the famous ordinance of 1787 was adopted, was 
governed at first as one district by a governor and judges, 
who were appointed by Congress and had power to make 
and execute laws suitable for the district. Most of the 
Louisiana Purchase was subject for over a decade to a 
provisional government. Alaska is still a colony of the 
United States, governed by law of Congress which is exe- 
cuted by a governor and assistants whom the President 
selects; and the Philippine Islands were for three years 
under a military governor, or a commission which had full 
legislative and executive powers. 
268. Congressional Control of National Territory.— Before 
considering either of these forms of territorial government, 
it will be well to learn the limits of the control that may be 
exercised by Congress, and to ascertain whether Congress 
may deal with them in the same way during the organized 
stage as it does during the provisional period. No very 
definite statement of the powers of Congress over territory 
was necessary until the acquisition of lands at a distance 
from the continental United States a few years ago.? As 
these lands were inhabited by people alien in race and 
political experience to the citizens of this country, the 
questions arose at once: were these colonies part of the 
United States, or did they simply belong to the United 
States? Did the special limitations placed upon Congress 
in the Constitution apply to this territory, as, eg., the one 
that duties must be uniform throughout the United States, 
1 Before the Civil War the South held that Congress could not prohibit 
slavery in the territories. This view was accepted by the justices of the 
Supreme Court in the Dred Scott opinion (1857), Historical

or might Congress pass a tariff act for any colony different. 
from thatapplying to the United States proper? Was Con-.-° 
gress under obligation to permit right of trial by jury and «.. 
perfect freedom of speech under any and all circumstances? _ 
In some of the “Insular cases” (1901) the Supreme Court. 
decided that Congress might levy special tariffs on the colo- 
nies, since they were neither foreign soil nor integral parts 
of the United States. Later decisions (1904) denied the right 
of trial by jury and the right to bear arms within the Phil- 
ippine Islands even to former citizens of the United States. 
These decisions recognized the power of Congress to decide 
when the Constitution and its amendments shall. apply to 
territory acquired by the United States, giving Congress ab- 
solute control of new territory until our national legislature 
limits its own power by extending constitutional rights and 
privileges to the inhabitants of the new lands. 
269. Present Government of the Philippine Islands. — With 
all of the insular possessions, every opportunity has. been 
given of securing those forms of governments which will 
combine a high degree of efficiency with as much popular 
zovernment as the conditions permit. After the cession of 
the Philippine Islands by Spain, they were governed at 
first by a military governor, and later by a civil commission, 
By the law of 1902 provision was made for a much more 
permanent form of government, all civil rights guaranteed 
by the United States Constitution being granted except the 
tight of trial by jury and the right to bear arms, both of 
which have just been considered. At the present time, the 
Philippine Islands have as liberal a government as can be 
found in the tropical possessions of any country. 
The Philippines have at present a central government, 
provincial governments and municipal governments. The 
sentral government consists of a governor and a commission 
of six besides the governor, who is a member of the commis- 
sion, all appointed by the President and Senate. The com- 
mission is the chief executive body in the islands, and

constitutes as well the upper house of the legislature. The 
lower house, called the assembly, is a body of eighty mem- 
bers} chosen for a term of two years by those men 23 years 
of age who own property or can speak, read, and write 
Spanish or English. This central legislature makes laws 
subject to the Philippine acts passed by Congress, The 
judges of the highest court are selected in Washington, and 
two “resident commissioners” chosen by the Philippine leg- 
islature represent the islands at the American capital. 
Each province has a board consisting of an elected gov- 
ernor and. several appointed officials, who look after the col- 
lection of revenues and the preservation of order in the 
province. A much larger share of governing is left to the 
municipalities into which the islands are divided. These 
municipalities elect their own magistrate and councils, 
which govern them under the laws passed by Congress or 
the insular government. The system seems to work well, 
and the progress in self-government and in education under 
American supervision has been creditable to both the Phil- 
ippines and the Americans. 
270. Government of Porto Rico.—The greater intelli- 
gence of the people of Porto Rico necessarily affects the 
government of that colony. The suffrage is universal, except 
that those who become voters hereafter must be able to read 
and write. These voters elect the lower house of the legisla- 
ture and many local officials, but the upper ‘house consists of 
eleven persons, five of whom must be Porto Ricans, selected 
by the President and Senate. Six of these persons are also 
heads of different executive departments who assist the gov- 
ernor, The governor has about the same powers as govern- 
ors in organized territories, but appoints a larger number 
of local officials. As in the Philippines, the governor, as 
well as the judges of the highest court, hold office directly 
from the President. One « resident commissioner” repre- 
sents the territory in Washington.

The system of local government in the island has been 
sompletely reorganized under American rule by the central 
government. The voters are allowed to choose a mayor and 
souncils in the municipalities, which form the only district 
for local government. The people have more control over 
their finances and some other matters than in the Philippine 
[slands, but there are no local judges, and the work of local 
government is at all times supervised carefully by the insu- 
lar authorities. . 
271. The District of Columbia.— In the Constitution, powet 
is given to Congress “to exercise exclusive legislation in all 
cases whatsoever over such district (not exceeding ten miles 
square) as may, by cession of particular States, and the 
acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government 
of the United States.” A law passed in 1790, arranged for 
the location of the district upon the banks of the Potomac, 
the land being ceded to the United States by Maryland and 
Virginia, although the part upon the south bank was re-ceded 
to Virginia in 1846. The district is now governed by three 
commissioners appointed by Congress, with power to select 
minor officials, and supervise the administration of all local 
affairs? 
The limits of the city of Washington have been made to 
coincide with those of the district. Because it is the capital 
city, especial care is taken to make the city worthy of the 
American people. Originally laid out by an artist engineer, 
Washington is prepared admirably to become the most 
beautiful city in America. By the grouping of public 
buildings, the creation of parks and the extension of the 
1 The selection of the location for the national capital aroused a great 
deal of interest and feeling, as each section was anxious to have the seat 
of government situated within its borders. Preference was finally given the 
South in order to gain Southern votes for ‘‘ state assumption,’’ a measure 
which Secretary of the Treasury Hamilton considered invaluable in estab- 
lishing the public credit. 
2Two afternoons a month are devoted in Congress to bills relating to 
the government of the district.

272, The Relation of an Organized Territory to the National Degree of 
Government.—-In one sense, every organized territory is nations! 
‘entirely under the control of Congress, for that body decides 
the extent of its boundaries, the form of its government, 
the part which the pcople may take in that government, and 
has a veto on all laws passed by the territorial legislature. 
In other words, the territory depends upon Congress for its 
very existence, and derives its fundamental law from Con- 
gress. But, by custom, a territory has always been treated 
as a rudimentary State, subject to national supervision, 
although given the right to direct its own affairs as far as 
possible, in order that when it becomes a member of the 
Union, the habit of self-government shall have become 
fixed. :

under territorial law, and many under the Constitution and 
statutes of the United States, are decided finally by these 
courts. All local executive and judicial officials are chosen 
by the legal voters of the territory. 
Two 274, The Admission of New States. — No organized terri- 
methods of tory believes its territorial government to be other than 
provisional, considering it the chrysalis form of its existence. 
_ Cooley, Its dream is to enjoy full Statehood, and it uses every pos- 
ome sible means to obtain from Congress the right to join the 
175-183, sisterhood of States. Sometimes it calls a constitutional 
convention that frames a constitution, which, after ratification 
by the voters, is sent to Congress for its approval. In this 
the. State usually renounces all claim to the title of the 
vublic lands, and agrees that certain articles, as, e.g., those 
alating to public education and religious liberty, shall be 
evocable only with the consent of both the United States 
nd the State. If nd constitution has been adopted, Con- 
ress passes an enabling act, which authorizes the framing 
f a constitution. After this has been accepted by the 
eople and Congress, the territory is admitted as a State.' 
Ina federal system of government in which each State 
sentitled to the same rights and privileges as each of the 
ther States, the principles governing the admission of new

8 well as of the Congress.”” .

States is of the first importance. No circumstances can 
justify the admission of new States in order to give help to 
the party in power in a coming election, nor can they war- 
rant the exclusion of a territory for political reasons. 
Several States have proved also by their experiences the 
undesirability of uniting within the boundaries of a single 
State radically dissimilar sections. For example, in some 
of the Eastern States there has been constant strife between 
the commercial.interests of the sea border, the rich farmers 
of the plains and the hardy mountaineers. Where these 
interests are dissimilar and fairly permanent, much dissatis- 
faction would have been avoided by a different arrangement 
of state boundaries. One of the great problems of the 
future must be the permanent status of those territories 
inhabited chiefly by races alien to our own.

275. Disposal of the Public Lands. — When the United 
States came into possession of the territories mentioned in 
§ 266, it acquired not only the right to govern these regions, 
but the title to unoccupied lands within their borders. As 
‘we just noticed, the title to these public lands did not pass 
to. the States upon their admission to the Union, but re- 
mained with the national government, 
This public domain was intended at first to be a profitable 
investment, but has been used much more for the purpose 
of developing the newer sections of the country. After 
completing the surveys described in § 279, the lands have 
been granted to States and to individuals, or sold at a nominal 
figure. An area greater than that of the thirteen original 
States has been transferred to railways or to States for in- 
ternal improvements. Two sections of public school lands 
in each township have been given to the various States

79-282, upon their admission to the Union, and, during the sixties, 
general grants of the lands were made for the aid of state 
agricultural schools. Parts of sections have also been 
assigned to soldiers and sailors for military service, and 
large quantities have been sold at $1.25 or $2.50 an acre, 
Nothing has affected more vitally the political as well as 
the economic development of the United States, and the 
social life of the people, than the public lands. During 
the closing years of the Revolution the public lands in the 
West produced the chief bond of union among the States 
(§ 181). In the West the possibility of acquiring title to 
public lands was the principal influence in the rapid devel- 
opment of the section east of the Mississippi between 1815 
and 1860, and west of the Mississippi after the Civil War. 
Our public land policy has helped to keep us a nation of 
small farmers; it has developed a real democracy, not 
simply political, but social and economic. It has helped us 
to absorb as true American citizens a multitude of for- 
eigners who have come to us. But in many ways our laws 
have been so liberal as to be unwise. The national govern- 
ment has given away land that it should have kept. More 
than this, its leniency has permitted persons to stretch 
even those liberal laws and defraud the people of lands 
that the future will show should have been retained by 
the Nation. : 
276. Agricultural and Grazing Lands.—~ Most of the West 
was settled under one of two laws — (1) the preémption law 
which was in force until 1891 and permitted any citizen 
who was a head of a family to require 160 acres by living 
on it six months and paying $200, or (2) by the Homestead 
Act, first passed in 1862 and modified somewhat later. This 
law permits any citizen or person who intends to become a 
citizen to acquire title of a quarter section, 160 acres, of 
ordinary agricultural lands by living on it and cultivating it 
for a period of five years. Veterans are allowed to deduct 
1 Before 1848 one section only.

acre. Both the Homestead Act and the Desert Act have 
been used by speculating corporations to acquire large areas 
of valuable lands at low figures. Unoccupied public lands 
have been fenced by cattlemen, who have had the use of 
these lands without charge. The large amount of fraud

TERRITORIES AND PUBLIC LANDS 271 
The reclamation service of the Interior Department has 
achieved remarkable results in examining districts that might 
be made arable, in planning the construction of dams amid 
great engineering difficulties, perhaps hundreds of miles 
from the territory provided with water, and in carrying this 
policy into effect. The execution of this plan has involved 
us in international complications, with Mexico on the lower 
Rio Grande and Colorado because of the Mexicans whose 
supply of water is affected, and with Great Britain on the

Montana border. These are but minor incidents in the com- 
pletion of’ a plan which wifl literally “make the desert 
blossom as a rose.” 
Work has actually been begun on more than twenty-five of these 
projects (1908), and the total cost of work that has been planned is 
more than one hundred millions. It is expected, however, that the in- 
crease in value of the lands brought under irrigation will exceed the 
entire cost of construction by 50 per cent, The average value of the 
crops from these lands undoubtedly will amount to one half the original 
cost of construction. Two of the projects may be considered as 
typical of others. The Roosevelt dam in Arizona is the largest of the 
projected, dams, being 280 feet high and 630 feet wide, forming a 
geservoir more than 25 miles long. An area of 160,000 acres in the

278, Mineral Lands and Forests.—It has been possible 
for individuals and corporations to acquire possession of 
the immense mineral wealth of the United States, because 
the national government has permitted citizens or associa- 
tions of citizens to locate small mining claims varying in 
size with the kind of mineral. In order to retain these claims, 
a minimum of $100 worth of labor must be performed on 
them each year 
for the first five 
years. Under the 
Stone and Timber 
Act, citizens may 
purchase 160 acres 
of lands that are 
not reserved or 
open under other 
laws. 
A large percent- 
age of the forests of 
the country have 
been set aside in 
reserves which are 
Narionau Forests not for sale, al- 
though they pro- 
duce considerable timber by thinning out the dense growths. 
The national government realized the need of preserving 
the forests before the public awakened to the danger. At 
the present rate of destruction, our forests will be de- 
stroyed within a generation, the soft woods suitable for mak- 
ing paper being almost exhausted already. The possibility   
200 MILES

ofthe destruction of the forests, the direct commercial and 
esthetic losses that come with deforestation, the indirect 
consequences to the water supply of denuding the hills of trees 
so that spring floods are swollen in volume while the summer 
streams become tiny rivulets—all these dangers caused 
President Roosevelt and Chief Forester Pinchot to increase 
the forest reserves to more than 160,000,000 acres. Great 
care is taken by the construction of fire breaks and the con- 
stant patrolling by rangers to prevent disastrous forest fires. 
Lumber thieves are watched, and prosecuted with vigor. 
Whenever possible, large areas are planted with trees suitable 
to the soil and climate by the Forest Service of the Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, which has entire charge of the reserves. 
An earnest attempt has been made to create, through the 
codperation of the Atlantic States, an Appalachian forest 
reserve, from lands held or controlled by the States. This 
interest in such a necessary reserve was one of the chief 
causes leading to the conference of governors at Washington 
(1908) (§ 164). 
Some of these reserves possess such marvelous scenery 
that they are not treated as ordinary reserves, but are con- 
sidered national parks. The largest of these, Yellowstone 
Park, is half as large as the State of Massachusetts, and is 
famous for its geysers. Probably the most beautiful is the 
far-famed Yosemite. 
279, The Method of surveying the Public Domain. — The 
surveys of our public lands have been made in accordance with ordi- 
nances adopted during the eighteenth century. These provided for the 
selection of certain parallels of latitude to be called base lines aiid cer- 
tain meridians of longitude called principal meridians, the intersection 
of abase line with a principal meridian being the starting point for 
surveying all of the lands in that part of the country. Townships six 
miles square are then surveyed to the north, east, and west, and possi- 
bly to the south, being named according to the distance from the base 
line and the meridian ; the distance to the east or west being indicated 
by the number of the range, and the distance to the north or south by 
the number of the township, as shown in the diagram given below.

280. The Post Office as a Business Organization. — The post 
office is the only notable example of a business actually con- 
ducted by the national government. More than 150,000 
persons are employed in gathering and distributing the mails, 
over 60,000 post offices have been established, and nearly 150 
pieces of postal matter for every man, woman, and child in 
the United States are handled yearly. Unlike ordinary 
firms, Uncle Sam does not seek to make money through the 
Post Office Department, but gives the people the best ser- 
vice possible at less than cost, the deficit in 1907 being 
$7,000,000 in a total expenditure of $ 190,000,000. 
Post offices are divided into four classes, according to the 
amount of the business transacted. Postmasters are ap- 
pointed by the President and Senate for the first three 
classes, about 7500 in number. The other postmasters, 
whose salaries.are less than $1000 each, are chosen nominally 
by the Postmaster-general, but really by the congressmen 
from the State or district in which the post office is located. 
None of these officials is subject to civil service rules, and 
many are changed whenever a new administration is in- 
augurated at Washington. Most of the employees, includ- 
ing postal clerks, railway mail clerks, and mail carriers, 
are appointed by the Civil Service Commission (§ 44), being 
continually reéxamined by inspectors to insure efficiency. 
The postal system was under the control of the government even in 
. colonial times, but the rates were exorbitant, and the methods in use

very different from those of the present. ’ Letters were usually the only 
things carried. Stamps were not used, and postage was not paid in 
advance. Until 1845 it cost 12} cents to send a letter 100 miles, and 25 
cents for any distance greater than 450 miles. After Sir Rowland Hill 
had demonstrated in England the advantage of adhesive stamps.and a 
reasonable rate, not dependent on the distance, we adopted in 1845 a 
modification of this plan. Charges have since been lowered greatly, 
the present rates having gone into effect October 1, 1883, The in- 
erease of business has certainly justified this last reduction, for the 
postal revenue is more than four times as great as it was twenty-five 
years ago, notwithstanding the proportionally larger business done for 
the same income, and the costly improvements that are constantly 
being made in the service. 
281. Methods employed by the Postal Service. — In addition 
to the post offices maintained for the sale of stamps and money orders 
and the delivery of mail, postal routes have been established over 
which the mails are transported. Contracts are made for carrying the 
mail on these routes; with companies, for the routes most traveled, 
as on railways or large rivers ; with individuals, in more isolated re- 
gions. Moreover, all other persons or corporations are forbidden to 
carry mail for a compensation over these routes, as the government re- 
tains a monopoly of the business. Special fast mail trains are operated 
between large cities and on transcontinental lines. On all railways 
the mails are distributed by railway mail clerks at all hours of the day, 
in order to facilitate its delivery. This system is employed even on 
electric cars, which are used for collecting letters in cities, 
The United States is a member of the International Postal Union 
which was organized in 1891 for the purpose of establishing uniform 
rates on all letters, periodicals, and books from one to another. These 
rates are now the same to nations not in the Union. The rates for 
mail are the same, however, from the United States to our island pos- 
sessions, Mexico, Canada, Germany, and Great Britain, as they are 
between points in this country. The United States has not joined the 
International Parcels Post Union which covers all of Europe, sending 
packages which weigh eleven pounds or less for small amounts. Special 
arrangements have been made with South American countries for car- 
rying packages, Germany being the only European power to which 
they can be sent, but all American nations include parcels with other 
mail, although at much higher rates than prevail in Europe. 
By a law enacted in 1866, the Post Office Department has authority

to acquire the ownership and control of telegraph lines which it may 
need. This authority, of course, it has never exercised. Postal tele- 
graph lines are being operated successfully by most of the progressive 
European governments. 
282, The Work performed by the Post Office includes not 
only the collection and distribution of the mails,’ but the 
issuance of money orders. Free collections and deliveries 
have been established in cities, large villages, and in many 
rural districts, the number of daily deliveries depending upon 
density of population and the distance from the post office. 
This service is distinctly inferior to that of many foreign 
countries, where the mails are somewhat cheaper and de- 
liveries are much more prompt. This is due partially tothe 
greater distances in America, and even more to the fact that 
in the United States the letters give a large surplus revenue 
which is used to make good the.deficit from other branches 
of the service. The mail for rural districts is really deliv- 
ered from traveling post offices, the former post office usually 
being discontinued. This rural service has resulted in a 
marked increase of business, and has been very successful. 
A law of 1910 permits the use of designated post offices as postal 
savings banks, The system has been tried with success in foreign 
countries, particularly Great Britain, France, and Italy. The govern- 
Ment pays 2 per cent interest, but no person is allowed to deposit 
more than $500. As 98} per cent of all deposits in our state sayings 
banks are in thirteen States, the postal bank offers security as well as 
opportunity for savings, particularly in the other thirty-three. . 
Valuable letters and packages are registered at the post offices or 
by mail carriers at the homes on the payment of. eight cents besides 
Postage. A record of every registered parcel is kept by each person 
through whose hands it passes, and, in case of loss, the sender may 
receive an indemnity not exceeding $25. 
Both domestic and international money orders are issued at cer- 
tain offices, at a nominal charge. In 1907, 62,530,408 domestic orders 
10rdinary mail is divided into four classes. Letters are first-class mat-

When the name and address upon a package cannot be deciphered 
or the mail has not been delivered for other reasons, it is returned 
directly to the one who sent it, if his name appears upon the letter or 
parcel ; otherwise, through the Dead Letter Office, where it is opened 
if necessary. The skillful clerks of this office display a wonderful in- 
genuity in reading addresses that are absolutely meaningless to the 
ordinary individual. 
283. Observations on the Postal Service. — With all of its 
merits, the postal service exhibits many defects. As the 
department is not organized on a thoroughly satisfactory 
business basis, unnecessary financial losses are constantly 
occurring. (1) The appointment of postmasters without 
special regard to preparation for their duties, and the fre- 
quent changes that occur under the present system, are in 
themselves inexcusably costly. (2) Abuses are likely to 
arise in awarding contracts for carrying the mails, the claim 
being made that the government pays much more than ex- 
press companies for similar services. As the transportation 
of the mails amounts to more than 40 per cent of the entire 
cost of the service, overcharges would easily account for a 
deficit of ten millions a year.) (3) The government sends 
free an enormous quantity of publications, seeds, and other 
articles both the cost and transportation of which would be 
saved if the recipient were obliged to pay the postage. (4) 
A great amount of discussion has taken place in connection 
with the rates for second-class matter. Since the postage 
paid on the periodicals coming under this class covers only 
asmall part of the cost incurred in handling them, an 
earnest attempt has been made to exclude all advertising 
1 A large amount would be saved if the government would purchase its 
own mail cars, permitting them to be attached to trains in the same way as 
express cars or sleeping cars, which are not owned by the railway com- 
panies. 
2¥For the year 1907-8 second class mail gave 6 per cent of the revenue, 
and constituted 65 per cent of the postal expenses.

circulars, books which have claimed to be periodicals, and 
newspapers whose circulation is almost entirely unpaid. A 
revision of the law for all second-class matter has been pro- 
posed, but without results, the enormous deficit for this 
elass of mail being justified on the ground of its educational 
value.

284. Government and Agricultural Development. — Only 
during recent years has the national government undertaken 
any work that would prove of direct benefit to those en- 
gaged in agriculture or allied industries. Jts present ac- 
tivities are exceedingly varied and valuable not alone to those 
who profit. by the help and suggestions given, but to the 
country at large, since its wealth is angumented greatly and 
the people are provided with foods that are purer and more 
nutritious. 
Most of the work is supervised by the Department of 
Agriculture, the different bureaus of which are doing an 
immense amount of investigation into the agricultural needs 
and problems of the United States, devising numerous aids of 
a practical nature for the farmers of the country. Codperat- 
ing with bureaus of this department are the well-equipped 
State Agricultural Colleges for each of which Congress has 
appropriated public lands and is granting annually a sum of 
$50,000 per year.! The instruction given to the regular 
students in these schools is supplemented by short courses 
offered to farmers during the Christmas vacation, by demon- 
stration trains which bring to the farmers the results of in- 
vestigation that may prove of value in that locality, by 
lectures and object lessons at farmers’ institutes, and by 
the results achieved on tens of thousands of demonstration 
farms which are being conducted in accordance with advice 
from Washington or the nearest agricultural college. This 
practical work consists, to a large extent, in the application 
1 $25,000 before 1907, increasing $5000 per year until 1912. General.

of the discoveries made by the experts and students in the 
experiment stations, of which one or more are to be found in 
every State. Congress appropriates $30,000 annually for - 
each of these exceedingly valuable laboratories which are 
solving the numerous problems of soil, plant development, 
diseases or other agricultural questions for which they. have 
especial advantages. 
285. Investigation and Use of Soils.— A very extensive 
survey of the soils of the United States has been made to 
ascertain the character, ingredients, and possibilities of the soils 
in different States and sections. The total 
area Which has been examined carefully ag- 
gregates about one fourth of the improved 
farm land of this country, although many 
surveys are made in unoccupied regions in 
order to discover what changes would be 
required for the growing of crops in remote 
territories and the possibilities of these lands. 
Especially in the South, this work is being 
‘aided by liberal state appropriations. Maps 
.of the lands surveyed which show the char- 
acter of the soils and their uses are prepared 
and distributed. 
The problems of obtaining the best possible 
results from ordinary land, of utilizing lands 
that appear to be “worn out,” of developing 
arid lands, of reclaiming alkali regions, and of 
draining swamps have received considerable 
attention. The value of land for agriculture 
Som Avaur depends to a large extent on the presence in 
it of nitrogen, besides several mineral elements 
and the absence of materials injurious to crops. Soils that 
are excellent for one crop are valueless for others, since 
different plants use different elements of the soil. A wise 
rotation of suitable crops gives a soil opportunity to replen- 
ish a supply of some elements which have been diminished

or exhausted. ‘Worn-out” lands may simply be lacking in 
some element essential to the plants which have always 
been grown on that soil but may have abundant supplies of 
most other soil elements. It may be a simple process to 
provide these lands with the elements that have been ex- 
hausted. It has been discovered that most soils may be re- 
supplied with nitrogen—the most important single soil ele- 
ment—by the simple process of growing leguminous plants 
like peas, beans, clover, or alfalfa, the roots of which, by the 
aid of the right form of bacteria, draw nitrogen from the air. 
If the bacteria are absent from the soil, they are furnished 
by the national government, and the soil is “ inoculated.” 
Government experts have paid especial attention to lands 
that are arid or contain alkalies, Not only is the govern- 
ment preparing (§ 277) to provide these rich lands with the 
chief thing they need—water —but efforts are being made 
to utilize the lands that cannot be irrigated. Through a 
study of the soil and of means to utilize all the moisture 
there is by improved processes of “dry farming,” or by the 
planting of crops that need little water, these lands are be- 
coming valuable. Alkali lands which were considered use- 
less because of the presence of injurious salts have been 
freed from these elements by the simple process of flooding 
and subsoil draining. - 
286. Plant Development.—The best results from the use 
of soils requires not only the adaptation of crop to soil, but 
the selection of that type of plant which is best suited to 
the climate and the purpose for which it is intended. By 
the careful selection of seed alone many farmers of the 
corn belt have increased their yield from 25 to 50 per cent. 
The national government has been trying to demonstrate 
that by paying more attention to the selection of that vari- 
ety which will give not only the largest gross yield but the 
greatest amount of nutrition, a half billion dollars a year 
without extra expense can in time be added to the wealth 
of the country in connection with corn alone. ~ Du Puy,

withstand greater cold than the érdinary varieties, are 
among the results obtained, and the future gives promise of 
more wonderful discoveries. 
Not the least successful of the tasks undertaken in con- 
nection with the new agriculture are the importations of new 
planis or new varieties, From the interior of China we are 
obtaining fruits or grains that can be grown on the arid’ 
Jands of the great plains. Siberia has yielded plants that 
show greater resistance to cold than any we have in Amer- 
ica, Some varieties of imported alfalfa will grow where 
ours will not, or will produce a larger number of crops 
yearly. Excellent examples of the present economic impor- 
tance of an imported fruit is the Washington navel orange 
brought from Brazil; of an imported cereal is the durum 
wheat, a crop of 50,000,000 bushels of which is grown now 
mostly in the land of little rain. 
287, Preservation of Food Supply.— One of the greatest 
savings effected by these scientific investigations of the 
national government is connected with the diseases which 
destroy plants or animals wholesale. All trees, shrubs, or 
animals imported from other countries are examined to pre- 
vent the introduction of new or dangerous diseases or in- 
sects, Frequently, as in the case of scale on orange trees, 
the pest is destroyed by the use of insects that use the pests 
for food. Parasites of insect pests, or birds which live upon 
objectionable moths or other injurious insects, are encour- 
aged or brought to the place where they are needed. In 
the case of the Mexican boll weevil, which is spreading 
eastward, playing such havoe with the cotton crop, all these 
means have been used, in addition to the attempted devel- 
opment of a variety of cotton boll that will not be subject 
to the weevil. Spraying has been found very effective for 
fruit trees, while solutions of iron sulphide have been used 
to destroy weeds without affecting the crop. 
Some of the worst diseases of stock have already been 
eradicated by vigorous treatment, frequently by outward Importa-

application. It is estimated by James Wilson, Secretary of 
Agriculture, that the expenditure of $220,000 saved prob- 
ably five hundred millions by preventing the spread of a 
virulent form of cattle disease. The government is trying 
. not only to protect stock from destruction, but toe develop 
those strains which will give best profits. Much less has 
been done with animals than with plants, however. In- 
vestigations are made of dairies and their products, but the 
indebtedness of the farmer is to the discoveries in the agri- 
cultural colleges of means for separating cream, and for 
testing the butter fat in milk. 
288. Food Inspection.— Of a somewhat different’ charac- 
ter is the inspection of foods by government officials in 
order to insure the purchaser against impure meats or other 
foods, ‘his is allied closely with the work done by the 
local governments (§ 121), since the national government 
has control of those products only which are shipped from 
State to State, or aré intended for export. The most promi- 
nent part of the work is performed at the great packing 
houses. Before 1906 very little attempt was made to pro- 
vide for careful inspection, but under the meat inspection 
law of that year the number of inspectors has been greatly 
increased, and there is careful examination of the ani- 
mals before they are killed and of the meats afterward. 
The inspectors may condemn meats that are unsatisfac- 
tory, the approved product being marked “U.S. inspected 
and passed.” In the canning and preserving rooms especial 
care is taken to maintain cleanliness and encourage the use 
of the most modern methods. 
Under the Pure Food Act of 1906 drugs cannot be sent 
‘rom one State to another unless they meet the tests pre- 
scribed by the United States Pharmacopewia. Foods must 
not contain injurious substances and must be accurately 
described by their labels. The regulations for the enforce- 
ment of this far-reaching law are quite strict, and the influ- 
ence of the law, together with the state laws (§ 121) to
-P-A-G-E-338
MISCELLANEOUS NATIONAL ACTIVITIES 287 
which it led, cannot easily be estimated, as most manufac- 
turers voluntarily and cheerfully followed the direction for 
pure food and the publicity of ingredients. The relative 
food values of different articles have been determined by 
chemical analysis and by experimentation in numerous 
agricultural stations and with Dr. Wiley’s famous “poison 
squads.” 
289. Protection against Storms and Floods.— The services 
of the Weather Bureau in forecasting storms and prevent- 
ing unnecessary loss to growing crops or to coast trade is so 
well known as to require little comment. There are located 
at about two hundred stations regular observers, who report 
twice daily to some central office the meteorological condi- 
tions in their vicinity. At these central or district offices 
men are constantly employed comparing the reports and 
sending out general and local Sorecasts, which are distrib- 
uted by mail as quickly as possible. Reports from these 
district stations are sent to the main office at Washington, 
where they are in turn compared by experts, who at once 
send out forecasts to the different stations. Reports on the 
conditions of climate and crops are received weekly from 
about fourteen thousand persons, national and state crop 
bulletins being issued as soon as convenient afterward. 
Most of us appreciate the importance of the weather fore- 
casts made by the Weather Bureau, though we frequently see 
only the failure to indicate the exact changes of tempera- 
ture for our locality. We do not always realize the im- 
mense saving to those engaged in agriculture of warnings of 
floods, droughts, or storms, nor the value to those who are 
shipping merchandise from port to port on the lakes or sea- 
coast, if notified that a storm is brewing.

At present all Chinese laborers, idiots, paupers, and per- 
sons with contagious diseases or under contract to work in 
competition with American labor, are excluded from enter- 
ing the United States. The number of immigrants is never- 
theless very large, 1,285,349 persons being admitted in 1907, 
and only about 1 per cent of that number being sent back. 
The next year, however, the net immigration fell to less than 
100,000, showing the influence of the hard times of that year. 
The character of the immigrants is unfortunately less satis- 
factory than two decades ago, and even more stringent laws 
have been proposed. 
The number of German immigrants decreased from 109,717 in 1887 
to 87,807 in 1907. During the same period the number of inhabitants 
coming from Austro-Hungary, Russia, and Italy rose from 181,856 to 
883,126. While the second generation of these latter peoples will 
probably be capable of assimilation with Americans, the older immi- 
grants are unable to drop their former customs and habits, 
Ships coming from Europe are met by inspectors who make as care- 
fula medical examination as seems necessary. Applicants for admission 
are taken to the immigration stations and cared for by the govern~ 
ment until the officials are satisfied that they do not belong to any 
of the excluded classes. As the steamship companies are compelled 
to take back those who are debarred from entering the United States, 
each transportation line makes some examination of the immigrants 
before leaving Europe.

new Americans — their legal position, their rights in regard 
to the holding of property and exercising political privileges,

and, more than all else, the conditions under which they shall 
be admitted as full citizens —- constitutes another subject of 
vital importance. Except for four years (1798-1802) our 
policy always has been to admit foreigners to citizenship 
after a very short period of residence in order that they may 
identify their interests with ours. In addition to this indi- 
vidual naturalization, we may have collective naturalization, 
the latter occurring when a large number of foreigners are 
made citizens by a single act, such as a treaty or Amend- 
ment XIV of the Constitution. 
Under the present naturalization act, passed in 1870, only 
persons of the white or the negro race may be naturalized, 
and these can become citizens only after a@ residence of five 
years in this country. The process includes two important 
steps: (1) The applicant for citizenship must first declare, 
before some court of record, that he intends to become a 
citizen of the United States, that he will support the Con- 
stitution, and must renounce his previous allegiance to any 
foreign State or sovereign. (2) Not less than two years 
after making this declaration, he must prove before a simi- 
lar court by means of witnesses that he has resided in this 
country at least five years, and has conducted himself 
properly. He then renounces his allegiance to his former 
sovereign and swears to support the Constitution. His 
wife and minor children become citizens without further 
formalities, 
As in the case of many other American laws, those con- 
nected with naturalization have been enforced Jaxly. In 
addition there has been an immense amount of fraud in the 
form of forged papers or of genuine papers sold by bribed 
officials contrary to the law. It is estimated by one investi- 
gator that more than one million fraudulent or defective 
2 The law of 1798 required a residence of fourteen years before an alien 
could become a citizen, but it Japsed in 1802, and five years has been the 
time required since, although attempts have been made to lengthen or 
shorten the period.

in treaties which were broken quite frequently. The tribal 
Indians have since been considered wards of the nation, and 
have had certain rights to lands on reservations. Indian 
affairs now are intrusted to a Commissioner who looks after 
the lands, schools, and moneys of all tribes except those that 
by former treaties are free to care for their own welfare. 
The government appoints Indian agents who oversee the 
distribution of funds and the allotment of lands, hear com- 
plaints, and have general charge of Indian affairs, great and 
small. The success of the present system depends to a very 
great degree upon the character and judgment of these 
agents, many of whom are conscientious, capable men, al-
-P-A-G-E-343
MISCELLANEOUS NATIONAL ACTIVITIES 291 
though they are often appointed for other reasons than their 
qualifications. A commission of ten members whe devote 
their time without pay has done much to improve the 
Indian service by investigating and recommending im- 
provements. 
On the reservations! schools are now supported by the 
government, aid in the form of food, clothing, cattle, and ag- 
ricultural implements is given regularly, and the encroach- 
ments of mercenary whites are prevented as far as possible. 
The problems of education and civilization are being dealt 
with in an honest spirit, and an attempt is being made to 
solve them by making the Indian a citizen, giving him land 
of his own, and training him in some suitable line of work. 
* Some of the Indians have proved their ability to keep afloat 
in the struggle for existence, but their character, training, 
and treatment by Americans have not prepared them for the 
life of the white man. . . 
293, Patents and Copyrights. In order to encourage the 
invention of new mechanical devices, Congress permits the 
Patent Bureau to issue to inventors patents which grant 
them the exclusive right to manufacture and sell the pat- 
ented device for a period of seventeen years.? The influence 
exerted by this system in improving the mechanical methods 
used in almost every branch of business in the United 
States cannot be overestimated. 
The issuing of copyrights is intrusted to the Librarian of 
Congress, to whom application must be made, and with 
whom two copies of each book or drawing are left for the 
Congressional Library. The fee is only $1, but the exclu- 
sive right of publication is granted for a term of twenty- 
1In,1900 it was estimated that there were 270,544 Indians in the United 
States, of whom 86,265 lived in what was called “ Indian Territory.” One 
sixth of these were able to read, and about the same number held land “in 
severalty.” In 1902, 24,434 children received instruction in the govern- 
ment schools, over $3,500,000 being devoted to this work.

drawings are actually printed in the United States. 
The applicant for a patent must file a very specific written statement 
showing the exact character of the device, accompanied by drawings 
and models when necessary. At the same time, he takes oath that he 
is the actual inventor of the art or machine, and that to his knowl 
edge it has never been patented before. When this application is 
made, a fee of $15 is paid, afurther fee of $20 being required if the 
patent is granted. 
The library of Congress contains a great many valuable books and 
manuscripts in addition to those left according to copyright laws. 
These are invaluable to students and to congressmen who wish to gain 
information on United States history especially, In 1907, the library 
contained 1,433,848 books and pamphlets. Since 1897, the library 
has been located i in a separate building, which is a very handsome 
piece of architecture.

CHAPTER XXIII 
CONGRESSIONAL METHODS 
ConGRESSIONAL REGULATIONS 
294, The Organization of Congress.— The Congress of the United 
States, like the legislatures of the States, is composed of two houses, 
one of which is much larger than the other. Unlike the state legis- 
Tatures, the houses of Congress are radically different in character, as 
the Senate, or upper house, represents the States, each State having 
- two senators chosen by its legislature, whereas the members of the 
House of Representatives are chosen by the people of the Nation from 
districts of nearly equal population. It will be remembered (§§ 185~ 
187) that the Constitutional Convention of 1787 was at no time in 
favor of having a single-chambered Congress, as that of the Confedera- 
tion had proved so unsatisfactory, while the state legislatures were 
quite vigorous. Yet the real difference between the Senate and the 
House in composition was less the result of planning and experience 
than of the compromise between the large and the small States (§ 187). 
This compromise —a necessary part of the convention’s work — has 
probably given us the best possible kind of a national legislature, be- 
cause the two houses are sufficiently unlike to prevent hasty and ill- 
considered legislation and to represent properly the varied interests of 
our Republic. 
At the first meeting under a new Congress, the Senate swears in the 
members last elected, and proceeds with its old committees and former 
Tules under the chairmanship of the Vice President, until the new com- 
mittees have been arranged (§ 305). 
In the House the organization is a little more elaborate. The clerk 
of the previous House calls the roll of all of those holding certificates 
of election, and, if a quorum is present, the House proceeds to swear 
in its new members, and to elect its Speaker and other officers.» When 
both houses are organized, the President is notified, and his annual 
message is read before the separate chambers. With the appointment 
of its committees by the Speaker, and the adoption of a set of rules, 
the House is, equally with the Senate, prepared for actual work,

295. The Sessions of Congress. Whenever a House of Repre- 
sentatives gives place to a new House, once in-two years, we have a 
new Congress. For example, the Fifty-seventh Congress lasted from 
March 4, 1901, to March 4, 1903, being replaced on the second date 
by the Fifty-eighth. 
Each Congress has two regular sessions, one of which begins on the 
first Monday of December after the Congress comes into existence, and 
continues into the following summer until the chief bills have been 
passed or postponed. This is called the Jong session.1 The second or 
short session begins on the first Monday of December following ad- 
journment, and closes the Fourth of March, when the Congress expires 
by limitation. 
The members of the House of Representatives are elected on the 
Tuesday after the first Monday of November in the even-numbered 
years, and cannot meet until the next Fourth of March, Ordinarily 
they do not come together until December of the next year. There 
seems to be a serious need of changing either the time of the election 
or the date of meeting for Congress. Many things happen nowadays in 
"thirteen months 3 new questions may arise or the feeling of the people 
may change. Furthermore, there is no good reason why one session 
of every Congress should be held after its successor has been elected. 
If the new Congress is very different from its predecessor, the old pne 
is confronted with the problem of leaving legislation untouched or of 
enacting laws in accordance with a policy that the people have just re- 
pudiated at the polls. 
Special sessions of Congress? may be called only by the President, 
and not by request of members of the legislature as in most of the 
States, unless Congress adjourns to meet ata date earlier than the first 
Monday of December. Special sessions are not common, but at times 
new laws are so imperative that the President issues his proclamation 
summoning a special session for a date named, and giving his reasons 
for calling the session. 
296. Provisions Common to Both Houses. — Hach house con- 
trols its internal organization, being authorized by the Constitution to 
make its own rules, elect its own officers, decide who are elected 
1 If the houses of Congress fail to agree upon a time for final adjourn- 
ment, the President is authorized by the Constitution to set a date at which 
the session ends, but his services have never yet been required. 
2 Special sessions of the Senate without the House are called immediately 
after the inauguration of a President to confirm his appointments for cabi- 
net and other positions. They may also be held to act upon treaties of 
importance.
-P-A-G-E-352
CONGRESSIONAL METHODS 299 
members, punish members for disorderly behavior, and compel the 
attendance of a quorum to do business. 
Each house has.a Committee on Rules to which all proposed changes 
are submitted. The Senate always uses the rules of the preceding 
session, but the House must formally adopt rules before they can be 
applied, although few changes occur from one Congress to another. 
The officers of the houses are elected at the beginning of each Con- 
gress and hold office during the sessions of that Congress. 
Both the Senate and the House have committees on elections that 
hear the evidence in disputed cases and report to the houses which of 
the contestants is entitled to a seat. 
Each house may punish a member for disorder, but even in flagrant 
cases the punishment is likely to be mild, reprimands being given on 
occasion, but suspensions very rarely. Two thirds in either house 
may expel a member, but cases of expulsion are almost unknown. 
No business can be transacted in either house unless a majority of 
its members, the constitutional quorum, is present. If less than half 
are in attendance, they may either adjourn or authorize the sergeant- 
at-arms to compel the others to attend. Neither house is allowed to 
adjourn more than three days without the consent of the other. At 
the close of a long session, the date for final adjournment is usually 
fixed by agreement without great difficulty. 
In order to insure a complete record of what is done in Congress, 
the Constitution provides that ‘each house shall keep a journal 
of its proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, except- 
ing such parts as may in their judgment -require secrecy.”? At 
present we have a daily paper called The Congressional Record, which 
contains a full report of all speeches delivered, and some others pre- 
pared by congressmen, and a biweekly Journal which gives a sum- 
mary of all bills introduced and all votes taken. 
297. The Privileges and Disabilities of Members.-— When the 
English Parliament was struggling to limit the power of the King, 
centuries ago, the King was often able to defeat their wishes by arresting 
the leaders of the opposition. Since the contest between Parliament and 
the Stuarts, which ended in the complete victory of the former, mem- 
bers of Parliament have been free from interference by the King or 
his ministers. Some of these privileges were claimed by the legislators 
in the colonies, and are now granted to Congressmen and our state 
legislators by the constitutions. Members of Congress are “in all 
cases except treason, felony, and breach of the peace privileged from 
arrest during their attendance at the session of their respective 
houses, and in going to and returning from the same, and for any Rules,

  speech or debate in either house they shall not be questioned: in any 
other place.’* 
Members of Congress receive from the Treasury of the Uni tod States 
a salary of $7500 a year besides traveling expenses—** infleage 
of 20 cents a mile! Extra compensation is granted in the form of 
allowances for clerks, for free delivery of mail upon public :business, 
allowance of money for stationery, and of large numbers of govern- 
ment publications and quantities of free seeds. Yet with all these per- 
quisites of office, our congressmen are so underpaid that few. business 
men can afford the luxury of holding the position. The shortsighted- 
ness of this policy is self-evident. 
Great was the dread among the members of the convention which’ 
framed the Constitution that congressmen might be drawn from the 
plain path of duty. They accordingly inserted in the Constitution 
this clause, ‘¢ No senator or representative shall, during the time for 
which he was elected, be appointed to any civil office under the au- 
thority of the United States which shall have been created, or the 
emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time, and 
no person holding any office under the United States, shall be a mem- 
ber of either house during his continuance in office.’” 
    
Tre Process or LAWMAKING 
298, The Early Stages of Legislation. — Inits earliest form, 
a law is either a bill or a joint resolution, introduced in the 
Senate or the House by some member? About one bill in 
eight is fortunate enough to be enrolled as a part of the law 
of the land. Most of them never reach a second reading, 
which means that they are never read at all; for, when a 
member introduces a bill in either house, the clerk or secre- 
tary reads only the title, the bill being immediately “com- 
mitted.” It is then likely to be “killed in committee.” 
3 The Speaker of the House and the president pro tempore of the Senate 
receive $12,000 each per year. 
2Members are not allowed to introduce bills when they please, for the 
houses are too busy to consider new bills except on stated days. In the 
House, for example, new bills must be introduced upon the first and 
third Mondays of each month. Ifa member has a bill to bring before the 
House, he takes it on those days to the desk of the Speaker or the clerk. 
and has the pleasure of listening to the reading of the title when the roll 
of the States is called.

CONGRESSIONAL METHODS 301 
If the bill has enough friends, or is of sufficient importance, it is in 
time reported back by the committee to the House and placed upon the 
‘‘ealendar,” after being read the second time. The committee may 
have altered the original measure so as to destroy all of its essential 
features, and it may be further changed when an opportunity is given 
later for debate and amendment, before the third reading and final 
vote, Bills are not, however, taken from the calendar in regular order, 
as appropriation bills and others of particular importance may be 
reported and discussed at any time. In the House, bills are taken from 
the calendar for consideration in the order prescribed by the Com- 
mittee on Rules (§ 310). 
The chief difference between the methods of the Senate 
and the House is observed in connection with the discussion 
of proposed laws. The House allows comparatively little 
debate, no one being permitted to speak who has not first 
obtained the consent of the Speaker or of the chairman of 
the committee in charge of the bill, for the Speaker gives 
the privilege of the floor to those only whom he wishes to 
recognize, According to the rules of the House, debate may 
be closed at any time by having one of the supporters of the 
bill move the “previous question,” which gives the majority 
an opportunity to decide whether a vote shall be taken upon 
it at once. 
In the Senate, on the contrary, there is no rule limiting 
debate, which has often continued for weeks upon some 
important bill, as in the spring of 1902, on the one establish- 
ing a Civil Government for the Philippine Islands. This 
gives the minority an opportunity to delay action, by 
“filibustering,” as it is called, a method that is now im- 
possible in the House. . 
299. The Taking of a Vote.—-When a bill has been read 
for the third time, the vote upon it may be taken in one 
of three ways, a majority of those present being necessary 
for its passage. (1) The usual method is to call for the 
ayes and noes, the presiding officer deciding from the sound 
whether the measure has passed. (2) When the result is 
in doubt, or 2 member asks for a rising vote, this is taken

and each side is counted. (3) If one fifth of the members 
wish to have the roll call, the clerk reads the names alpha- 
betically, the vote of each being recorded. "When the roll 
is called unexpectedly, there is always an interesting hunt 
for the members of the House who may be in the building, 
but not in the legislative hall. 
An active canvass for votes may be necessary in order 
to insure the passage of a measure, Votes for one bill are 
often secured by promising support for another, a practice 
known as “log rolling.” It is safe to say that earnest 
personal appeal exerts more influence than public debate. 
With party measures which fail to interest all the members 
of the dominant party, various tactics are employed to gain 
the support of those likely to oppose the bill. Among the 
means used to this end, the most effective consists in hold- 
ing a caucus of all the party members belonging to the 
House. If the caucus indorses the bill, a full party vote 
is assured, as few men will vote against their party under 
such circumstances. 
A kind of “filibustering’? used on former notable occasions is 
now forbidden by the rules of the House. As organized in December, 
1889, the House contained a very small majority of Republicans, and, 
owing to the absence of several members, Speaker Reed was able to 
obtain a quorum only by counting Democrats who were present, but 
who refused to vote. This action was opposed at the time with great 
vigor, and gave the Speaker the title of ‘* Czar Reed,” yet ever since 
members present but not voting have been counted. 
300. The Bill in the Second Chamber. When a bill has 
been passed by one house and signed by the presiding officer 
of that body, it is sent to the other chamber where the three 
readings, the reference to a committee, and the discussion 
will be repeated. If it is approved by this house without 
alteration, it is signed and sent to the President, but if 
amended in any particular, it must be returned to the house 
which passed the original bill, because the measure must be 
adopted by the two houses in exactly the same form. ‘Ways of

  The second house may even go so far as to subgtitiite for 
the original bill an entirely different one relating to the 
same subject. This was done by the Senate in thé closing 
days of the first session of the Fifty-seventh Congress, in 
regard to an interoceanic canal. The House bill provided 
for the construction of a canal across Nicaragua, and the 
Senate substituted the Panama route, with the proviso, that, 
if no clear title could be obtained to the Panama route, the 
President should be authorized to construct the canal by 
way of Nicaragua. Strangely enough, the Senate bill 
passed the House by an overwhelming majority, but in 
such cases it is usually necessary to resort to a conference 
committee. 
A conference committee is composed of an equal number 
of members from each house of Congress, selected for the 
sole purpose of reconciling the differences. between the 
Senate and House bills upon a particular subject. Each 
chamber usually selects three of its best men as its repre- 
sentatives, choosing those who have been most interested 
in its bill, The conference committee may select the Senate 
or House bill én tofo, but this is unusual. The compromise | 
bill reported by the committee is very often accepted by 
both houses without discussion or amendment, although a 
second conference may be required, or the bill may be de- 
feated in one or both houses. 
301, The Presidential Veto.— When a bill has been pre- 
sented to the President for his signature, he is allowed by 
law ten days, exclusive of holidays and Sundays, in which 
to sign it. Imfhe fails to sign it or return it to Congress 
within that time, it becomes a law without his signature, 
Bills which he disapproves are returned to the house in 
which they originated, with a message giving the reasons 
for his veto. A vetoed bill must command a two-thirds vote 
in each house before it becomes 2 law. This majority very 
few measures can obtain, especially with the weight of the 
President’s disapproval against them. In fact, but one bill
-P-A-G-E-359
  CONGRESSIONAL METHODS 305 
‘was passed over the President’s veto before 1866, although 
we must remember that the chief executives of those days 
‘were much more chary of using the veto than in these later 
times, when Congress enacts laws with greater haste. 
A bill passed less than ten days before the adjournment 
of Congress does not become a law unless actually signed by 
the President. Neglect in cases of this kind is equivalent 
to a veto, the name pocket veto being popularly applied to 
the practice. On account of the large number of bills 
which are passed during the closing days of a session, the 
President may be able to exercise an undue influence upon 
legislation. Many of these bills are, however, hastily drawn 
and ill-considered, so that on the whole their failure does 
not injure the public. 
302, The Committee System.— The most distinctive fea- 
ture of congressional procedure is the use of committees in 
making laws. The committees? are the center and life of 
Congress, doing the larger part of the work in framing im- 
portang bills, — although these may be actually introduced 
by individual members, — in investigating subjects before 
either house, and in concentrating the discussion in the 
chambers upon a few vital questions. The House places a 
much greater dependence upon committees than the Senate,? as 
1 The committees are usually composed of from ten to fifteen members, 
some having as few as three, and others, in the House, as many as eighteen, 
the largest Senate committee numbering seventeen. The majority of each 
committee belongs to the dominant party, except for a few unimportant 
Senate committees; but every member of the House is on at least one com- 
mittee, and every senator is assigned to not less than four. A few repre- 
sentatives are connected with three or even four committees, and many 
senators work on six or seven. 
In the House, the committees are selected by the Speaker, and in the 
Senate the appointments are made by the whole Senate (§ 305). In both 
heuses, the member whose name appears first on the list of committeemen 
is the chairman. \ 
2 The House of Representatives has two Committees of the Whole, one of 
which deals with financial bills and the other with private bills. When 
the House resolves itself into a Committee of the Whole, the Speaker 
always calls some one else to the chair, as he sometimes does in the House 
proper. "But the presiding officer cannot make any one attend the com-

it is much larger. Standing committees have been used in 
the House from the beginning, whereas the earliest perma- 
nent committee of the Senate dates from 1816. 
So numerous are the committees that their duties fre- 
quently overlap. Many bills may, therefore, be assigned to 
any one of two or more committees. There is often a sharp 
contest between chairmen for the control of important 
measures, and, as the different committees would be likely 
to make very different reports, the right to decide which 
shall have it is of the first importance. In the House, this 
power belongs to the Speaker, but, in the Senate, it is re- 
served by the chamber, although ordinarily exercised by 
the presiding officer. 
The committees usually hold their meetings upon certain 
mornings, many of them having separate rooms for this 
purpose. The sessions are supposed to be secret, but are 
not strictly so, although no records of their proceedings are 
published. Most of the work at these meetings is done by 
the members of the majority, whose leaders, in fact, often 
arrange all important details beforehand. Subcommittees 
are frequently appointed to examine and report upon special 
features of a bill. In the regular sessions, the committees 
hear the reports of individuals or of these subcommittees, 
listen to the statements of business men whose line of work 
would be affected by the committee’s action, examine ex- 
perts, confer with subordinate officials of some executive 
department of the government, and discuss the bills under 
consideration. 
mittee, neither does he have the right to maintain order by force. The 
quorum, instead of being one half the members, is only one hundred. As 
sessions of the Committees of the Whole are held for the express purpose 
of debating proposed laws, speech is not subject to the same limitations as 
in the House. When a committee has finished the business in hand, it 
rises and reports to the House, which is in no way bound by the action of 
the committee.

CHAPTER XXIV 
THE HOUSES OF CONGRESS 
Tur SENATE 
9309, General Character of the Senate. — The Senate of the 
“United States is one of the smallest and most satisfactory 
national legislative bodies in the world. It is composed of 
two members from every State, all of whom must be at least 
thirty years of age, have been citizens of the United States 
at Jeast mine years, and be residents of the States from which 
they are chosen. The term of office is six years, and as the 
senators are divided into three classes, so that one third 
retire every two years, the Senate isa continuous body. On 
aecoont of its small size and its semi-permanent character, 
the Senate is able to discuss public business much more 
thoroughly than the unwieldy House of Representatives. 
Itis, therefore, especially fitted for the work of confirming 
appointments and ratifying treaties made by the President, 
these being the chief special powers conferred upon the Sen- 
ate by the Constitution. 
90% The Flection of Senators.— As the Senators are 
supposed to he the special representatives of the States in 
the. national government, they are chosen by the respeetive 
state legislatures. Since 1866, the methods used by the leg- 
islatures in senatorial elections have been the same through- 
aut the United States. On the second Tuesday after the 
meeting of a state legislature upon which the election de- 
volves, the members of the separate houses are to name by 
‘otua, voce vote their choice for the position, and a joint ses 
sion ig to be held the next day,a majority of eack house

being present. Ifno one is elected on the first ballot, joint 
sessions are held daily at noon until a senator is selected. 
The choice, of course, always falls upon the candidate of the 
party which has a majority in the state legislature, this can- 
didate having often been previously selected by a caucus. 
Sometimes, however, the majority fails to agree upon a can- 
didate, and disagreement may even be carried so far that the 
State has no representative in the United States Senate, as 
was the case with Delaware in 1902.! 
During the last decade there has been a widespread and 
constantly growing demand for a change in the method of 
electing senators. Successive Houses of Representatives 
have passed, by almost unanimous votes, resolutions which 
propose to amend the United States Constitution in order 
that senators may be chosen by popular vote, but the resolu- 
tions have never even been discussed in the Senate. The 
cause of the movement for popular election lies in the gen- 
eral belief that the legislatures are thwarting rather than 
expressing the wishes of the people, and is closely allied to 
the distrust of our state legislatures which has shorn them of 
many of their powers (§§ 89-91). As a means of avoiding 
tho protracted contests in the legislatures, which are becom- 
ing much more common and seriously interfering with state 
business, and as a preventive of possible bribery, popular 
election would undoubtedly be a success. 
Several of the States have already adopted laws which 
provide that, in the primary elections at which state officials 
may be nominated (§ 26), the voters may express their prefer- 
ence for United States senators. Ordinarily, this expression 
of opinion is not binding on the legislature. In Oregon, 
however, by a combination of direct nomination of senators 
1When a vacancy oceurs by death or resignation during the recess of 
the legislature, the governor may appoint some one until the next legisla~ 
ture shall choose a senator in the way just described. But when a legis- 
lature has failed to elect a senator and the government makes an 
appointment for the vacancy, the Senate refuses to admit the appointee 
as a member.
-P-A-G-E-365
THE HOUSES OF CONGRESS 311 
and pledges exacted from candidates for the legislature that 
they will support the senatorial nominee who has the largest 
vote, irrespective of party, a legislature of one party may 
choose a senator belonging to the opposite party — practi- 
cally if not legally a popular election. 
305, Senato¥ial Regulations,!— Like the House of Repre- 
sentatives, the Senate does a large part of its work through 
committees. The selection of the committees is left with 
the party that controls the Senate at the beginning of each 
Congress, but usually certain rules are observed. The ma- 
jority of the members upon all important committees belong 
to the party in power, who retain the chairmanships with 
possibly a very few unimportant exceptions. Thechairmanof 
any committee is not chosen arbitrarily, but is the commit- 
tee member who has served longest upon the committee, 
unless -he voluntarily relinquishes his position by preferring 
another more important chairmanship, In case a chairman 
dies or resigns, the position falls to the committeeman who 
has seen the greatest length of service, so thatin the Senate, 
“seniority” is a fied rule, and a fair evidence of senatorial 
conservatism, 
The Senate spends a large part of its time in discussing 
public questions, but it has never been willing to adopt a 
rule that Would limit the debate. This is done in most de- 
liberative assemblies by asking for the “previous question,” 
which brings to a vote the question before the House. The 
Senate relies upon its natural dignity to keep the debate 
‘within bounds, but at times the lack of the “previous ques- 
tion” is painfully evident, for the minority have occasion- 
1The presiding officer of the Senate is the Vice President of the United 
States, who is not chosen by that body but is elected at the same time and 
in the same way as the President (§§ 313-317). Not being really a mem- 
ber of the Senate, he does not appoint the committees nor control busi- 
ness. He has a vote only when the Senate is equally divided. In case of 
his absence, death, or elevation to the presidency, his place is filled by a 
president pro tempore of the Senate, selected by the senators from their 
own membership. Rev. of

306. Special Powers of the Senate.—- A large past of the 
authority and influence of the Senate is derived from its 
power to confirm all important appointments made by the 
President. Because of the double system of ebeosing. offi- 
cials (§ 326) there has become fixed a custom called sena- 
torial courtesy which leaves with the senators the. actual 
selection of most persons holding national offices within 
their States, 
As we have seen (§§ 228, 229), treaties are made by the 
President through the Department of State, but they do not 
take effect until approved by two thirds of the Senate. 
The Senate is a real power in treaty making, as it never hesi- 
tates to amend any articles or reject an entire treaty. 
When acting upon presidential appointments or discussing 
treaties, the Senate goes. into executive session, the doors 
being closed and the proceedings remaining seeret. 
Ia addition to these executive duties, the Senate has one 
of a distinetly judicial nature. When any “civil officer” 
of the United States government is impeached by the House 
of Representatives for “treason, bribery, or other high crimes, 
or misdemeanors,” the Senate sits as a court and hears the 
testimony for and against the official. No official can be 
convicted except by a vote of two thirds of all the senators 
present, and conviction carries with it only removal from 
office and disability to hold any other office under the 
United States, but the person may then be tried for crime 
like any other individual. Although the framers of the 
Constitution were sincere in their belief that impeachment 
could be relied upon as a valuable check upon public serv- 
apts, the method has been used but seven times in all, 
  4This fillbustering is especially likely to come at the close of the short 
session, which must end on March 4. In the closing days of the first ses- 
sion of the LX Congress, however, one of the opposition senators spoke 
eighteen hours.

with only two convictions! By far the most interesting 
trial upon impeachment by the House was that of Andrew 
Johnson, President of the United States, in 1868. 
The Senate is called upon to elect.a Vice President when- 
ever the electors fail to do so. The choice is limited to the 
two persons receiving the greatest number of electoral 
votes. At least two thirds of the senators must be pres- 
ent, and the person elected must have a majority of all 
the senators, whether present or not. Only once in our 
history (1837) has it been necessary for the Senate to ballot 
for Vice President. 
Except in relation to just one subject, the Senate has the 
same powers of legislation as the House, “ All bills for 
raising revenues shall originate in the House of Representa- 
tives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amend- 
ments, as on other bills.” 
Tue House or REPRESENTATIVES 
307. General Character of the House. — The larger branch 
of Congress, called the House of Representatives, is a body 
of almost 400 members elected every two years from dis- 
tricts of nearly equal population. The representation from 
any State depends upon its population, but every State has 
at least one representative. In the making of the ordinary 
laws, the House has equal power with the Senate. Because 
it is the more popular body, it has the right to originate all 
money bills (§ 249), to elect a President in case the elec- 
toral college fails of a choice (§ 321), and to bring articles

States. Pickering, judge for New Hampshire (1804), charged with drunk- 
ennese and profanity, and Humphreys, judge for Tennessee (1862), for dis- 
loyalty.. Five others have been tried on impeachment—- Chase, justice of 
the Supreme Court (1805) ; Peck, district judge for Missouri (1830) ; John- 
son, President of the United States (1868); Belknap, Secretary of War 
(1876); and Swayne, district judge for Florida (1906) ~—all of whom were 
acquitted. In 1797 Senator Blount of Tennessee was impeached by the 
House, but the Senate decided by a vote of 15 to 11 that congressmen

of impeachment against any civil officer for treason or for 
high misdemeanors in office (§ 306). 
The number of representatives to which any State may be entitled 
is determined by the population as shown in the decennial census.! 
Congress selects some number as a ratio, and divides that number into 
the population of each State, granting the States representatives not 
only for the number given in the quotient, but for all additional 
fractions of more than one half. In 1901, this ratio was fixed at 1 to 
194,182, a ratio which possessed the merit of not decreasing the repre- 
sentation in any State, although adding 29 to the membership of the 
House, making 891 members for that body, after five were added for 
Oklahoma in 1907. 
Tf a State’s representation Is changed by any reapportionment, the 
legislature at the next session divides the State into the proper number 
of districts, each of which must, according to the congressional law, 
contain as nearly the same population as possible, and be compact and 
contiguous. This isto prevent, so far as may be, the evils of gerryman- 
dering, which unscrupulous majorities in state legislatures are willing 
to employ for their own benefit (§ 32). 
308, The Hlection of Representatives.—- Except in three 
States, the congressional elections occur on the Tuesday 
after the first Monday of November in the even-numbered 
years. The nominations of candidates are almost invari- 
ably made by conventions of delegates from the towns or 
precincts of which the district is composed. No one is 
nominated unless he is a resident of the State, at least 
twenty-five years of age, and has been a citizen of the 
United States at least seven years, for the national Consti- 
tution expressly states that these shall be the minimum. 
qualifications of representatives, 
1 Until the abolition of slavery in 1865, five slaves were counted as 
equal to three white persons for purposes of apportionment, the represen- 
tation from the South being therefore proportionally smaller before the 
Civil War than since that time. According to the XIV Amendment, any 
State which denies to any of its adult male citizens the right to vote shall 
have its representation in the House reduced in the proportion that the 
number of excluded citizens bears to the total of male citizens over twenty- 
one years of age. This provision has never been applied.
-P-A-G-E-369
_ THE HOUSES OF CONGRESS 315 
There is no national suffrage law. Those who may vote 
for members of the lower house of the state legislature may 
vote also for congressmen. This leaves the question of suf- 
frage wholly with the States, subject to the restriction of 
the XV Amendment of the United States Constitution that 
“the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not 
be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State 
on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.” 
The candidate who, upon the face of the returns, receives a plu- 
rality of the votes cast, receives a certificate of election from the gov- 
ernor of the State, and is permitted to take his seat in the House 
when that body is organized. If an unsuccessful candidate disputes 
his election, the case is carried before a House Committee on Elec- 
tions, without, however, interfering with the successful candidate’s 
tight to attend sessions and vote. A liberal sum is allowed by Con- 
gress to each of the contestants to prove his claims, and often several 
weeks elapse before all the evidence has been taken. The committee 
then reports to the House, and, quite frequently by @ party vote, the 
House decides who is entitled to the seat. 
309. The Speaker.— At the beginning of each Congress, 
the most important task of the House is to elect its Speaker. 
This officer, who presides over the deliberations of the House, 
is probably more powerful than any other person connected 
with our system of governments, with the sole exception of 
the President of the United States. He is the leader of the 
majority, and is selected by a caucus of the majority before 
Congress meets, his election in the House being therefore 
of a formal nature. His chief powers are four in number. 
(1) He appoints all of the committees and selects the chair- 
men. (2) He assigns to the different committees the bills 
which the House wishes to commit. This gives him an 
opportunity, if two chairmen desire to investigate and re- 
port upon the same bill, to select the committee most in 
sympathy with his own views. (8) He recognizes whom 
‘he pleases on the floor of the House, and in consequence 
may easily limit the debate of the opposition upon any bill Who may 
vote for

by refusing to give the floor to one of their number. The 
House has found it necessary to give the Speaker this some- 
what atbitrary authority in order to protect itself from the 
debating “filibusterer,” who can in this way be silenced 
almost as effectually as by the previous question (§ 295). 
(4) The Speaker is the chairman of the Committeé on 
Rules, the most powerful of the House committees, 
810. The Committee on Rules practically arranges the 
program of business for the House. It decides what com- 
mittee shall be allowed to report on a certain day and what 
length of time shall be given for discussing the report. By 
discriminating between the reports of committees and giv- 
ing the time of the House to those that it deems important, 
it enables the House to make headway with the vast number 
of bills reported back to it, and saves it from frittering away 
‘its time on non-essential measures. In other words, it does 
for the reports of the committees what each committee does 
with the bills assigned to it —sifts out those that need at- 
tention, and secures action upon these. 
The Committee on Rules consists of five of the ablest 
and most experienced representatives, but the real power 
of the committee rests with the Speaker and the two other 
members belonging to the dominant party, for these three 
are, to all intent and purposes, the committee. 
RELATIONS AND CHARACTERISTICS 
S11. The Senate. — Perhaps the most striking characteris- 
tics of the Senate are its permanence and its conservatism. 
Because of the method of election, at least two thirds of the 
senators are always men who have seen service. Reélec- 
tion of members is much more common than for . the lower 
house, partly because the senators are chosen by a small 
body of office holders and partly because a State loses 
greatly by changing senators. Since promotion on com- 
imittees: depends on continuity of service, the best chair-

-P-A-G-E-372
  manships:come to the members of the dominant party who 
have been longest in the Senate. Some of the Eastern States 
and some of those in the Middle West have kept the same 
senators for four or five terms. Promotion of members of 
the lower house, once very common, has been discontinued THE HOUSES OF CONGRESS 317° 
to a large extent. With the growing influence of corpora _ 
tions in our state legislatures, a larger percentage of capi- 
talists and corporation lawyers have been chosen, so that 
by many the Senate has been considered the special guardian 
of vested interests. 
The power of the Senate is augmented by its small size, 
its permanence, its lack of fierce partisanship and unity of 
interest, its special powers under the Constitution. As we 
shall notice in § 313, it more than holds its own in con- 
tests with the House, for even in bills for the raising of 
revenue, the wishes of the Senate have been dominant, as 
recent. tariffs testify. Its unwillingness to delegate the 
least iota of its power in the making of treaties has ham- 
pered the conduct of foreign affairs, but to the gain of the 
Senate. The tremendous power it has wielded by virtue 
of its right to ratify appointments has contributed much 
toward making the Senate the most powerful organ in our 
system of government. What it has gained once it does 
not lose easily, for the senators are united —they are sen- 
ators first and partisans later. 
212 The House.—The House is more representative of 
the people than the Senate has ever been. The members 
are frequently politicians who have seen service in the 
state legislatures or local governments. Even if they are 
selected for several terms, which is unusual, their average 
tenure of office will be less than the six years for which 
every senator is chosen. A representative has compara- 
tively little chance to make an impression during a single 
term of office, so greatly is power concentrated in the hands 
of the leaders. Indeed, many protest that, so far as legis- 
lation in the lower house is concerned, the “big three” of

the Committee on Rules manage everything. Because of 
its size, its delegation of work to committees, its lack 
of public debates, the House is less interesting than the 
Senate. 
The meetings of the lower house are held in a large hall 
. in the south wing of the Capitol. The desks of the mem- 
bers are arranged in semicircular form about that of the 
Speaker, the Republicans on his left and the Democrats on 
his right. When a congressman gains the floor, he may 
speak from his seat or from the space before the Speaker’s 
desk. In either case he is likely to receive scant attention, 
as the hall is almost always so noisy that difficulty is found 
in hearing any but the best speakers. Unless the subject 
is one of considerable importance, the members are quite! 
often in adjoining rooms, or, if present, are devoting their 
time to something else. For these reasons, speaking and 
debate are much less prominent in the House than in the 
Senate, where the smaller room, and the more orderly de- 
portment, give opportunities for speakers to present their 
views to advantage. 
813, The Senate and the House.— There is no important 
European State in which the two houses of the legislature 
are of equal importance. For various reasons, the lower 
and more popular branch has usually much greater actual 
influence in shaping the policy of the government. It is 
beyond our purpose at this point to investigate those rea- 
sons; but, assuming the fact that the European houses are 
unequal, we may ask whether the Senate is dominated by 
the House of Representatives or the reverse, and the actual 
position of each house. 
It is certain that neither house igs subordinate to the 
other. The chief cause of this is the separation of the ex- 
ecutive and legislative departments. In this country the 
President and his advisers are not the agents of Congress, 
but of the people directly. If they were the agents of 
Congress, they could not serve both the Senate and the
-P-A-G-E-374
THE HOUSES OF CONGRESS 319 
House; but must choose one or the other. The one that 
was chosen, or that could make itself the real power in 
making and executing law, would, of course, control the 
other. This is what has happened in England and France, 
and what has not happened in the United States. 
To-day. the Senate is, in many ways, more powerful than 
the House. This is especially due to three things: first, 
the more permanent character of the Senate; second, its 
better organization; and third, the patronage it possesses 
through the right to confirm appointments. Those who 
have noticed the work in Congress for several years cannot 
fail to be impressed with the way in which the Senate has 
gained its end, although the House seemed to have every 
advantage. The senators have been more united. They 
have' ignored or obstructed House measures time after time, 
while Senate bills have been forced through the House. In 
conference committees they have yielded less and obtained 
more than the representatives. 
314, Congress and the Other Departments,— There has 
never been very great danger that Congress would become 
subservient to either the President or the courts, for it has 
tended constantly to encroach on the spheres of those de- 
partments of the government. A vigorous executive, how- 
ever, may seek to dictate the policy to be followed by 
Congress. In a contest between the two, Congress has the 
advantage of general legislative and financial powers, besides 
the veto of the Senate on treaties and presidential appoint- 
ments. The President must depend on his veto and his 
claim that he may use his discretion in executing the laws 
that are passed, Ordinarily, when the President and Con- 
gress represent the same political party, their relations are 
cordial, and this is the case sometimes when they differ in 
their political views. 
The control of Congress over the executive departments 
which aid the President is much greater than that exer- 
cised over the chief executive. These departments are ere- Advantages,

changed at the wish of the lawmaking body. Their chief: 
dependence upon Congress in practice arises from the power 
of Congress to give or withhold the money necessary to do 
their work. Even the President may be coerced into doing 
the will of Congress in some disputed point, by the failure _ 
of Congress to. vote “supplies.” * 
The Constitution dees not provide for the organization of 
the judicial department, except te state that there shall be 
a Supreme Court. and such inferior courts as Congress shall 
establish. The structure of the national judiciary is there- 
fore arranged by congressional statutes. Themumber of the 
Supreme Court justices may be increased at any time, and 
the jurisdiction of most of the courts changed by aet of 
Congress. It is well known that Congress does not inter- 
fere with the independence of the judiciary.

Tue SELECTION oF A PRESIDENT 
316. The Selection of Delegates to a National Convention.— 
The election of a President involves three steps: the nomi- 
nation, the choice of presidential electors, which occurs in 
November of the years divisible by four, and the meeting of 
the electors to yote for President and Vice President the fol- 
lowing winter. | 
Nominations are always made by conventions composed 
of party delegates from the different States or congressional 
districts (§ 24). The time and place for holding a conven- 
tion are decided by the national committee of each party, 
which ‘instructs the different congressional districts to elect 
two delegates and two alternates who shall represent the 
Aisicts in the convention. The States are at the same 
tinfe requested to appoint four delegates at large, as repre- 
sentatives of the State, so that usually there are twice as 
many delegates as there are members of Congress, 
An effort is made, ordinarily, by the men who wish to be 
nominated for the presidency, to secure the election of 
delegates favorable to themselves, and to have the delegates 
instructed to vote for them in the national convention. For 
this reason, it may be known before the convention meets 
who will be the presidential nominee of the party. Often 
there are numerous and interesting contests between two’ 
‘delegations from different districts or States. Until the 
national convention secures the evidence regarding the facts, 
in dispute and the convention decides which delegation shall 
be seated, there is much doubt.

appointed by the national committee, the convention is 
called to order by the chairman of that committee. A tem-

  porary chairman is chosen and several committees are ap- 
pointed, each consisting of one member from each State 
selected. by that State’s delegation. One of these learns 
what delegates have been elected to the convention and 
another drafts a platform. After the committee on credentials 
has made its report, the convention must decide which of 
two contesting delegations was duly elected. It then pro- 
ceeds to hear the report of the Committee of Resolutions, 
Radical changes in the platform proposed by the committee 
are unusual, but at times, as in the consideration of the free 
silver plank in the Democratic convention in 1896, the de- 
bate has been keen and the speakers eloquent. 
When the convention has adopted a platform setting 
forth the principles of the party, the roll of the States is 
called, and nominations are then in order. Even when there 
is no doubt about which presidential candidate will be 
chosen, favorite sons of the different States are often nomi- 
nated, and receive complimentary votes on the first ballot. 
Ordinarily, from five to ten contestants enter the field for 
the prize, each of whom is nominated in laudatory speeches 
followed by prolonged applause. The nominations having 
been closed, the roll of the States is called again, and the 
chairman of each delegation announces its vote. If any.

Democratic convention — one of the managers for a defeated. 
candidate immediately moves the nomination be made unan- 
imous. This is almost invariably done. ‘Usually several 
ballots are taken, and at times the voting is very much pro- 
Tonged, as in the Whig convention of 1852, in which fifty- 
three ballots were necessary, or in the Republican conven- 
tion of 1880, which nominated James A. Garfield on the 
thirty-sixth ballot. Occasionally, on the other hand, candi- 
dates are nominated by acclamation without going through 
the customary forms. 
After selecting the candidate for President, the convention 
proceeds to choose a nominee for Vice President. As the The

position is one of more honor than power, it is not. often 
desired by men of the greatest ability. Itis given usually 
to a leader of some minor faction of the party, or to a poli- 
tician whose State is located some distance from that of the 
presidential nominee. In either case it would give strength 
to the “ticket.” Unsuccessful candidates for the presiden- 
tial nomination are rarely or never chosen. ’ 
$18.. The Qualifications of Candidates. — There are two classes 
of qualifications required of every candidate nominated for the presi- 
dency : the first constitutional, the second practical. (1) The Consti- 
tution does not allow any person to hold the office of President or 
Vice President, unless he is a native-born American at least thirty-five 
years of age, and has been a resident within the United States fourteen 
years, The two officials are expected also to be citizens of’ different 
States. (2) The convention, while not ignoring these qualifications, 
pays much more attention to the availability of a candidate, selecting 
she man who will be most Hkely to win. On this account, statesmen 
whose long public service may have been of great value, but who have 
nade enemies, are obliged to give place tonewer men whose careers are 
‘ess well known, and, therefore, less subject to attack. Candidates have, 
in fact, been selected chiefly because they stood the best chance of car- 
tying some doubtful State, so that frequently considerations which 
should be of minor importance play a great part in the nomination. 
Whenever a convention fails to select a candidate at first, the coveted 
honor frequently goes to some one who had scarcely been mentioned 
for the place—to a ‘+ dark horse,’? as such an eleventh-hour candidate 
is called. 
319, Campaign and lection. — After the candidates for 
the presidency have been notified of their nomination, and 
have sent in their letters of acceptance defining their posi- 
tion upon public questions, the campaign may be said to 
have begun. Its close is marked only by the November elec- 
tion, interest and excitement constantly growing until the 
result is.known. During these three or four months, busi- 
ness becomes less active, and each party organizes its forces 
ascarefully as possible. The great burden of the campaign 
ig borne by the permanent committees of the political par-

the Tuesday after the first Monday of November in 
leap year, the voters go to the polls and cast their 
ballots, not for the candidates for President and Vice Presi- 
dent, but for electors who will later vote for these persons. 
State is entitled to as many electors in the “college” 
whieh elects the President as it has senators and represent- 
    equisite number of electors, and has placed their names 
uptia the official ballot (§ 29).

whe would not be allowed to do so in others. In fact, there is nothing 
-dn the Dnited States Constitution to prevent a State’s leaving the ap- 
  Pointment of its electors to the legislature, as all of them did formerly. 
Ot two electors at large may be chosen from the whole State, while the 
others are elected in the different congressional districts. It is well to 
. beat in mind, however, that at present custom and public opinion 
make popular election of electors compulsory, and that the United 
States Constitution by the Fifteenth Amendment does not permit a 
Staté to abridge the right of citizens of the United States to vote on 
account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,

another by messenger, to the president of the Senate, who opens these 
ballots before the assembled senators and representatives on the second 
Wednesday of February. The announcement on this occasion defi- 
nitely concludes the election of the President, unless no one has 
received a majority of all the electoral votes. 
The result in one very interesting and exciting election, that of 
1876-1877, hinged upon the counting of several disputed electoral 
votes, The Republican candidates, Hayes and Wheeler, had 185 
votes, 21 of which were contested, while the Democratic. nominees, 
‘Tilden and Hendricks, received 184 that were not in doubt, The 21 
Democratic electors who claimed to have been chosen, insisted upon 
voting for their party’s candidates, and the delicate question of which 
had actually been elected was at last referred to an Electoral Com- 
mission of five senators, five representatives, and ‘five Justices of the 
Supreme Court. The decision of this commission, giving Hayes and 
Wheeler all 21 of the votes in dispute, was accepted as final by both 
candidates and by the parties they represented. 
In 1887, Congress passed the Electoral Count Bill, which provides 
that when two sets of Slectoral votes are cast in any State, the set shall 
‘be counted which beara the signature of the state executive or which 
has been declared legal by the state courts. If the State fails to de- 
cide the question, the votes must be discarded unless both houses of 
Congress can agree upon the set to be accepted. 
321. Hlection by the House of* Representatives — When the 
electoral. college fails to choose the President, the House of Represent- 
atives proceeds to elect one from the three candidates who stood 
highest on the list of the electors. ‘The vote is then taken by States, 
each State having one vote, but members must be present from two 
thirds of the States, and a majority of all the States is necessary t0 a 
choice, The failure of the college to elect a Vice President leaves the 
selection of that official with the Senate. From the two candidates 
who have the greatest number of electoral votes, one is chosen by a 
majority of all the senators, at least two thirds being present. 
In the election of 1800 the electors did not designate whether the can- 
didates voted for were nominees for the presidency or vice presidency ; 
they merely cast two ballots. As Jefferson and Burr each had seventy- 
‘three votes, the House was obliged to select one of the two. Jefferson 
_ ‘was chosen only after thirty-six ballots. The Twelfth Amendment was 
adopted in 1804, which changed the method in certain particulars, and 
made it Decessary for the electors to designate the office of each candi- 
« date. 
In the election of 1824, there were four men who received votes in the /

,- Jackson had ninety-nine, Adams eighty-four, Crawford forty- 
ind Clay thirty-seven. The choice was limited to the first three, 
aud Clay held views similar to those of Adams, by counting the 
votes of their followers, Adams was elected by the House without 
difficulty. It will easily be perceived that the failure of the 
college to elect cannot recur under the present Constitution, unless 
there: are more than two great parties, or during the reorganization 
of. parties. 
~The Constitutional Convention, after considering many ways of 
selecting the President, finally decided to leave the choice with electors 
chosen by the States in the way prescribed by each. These electors, 
48 stated above, were equal in number to the representatives and sena- 
tofa from the States, and were, at the first, usually themselves elected 
by the state legislatures. It was the intention to name the best men 
possible, and permit them to-use their own judgment in the selection 
of the executive. Even before 1801, the electors had become a mere 
cog in the political machine, registering the popular will. 
322. The Inauguration of a President occurs on the 4th 
of: March following his election, It is one of the most 
prominent social events connected with the life of the

impossibility for any one to break the « third-ten tradi-

There has recently been quite a little discussio1 
tering the term of office, going back to the six or seven years 
preferred by the convention at first,and not all 
President to be reélected. The reasons for this 
are found in the objections to the exciting campaign’ 
four years, and to the bad effect which a desire to:remain in 
office has upon a President’s policy during the lasttwo years 
of the first term. There can be no doubt that these; objec- 
tions are well grounded. Yet there is much to be. said on 
the other side. Four years have been all too long for some 
of the Presidents we have had. Six years.would mean’ no 
teéligibility, so that a satisfactory President could not be 
retained. Or if he might be elected again, he would have a 
stronger hold upon the patronage, which always plays'a part 
in elections, and would pander still more to populaztpreju- 
-dices, as reélection would be more difficult if the term were 
six years. 
The salary of the President was at first $25, 000 a year. 
In 1873 it was raised to $50,000, and in 1909 to $75,000. 
In. addition, the executive mansion known as the White 
House is placed at the disposal of the President, and the 
government pays most of the expenses incurred in the 
performance of diplomatic and social duties, aggregating 
about $150,000 a year.

ings connected with the selection and installation of the Pres- 
ident, the Vice President plays a very minor réle.. Chosen

ing the inauguration. He presides over the deliberations 
of the Senate, but he is not a member of that august as- 
sembly. _He cannot appoint its committees, neither can he 
influence its-actions except through the force of his person- 
ality. Were it not necessary to have some popular repre- 
sentative who may take the place of the President if the 
presidency should become vacant for any reason, the Vice © 
President would be a very superfluous national official. But, 
as five Vice Presidents have been called upon to assume 
presidential duties, the value of the office is apparent. 
In case both President and Vice President die during the 
term for which they were elected, the office of President 
will be filled by the members of the Cabinet, in the following 
order: Secretary of State, Secretary of the Treasury, Secre- 
tary of War, Attorney-general, Postmaster-general, Secretary 
of the Navy, Secretary of the Interior. Previous to 1886, 
when the present law was passed, the president pro tempore 
of the Senate and the Speaker of the House would have suc- 
ceeded to the presidency had that office become vacant. 
The chief objection to the older law was the possibility of 
having as President a man whose policy was the exact’ op- 
posite of the former chief executive.

law is ordinarily a peaceful process in which the executive 
officers deal directly with individuals. Occasionally, per- 
sons may break a national law, or openly resist the execu- 
tion of a particular act. It is then necessary for the 
executive officials to arrest the offenders, and secure their 
conviction by the courts and subsequent’ punishment. If

the resistance is active and widespread, the President. may 
find it necessary to use the regular army or the militia to 
suppress riots. This can be done very effectually, because 
the President is both the chief executive and the commander-in- 
chief of the army. On several occasions the regular troops 
have been called out to protect the mails and interstate com- 
merce.! Especially during the great railway strikes of 1877 
and 1894, the arrival of the United States troops at the 
scene of disorder had a very wholesome effect upon the riot- 
ers, with whom in some instances the local authorities were 
unable to cope successfully. 
The real military power of the President can be exercised 
only in case of actual war. Theoretically, an army can -be 
raised and war actually declared by Congress alone (§ 237), 
but as military commander-in-chief the President may really 
begin war, and Congress will then have no alternative but 
to vote men and money for carrying it on, or risk loss of 
national prestige by an unseemly withdrawal from hostili- _ 
ties. In the prosecution of a war a President may become — 
a military dictator, continuing to increase his power until 
within vast territories there is no government except that 
under martial law. During the Civil War, for example, the 
President, by virtue of his position as military commander, 
suspended the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in a 
large part of the North, and issued the Emancipation Proc- 
lamation, freeing the slaves in the States then in insurrec- 
tion. During that struggle, according to Mr. James Bryce, 
« Abraham Lincoln wieldgd more authority than any single 
Englishman has done since Oliver Cromwell.” . 
$26. The Power of Appointment.—The President has the 
right to appoint “with the advice and consent of the Senate” 
all ministers to foreign countries, consuls, national judges, — 
and all other United States officials and employees whose

THE PRESIDENT 333 
  appointment is not left to heads of departments or the Civil 
Service Commission. As a matter of fact, the President 
‘names persons for only the most important positions, in- 
eluding those abroad, the chief places in Washington, collect- 
orships throughout the United States, and first-, second-, and 
third-class postmasterships--in all something over eight 
thousand offices. This power of appointment is one of the 
most valuable given the President, although it undoubtedly 
causes him very great annoyance. The throngs of office 
.seekerg have made the life of many a President a burden, 
and an unwise or unpopular appointment often alienates 
large numbers of a President’s supporters. 
The practical working of the system leaves the President 
most of the discomforts, with only a fair share of the bene- 
fits; that accompany the right to select subordinates. This 
is caused by the necessity of consulting the Senate in mak- 
ing. appointments. The senators who belong to the same 
party as the President insist that their wishes be respected 
when any appointments are made to offices situated within 
their States. Ifthe President does not nominate the man 
selected by a senator or choose one from two or three whom 
the senator names, his appointment is likely to be rejected 
in executive session. The Senate upholds the right of a 
senator to make these selections, and each senator is accus- 
tomed to vote for any appointment made by another senator, 
a practice called senatorial courtesy. Appointments of 
this character are in reality made not so much with the con- 
sent of the Senate as upon its advige. The President is really 
Free to consult his own wishes in making but a small proportion 
of his appointments, the chief of which are to Cabinet positions 
and foreign offices. The general system of appointment, it 
can readily be seen, leaves to the Senate the lion’s share of 
national patronage. 
Minor appointments were formerly left entirely to the heads of 
bureaus or departments, who were in turn appointees of the President. 
Since 1883 a constantly increasing percentage of these employees have Constitu-

Messages. years officials could be removed only with the consent of the 
Senate. Having so much influence in appointments, the 
Senate would naturally wish to be consulted in removals es 
well. The First Congress, however, passed a resolution 
which declared that the President was not obliged to obtain 
theconsentof theSenate. This practice remained unchanged 
until, in 1867, Congress passed the famous Tenure of Office 
Act, requiring the indorsement of the Senate for both. re- 
movals and appointments. In 1887 this law was repealed 
and the power again left to the President alone. When an 
official resigns or is removed during a recess of the Senate, 
his successor may hold office without confirmation until the 
close of the next session of Congress. 
328, Legislative Powers.—The President may exert a 
very powerful influence upon the actions of Congress through 
his right to veto bills, to call special sessions, and to adjourn 
Congress when the houses fail to agree upon a date. Some- 
times he also succeeds in persuading the national legislature 
tocarry out his policy by sending regular and special messages. 
The President’s right to veto bills (§ 301) gives him more 
influence over Congress than any of his other legislative 
powers. Most; Presidents have, however, used the veto spar- 
ingly, and some not at all. The proportion of bills passed 
over vetoes has been remarkably small, for the congressmen. 
have rarely failed to be impressed by the reasons given for 
executive disapproval, and a two-thirds majomty ean be 
obtained only under exceptional circumstances.

upon. legislation is marked and immediate; but with special 
messages, it is the pressure of public opinion, rather than 
‘the power of the President, that leads to favorable action.

  CHAPTER XXVI 
‘ THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS 
Tun Presipent’s CaBrnet 
330. Introductory. Although the power of our national 
executive belongs almost exclusively to the President, the 
administration of its business remains with the different ea- 
ecutive départments. At present there are nine of these —the 
Department of State, the Treasury, War, Navy, Post Office, 
Interior, Justice, Agriculture,and Commerce. The heads of 
these departments, usually called secretaries are’ selected 
by the President and are personally responsible to him. 
Collectively, they form an advisory body called the Cabinet, 
. which assists him in fotming and executing any policy in 
which the entire Administration is interested. All questions 
of moment are discussed in Cabinet meetings, held at the — 
White House twice a week, but the President is in no wise 
bound to follow the advice of his Cabinet, and may act in 
opposition to the wishes of all’the secretaries. Much more 
” frequently, of course, the President and his associates hold: 
identical views upon public questions, yet we must not for- 
get that in the last analysis the policy of an Administration 
is the. policy of the President and. not that of the Cabinet. 
_ .~ Formerly, unsuccessful candidates for the presidency were often 
chosen for Cabinet positions, £.g. President Lincoln appointed William. 
H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, and Simon Cameron, all of whom had 
- been political rivals, to the three most important positions in his Cabi- 
net: This custom has fallen into disuse, and recent Presidents have 
usually. selected business meri for the business departments, and promi-

   nent ‘ersywho may have taken no active part in politics, for the other 
«°. The newer practice has given satisfaction, for the adminis- 
ork of the executive departments was never more effectively 
perfo than it is to-day. For these positions, the compensation is 
inadequate, being but $12,000 per year. 
331. Hxecutive and Legislative. — In considering the 
powers of Congress, we noticed how closely the administra- 
ion of law is related to legislation.! .In fact, a task which 
in one case is performed by Congress may be left in another 
to Cabinet officers, who prescribe the work to be done and 
the methods to be employed. This interrelation of legisla- 
tive.and executive duties has produced in England and some 
other:European countries a more or less complete union of 
these. branches of government, In Great Britain, for ex- 
ample, the executive department is the Cabinet, which is in 
realitya committee of Parliament. This Cabinet not only 
carries out the laws passed by Parliament, but it introduces 
all.important bills. Moreover, when its policy is no longer 
approved by the House of Commons, the more powerful 
chamber, the Cabinet is obliged to resign or call a new 
election for members of Parliament. This system insures 
responsibility and prevents unnecessary friction between the 
legislative and executive departments. For these reasons it 
hasbeen highly recommended as suitable for this country» 
although our preference for a separation of the three great 
departments of government makes its adoption unlikely, and, 
inthe opinion of most statesmen and students, unwise. 
The very separation of the departments is usually considered 
one-of the wisest political devices adopted by our fore- 
fathers, and, although it has given us perhaps a less efficient 
government than that of England, it has probably been the 
safest and most satisfactory government we could have 
had. .

comparatively simple and satisfactory. Congress organizes 
and has general oversight of the departments and their 
bureaus, while the secretaries are given a considerable 
amount of discretion in applying the laws whose administra- 
tion belongs to them. Congress may hamper the work. of any 
department, however, by a failure to make needed reforms 
or vote sufficient money. In each house there are appropri- 
ation committees whose especial duty is to examine the 
estimates sent in by the departments which they supervise. 
These committees, in a sense, form a connecting link between 
the departments and Congress. Toa large degree, harmo- 
nious relations between the houses and the executive officials 
depend upon them, for they may prevent successful admin- 
' istration or required improvements. 
The secretaries can influence Congress through their annual 
reports, and by personal appeals to leaders and to the chair- 
men of the committees which look after their departments. 
It has been proposed that members of the Cabinet should 
have seats in Congress with the right of speaking though not 
of voting, but the suggestion has not met with favor. Nev- 
ertheless, the heads of the executive departments have ex- 
erted a marked influence upon the important laws relating to 
their departments. For instance, during recent years the 
Secretary of War has been able to obtain colonial and mili- 
tary legislation that has followed the suggestions of his 
annual report to quite an extent, and the Secretary of the 
Treasury has many times possessed a similar influence 
(§ 336). 
$38. Discretionary Power of the Secretaries. A great 
deal of distretion is permitted by Congress or is exercised 
by a determined secretary in administering the work assigned 
to his department. This is due to the importance of the 
tasks performed by the heads of departments rather than 
the willingness of Congress to give the secretaries a free 
hand, for our scheme of government has been designed from 
colonial days to prevent the exercise of arbitrary power by

ahy-executive official. This idea has been carried so far 
‘ mn the President would have been hampered in the 
ise of his powers, were his duties not of such a 
x that he is really a ruler and not simply a figure- 
The Department of State offers the best example of dis- 
. cretionary power exercised by a secretary, for Congress has 
“no-gontrol over diplomatic relations, and the President, by 
custom; usually leaves the negotiation of treaties and other 
foreign affairs wholly to the Secretary of State. The same 
is true of the Secretaries of War and the Navy in time of 
wat. Although Congress declares war and raises armies 
after’ war has been declared, the Secretaries control the 
“movements of the military and naval forces, even when 
Congress objects to the war policy that is followed. Many 
historical examples of the great discretionary power of the 
Secretary of the Treasury might be cited, from the days when 
Secretary Hamilton in 1790 formulated and secured a finan- 
cial policy for the new republis to recent years in which 
secretaries have decided questicns cf vast magnitude in 
determining whether bonds or notes redeemable in “coin” 
should be paid in gold or silver. The Secretary of the In- 
terior has wielded vast power in deciding land questions 
involving millions of dollars, in selecting forest reserves? 
(§ 278) or sites for the huge dams constructed by the rec-

control of most of the administrative duties belonging to 
each department is of necessity left entirely with its secre- 
tary, because such duties deal largely with matters of detail.

cipal: duties relate to the negotiation of treaties (§ 228), 
which are left almost exclusively in his charge. His for- 
eign: policy is likely to become that of the President, and 
the guecess of the government in its dealings with other 
nations depends to a large degree upon his wisdom and 
skill. Newly appointed foreign 
representatives are met by the 
‘Secretary of State and presented 
by him to the President, all 
business with them being done 
through him (§ 230). But his 
time and that of his associates 
is devoted to many matters of 
routine. The entire consular 
system (§ 235) is under his su- 
pervision. He is intrusted with 
the keeping of the laws of the 
United States, sending certified copies of all, as they are 
enacted, to the governors of the States. He affixes the 
great-seal to civil commissions of officers appointed by the 
President, issues proclamations when amendments to the 
Constitution are adopted, and often drafts the Thanksgiving 
proclamation and other proclamations made by the Presi- 
dent.

leaders rather than by congressmen. During Washington’s 
administration, Secretary Hamilton’s suggestion regarding 
the different sources of revenue and the methods to be used 
in collecting or disbursing money, were accepted with com- 
paratively little change. While no later secretary has so 
completely molded Congress to his own views, many have 
been able to carry out their plans, as in the creation of a 
national banking system (§ 257). 
The discretion which a secretary is allowed to use in the 
management of the finances gives him a considerable degree 
of authority. He has charge of the collection and disburse- 
ment of more than a billion dollars a year, and is able to de- 
cide the amount of money that shall be coined from different 
metals unless the laws are specific. He may also influence 
Congress greatly at present through the suggestions made 
in his annual report for the improvement of the revenue sys- 
tem, the support of the public credit, or the adoption of more 
satisfactory methods, This influence is increased through 
the letter which he submits to Congress (§ 250), giving his 
estimate of the receipts and expenditures for the following 
year. 
337, The Interior Department. —“ The Interior Department

mitted to it, one-of the. greatest of the executive departments, 
Perhaps no one of the secretaries, unless it be the Secretary 
of the Treasury, is so pressed and cumbered with business 
as the Secretary of the Interior. His work is not single, as 
in most of the departments, but diverse and multifarious ; 
and only a strong and versatile man can conduct it success- 
fully. The Secretary must pass finally in the department 
upon questions of patent law, pension law, land law, mining 
law, the construction of Indian treaties, and many other 
questions calling for legal knowledge, if the judgment of the 
Secretary is to be of any value. There is an assistant 
attorney-general assigned to the department, and the Secre- 
tary may call upon the Attorney-general for his opinion

all matters pertaining to education are left with the States, the 
mnissioner of Hducation confines his labors to the gathering of statis- 
information, the making of reports, and suggestions. His principal 
is to bring about uniformity of the highest degree in the schools 
the land. The Commissioner of Pensions supervises the administra- 
‘of the pension laws (§ 242), and examines and passes upon all 
tions: made by claimants for pensions, All interests of the gov- 
‘ernment relating to transcontinental railways are in charge of the 
4 ioner of Railways. The Director of the Geological Survey 
vestigates and reports upon the character and natural resources of 
within the United States. The administration of the land laws, 
dding surveys of the public domain, and the distribution of farms 
lers under the Homestead Act (§§ 275-276) is left with the Com- 
srissioner of the General Land Office. The Reclamation serviceselects 
aa to-be reclaimed, and constructs dame to hold the water used for

Commissioner of Patents, and all Indian affairs (§ 292) are super- 
by the Indian Commissioner. 
The Secretary of War,! although not often a military officer, 
real commander of the army, supervising its organization, equip- 
and movements. In this work he acts for the President, who is 
Mander-in-chief, and he is aided by several officers, who, collec- 
'y With the commanding general of the army, form ‘the General

in the most important matters.t 
339. The Secretary of the Navy bears much the same relation to 
the President as does the Secretary of War, being in fact as well.as in 
_theory the head of his department. He is assisted by a General Board, 
which corresponds in part to the General Staff, although less perfectly 
organized at the present time (1908).- Perhaps the most important of 
the bureaus is that of Construction and Repair, which is wholly re- 
sponsible for the plans of any vessel and the stability of all vessels 
built under its directions. The number and size of the guns a warship 
sball carry and the thickness of the armor for the turrets and exposed 
parts of the hulls are determined by the Bureau of Ordnance in coépera- 
tion with that of Construction and Repair. Each of the other bureaus 
has.a very important and valuable work, though of less general interest. 
‘The department has charge of a naval observatory at Washington and 
of the Annapolis Academy (§ 240). 
340. The Department of Justice was not organized as aseparate 
department until 1870, athough the Attorney-general has always: been 
a Cabinet-officer.. The direct duties of the Attorney-general and his 
subordinates are to advise the President and the executive officials re- 
garding legal questions that arise, supervise the actions of the district 
attorneys and marshals (§ 846), and conduct suits to which the United 
States is a party when tried in the higher courts. Special assistants 
have taken charge of the large number of prosecutions made by the 
overnment against monopolistic corporations. Two solicitors advise 
be officials of the Treasury in connection with the questions involved 
no the collection of the cnstoms and internal revenue, another is con- 
~Uited by the Department of State upon difficult points of international 
law. ‘Two of the assistant attorney-generals devote all their time to 
legal questions connected with the Post Office and Interior Depart- 
ments, the others and the Solicitor General being concerned with more 
general duties. 
1. Ibe Department of Commerce is composed of a large num- 
‘ber of bureaus formerly connected with other departments, especially 
  the ‘Treasury. Among other duties, the heads of these bureaus have 
        large areas within: the United States or belonging to it are under 
- snilitnry government, as was the case immediately after the Civil War and _ 
fie: Spanish-American War, the Secretary becomes an administrative 
official of very. great {nifluence.

The Bureau of Labor gathers information from all parts of the 
country on the hours of labor, the wages paid in different lines of em- 
ployment, and the general labor conditions in various sections. Cor- 
porations which do interstate business are investigated by the Bureau. 
-of.Corporations, which has the right to publish any information ob. 
tained (§ 264). The aim of the Bureau of Manufactures is to aid 
American manufacturing industries, especially through the develop- 
ment of foreign and domestic markets, by gathering and publishing 
information, and “by such other methods and means as may be 
prescribed by the Secretary, or provided by law.” 
The chief task of the Census Bureau consists in gathering, compiling, 
and publishing every ten years, and in some instances every five years, 
‘statistics upon population, agriculture, vital statistics, and manufac- 
tures. .This work must be completed within two years. The remain- 
ing eight years are devoted to collecting information on special classes, 
taxation, transportation, and other subjects. The forces employed in 
the Census Bureau vary greatly. During June of the census year 
“proper, nearly 50,000 enumerations are engaged under the direction of 
about 300 supervisors, who have charge of districts covering, on the 
ayerage, the same area as a congressional district. Many expert ac- 
countants are occupied permanently with the publication of the reports

those of animal industry (§ 287), and chemistry (§ 288), through the

- In addition to these nine departments, there are commissions which 
are not connected with any department. These are the Interstate 
“Commerce Commission (§ 262), the Civil Service Commission (§ 44), 
‘the Smithsonian Institution, and the International Bureau of Ameri- 
ean Republics. Avery useful work is performed by the Congressional 
|. Isbrary (§ 298), and by the Public Printing Office. In the latter,

are the Oficial Records of the War of the Rebellion, in more than 100 
volumes, undoubtedly the largest set of works ever published, explora- 
tions in the South Seas and the West, the various reports of the Geo- 
logical Surveys, and the volumes on the censuses, that of the eleventh 
census covering 29 quarto volumes. "Bach year the office prints not 
only the records of Congress, but more than 100 separate reports of 
the executive departments and their bureaus. Of the Year Book of 
the Department of Agriculture alone, 500,000 copies are published. .

Const?l 
Law, 30-43, the Constitution, the national laws, or treaties. For this- 
reason, the Supreme Court is the jinal interpreter of the Con- 
stitution of the United States; that is, it decides what the 
meaning of any particular clause or section may be. The 
significance of the statement may not be at once apparent. 
We must remember that our national government derives 
its authority from the people through the Constitution and 
the Constitution alone. The Constitution enumerates the 
general powers to be exercised by the national government, 
and, in doing this, separates the sphere of the States (§ 215) 
om that of the Nation (§ 195). The boundary.line be- 
veen these two spheres of activity is of necessity some- 
hat indefinite, but as final interpreter of the Constitution, 
e Supreme Court has the power to determine the exact loca- 
m of this line in regard to any subject brought before it. 
-oreover, it may permit the national government “to use 
implied powers,” which supplement those enumerated in: 
1e Constitution, but which do not infringe upon the rights 
f the State.

‘ich the case is concerned, the law is declared con- 
stitritional. If Congress has exceeded its powers, the law is 
set aside as null and void. The Supreme Court, to which 
cases-involving the Constitution are appealed, is thus en- 
abled. on. the one hand to extend the power of Congress 
within reasonable limits, and to prevent that body from 
usurping the functions of the other departments of the 
national government and of the States.   
In deciding whether a law is adverse to the Constitution, the courts 
are accustomed to observe certain rules and customs. Among these 
may be mentioned: (1) No important case involving the Constitution 
is considered except by a full court. (2) No law is declared unconsti- 
tutional. unless it is clearly in opposition to the Constitution, (8) To 
find the meaning of a particular clause, the meaning of the Constitu- 
tion asa whole is usually taken into consideration. (4) Laws which 
violate general principles of liberty are not on that account declared 
null and void. (5) Statutes may be held to be unconstitutional in 
part, the validity of the remainder being affirmed. 
a45, ‘The Relation of National to State Courts. — All cases 
involying state law only are always tried in state tribunals. 
Cases involving national law are tried usually in national 
courts, but those dealing with a few subjects, such as postal 
matters, may be tried in either state courts or those of the 
Nation, as the plaintiff may prefer. In these cases the 
final decision rests with the highest national court. By far 
the larger number of cases of this kind, which are begun in 
state courts, deal with state laws supposed to involve the 
United States Constitution or laws. If the state court 
decides that the state law is in opposition to national law, 
its decision is final. If it thinks there is no conflict be-_ 
tween the two and that therefore the state law is valid, the Cases

case must be carried to the Supreme Court of the United 
States. In fact, in all instances, we. may say that when a 
State decides in favor of the United States laws or Consti- 
tution, its decision does not need to be reviewed by the 
Supreme Court. In this respect, the state courts have been 
made real parts of the national judiciary, a fact which illus- 
trates the real unity of the national and state systems of 
government (§§ 219-221). 
346, National Courts: Judges and Jurisdiction. — Accord- 
ing to the Constitution there shall be one Supreme Court and 
as many inferior courts as. Congress may establish, At 
present there are four series of courts——the Supreme Court, 
which always mects in Washington, nine Circuit Courts of 
Appeals, nine Circuit Courts with twenty-nine judges, and 
ninety-two District Courts. 
The judges of all these courts are appointed for good be- 
havior by the President with the consent of the Senate, They 
may be removed only on impeachment in the House of Rep- 
resentatives and conviction by two thirds of the senators. 
For their services they are paid small salaries which may 
be increased, but not diminished, during their term of office? 
Those who have served at least ten years are permitted to 
retire at the age of seventy, and continue to draw full 
pay. Because of the honor connected with a judgeship, our 
national judges have been men of exceptional ability, and 
our Supreme Court especially has enjoyed a world-wide 
reputation for wisdom and impartiality. 
The Constitution provides for the different kinds of cases that may 
be tried in United States couris. ‘The judicial power shall extend 
to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws 
of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under 
their authority ;-—-to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public min-

eixenit judges at $7000, and of the district judges at $6000 each.

3497, The Supreme Court.— The Supreme Court consists of one 
chief justice and eight associate justices,1 appointed by the Presi- 
dent for life. The court holds its regular session in Washington? 
beginning in October, and the. presence of six justices is necessary 
before-a decision is rendered. These decisions are written by the dif- 
ferent judges to whom particular cases are assigned by the chief justice 
after discussion by the different members of the court, The opinion 
is then read in the presence of the others, a vote is taken, and, if ac- 
cepted by the majority, it becomes the decision of the court, Dis- 
senting opinions are often given by the minority in suits involving 
important principles, 
In 1908 the court was composed as follows : —

Associate Justice John M. Harlan (Ky.) . .| Sixth 1877

  The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is of two kinds, original and 
Gppellate. The cases which may be tried originally in the Supreme 
1Until 1807 the court had but five associate Justices. From 1807 to 1837 
the number was six; after 1837, eight. In 1863 it was increased to nine; 
bat in 1866, in order to prevent President Johnson from making appoint- 
ments, it was practically reduced to six. Since 1869 there have been eight 
‘associates of the chief justice. . 
2Each justice of the Supreme Court is also assigned to a particular cir- 
cuit, in which he is obliged by law to hold court at least once in two years. 
‘He is likely to be called upon for service in the Circuit Court of Appeals 
In his cireuit, so his position is no sinecure.

Court are those “affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and 
consuls, and those in which a State shall be a party.’’ The appellate 
jurisdiction of the court may extend to all other cases, but to.do this 
would lead to a needless increase of its business. Cases which are 
now appealed may be divided into three classes, according to the 
“ courts from which appealed. 
Glrenit 348. Inferior Courts.1—The Circuit Courts of Appeals were 
Gourts of —_ created in 1891 for the purpose of relieving the Supreme Court of most 
Appeals. of its appellate business. There are as many courts as there are 
fe circuits; that is, nine, and each is composed of three persons, the 
“Gauss, Am. Supreme Court justice of that circuit and two of the regular circuit 
Gov't, judges, or possibly district judges. Any two of these may hold court 
at any time, but the places are designated by law. All cases appealed 
from the district or circuit courts, and not taken directly to the 
Supreme Court, are reviewed in these courts. The decision of the 
courts is final in some of these cases, as in those involving criminal, 
admiralty, revenue, and patent law, but in all others the case may © 
be carried to the Supreme Court, either by appeal or on writ of 
error.? . 
For each of the nine circuits either two, three, or four circuit judges 
are appointed who may hold court separately or together. Before 1804 
the courts possessed both original and appellate jurisdiction, but by the 
judiciary law of that year, when the whole system was reorganized, 
only original jurisdiction was left. Important civil suits involving two 
thousand dollars or more which arise under the Constitution, the 
statutes, or the treaties, or which involve the United States, any State, 
or citizens of different States, as well as criminal cases of magnitude, 
are first tried in these courts, but may be appealed to one of the higher 
courts. . 
There are at present ninety-two District Courts in the United 
States. To each of the districts is assigned a district attorney, who represents the United States in all suits arising in the United States 
. courts held in his district, and a marshal, who executes the decisions 
‘of the sourt and who may call out a posse or ask aid from the Presi- 
- dent in performance of his duties. The jurisdiction of the court is

  2, and covers a multitude of cases from those of minor impor- 
tafiee to the final decision of prize causes. 
. Conclusion.—It is fitting that a text-book upon 
rican government should be concluded with an ac- 
of our national judiciary. Among our successful 
tical institutions, the most conspicuous is the system of 
United. States courts, which has been the special guardian of 
he Constitution. The Supreme Court, at the apex of this 
system, represents the highest type of political evolution. 
A-model of fairness, wisdom, and integrity, it is respected 
ué:home and honored throughout the entire world. It is a 
Witness to the honesty, earnestness, and intelligence of the 
American people whom it serves and a proof that govern- 
ment “of the people, by the people, and for the peaple shall 
nob perish from the earth.” ‘To its high standard our other 
governments may be unable to attain, but it will continue 
to.be their model, and its standard will remain the ideal 
of the American citizen. Decade by decade it has developed 
inthe people a more perfect type of public morality; and in 
the coming years, the lesson it has taught, that true patriot- 
ism is not selfish nor sectional, and that national success 
must depend upon our recognition of the eternal principles 
of Justice, will bring the Nation toa higher level of civic 
righteousness. Then, with even greater pride than we feel 
to-day, may each one of us utter our proud boast —“I am 
4N AmmRicAN CITIZEN.”

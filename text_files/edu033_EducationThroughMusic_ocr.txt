  EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
CHAPTER I 
PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 
AxouT one per cent of our population has a formal 
education beyond the age of fourteen.* The musical 
instruction that is given during this period is for most 
people all the training that they ever receive in the subject. 
Hence it is of the utmost importance that the little time 
given to music should be spent in the most effective way. 
This requires a consideration not merely of the musical ends 
to be reached, but of the capacity of the pupil and his 
musical needs, involving a cultivation of the desire for the 
beautiful in music, and direction for its gratification under 
the social conditions in which he lives. (Such a broad view 
of the subject demands that sound principles be followed 
and that a rational plan of presentation be employed, It 
*In 1905-06 the number of children registered as attending public 
high schools in the country at large was eighty-eight hundredths of one 
‘per cent of the total population; or, including the children studying at 
private secondary schools, over one per cent of the population was tak- 
ing secondary education. David Snedden, Charities and the Commons.

may be of help if at the outset the principles upon which the 
instruction is based be formulated, and the necessity for a 
plan of teaching presented.) 
It is not always easy to differentiate between a method 
employed, which is the way a thing is done, and the prin- 
ciple that it is intended to follow, which is a general rule of 
procedure constantly needing common sense for its ap- 
plication. 
No one way of procedure is the right way under all 
conditions; but the principles that underlie the application 
should have stability. Without this, the goal cannot be 
reached. The principles are few and explicit; they are the 
result of the experiences of many, and of the application 
of physiological-psychological lawsit ~The actual method 
pursued, however, will be determined | by the character of 
the students and the conditions under which the work is 
sone A principle requires a way, in other words, a 
me’ , for its expression, but the wise teacher knows 
very well that to confuse the two is to crystallize the 
method, from which it is but a step to dogmatism and stag- 
nation. Hence one is constantly testing principles in order 
to separate the method useful only in a given case from 
that which is always applicable. 
The principles that have controlled the presentation in 
the following chapters are: 
(x) Experience should precede formal instruction. 
(2) Where it is lacking, the teacher should supply the 
experience necessary as a basis for instruction. 
(3) The teacher should organize this experience, so that,
-P-A-G-E-7
ee 
PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 7 
while a particular effect is observed and studied, its re- 
lation to the total effect shall not be lost. 
(4) The motive or impulse in artistic education lies in 
the desire of the individual to express himself. 
(5) The purpose of education through art is to quicken 
perception, clarify feeling, and stimulate initiative for the 
beautiful. 
Of the five principles which the book emphasizes, the 
first demands experience as the prerequisite of all work. 
The second begins the teaching with management of ex- 
perience, as for instance, in the rhythmic acting in the first 
grade, or the chord formation of the sixth, so that all the 
students in a class, not merely the talented few, shall pos- 
sess the foundation experience for what is to be taught. 
The third takes the complex experiences that manifest the 
subject studied, as in this case music, and breaks them up 
by means of carefully arranged steps such as acting or 
picturing. In that way the particular experience, the 
nature of which the average student would otherwise be 
unconscious, is observed and felt, and made to form a 
basis for study, a definite object for notation. From the 
imitative song singing at the opening of the first grade work 
to the appreciation of the higher forms, the material has 
been so arranged that at every stage it shall relate to a defi- 
nite preceding experience. In this way not simply a mem- 
ory appeal will be made, but definite ideas developed, so 
vital, because of their relation to experience, that they can 
form a foundation for new ideas and through them lead to 
new experiences. This arrangement of the material with 
     
-P-A-G-E-8
8 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
  reference to experience renders it possible for the pupil to 
make a vital connection with great works of art, by means of 
which a deeper significance and an enduring worth are 
given to life. 
Thus three of the five principles formulated deal with 
experience. The fourth is closely allied, for with reference 
to it the work has been constantly planned so as to insure 
such self-activity on the part of the individual as shall 
not be vague nor haphazard, since this would vitiate the 
ideas to be developed, but definite and systematic. For 
instance, the child in connection with the song carries on 
definite activities: he steps to the rhythm; he claps for 
duration; in speed work he is obliged to grasp the phrase as 
a whole; later, he follows the separate sentences which 
make up the thought of the larger form with lines that show 
their number and relationship. In the creative work of 
song-making and in writing what he hears, the induced 
self-activity vitalizes his experience. Finally, the fifth 
step still views the subject from the pupil’s point of view; 
for it limits the field of study to that knowledge and skill 
which may be turned to practical use in the experience of 
the average man. 
Turning now to the plan of teaching employed: this 
consists in presenting the material in topics thoroughly 
~ worked out in the logical relationship of their parts and 
dictated by the experience of the pupil. This requires 
careful preparation on the part of the teacher. 
Spontaneity is often looked upon as the one ideal con- 
dition of instruction; the teacher is expected to be bub-
-P-A-G-E-9
  PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING 9 
/ bling over with enthusiasm and knowledge, ready to adapt 
herself to whatever phase of the subject the humor of her 
pupils may present. Hence the use of the words “plan of 
instruction” referring to the way the work is presented, 
and implying that something more than mere knowledge 
of the subject is necessary for the teacher, has, on some 
persons, the effect of the traditional red rag. A lesson to 
such people is like an artistic performance whose death 
knell is sounded if any regulative element is introduced. 
Yet, if we accept this conception of teaching as an artistic, 
rather than a scientific performance, owing to the personal 
and emotional elements involved, does it follow that there 
is no technique required for its realization? Not by any 
means. 
An illustration from the field of art is appropriate. 
There is no doubt that a man like Paderewski enters upon 
his career with a remarkable natural endowment, but in 
spite of this he undergoes a rigorous technical training that 
only an iron will and strong constitution could stand. Yet 
all this training is simply to enable him to interpret a 
musical passage to his audience. He practices much in 
order that he may present something effectively to others. 
A teacher who should stop simply with the acquisition of ~ 
the subject, and take no thought as to how it should be 
interpreted with.reference to the needs-of the particular 
class, would be doing the same thing that a Paderewski 
might who mentally grasped the thought of the composi- 
tion, and knew just how it should be performed, but did 
not trouble himself to learn the technique necessary for its
-P-A-G-E-10
  10 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
presentation. In other words, there is a difference between 
knowledge of a subject-and_the ability to put it before 
others. A great many people think that when an indi- 
vidual knows a subject he is prepared to teach it; but 
from the teaching point of view he is only ready to begin 
his professional preparation. His peculiar technique, that 
which justifies his being called a teacher, lies in his ability 
to impart knowledge. 
It is quite possible for a person to have a special gift for 
imparting knowledge,—a sympathetic appreciation of the 
needs of the learner, enabling him to become a brilliant 
teacher after he has learned his subject. But even under 
these conditions such a person attains his skill, not at once 
but through the opportunities he meets in teaching! 
As soon as he has finished learning his subject, a gifted 
teacher may give good lessons without any special atten- 
tion as to how he shall teach; but though he may have had 
no pedagogical training, the fact that he is gifted in this 
respect has caused him to observe and learn from his own 
skilled teachers, so that he really has had professional 
training, though not of a formal nature. While it may be 
true that the teacher, like the artist, is born and not made, 
it is equally true that, as an artist, he needs professional 
training. Those who object to the planning of instruction 
are really denying the’ value of professional training-for_ 
the teacher. 
The sche ining like that of the artist, has two 
sides; one thé/actual doing of the thing,—modeling in clay, 
painting on canvas, performing at the keyboard, actual
-P-A-G-E-11
  
PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING Ee 
teaching of children; the other, the thought, plan, prep- 
aration for action. The fascination that the sketchbooks 
of great artists, such as Beethoven or Leonardo da Vinci 
or Hawthorne have for us is that they show how these 
artists prepared for their work. 
The plan stands in the same relation to lessons given, as 
the sketchbook of the artist does to his masterpiece. The 
teacher sketches his idea of how the subject should be 
developed, changes it, emphasizes now one aspect, now 
another, viewing it in the various lights of different ap- 
proaches. He attains such a mastery over the presentation 
that he is able to play with the thing. He has developed 
a technique far beyond what is necessary: he has gained 
what the engineer calls a margin of safety. Now he comes 
to the class, not to reproduce something cut and dried, but 
to mold the minds before him through the very activity 
he draws out; like the sculptor who has a clear image he 
wishes to realize, and yet is open to every inspiration that 
= may come to him as the figure emerges from the clay. The 
plan does not tie the teacher’s hands; it frees them. It 
gives control of the situation by anticipating various 
possibilities that may occur. The planbook of the teacher 
is, then, the sketchbook of the artist. Let me not be mis- 
understood: I would not lay undue stress upon mere plan- 
ning of topics to the neglect of such experience as one gets 
by actual teaching. Preparation must go hand in hand 
with execution. To adapt a famous adage, planning with- 
out doing is, like theories without facts, vain; and doing 
without planning is, like facts without theories, futile.
-P-A-G-E-12
12 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
  While the work in the following chapter is presented in 
the form of stages and steps, implying a connected pres- 
entation of the subject under complete topics, they are 
not necessarily intended to be given in one lesson, but to be 
treated so connectedly that the whole will form a united 
impression upon the mind of the pupil. A large proportion 
of the actual lessons given will be those of review and ap- 
plication. These are left to the good judgment of the 
teacher. The greatest skill and closest thought is required 
when a new topic is being first presented. This is the 
birth of an idea in the pupil’s mind. Whether it be de- 
formed and sickly, or compact and healthy, depends largely 
on its first formation, hence the emphasis on the way the 
subjects are presented and the absence of directions for 
teview and practice, which would be necessary were the 
book a manual of teaching and not a presentation of 
principles.
-P-A-G-E-13
  CHAPTER II 
THE MUSICAL IDEA 
Tue satisfaction derived from music is more dependent 
on the way the tones are combined_and employed than on 
the tones themselves. The direct stimulus to the senses is 
of itself entirely inadequate to account for the pleasure 
music gives. WN 
A visit to a Chinese theater will convince the reader of 
the truth of this. He will find the acting intelligent, the 
color scheme effective. When the interpreter by his side 
translates the poetry it may appeal to him as good; but 
the music will be ‘sound and fury, signifying nothing.” 
Ask the interpreter what the music_means and he cannot 
put it into words. But the intelligent Ah Lee or Woo Sing 
appears to understand and enjoy it. Consider what this 
fact means. Here we have intelligent men, who in some of 
their arts are our superiors, listening with enthusiasm to 
what sounds to us like mere noise. We thus see how little 
we are affected by an appeal to the senses pure and simple. 
We do not appreciate Chinese music because we do not 
understand the principles and ideals that underlie its 
structure and interpretation. et 
Of all the arts, music is the least universally comprehen- 
13 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  14 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
sible. Painting and sculpture do not require even to be 
translated, because the objects on which the ideas of these 
arts are based are the same throughout the world. Trees, 
water, sky, and land are similar in Paris and Pekin. A 
statue representing parts of the body put together amiss 
would be as wrong in one locality as in another. Poetry 
is translatable because the ideas of which it treats are more 
or less alike in Asia and America. Human nature is prac- 
tically the same the world over. However much its man- 
ifestations may differ, there is a wonderful similarity of 
experience. Love and hate, kindness and cruelty, are com- 
mon to all dwellers on the earth. When the Chinese poet 
weaves these experiences into a drama, the ideas are in- 
telligible to the Parisian listener. For a good translation 
can bring the Chinese poet in touch with a foreign audience, 
and in spite of the difference in style any one may genuinely 
enjoy the Oriental poet’s work. As soon as the barriers of 
language are removed, the Oriental and the Occidental 
can look over the dividing walls of custom and civilization 
and appreciate each other’s art. 
/ The reason that music alone of the arts is untranslatable 
is because the elements of music, tone grouping, and the 
manner of production by means of which specific musical 
ideas are expressed, do not exist in nature, but are the 
| product of civilization and custom. Each race has its par- 
sae set of musical ideas, and the individual is familiar 
ith them because he is born into them. His mother sings 
melodies that bring smiles of pleasure to his face or soothe 
him to sleep. He hears the little songs of his brothers and
-P-A-G-E-15
THE MUSICAL IDEA 15 
  sisters. Unconsciously he learns the prevailing idiom of 
the musical language, and as soon as his faculties permit he 
begins to imitate and to produce the kind of music pre- 
vailing in his region, just as he talks French if he is born in 
Paris. Hence, when a specific piece of music is heard by 
those unfamiliar with the musical ideas which the piece 
embodies, no comprehension can take place. The design 
is not appreciated; only a more or less pleasing collection 
of sounds is heard. This is why Oriental music is incom- 
prehensible and untranslatable. 
/ Since ideas lie back of music just as they lie back of lan- 
guage, there is a similarity in the way they are acquired. 
In learning a language the child first utters incoherent 
cries and ejaculations; then he begins to use single intelli- 
gible words; then he adds more words and forms sentences, 
So with music; the child’s incoherent calls and gurgles 
give place to definite groups of tones; then he attempts to 
sing, often with no better success than is attained when he 
tries to pronounce the words he hears. This learning of 
the sounds and forms of the music idiom depends, as does 
his learning of language, on what he hears and on how 
much he tries to imitate. 
s / But the needs and wants of the child force him along 
faster in the mother tongue; he is constantly hearing it 
used, so that he has opportunity to connect the things said, 
and gains an idea of what is being talked about. If he 
is to get what he wants and be one with his fellows, he 
must talk, and talk freely. No such force impels him in 
music. The only reason a child sings is because he likes to
-P-A-G-E-16
    16 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
sing. And many a child does not have much pleasure ir 
singing; often he has not learned to control the throat so 
that he can sing what he wishes. There are people who 
cannot even hum an air or tell one tune from another; 
while, on the other hand, there is the prodigy who plays 
and even composes before he reaches his teens. 
&The sensation of pleasure or displeasure that music in- 
duces has led to the statement that music appeals directly 
to the feelings. If this were true, music would be in the 
same class with perfumes. Ifa person should smell two un- 
familiar odors, unless they were similar to some he already 
knew, so that he could say one resembled, for example, a rose 
or violet, he would be unable to describe {the difference in 
such a way as to make it clear either to hintself or to others. 
He could say that the two odors were different and that 
he liked one and disliked the other, but that would be all. 
The point is that while at first thought music seems to ap- 
peal directly to the feelings, it really does not do so, but 
reaches the feelings through ideas which 1 deal with definite 
‘forms. These ideas relate to plan and arrangement and 
to the manner of performance, showing that the emotions, 
music awakens result very largely from ideas of structure ure) 
and interpretation. 
If a person had never heard Dixie or Suwannee River, 
when the two tunes were played to him he would have 
different feelings about them; he might like one and dis- 
like the other. But, besides the difference in the degree 
of pleasure felt, he could point out a number of particulars 
in which the two differed. Even the average observer
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE MUSICAL IDEA ry 
would feel the différence between the swing of Dixie and 
that of Suwannee River. 
The fact that he could notice unlikenesses in the two 
tunes would show that there is a difference in the designs 
of which the tunes are constructed. Such differentiation 
is also impossible between odors. If all associations con- 
nected with the rose and the lily were blotted out, we could 
only say in comparing their odors that they were different. 
But if we compare the flowers themselves, we shall find 
that they present certain ideas. That is, each flower mani- 
fests itself in a certain way—the lily through its cup-shaped 
and the rose through its complex corolla. Our experience 
in observing the arrangement of petals, the color, the shape 
and the relationship of parts to a whole has produced the 
ideas rose and lily, and we are able to judge whether these 
ideas are adequately attained or not. So with the two 
tunes mentioned above. The different relationships of the 
parts to one another show different designs. We have ideas 
of them which cause us, if a part be slightly changed, to be- 
come conscious not only of the alteration, but of the nature 
of:the effect it produces. These are the ideas of structure. 
But there is another class of ideas, those pertaining to vy 
interpretation. Dixie and America might be so played 
that the listener would say one is jolly, gay, and lively; the 
other dignified and stately. This sense of difference is 
caused by the way the tunes are performed. We can 
imagine Dixie played in the solemn style of America, and 
America played in the lively way suitable for Dixie. But 
such performances would awaken feelings of incongruity. 
Music—2 | 7 
; 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  18 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
We have, then, ideas of how a tune should be performed, 
ideas arising partly from the nature of the particular tune, 
and partly from the associations connected with it. 
We have perceived how we can describe what we see in a 
rose or lily. This is due to the fact that the eye is able to 
recognize the relationship of qualities and parts to the 
whole. Thus we get not only the idea of the entire rose or 
lily, but also ideas of the component parts—stem, leaf, 
petal—that make up the complete idea, percept, or notion. 
The rose may be faded and dull, or it may be fresh and 
bright; each of these is a definite idea pertaining to the 
quality of the flower. The rose may be single or double, 
its petals may be round or oval; each of these is a definite 
idea pertaining to the structure of the flower. To be com- 
plete, the notion or idea of a flower must be a combination 
both of ideas of its structure and of ideas of its quality. 
Similarly, a piece of music presents not only the ideas 
of structure and interpretation already referred to, which 
give the notion of the piece as a whole, but these in turn 
can be analyzed into a still further group of ideas which 
we shall term constitutive, becatise every definite musical 
theme or motive and its adequate production, includes 
these essential factors. There are seven of these; four 
relating to interpretation, and three to structure. The 
four ideas upon which interpretation is dependent are: 
(x) Quality of tone, 
(2) Quantity or volume of tone, 
(3) Rate of movement, 
(4) Articulation (such as separation or union).
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE MUSICAL IDEA 19 
The three ideas essential to structure are: 
(1) sation, 
(2) Buration, 
(3) Pitch. 
The capacity to feel the effects of these seven constitu- 
tive ideas is essential to the adequate appreciation of 
music. 
In developing the consciousness of these ideas it is 
necessary to analyze them; but this, while supplying a 
‘basis, by no means accomplishes all we wish in education. 
he true science teacher attempts not only to lead the 
children to know something of anemones and buttercups, 
of butterflies and ants, but through this knowledge to 
strengthen the love for the nature life about them; the 
true teacher of English not only trains the children to 
speak and write correctly, but awakens in them a love for 
good literature. The teacher of physical training likewise 
aims not only to make the little people stronger, but to in- 
spire in them a pleasure in graceful posture and motion. 
This aspect, the love for, what is taught, while impossible 
without the knowledge of the subject—for we cannot love 
what we do not know—does not in all cases necessarily 
follow knowledge. But music teaching which does not / 
awaken this feeling of delight is a failure.
-P-A-G-E-20
  CHAPTER III 
IDEAS AS RELATED TO INTERPRETATION 
Ir is the purpose of this chapter to describe the prin- 
ciples that deal with the way music is performed, that i a 
with the interpretation of music. 
The child with a weak sense of rhythm might play Dixie, 
using a beautiful piano, but exhibiting such a lack of feel- 
ing that the performance would awaken irritation; while 
some street urchin might play the same tune on a Jew’s- 
harp with such individuality in the rendering that we 
should say with pleasure: “There is a musical youngster.” 
Although both performers presented the same structural 
form, and that produced on the piano would have great ad- 
vantage in the quality of tones, we should prefer the Jew’s- 
harp version. Our quest is to know just what it is that 
gives the preference in this instance to the poorer in- 
strument. 
Turn to the analogy of language. Listen to a school- 
boy reciting the Gettysburg speech and compare his in- 
terpretation with the declamation of a finished orator. The 
words are the same—that is, there is no difference in the 
structure—but how unlike is the effect!. The boy may have 
the better voice, yet beside the orator, his recitation of the 
a 20
-P-A-G-E-21
  IDEAS AS RELATED TO INTERPRETATION 21 
words is mechanical and full of inflections betraying a lack 
of comprehension of the thought. The most striking 
difference between the two recitations is that while the 
orator brings out the meaning of the language, and causes 
us to see even more in the words than when we read them 
ourselves, the schoolboy’s awkward presentation obscures 
rather than illuminates the thought. 
It is clear, then, that comprehension of the speech is not 
communicated simply by the accurate repetition of the 
words. The orator, a mature man, has had wide experi- 
ence; he has studied many great speeches and has learned 
to value them; he has read history and realizes wkat a 
powerful influence this particular speech had at a critical 
period in the life of the nation. All this background 
enables the orator, through inflection and tone color, to add 
an emotional value. Our preference for the orator’s in- 
terpretation of the Gettysburg speech is due, then, to his 
clear discernment of its thought, and to his power to feel 
and express its worth. This second element, though often 
spoken of as emotional and temperamental, is more than 
this. The boy’s delivery may have plenty of emotional 
color; in fact, the ludicrous character of such performances 
is very often the result of misplaced or exaggerated emo- 
tional effects. The interpretation of the speech is deter- 
mined by the character and skill of the speaker and the 
wealth or poverty of his past experience. 
Turing now to the two performances of Diwie, we see 
that the preference for the Jew’s-harp version instead of 
that of the piano did not lie in the musical idea presented,
-P-A-G-E-22
22 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
for both gave the same tune; nor in the tone employed, for 
the poorer tone was preferred; but in the way the idea was 
presented—its interpretation. The power to interpret is, 
popularly speaking, due to the inherent musical qualities 
of the Jew’s-harp player. This is but another way of 
saying that the Jew’s-harp player is more richly gifted 
or that he absorbed a large amount of the musical language 
in early childhood and often used it as a means of ex- 
pression. The street urchin could make the gay tune ex- 
press the emotion he felt, just as the statesman could 
impress his audience with the force of his own feeling for 
the speech he was reciting. 
The popular notion of the process of musical interpre- 
tation is the very reverse of what we have been describing. 
The emotional element is supposed to come first, leading 
afterwards to a discernment of the thought. But when we 
ask what it is that awakens the emotions,. unless we say 
that it is a spontaneous reaction to the sound, as is the 
sense of smell to the odor, we must admit that the emotions 
are aroused through ideas. Two steps are involved: first, 
realization of the structure of the idea presented; and sec- 
ond, appreciation of the significance of this idea or its 
interpretation, aided by previous musical experience. 
This double discernment of the musical idea and its 
value to us goes on subconsciously, for our fundamental 
musical understanding, like our grounding in language, 
takes place so early in childhood that we are not conscious 
of the processes; we are sensible only of the result. The 
more musical a person is, the more intuitive will be the
-P-A-G-E-23
  IDEAS AS RELATED TO INTERPRETATION — 23 
feeling of reaction. How common it is to hear a musician 
say: “I don’t know how I do it; I feel it so.” He does not 
realize that an intuitive reasoning is taking place which 
makes him perceive one form one way and another form 
another way. The reason for his feeling how a composition 
should be interpreted really exists, even though it is hidden 
from his conscious self, in his musical rationality. If we 
analyze the performances of musical people, we find that 
the manner of their interpretation grows in a logical way 
from the nature of the selection, and it is possible to for- 
mulate the laws that underlie the performance of a given 
work. Because the musician may be unconscious of these 
laws, it does not follow that they do not control his proc-

What method should be taken to teach the boy to deliver 
the Gettysburg speech adequately? Some instructors 
would give a training in gesture and expression of face and 
body, in the rolling of r’s and the emphasizing of final 
consonants. But such training alone would only add to 
the ludicrous effect of the recitation and make its inade- 
quacy more prominent. 
The true teacher would begin by trying to make the boy 
so thoroughly understand the thought of what he was re- 
peating that he would see the bearing of each sentence on 
this thought. Along with this training in the structure of 
the speech would go a second kind of training—in its in- 
terpretation. In order to give the boy the necessary back- 
ground, the teacher would tell him about Lincoln and the 
influence growing out of the conditions, which led to the
-P-A-G-E-24
  24 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
speech. He would be asked to study other great speakers, 
and he would gradually, as far as possible for one of his 
experience, begin to realize the force and beauty of the 
masterpiece. He would begin to value it. 
The same principle should hold true in teaching the 
effective interpretation of music. The teacher who, with- 
out reference to the significance of the ideas in the music, 
teaches what he calls expression by variation in tempo and 
emphasis, through these arbitrary changes makes only 
more obvious the lack of true discernment of the musical 
idea. A wise teacher will lead the pupil to conceive first 
what the music means as a whole. Is it a brisk winter 
song, or does it regret the passing of the flowers? From the 
thought will be decided the quality of tone to be employed: 
there must be sustained energy in one, and pensive qual- 
ity in the other. With the quality will be developed a feel- 
ing for the proper quantity: the hilarious winter song must 
have something of the shout; while the autumn song re- 
quires a subdued tone appropriate to the regret it expresses. 
There will be difference in velocity: skating, or sliding, 
or snowballing, or the scurrying of snowflakes demands a 
brisk movement of the music; while the passing away of 
summer, the disappearance of the flowers, the sleep ‘n the 
cold ground, and the drizzling rain will be expressed by a 
slower movement. Furthermore, the articulation will dif- 
fer: the zigzag motion of the skater or of the snowflake, and 
abrupt motions of the snowball require an emphasis on the 
separated or staccato effects; whereas the reverie of the au- 
tumn song will utilize sustained and well-connected words 
{

  IDEAS AS RELATED 10 INTERPRETATION — 25 
and phrases. Thus, in the attempt to express the central 
thought the pupil has gradually been made conscious of 
the means employed to express it. Through realizing 
their appropriateness in expressing the song, he has be- 
come aware of the four constitutive ideas of interpretation, 
as mentioned in Chapter II. 
(x) Quality of tone, 
(2) Quantity or intensity of tone, 
(3) Rate of movement, 
(4) Articulation (such as separation and union). 
It will be readily seen that these interpretative ideas are 
not applicable unless the structure of the song is appro- 
priate to the sentiment it expresses. But if the song be 
good the pupil, as he becomes conscious of the interpreta- 
tive ideas, grows aware of the more subtle structural ideas 
upon which the interpretation depends. As in the case of 
the Gettysburg speech, a complete presentation necessitates, 
in addition to the interpretative and structural ideas, a 
knowledge of the external associations, such as the subject, 
style, intention of the composer, and date of composition. 
This is where the individuality of the interpretative artist 
finds play. The value of the interpretation will depend 
on his skill and his appreciation of the composition. 
While the average listener is not conscious of the con- 
stitutive ideas by means of which interpretative effects are 
gained, their influence upon the complete interpretation of 
the work is shown by the unanimous appreciation given a 
really musical performance. 
It is told of an eminent concert pianist that he found his
-P-A-G-E-26
    26 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
- best critic in an acquaintance who could not even sing or 
whistle a tune correctly. Any one can easily bring to 
mind instances of the quickness with which a musically 
uncultivated audience will respond to a genuinely artistic 
performance. Though they are not able to give an ade- 
quate reason for their preference, the power of the gifted 
player or singer is instantly felt and is summed up by the 
word “musical.” This shows how universal and how 
definite are the ideas of interpretation, by means of which 
such sure verdicts are given even by nonmusical people. 
We like the way one person performs a musical work 
and dislike another’s interpretation of the same work, even 
when the performance by the latter is technically correct, 
because the interpretation of the first has appealed to the 
ideal of the beauty contained in the music, while the second 
interpretation lacked that beauty. Our ideals are the 
result of our previous musical experience, and beautiful 
performances make us conscious of them. The awak- 
ening of such consciousness is often like a further self- 
revelation and gives us a rare feeling of exaltation. Hence 
the importance of developing musical ideas. These will 
be considered in Chapter IV.
-P-A-G-E-27
  CHAPTER IV 
IDEAS AS RELATED TO STRUCTURE 
In marked contrast with the uniformity as regards in- 
terpretative ideas stand the ideas of musical structure, of 
which we shall treat in this chapter. Choice here is by no 
means so sure and definite. To illustrate this divergence, 
equally good presentations of two unlike compositions may 
be taken. Imagine two church choirs which are equally 
skilled in every way, but of which one gives historic music 
of the style of Old Hundred while the other sings the Gospel 
Hymn type. Each congregation is pleased with its own 
music. Now let these churches exchange choirs, while 
each continues to sing its own selections. The interpre- 
tative work will be equally good, but the effect on the 
audience will be very different. The first congregation will 
consider the songs of the second, vapid, silly, unchurchly, 
and impossible of conveying any spiritual meaning; while 
the second will think the music of the first dull and cold, 
without power to express spiritual fervor. This difference 
‘in preference is evidently not one of interpretation, for 
the choirs are equal in their ability to render their music 
effectively. But the content of the two kinds of music is 
totally different. They express different structural ideas 
27
-P-A-G-E-28
  28 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
which appeal, or do not appeal, to the different audiences. 
brn kind of music we like is determined by our immediate i. 
* environment, Whether we prefer the music hall type, or 
  the work of great masters depends upon which we are in 
the habit of hearing, unless we are musically gifted and 
can enter at once into the greater inheritance. 
The two recitations of the Gettysburg speech exem- 
plify the importance of interpretation. We realized the 
necessity for the speaker’s appreciation both of the speech 
and its setting. That he might recite it effectively it was 
essential for him to be able to value it. But if a speech 
lacks ideas, no amount of interpretative skill can make it 
affect us, for there is no vital meaning to express. More 
important than expression, or form, is the thought itself, 
or substance. In music, as in language, the idea is of 
supreme importance. A single tone heard by itself means 
nothing. Only the few who possess absolute pitch can 
identify it by name. Before it becomes meaningful it must 
be built up with other tones into a pattern or design. 
We have seen that differences in preference are due to the 
memory of what we have been accustomed to hear, but 
there must be something in the structure to which memory 
can attach. A person who has heard Dixie and The Star 
Spangled Banner from childhood would not confuse the 
two, even though he were not able to state in words the 
different ideas the two tunes expressed; their difference 
would be as distinct in the consciousness as the difference 
between Barbara Frietchie and the Biglow Papers. 
Let us examine the difference in the structural ideas of 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
I ee ee 
IDEAS AS RELATED TO STRUCTURE 29 
the two tunes. This requires us to consider the constitu- 
tive ideas of structure that unite in producing their specific 
effects. First, we can march to one tune, but we should 
have to waltz if we wished to move with the swing of the 
other. The grouping and emphasis of tone for the purpose 
of producing this feeling of pulsation, enabling us to move 
regularly to the swing of the tune, is technically known as 
the metrical element of music. The metrical element—for 
instance, two-four or three-four—can be thought of in- 
dependently of these tunes. Meters are distinct ideas in 
themselves, modes of pulsation necessarily used to form a 
musical structure; but they have significance only as they 
constitute a definite element of music. 
In the second place, we notice as we sing the two tunes 
that while we can keep a regular movement, the tones 
through which the pulses are manifested are not of regular 
length; some are long, even lasting over a pulse, and some 
are short so that several occur in a single pulse. This 
variation of the tones as to time duration is not arbitrary, 
but fits in with the regular pulsation of the metrical rela~ 
tionships, forming with them a rhythmic pattern or design. 
We find that the two tunes vary decidedly in this respect 
of duration. These duration values are not invented for 
these particular tunes; they are part of the inherent rela- 
tionship in which tones are thought. In themselves they 
form a distinct group of ideas, but as in the case of pulsa- 
tion, they gain their significance only when expressed in a 
given musical passage. 
Finally, we have a third grouping of tones, which has to
-P-A-G-E-30
  
  30 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
do entirely with the pitch of the sounds. Here, similarly, 
we find that the selection of pitches is not arbitrary, but 
consists of tones related in a definite way to what is called 
the keynote of the composition—its principal or most im- 
portant tone. This key relationship is a distinct idea in 
itself, independent of the two others mentioned; yet, like 
them, not significant until it is combined with them. Such 
combination results in a definite piece of music whose type 
varies according to the way in which the constitutive ideas 
have been used. 
— To recapitulate, the complete structural idea of the two 
tunes, while felt as a sound motion or progress (for we 
speak of the way music “‘goes’’), takes its definite character 
in each tune from the three ways in which the ideas consti- 
 tutive of structure are manifested: first, in relation to the 
regular successions of time, which is expressed by means 
of pulsations that throb in larger and larger units; second, 
in relation to the relative duration of the tones, which, 
fitting in with the pulsations, present a definite, rhythmic 
design; and third, in relation to the pitch of the tones, a 
selection of sounds with reference to a central or key tone, 
which vary with reference to the direction up or down and 
to the extent of change in each. These three ways in which 
tones are grouped unite to form the structure or design of a 
tune. This design is the idea the composer of the tune in- 
tended to represent. We recognize the force and character 
of the idea long before we analyze it; in fact, analysis into 
these constitutive ideas might hinder enjoyment at the time. _ 
Disassociation between a musical passage and the spe-
-P-A-G-E-31
Be ee 
IDEAS AS RELATED TO STRUCTURE BY 
cific idea it expresses cannot take place. All musical pas- 
sages are specific; every combination of sounds, every tone 
group that conveys a musical thought can express only that 
particular tone thought, and it cannot be translated into 
words, Change any constitutive factor, such as the dura- 
tion or pitch of any of the tones, and you express some- 
thing different. 
As soon as we realize that every musical form or tone 
group we hear is itself a concrete musical thought, and is 
the product of combining the three tone relationships, 
pitch, duration and pulsation, which are themselves con- 
stitutive ideas, we perceive how important it is to hear 
accurately these relationships. It is true that musical 
appreciation does not need to break up the tonal move- 
ment or progress into these three factors, but it is also 
true that any indefiniteness in perceiving these relation- 
ships must result in indefiniteness on the part of the listener 
as to the idea expressed. 
For this reason the Kindergarten stage of mere sensi- 
bility without training in analysis for accurate hearing is 
inadequate. Yet most of us never advance beyond this 
childhood stage. Its:limitations may be formulated thus: 
first, experience is narrow, we learn to like few and poor 
varieties; second, experience lacks intensity, is weak and 
superficial. Most of us need development and widening 
of the early experience through opportunities for inter- 
pretation, and the making of this experience more sharp 
and vivid through training in hearing accurately the consti- 
tutive ideas,

The importance of directing and guiding musical ex- 
perience will be seen if we keep in mind these facts: first, 
that while comparatively few make music, every one whe 
hears it takes part in it to the extent of his enjoyment; 
second, that the part taken by those who enjoy it is by 
means of the musical ideas that are presented; and third, 
that the musical ideas presented woul/ be unintelligible to 
the hearer unless his previous musical experience had 
made him familiar with similar ideas. The aim of music 
teaching in the public school being to give not only technical 
knowledge to the gifted few, but also-a cultural training to 
the many, the teaching should consist of the experience 
that will widen and intensify the ideas of musical structure 
and interpretation, and thus lead to comprehension and 
enjoyment. 
The following chapters suggest a way in which this may 
be done.    
-P-A-G-E-33
CHAPTER V 
HOW IDEAS ARE DEVELOPED THROUGH 
EXPERIENCE 
One of the editors of a large metropolitan daily says 
that while almost all the writers in the office are college 
men, and that, too, from a university that lays special 
stress on English work, yet it is practically necessary to 
teach these men to write after they enter the office. We 
know that they have had eight yeai's of English in elemen- 
tary and grammar schools, and four years of secondary 
school training; that they have specialized in English at 
college; and that the subject, instead of being divorced 
from actual life, requires daily practical exercise from 
childhood. Then, too, we must remember that the schools 
have almost entirely neglected the oral for the benefit of 
the written language. In the face of all these facts, the 
remark of the editor-in-chief that it is necessary to teach 
college graduates how to write—not academic English, 
but the common English of every day life—seems strange. 
This can be accounted for, however, when we take into 
consideration that, while the true aim of school work is to 
prepare for life, the immediate aim is the study of such 
subjects as reading, writing, and arithmetic. The teacher, 
Music—3 33
-P-A-G-E-34
ee ee ee ne Te RT er eh nae ; 
| 
34 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
with all his energies bent on accomplishing these definite 
activities, is liable to lose sight of the real end for which the 
studies are prescribed. Hence, while the children learn to 
read, write, and cipher, they do so under artificial condi- 
tions, and are instructed with a disregard for the applica- 
tion of these activities to living, so that the true aim of all 
their work—the participation in life—is lost. Therefore, 
owing to this radical difference in point of view, it is pos- 
sible for a pupil to study English all his student life, and 
still be unprepared for the practical demands of news- 
paper work. 
Tf this is the case in such a study as English, the difficulty 
is much more apparent in a subject like music, the practical 
exercise of which is but sporadic and occasional. To this 
_ disadvantage must be added the fact that the relation be- 
tween the thing studied, as scales, chords, and all the com- 
plexities of notation, and the vital thing experienced as 
beautiful music, is difficult to establish even for musically 
gifted people. One can imagine, therefore, the state of 
mind of the large majority of the ungifted. 
Take the study of harmony. There is hardly any one 
who is not sensitive to its effects, yet it would be safe to 
hazard that not one in a hundred of those who write out 
the exercises of an average harmony book is able to make 
any practical connection between the knowledge and skill 
he has gained and his musical experience. 
In the vast amount of knowledge that children gain 
spontaneously before school days begin it is the practical 
use of what is learned that causes them to absorb it. A  
-P-A-G-E-35
  HOW IDEAS ARE DEVELOPED © 35 
rudimentary notion of current musical ideas has been 
unconsciously acquired by the average child who enters 
the first grade. He has picked them up just as he has 
picked up his mother tongue. If he is born in London, 
Occidental music sounds familiar to him; if he is born in 
Tokio, Oriental music. 
In order to understand language, the child has need 
of a great background of language experience whereby, 
through a series of unconscious comparisons of the sounds 
he hears, aided by the common points in the circumstances 
under which they are uttered, and through continual de- 
liberate attempts to imitate the sounds, there gradually 
and all unconsciously dawn upon him their purpose and 
the method of using them. Thus he becomes conscious 
of the idea. In other words, his consciousness of ideas is 
the result of his attempts to make his experience practical. 
The following illustration shows the necessity of applying 
language forms, such as words, to our experience in order 
to define ideas and make discrimination possible. A boy, 
who, on account of brain deficiency, did not imitate sounds, 
grew to the age of eleven without being able to talk. He 
acted like an imbecile, did not play with the other children, 
and expressed hunger and other elemental ideas only 
through signs, intelligible to no one but his parents. At 
eleven, the experiment of teaching him by Bell’s visible 
speech was tried. The result was marvelous. The boy 
caught up with the other children; in fact, he advanced so 
rapidly that it was necessary to stop teaching him for a 
time lest his brain be overtaxed. The boy had the ex-
-P-A-G-E-36
  30 EDUCATION THROUGH ‘Music 
perience, the necessary senses, and evidently the brain 
capacity, but because of his inability to imitate sounds he 
had been unable to apply the symbols of language to his 
experience, and thus was left incapable of developing his 
ideas. 
If we apply to music the thought of the preceding illus- 
tration, the first attempts of little children to sing will show 
how the experience is being acquired from which musical 
ideas may be developed. In his attempts at song, the 
child’s voice goes up and down in pitch, it produces long 
and short tones, it occasionally places emphasis, and suc- 
cessive outbursts produce a crude sort of rhythm. But 
this rambling la-laing, although it contains all the elements 
of music, and the fond mother may call it singing, cannot 
be termed music; for it presents no organic material. But 
let the child repeat a definite rhythm, expressed through 
tones showing key relationship, and the very fact that he 
can hold this unit and can keep repeating it shows that 
his previous, unorganized experience has been organized 
by means of this particular melodic form. His music at 
first may consist of this one figure, but soon others form 
and he shows preferences. He will need to hear but the 
first strain of Little Bo Peep or Ding Dong Bell to dis- 
tinguish it. In other words, he has gone through precisely 
the same process and has organized and used ideas in 
connection with these songs just as he did with the words 
cat and dog. But there is this difference that the child 
is probably more analytically conscious of the constitutive 
ideas that combine to form the notions of objects, because 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
HOW IDEAS ARE DEVELOPED 37 
it is easier to think of phenomena presented in space than 
of those presented in time. In music, pitch, duration, and 
pulse changes all combined, succeed one another so subtly, 
as presented in time, that the memory is unable to hold 
them distinctly enough to permit the mind to compare 
them. However, the essential thing—their effect as reg- 
istered in feeling—is just as distinct and definite for Ding 
Dong Bell and Little Bo Peep asit is for any visible objects. 
Objection may be made to the preceding description as 
not applicable to the facts presented by extremely musical 
children. The musical child will produce organized mu- 
sical effects in the form of melodies with apparently no 
more preparation than the newly hatched chick requires 
in order to peck. This means simply that the young inherit 
strong tendencies to do things which favorable external 
circumstances promptly set in motion. Because the child 
produces melody at once, it does not follow that experience 
and the forming of ideas have not preceded it; but that 
environment makes available an experience which im- 
mensely increases the effectiveness of his own. 
Since language ideas are more universally employed 
than those of music, they are of great assistance in teaching 
* music. By employing songs where language ideas already 
familiar to the child coincide with the musical ideas, he can 
be led to the proper musical interpretation. The child, in 
singing the winter or autumn song described in Chapter 
III, starts with the thought of the song as a whole, and 
finds no difficulty in relating to the central thought what 
j/re does for quality, quantity, rate, and articulation. Thus,
-P-A-G-E-38
    38 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
if we choose an expressive song, and teach the child to sing 
it so as to bring out its thought, we can easily make him 
conscious of the reason for employing constitutive ideas, 
and develop in him an intelligent notion of good inter- 
pretation. 
On the other hand, what is done with reference to pitch, 
duration, and pulsation, or the ideas constitutive of struc- 
ture, is not easily separated and made distinct in the move- 
ment of the music. Hence no connection can be made 
between such a specific act and its effect in the musicel 
impression; consequently no idea can be formed. What 
is needed to form such ideas is something that will guide 
the pupil’s attention, so that, while he is feeling the swing 
and go of the music, he can at the same time observe a 
specific form or act, and notice its influence in the total 
effect he feels. This will enable the pupil to develop an 
idea of the specific act or form, so that he not only may learn 
the symbol that represents it, but also may use both the 
symbol and the ideas in recognizing or suggesting new 
form combinations and new ideas. 
To aid in accomplishing this end, the work has been 
divided into four steps: observing, acting, picturing, and 
notation. 
In the first step the child is led to observe that there is 
something in connection with the structure of the tune that 
is appropriate to what it expresses. This something may 
be separated into the three kinds of musical ideas already 
referted to: (1) the metrical grouping—the succession of 
pulses; (2) the grouping with reference to tone duration—
-P-A-G-E-39
  HOW IDEAS ARE DEVELOPED 39 
long and short sounds; (3) the grouping with reference to 
pitch—popularly described in terms of space as up and 
down. 
If the child has observed that there is a difference be- 
tween the “go” of his slumber song and that of his march- 
ing song, we should lead him to discover the nature of this 
difference by letting him act what he feels—the second 
step—for there is a natural and intimate correlation be- 
tween movement and music; they mutually define each 
other. One might not be able to tell the difference between 
a tune in three-part and one in four-part meter, but if he 
tried to move to these, the movement itself would make 
him conscious of the difference. At the same time, move- 
ment with the music does not destroy the consciousness 
of the tone structure itself. The average listener may not 
be able to tell what constitutes the differences in tone 
length and grouping between Yankee Doodle and America 
but if he “claps” the sounds as he sings them, by con- 
centrating his attention on what he is doing with his hands, 
he can, after sufficient trial, realize the metrical difference 
between these two songs. Thus the step of preliminary 
observation is made more intensive by combination with 
action. 
When the ideas have become distinct in consciousness 
as forms of movement, we can define them still further by 
diagram, making the third step. Strong and weak pulses 
may be represented by large and small circles, long and 
short tones by long and short dashes, the idea of up and 
down by dashes of different elevation. Thus tone ideas
-P-A-G-E-40
  4o EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
have been translated into movement ideas, and these have 
been represented pictorially. 
In each of these steps the music is being sung while a 
given tone relationship is being observed by means of 
action, picturing, etc., so that there is no break between 
what is felt as music and that which is representing one fea- 
ture of its structure. We can now pass on to the final step, 
which is to change the picture of the tone relationships to 
the notation that represents the same ideas. 
Thus the fundamental principle, the connection between 
what is felt and that which expresses it, is so systematically 
evolved by means of the four steps of observing, acting, 
picturing, and writing the symbols that the dullest pupil 
shall not be left behind. 
° We must not forget, however, that the act of appreciation 
itself is one that feels the beauty of all the parts as related 
to a complete whole; it is a synthetic and not an analytic 
act. Whenever we study a piece of music we are only 
preparing ourselves for appreciation. The objection so 
often made that the study of an art work by drawing atten- 
tion to its mechanism destroys its imaginative appeal is 
well taken, for the analysis of a work of art involves a 
different mental process from its appreciation. One is 
the scientific attitude, the other the esthetic. One cannot 
be substituted for the other. The individual, fully to 
realize his opportunity, must have the benefit of both 
methods of approach. One prepares him; the other gives 
him the fruition, —_/

CHAPTER VI 
FIRST YEAR WORK: AWAKENING MUSICAL 
IDEAS 
FIRST STAGE: RHYTHM WORK 
Tr all the children entering the first year of school could 
bring the same inheritance of musical talent and the same 
amount of ‘experience through its exercise, the organiza- 
tion of the music work would be comparatively simple; 
but, unfortunately, both of these factors vary widely in in- 
dividuals. 
Children in the firet year represent perhaps greater vari- 
ations in musical ability than in any other subject of the 
curriculum. If music were a study carried on individu- 
ally, it might still be possible to adjust the work to such 
widely varying ability, but this subject, unlike all other 
school activities is.foo often expressed only collectively. 
Hence the untalented children affect not only their own 
work, but-also that ofthe talented. 
The ordinary procedure of the school is to start at once 
with the song. Experience shows that out of a room of 
thirty pupils, approximately one-sixth catch the air im- 
mediately and soon become leaders. One-third manage 
to mumble along after the leaders and to add something 
4h  
-P-A-G-E-42
  42 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
to the total tone of the room. Another third take still 
longer to fall in and are quicker in going astray, while one- 
sixth at first seem hopeless. The visitor listening to such 
a room will not be aware that the effect of the song is not 
the result of the total activity of the class; but, as a matter 
of fact, the real work is done by the few leaders, with a 
more or less intelligent following of the second group, and 
the decidedly unintelligent help of the third. The result of 
such work is to educate most effectively those who are 
already leaders, to do something for the second class, oc- 
casionally to bring up one from the third to the second 
group, and to do nothing for the remainder, thus making 
greater rather than less the difference between musical and 
nonmusical children. 
When one considers that music work should be the con- 
certed act of the entire class, and that it is the business of 
the school so to arrange it that all shall be equally benefited, 
one must admit that the procedure just described will 
hardly satisfy the demands of good organization. Instead 
of appealing merely to those who are musically the most 
talented, a form of work should be undertaken that will 
awaken musical thought and expression in the large major- 
ity of the class. 
Children entering the first year, unaccustomed to school 
life, are shy, and since they have sung but little they cannot 
easily discover the singing voice. The act of singing is a 
comparatively strange one to most children. 
But there is a simpler and more primitive form of musical 
expression, which finds its vent in rhythmical action, Such
-P-A-G-E-43
  FIRST VEAR WORK 43 
expression of musical feeling is not so much by means of 
voice as by movements,—for instance, walking, marking 
time with the hand, the foot or the head, swaying the 
body,—movements all of a simple character thoroughly 
within the control of the pupils. By selecting some very 
simple songs like Hot Cross Buns or London Bridge, Jack 
and Jill or Little Bo Peep, we have material in the swing 
and go of which we can easily interest the children. If the 
song is such that movement is an idea suggested in it as, 
for example, a cradle song, a marching song, a wind song, 
or one of the songs expressive of various occupations, the 
motion can be made much more suggestive. 
But it must be borne in mind that the point of the action 
is not to dramatize the song. Dramatic activity in connec- 
tion with singing is prone to lead away from the thought of 
the musical movement to something more readily suggested 
by the words, and hence be an element of distraction rather 
than an aid. The aim is rather to get all the children in 
the class interested in what is going on, some in the com- 
plete song, others in its rhythm, all in musical movement,— 
not alone in ideas that may be suggested in the text. 
This work has no analytical aspect; the children do not 
know how to tell what they are doing; they simply march, 
swing or clap in harmony. The teacher will soon discover 
those who are musically deficient, and a large part of her 
time will be taken up in bringing these laggards into the ~ 
rhythmic fold where they can be benefited by the exercises 
of the class. Such work does not give the kind of musical 
results that make a favorable impression on visitors and

principals, but it is a much more honest effort toward the 
ideal of what public school work should be than is the 
course ordinarily followed, which is to-give to those that 
have and to slight those that have not. 
SECOND STAGE: VOICE WORK 
\ After a period varying from three to six weeks, during 
which the main effort is to unify the class and have the 
children realize that everyone can do something in the 
singing hour, the teacher may enter upon the second stage 
in the organization of the music work. | This deals with 
the tone qualitywhich is based on the principle that the 
quality of the véice naturally expresses the idea calling it 
forth. Older persons learn to belie themselves in this re- 
spect, but the child’s voice responds with a charming frank- 
ness to the imaginative or emotional conditions by which 
he. is influenced. 
This fact gives us the clue for the first steps in voice 
training,)and at the same time is in harmony with the 
fundamental principle underlying all the work, i. e., to de- 
velop the form as always expressing an idea. Listen to the 
little girl asking permission from her mother to go out to 
play, and to the same little girl arguing with her mother 
after she has been refused. Here we have expressive voice; 
idea and form are closely related. Give a child such 
‘a little song sentence as, “Good morning, my dearest 
Mamma.” Let it be sung and you will probably have a 
thin, meaningless, coarse or squeaky tone; but awaken 
in the child the thought of her mother and of how much  
-P-A-G-E-45
—_—— 
FIRST YEAR WORK 45 
she loves her, get her to feel that she is singing good 
morning to her,—and then let the song be sung again; 
there will be a magical change in its tone quality. 
Such work demands that the song material selected shall 
have some emotional clement. Songs about facts of nature 
which awaken no feeling in the child, descriptions that are 
more concerned with the statement of facts than with 
arousing feeling, are difficult material for voice work. The 
changing seasons, fall, winter, and spring, bring with them 
hundreds of apt occasions, from the falling of the leaves to 
the appearance of the pussy willows, thus furnishing in- 
cidents that prove extremely interesting for the time being. 
A song well chosen in this respect has large expressive 
possibilities for the voice. Again: the festivities of the year, 
like the Thanksgiving season, Christmas, Easter, and the 
patriotic days, give scope for the musical work that makes 
it possible to awaken an emotional interest sufficiently 
strong for the most effective tone training.) 
It must be borne in mind that this response in the child 
is automatic. The emotional interest is awakened not 
simply to mak the work interesting to the child, but for 
the effect it has on the voice.) This result is obtained by 
continually drawing his attention to the thought that the 
voice quality and modulation must be true to what he is 
uttering. In doing this we are awakening in him a sen- 
sitiveness to truth of expression which is fundamental not 
only to all his appreciation of music but to his intercourse 
with his fellow beings. Such voice training becomes not 
simply music work, but one of the basic activities in which
-P-A-G-E-46
a ee 
46 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
the child must be trained the first year. What should all 
the school work amount to but to enable the child ad- 
equately to express himself? Music, like the other studies, 
supplies but the necessary facts and means for such ex- 
pression. In the voice we have a beautiful organ, most 
delicately adjusted, and through the niceties of its cultiva- 
tion we can awaken the keenest sensitiveness to the truth 
of what is expressed and its expression as well. 
Every word that the teacher utters should be a good 
example in this respect. Every answer of the child gives 
opportunity for training in this true music of life, for lan- 
guage becomes musical as it becomes expressive. The 
spoken word does not emphasize the vowel tone but draws 
attention to the consonant; (singing reverses this process 
and draws attention to the vowel.) Singing and speaking 
are therefore mutually helpful. In order to sing intel- 
ligently, the niceties of the consonant must be studied in 
speech; to speak expressively, attention must be given to 
the vowel tone of song; and back of both these effects, the 
idea of which these are the means of expression must be 
rep and vivid. ro 
\Training in these ideas of interpretation, awakening 
sensitiveness to the way in which the thing is done should 
not be limited to songs nor to the singing period.) Short 
phrases and words should be repeated and the ‘children 
made conscious of the differences to which they have un- 
consciously been responding. A word like “No,” for ex- 
ample, can be made to convey half a dozen shades of mean- 
ing, from an absolute refusal to a practical consent.  
-P-A-G-E-47
  FIRST YEAR WORK 47 
In this work lies the opportunity for the so-called 
- monotone,” the child who cannot sing, whose difficulty 
generally is that he is unable to grasp and prolong the 
vowel. He can be asked to repeat his name as the teacher 
does, prolonging the vowel and turning it into a singing 
tone. ‘Two-syllable names can thus be sung on the tones 
soh, doh, or the tonic dominant, each child standing until 
he can imitate the teacher’s call to the satisfaction of the 
class. The imitation of whistles and the sounds of nature, 
as water and wind, gives to the skillful teacher a great 
variety of opportunity for awakening consciousness of 
tone in the backward members of her class. 
Gradually, from the consideration of tone and its connec 
tion with the meanings attention can be drawn to beautiful 
tone as significant in itself) but the order of work should 
always be from the practical expressive use to its use for 
technical purposes. (In singing exercises to vowels, for ex- 
ample, the attempt should be made to have the vowel sound 
as beautiful as possible! This technical and abstract vowel 
work, contrary to the practice of many, should follow and 
reénforce the tone work of the song rather than precede it, 
as would naturally be done with mature students. 
While what has been said applies to the work as a whole 
with reference to its underlying principle, it will be neces- 
y for the teacher to study each child’s voice individually, 
There will be some children with strident, piercing voices, 
and others with gruff, chest-tone qualities, very often the 
result of habits formed while having a cold; then there will 
be the feeble, undeveloped voices} While the principle 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
will remain the same, the instruction will vary according 
to the needs of the pupils. 
The practice of suppressing the children’s voices in order 
to attain the so-called sweet tone, while it avoids injuring 
the voices by strain, leaves them undeveloped and un- 
expressive, and the tone of the whole room becomes 
“breathy” and without character. Quantity of tone is as 
much a part of expression as quality. Children love to 
shout and to sing loud and it is good for them to do so, but 
it must be significant and controlled sound, not senseless 
noise. The teacher need not be afraid of voice strain if the 
tunes are properly pitched, that is, sufficiently high to avoid 
the use of the chest tone. The constant tendency of the 
teacher to judge the pitch of the tune by her own vocal 
feeling is often misleading. The children’s vocal organs 
are smaller than those of a grown person, and are conse- 
quently higher pitched, as the piccolo ranges higher than 
the flute because it is smaller. Hence unless the teacher is 
very sure of herself, the pitch of the tunes should be de- 
cided by the needs of the class, which may sometimes 
require the giving of the pitch higher than it is written. 
Tunes requiring force on low tones should be avoided, 
But phases of the question that deal with the means of ex- 
pressive voice, the pitch of tunes, the avoidance of pieces 
that are unsuitable, and the attention that should be given 
to the individual qualities of the student, are problems for 
the teacher. All that the child is asked to do has reference 
to expressive purpose. By these means pure tone is 
developed.
-P-A-G-E-49

THIRD STAGE: PITCH, DURATION, AND PULSE 
The second stage in the organization of school work is 
connected entirely with ideas arising out of the interpre- 
tative aspect of music. This aspect, however, cannot be 
long pursued before it leads back to structural ideas. 
After a few weeks, therefore, we begin a class of work which 
has an entirely distinct aim, i. e., to make the pupils 
gradually conscious not only of the material of expression, 
but also of the structure of the forms, the interpretation of 
which they have been studying. This is the third stage in 
the organization of music work. 
~~ Such a song sentence as Gently Rocks My Light Canoe 
can be given. After the song has been sung correctly, it 
may be repeated, the upper tones being sung a third or an 
octave higher than they are written. By this means the 
children discover that the up and down movement of 
the tones has a good deal to do with the on of 
the words “gently rocks.”

The children quickly grasp the significance in the struc- 
ture of Birdie Fly as compared with Raindrops Fall; and 
the relation of the tune to-the words in Down Come the 
Autumn Leaves and Up Goes My Pretty Kite is at once felt.

In order to make the contrast more striking, the words 
and tunes of the last four songs may be exchanged, when 
the absurdity of trying to express the thought of the ascend- 
ing kite by the tune of the falling leaves, or the raindrop 
song by that of Birdie Fly will be felt by even the most 
obtuse member of the class. What makes this difference 
is a problem that the little children do not take long to 
solve. Ideas of direction and extent of direction are thus 
made apparent, and when once clearly observed are acted 
out, the hand showing by its movements not only the direc- 
tion of each tone from the’ preceding, but in a general way 
the extent of direction. After much practice in this kind 
of observation of suitable songs, selections may be taken in 
which the melody is not so baldly expressive of the pitch 
movement. The idea once gained of tone movement with 
reference to direction and extent, it is not difficult for the 
children to apply their powers of observing and acting to 
the movement of any melody. 
* But this is only one phase of the musical idea. Now  
-P-A-G-E-51
Ee eee er nen ee eee 
FIRST YEAR WORK 5r 
that attention has been drawn to tone direction, it can 
easily be turned towards tone duration. Some quickly 
moving tune like Yankee Doodle or a wind song com- 
pared with the slow moving tones of a lullaby, will cause 
the children to observe a difference in movement; they can 
clap this difference, thus making themselves more distinctly 
conscious of its nature. This is generally spoken of as 
“clapping the words.” The children are conscious that 
the speed and movement of the tones are factors in the 
structure of the tunes which, decide their expressive char- 
acter, that there is something appropriate in the grouping 
of tones of See Saw as compared with Little Bo Peep 
quite apart from the exigencies of the syllables. After the 
idea is once grasped, through its significance the more 
abstract idea of variation in tone duration itself can be 
reached, and children can now clap the words to any tune 
and be made to observe the tones in their relationship to 
one another, as long and short, or in their durational value. 
We are now ready to observe the most fundamental and 
at the same time the most abstract element in tone group- 
ing; that which has reference to the pulse or metrical ele- 
ment of tunes. Here the connection between expressive 
values cannot be made so clear. On the other hand, the 
phenomenon itself is much more simple. What we wish 
the children to know, i. e., that there is a steady pulsation 
running through music, we can make them conscious of 
by letting them keep step or mark time. 
Children have plays that bring out this idea: the various 
“counting out” games; for instance, such as ‘‘ Eeny, meeny,
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
miny, mo,” where the metrical grouping depends upon the 
regular recurring pulse. Perhaps more effective’ still is 
tolhave the class play they are a band. While the musical 
children carry the air, those who need development of the 
metrical sense give various drum beats, the little drums 
marking all the pulses, the larger ones only every other 
accent, while the largest of all give only the strongest ac- 
cents.) Or if toy instruments can be procured, drums, 
cymbals, triangles,and tambourines may be used to ad- 
vantage. Thus the feeling of grouping, the relation of 
pulses to one another and their regularity, are readily and 
practically brought home. The children get so interested 
in such work that the unmusical ones have been observed 
in process of being coached by the more musical during 
recess. 
The difference between this work and that done at the 
opening of the school is that in the early work no attempt 
was made to observe the phenomenon itself. It was merely 
a means to get the pupils to join in the music. Now we 
wish to have them notice the effect itself. Mother Goose 
songs supply good material, especially those in compound 
or six-eight meter. In these the two large swings that throb 
through each measure are easily felt and acted. The same 
grouping of two can be applied to most four-pulse meter, 
as well as to all two-pulse and many three-pulse meters, 
especially those that are written for children. The three- 
part songs may be treated as if they were compound, and 
acted in the same way as the six-eight song. 
It will be noticed from this enumeration that the object
-P-A-G-E-53
Pe ee ee een 
FIRST YEAR WORK 53 
is; not to discover the metrical signature, but simply to 
make the children conscious of the fundamental swing, like _ 
that of a pendulum, which runs through the music: Along 
with this song work the same principle of observation and 
acting can be applied to the recitation of Mother Goose 
rhymes and jingles. Valuable discriminating thought can 
be awakened by repeating Jack and Jill first marking every 
beat of the foot, then marking only the strong beat, and 
finally grouping and marking only every other foot.

Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of wa-ter. 
The children will feel the choppy effect of the first and 
second ways, and choose the third: 
Jf we examine the illustration of Jack and Jill closely, 
we shall find that there isa still higher rhythm—that which 
deals with the thought: Like the others, it presents a 
series of large pulsations, but instead of grouping these 
pulses mechanically on the basis of the foot, it prolongs or 
hurries these as the thought may require: for instance, 
Jack and Jill would form the first group; went up the hill, 
the second; and Jo fetch a pail of water, the third. Thus 
Jill, hill, and water would form the climaxes of these pulse 
waves, In order to make these of equal proportions, the 
second group must be uttered a little faster than the first, 
and the third considerably faster still. Thus three pulses 
would take the place of four. Thought grouping is of 
prime importance in serious poetry, where the rhythm isa

  54 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
helpmect to the thought, and justifies Professor Scrip- 
ture’s contention with reference to the true nature of poetic 
rhythm, 
The purpose of the work suggested here, however, is to 
arouse in the average, or those below the average, that 
feeling of regularity:-in succession which is the necessary 
basis of ssensitiveness to the truly artistic use of rhythm. 
The child who is unable to regulate rhythmically his phys- 
ical movements, such as walking and clapping, will later 
be pretty sure to find difficulty in extending and com- 
pressing the foot in poetry as is essential in order to mani- 
fest the true poetic rhythm. As a means of strengthening 
the sense of recurring -ptlsation, there is great value in 
employing jingles such as Mother Goose supplies, where 
evidently the pleasure consists in the rhythm rather than 
in the thought expressed. The reason that the majority 
of people read poetry in a sing-song which disregards the 
true flow of the lines is because the rhythmic sense is so 
undeveloped that they rely on the mechanical regularity 
of the foot to steady them. It is the nonmusical dancer 
who is most dependent upon uniform tempo in’ the music; 
he who is truly musical and has perfect command over 
himself can readily accelerate or retard his movements to 
accord with the artistic interpretation of the music. 
There can be no more genuine musical training than 
awakening and making the pupils sensitive to the true 
pulse in both music and poetry. Some children will find 
difficulty in catching even the dogtrot of the iambic foot, 
and it is only by appealing first to the mechanical regular
-P-A-G-E-55
te ee ene 
FIRST YEAR WORK 55 
grouping that they can be taught to vary this as may be 
needful for the sympathetic rendering of whatever may be 
the music in hand. 
With reference to the three aspects of study here de- 
_ scribed,—pulsation, duration, and pitch,—it will be ob- 
served that we have gone through the first two stages of 
the process outlined in the preceding chapter, i. e., those 
of observation and acting. Yet the aim of the work has not 
been to make the pupils analytically accurate with refer- 
ence to tone relationship. 
The important point was not that the tones moved in 
seconds or octaves, but in small or large skips; not in halves, 
quarters, or eighths, but in long or short tones; not in two- 
part or three-part meter, in four-part or six, but that there 
was a regular pulsation in all music, which when recognized 
made it go easily. We have been aiming at fundamental 7 
ideas rather than at analysis. 
The principle can be similarly carried on to a rather 
rough and ready picturing of these three effects by using 
dashes at different heights to represent pitch, dashes of 
different lengths for duration, and large and small circles 
for strong and weak pulses. 
* The idea of musical structure, felt as a ‘“‘go”’ or move- ~ 
. ment, is developed, as we have already shown, through the 
recognition of tone relationships. The difficulty has al- 
ways been that when a relationship simple enough to be 
grasped has been presented, the musical movement for 
which it exists has been lost. When the child is thinking 
out how the first three tones of America are related to one “
-P-A-G-E-56
Be) eee ste ot ee 
; 
56 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
another with reference to pulse and pitch, he is pretty sure 
to forget that they have to do with the design of the tune. 
On the other hand, when pitch, duration, and stress rela- 
tionships are presented as materials out of which music is 
made, as scales and time exercises, only musical pupils are 
able to make the connection between the material and the 
structure it forms, or to recognize it in the music they hear. 
The processes above described start and end with the mu- 
sical passage, and while they detach by action or picture 
some one feature of the movement and make it possible 
for the pupil to develop that phase of the idea, the passage 
as a whole is being sung or heard at the same time, go, that 
relationship to the whole is-never lost. q

But the description of pitch differences in terms of space, 
while serving well enough for the first presentation, is _ 
neither accurate nor sufficiently true to experience. We can 
describe the difference between the octave of a tone and 
the seventh by saying that the former is a trifle higher, but
-P-A-G-E-57
  — 
FIRST YEAR WORK 87 
the difference in effect is much greater than the distance 
idea suggests. In other words, various tones, owing to 
their relation to the key tone, take to themselves certain 
qualities derived from key feeling. If the pupil is to hear 
accurately, he must be able to recognize these qualities 
due to key feeling. Tn order to do this he must be able to 
hear them not as effects in the general flow of the melodic 
movement but associated with the individual tones that 
produce them. The first step in this recognition is a 
difficult task for all except musical people. Hence to ac- 
complish it, a device dating back to the eleventh century 
is employed, i. e., associating the tones with what are called 
sound names, so that a tone occupying a given place in a 
key will always be sung by a given name. In this way the 
key qualities of the tone are gradually associated with the 
name, and when the tone is heard in its musical relation- 
ship, the key feeling suggests the name and thus defines 
it for the mind; or, when the sign that suggests the name is 
seen, it so brings to mind the key feeling associated with it 
that it is possible to think or sing the tone. 
It is obvious that in order to use such a device effectively, 
the singing of these names in connection with the tones as 
they occur in music, must be practiced, forming the nec- 
essary association, and the less musical the pupil the more 
is this essential. The ordinary way of starting out with 
these sound names and forcing an association with them 
entirely -from the scale aspect of the tones, makes of the 
connections a set and artificial grouping. This, although 
well enough for exercises written for the beginner or for
-P-A-G-E-58
    58 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
the scale idea, tends to break down in the free movement 
of tones as they actually occur in songs, the very time 
when its help is most required. In\other words, the expe- 
rience which is to form the associations between the tones 
and their musical qualities is too narrow and artificial. 
What is needed to make the device successful is a wider 
experience for forming a more accurate association. (To 
supply this we very early in the year connect with the 
simplest song sentences, after they have been thoroughly 
learned, their sound names. For example, after the child 
has sung Gently Rocks My Light Canoe and has thor- 
oughly learned the expressive qualities of the tones with 
reference to the idea expressed, the same two tones are 
sung as doh,* re, and he associates these names with the key 
feeling that these tones awaken. This process is kept up 
through the year, the sound names being used not as is 
ordinarily done, to suggest the tone required, but—after 
the tone is learned and its quality is thoroughly in mind, 
for the sake of connecting these qualities with the names by 
which we later wish to suggest them. 
The sound names, though they have nothing to do with 
the expressive rendering of the song and hence seem incon- 
sistent with the principles we are following, are, in this 
case, connected with the tones after their expressive values 
* The phonetic spelling used for the syllable names in this work is that 
employed in Tonic Soh-fa method, with the exception of the syllables for 
the second, third, and seventh and fourth and fifth sharped of the scale, 
for which the American spelling of re, mi, ti, fi, and si is adopted in order 
to avoid confusion with the usage in this country. The value of the Tonic 
Soh-fa spelling tending to keep a pure vowel tone, is obvious.
-P-A-G-E-59

FIRST YEAR WORK 59 
rare felt. They are not an aid in the present work, but 
~ preparation for more complex work to follow. 
It will be observed that the three stages of work so far 
* outlined all grow out of song material and hence imply that 
actual song singing is the larger part and the most im- 
portant feature of the work. What has been described 
with reference to tone relationships has grown out of the 
song work and is necessary for the organization of the ex- 
perience. Such observation of song material as has been 
described follows the song singing after its full expressive 
value has been developed. Observation that some of the 
tones are high or low, or long or short follows the learning 
of the song and awakens new features of interest. 
But this is not all. These observations help the child in 
learning new songs in the latter part of the year. Instead 
of repeating passages to be taught over and over until 
there is an automatic memory of them, the child’s obser- 
vational powers are directed by means of the devices used. 
For instance, in teaching a new song the children are asked 
at the outset to notice whether the tones go up or down, 
whether in wide skips or little skips, whether they move 
rapidly or in long-sustained tones. Thus the process of 
musical observation is developed and musical passages 
are quickly grasped. The pupils feel the force of the work 
done in aiding them to observe how the tones go, and a 
keen competition is awakened in the exercise of their new 
powers of tone discrimination. To go on teaching songs 
through mechanical repetition after the children have 
begun to observe definite features is like supplying tools
-P-A-G-E-60
  60 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
without giving opportunity to use them. They fail to 
apply what they have learned and miss the exhilaration 
and interest that this might awaken. 
At the end of the first year the pupils should have a keen 
feeling both for tone quality and for its expressive use in 
connection with their songs, in other words, for interpre- 
tative ideas. Experience has shown that the way the song 
goes, or its structural idea is due to the grouping of the 
tones in pulses, with reference to their being long or short 
and with reference to high or low. And they have formed 
associations between the tones of their songs and the sound 
names of these tones, so that when the first and second of 
the scale are sung, doh, re come tc the mind. 
All knowledge gained has been in the form of experience 
in acting and picturing songs, playing with the material in 
its constructive aspect without analyzing it. If the work 
of this year has been successfully carried out, an effective 
basis of experience has been laid for a more accurate and 
definite observation of tone as used in the music necessary 
for the more advanced work of the second year.

CHAPTER VII 
SECOND: YEAR WORK: DEFINING INTERPRE- 
TATIVE AND STRUCTURAL IDEAS 
Tue first stage deals with the interpretative idea, the 
expressive use of song; the second individualizes the tone of 
the key; the third carries the rhythmic thought to the point 
where notation can be considered, and the fourth intro- 
duces the staff. The rest of the year combines this material 
and adds one distinct feature which also requires the union 
of all the previous knowledge, that is, the practice of song 
making. : 
FIRST STAGE: VOICE WORK 
In the first of these four stages, dealing with the inter- 
pretative idea, the children learn that songs are expressive. 
In Chapter V it is stated that the good tone gained in the 
first year is an automatic response to proper imaginative 
and emotional conditions. Through constant attention the 
children not only have been getting experience in effective 
singing but have also been forming good habits. They 
are now a year older; the shyness of the first year has 
disappeared and the change in maturity is greater than in 
older pupils. They can be made conscious of some of the 
61 :
-P-A-G-E-62
  62 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
simpler technical steps necessary to get good tonal results, 
and systematic effort can be made to correct tonal faults. 
The study of the vowel is now introduced and the chil- 
dren begin to learn that of the various sounds that make 
up syllables and words, one is chosen for the singing tone 
while the other sounds come in very quickly before and 
after as the syllable requires. Take, for instance, the 
word ‘‘ My” it consists of three sounds: a humming sound, 
required by the m followed by a as in father and i asin ill. 
A good singer makes the first and last quickly while the a 
is the sound on which the word is sung. If the pupils 
try singing My Country ’Tis of Thee they will find that 
many, instead of singing on the tone a go on to the tone i 
and this not only makes the word sound badly, as if it had 
two syllables, but also requires the making of a singing 
tone on a sound difficult to sing. The study of the vowel 
consists first in learning to select the right sound for the 
singing’tone, and, second, how to hold it without changing 
its quality, at the same time learning to make the sounds 
that come before and after, not only quickly, but so 
distinctly that the words will be clearly understood. 
Supporting this work and making it effective is the neces- 
sity for good position of body and sufficient breath. The 
relation of pose of body, flexibility of jaw and control of 
breath to what they are trying to do in tone production is 
easily made apparent to the children. If the work is done 
in connection with the song and if the relation of the word 
to the song is felt, then the relation of the vowel to the word 
can be carried and both these can be related to the good .

position of the body and breath control. Thus all the 
factors can be coupled with the expressive end they serve. 
On the other hand, if the breath exercises are taken as in- 
dependent work at one time, the vowel work. in arbitrary 
exercises at another time, the pronunciation of the words 
of the song at still another time, and general drill on ex- 
pressive singing of the song at yet another, we have what 
too often happens under the so-called systematic teaching 
of music: all the essentials necessary for effective singing 
are practiced because their logical importance is felt; but 
they are so disassociated one from another that little prac- 
tical use is made of them, hence that which unites them and 
makes them significant is lost. 
Good position of body, breath control, and the nature 
of the vowel and the consonant are technical elements, of 
whose place in singing the pupil is gradually made con- 
scious by their employment to attain expressive ends. The 
first stage of the second year work emphasizes this mastery 
of means through the ends they serve, which goes on prac- 
tically through the year in connection with the song singing, 
the point now aimed at being to make these features so 
important and vivid to the children that they can be car- 
ried along and progress can be made in their successful 
use through the regular practice of learning songs. 
SECOND STAGE: KEY QUALITY 
After a few weeks spent on the first stage of work, it is 
left for that of the second stage,—learning the character- 
istics of the tones of the key. The tones in the melody are
-P-A-G-E-64
    64 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
not like a string of beads all of the same size and color, but 
their relations in the key give them various qualities so 
that the scale made up of these tones is really like a spangle 
of diverse jewels. As the effect of jewels varies according 
to the light they are in, so the effect of tones varies ac- 
cording to the successions in which they are grouped. It 
is not difficult to memorize the tones in scale succession, 
but put these tones into a song and the children find it dif- 
ficult to recognize them. 
The first year’s work has given the children a feeling 
for tones so that they recognize bright or dark tones, repose- 
ful or active tones, without any attempt either at definition 
or analysis. “They have felt these qualities in the songs 
they have been singing and an effort has been made to 
connect the’sound names with the feeling of the tones that 
the song has developed. This has been done by repeat- 
ing the same little melodies, using instead of words the 
syllable names, after their character has been fully de- 
veloped and felt in songs. 
\The advanced work aims to make the pupils conscious 
of the qualities so that they wil! know definitely what key 
characteristics belong to each tone. Let us illustrate by 
means of language. The child becomes familiar with the 
sound ‘‘d” through speaking words in which it occurs. For 
instance, he has often said the word ‘‘did”’ but he has never 
separated it into the different sounds that make it up. In 
time he learns the symbol that represents the sound ‘‘d”’ 
and then he finds this symbol in written words that he 
already knows, such as “day” or ‘‘good.” He realizes
-P-A-G-E-65
SECOND YEAR WORK 65 
after a number of such experiences that the symbol “d” is 
the mark for a sound with which he has long been familiar 
in his verbal experience. Hereafter the sound “d” is a 
separate thing to him and he is consequently aware of it 
wherever it occurs. It no longer merges in the whole 
word. The form and the experience have united; con- 
sequently an idea is developed. 
In music the child has already sung as wholes short 
musical phrases to the syllable names, and he has felt 
bright or dark characteristics, or active or reposeful qual- 
ities in the different phrases. For instance, in the song 
‘sentence, “I’m so gay” he felt the gladness of the whole. 
[ate + 
Dime! S013) gay. 
When he broke up the word “day” into its parts he found 
the peculiar effect that was due to the presence of the sound 
“d.” Now in his singing his attention is drawn to the par- 
ticular sounds which produce a particular effect. He finds 
that the peculiar gladness of the phrase “I’m so gay” 
comes from the sound sof, the fifth in the scale. If the 
reader will sing the passage, ending first on the fourth and 
afterwards on the sixth (the two tones on either side of the 
fifth), he will realize that the fifth tone gives the quality 
which expresses the thought of the word. True, this qual- 
ity of the fifth is due to what has preceded it so that the 
characteristics of tones studied in this stage are really 
effects dependent on a harmonic relationship of which the 
pupil is only aware in the single tone; here lies the benefit 
Music—5,

  66 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
of this work that, by making the pupils sensitive to the qual- 
ity of the individual tones, an elementary harmonic feeling 
is being developed. As the first music the pupils attempt 
to read is of the most obvious harmonic structure, the de- 
scriptions here given hold good to their experience. As 
skill in reading increases, experience with more complex 
harmonies grows and a subtle feeling for tone relationship 
takes the place of this stage. Both the use of the syllable 
or sound names, and hand signs are for the purpose of 
impressing on the memory the quality of the tone in the 
key. Their influence is dependent on the thought they 
stimulate; when they are constantly used as mnemonics 
for the memory they may easily come to take the place of 
thought and thus become a hindrance to musical thinking. 
We begin this work by singing to the pupils two little 
sentences, “I want to stop,” and ‘“‘I want to go,” set to 
almost the same notes except that the first ends with doh 
and the second with re. 
2 
fe 1 
I -want to stop. I want to go. 
After we have sung the second, we bid the children sing 
the first. They sing the words of the first, but generally to 
the tune of the second, which is, of course, more distinctly 
in their minds, and resembles the first in every respect but 
one. ‘That doesn’t sound as if it wanted to stop,” we 
observe. The children shake their heads; they feel that 
something is wrong. A new idea has been brought to their 
attention; one tone has a different feeling from another         
     
  
  
      
  
 
-P-A-G-E-67

tone. They have never thought of it before, but there is no 
escaping from it now. We sing “I want to stop” to them 
again. Now they have it and hereafter cannot be shaken. 
“I want to stop” ends on a tone that wants to stop, and 
they have no doubt about it. That tone, we tell them, is 
named doh, and extending the closed fist, ‘‘Here,”’ we say, 
“‘we have a picture of it.” Similarly we tell them later 
that the name of the tone that wants to go is re, and drive 
its progressive quality home by picturing it with the palm 
spread out sloping upward. 
‘We now study the third of the scale, repeating the same 
two songs, but commencing on mi. This gives us the 
half step above rather than below the initial tone. If the 
tonic is clearly in mind, the repose quality of the third 
will come out, and at the same time its sensitive, plain- 
tive character. The open hand well illustrates this tone 
quality. While the fourth helps bring out the quality of 
the third, it is not individualized, the whole attention be- 
ing centered on the similarity and difference between the 
third and the first—between mi and doh. This relation- 
ship is further tested by the teacher’s singing the doh in 
different pitches and asking the children to sing the mi. If 
the pupils have a true idea of mi, the reverse step will be 
possible, though it is much more difficult, i. e., when the 
teacher sings mi in different pitches the children can give 
the corresponding doh. 
The next step is to compare the third repose tone with 
the two already studied. For this the teacher takes the 
sentence ‘I’m so gay,” given on page 65.  
-P-A-G-E-68
  68 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
The three tones are now practiced from hand dicta- 
tion, the lower fifth being easily added as the octave of the 
upper. It will be best to practice not only reaching the 
fifth from the tonic and the third, but also the reverse— 
giving the fifth and having the pupils sing the other two 
tones. If the fifth has been really learned, when it is sung 
on different pitches by the teacher it will not be difficult 
to reach the other tones. Practice and great care will be 
needed not to have the acquiring of these tones result in 
merely learning a mechanical formula, but to have it a 
Tesponse to genuine musical thinking. 
The next step is to study the tone just below doh, using 
the following sentence: 
ee = 
Saar pe ee 
          This is the ne - ing tone. 
Emphasis of the word “teasing” will bring out the qual- 
ity of the seventh—its incisiveness and the demand for 
resolution upwards. Using the Tonic Soh-fa name, we 
call it ti, and the index finger pointing up pictures it to 
the eye. This is now practiced with the others in a similar 
way. 
The next tone is studied,—the fourth, fa. For this the 
phrase ‘‘so far away” is added to the already familiar “I 
want to go.” 
rit.     
    I want to go so far a - way.
-P-A-G-E-69
SECOND YEAR WORK 
The dark, unsatisfied quality of the tone is 
brought out by the song. Its tendency to 
drop down to mi is illustrated by the index 
finger’s pointing down, the opposite of /. 
Finally, the last tone Za, the sixth, is taken 
below the tonic in the little song, “I’m so 
sad.” 
=] Im so ___ sad. 
The rather dark quality is brought out by 
the song. The downward tendency of the 
tone Ja is indicated by the whole hand point- 
ing down, the opposite of re. This posi- 
tion shows its downward tendency from the 
tonic, while its opposite upward progression 
towards doh is indicated by the wrist’s being 
raised from the soh position. 
The true test for learning the key quali- 
ties of these tones is not the ability to reach 
them from the tonic, but the ability to form 
the tonic when the tone is given in different latdccsde lacey 
pitches, thus resulting in the ability to think 
new keys. 
Last year’s songs and song sentences are 
sung and the pupils feel that their past ex-

perience in singing the sound names is being supported by 
their new observations. The advantage of the past experi- 
ence is that it keeps a pupil from making a too narrow and 
arbitrary deduction with reference to tone character, which 
is bound to be contradicted by later experience. For 
context, harmony, and rhythmic position are constantly 
changing the effects of tones even in simple melodies, thus 
making it especially necessary that experience should pre- 
cede definition. 
So we go through the seven notes of the scale, bringing 
vividly into the child’s consciousness the key quality of 
each tone through song sentences that emphasize its pe- 
culiar characteristics and through hand signs that suggest 
it physically. Thus the beginnings of work made in the 
previous year, observation, acting, and picturing, are con- 
tinued. In this work with tone definition the shape of the 
hand—closed or open, pointed up or down—represents to 
the eye distinctive qualities of the tone and takes the place 
of the blackboard picture, for obviously such qualities 
could not be pictured. All that the blackboard can do is 
to suggest distance and direction. 
Taught in this way the tones interest the children and 
become so real to them that music can be easily dictated by 
use of the hand signs. The hand sign suggests the quality 
of the tone, the raising or lowering of the hand when the 
sign is made suggests the direction and duration of the 
interval, Thus we have, combined in one act, three 
suggestions of tone relationships. The children will sing 
readily new tunes thus dictated: the ease with which they

follow this dictation makes it possible, by using both hands, 
to dictate two-part exercises in the second grade, long 
before they can be sung from notation, showing that the 
hand signs are the simplest and most accurate way of 
suggesting tones, with reference both to pitch and rhythm. 
In arithmetic, after the child has acquired a certain 
amount of knowledge about numbers we organize his 
knowledge for him in the shape of the multiplication table. 
Similarly we organize the tone knowledge that the child has 
now acquired by grouping the tones, in the scale, for in- 
stance, showing their relative places there. The child’s use 
of the scale is not dissimilar to his use of the multiplication 
table. The latter is useful to him in most arithmetical 
operations. So the knowledge of the scale, involving ac- 
quaintance with the sequence of the tones in a-key, is of 
use constantly in music. Moreover, the scale is a mode of 
movement that occurs often in music, like an idiom in 
language. Beethoven’s Hymn to Joy in the Ninth Sym- 
phony moves almost entirely in the stepwise movement 
of the scale. ‘The fact that the scale is such an idiom is so 
obvious that i§ needs no illustration. The child in his ex- 
perience discovers that the song Up Goes My Pretty Kite 
(page 50), is practically the scale that he has been learn- 
ing, and that in many of the songs he has been singing 
parts of the scale. 
THIRD STAGE: TONE DURATION 
After attention has been centered for some six weeks on 
the tones of the key, ending with scale practice, observa-  
-P-A-G-E-72
  72 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
tion is directed to the third stage, or rhythm, which in- 
cludes both pulse and duration.SThe object here, as we 
have said, is to lead to the discovery that the tones have 
- various lengths which are capable of being measured. Be- 
fore the pupils are through with this they also find that the 
measurement can be represented. 
We open the new work some day by making the children 
sing a song and then asking whether all the tones are of 
the same length. They are not quite sure, perhaps. 
“How do we notice the long and short tones?” 
“Clap them out.” 
“All right,” and the children proceed to clap out the 
song. ‘ 
“Now, are the tones of the same length? ” 
“No, some go fast and some go slow.” 
Following such a course of questions and answers, we 
at last elicit from the children the idea. that if we are to 
discover how long the tones are, we require a means by 
which to measure them, just as we need a yardstick to find 
the length of a piece of cloth. 
“Ts there anything regular in music?” we ask. 
“Yes,” they answer, “there was something that we 
walked to and acted and pictured by circles.” 
Here we have a measuring stick at hand, namely, the 
regular pulsation. We apply the measure. While the 
class sings the song, clapping the tones, the teacher swings 
a circle for the pulse. This is a way for measuring tones. 
It is seen that some tones last as long as the circle, some 
twice as long, some only half as long. The children in the
-P-A-G-E-73
  —_——— 
SECOND YEAR WORK 73 
first year have already pictured both pulse and duration 
separately on the blackboard. Now they combine the two. 
One child, for example, draws the pictures of the pulse by 
means of circles, dividing the space above them by vertical 
lines, one being placed before each large circle, thus mark- 
ing the strong pulses. Then while the class sings the song 
again, another child draws horizontal lines above the 
circles and between the vertical lines. These show the 
duration of the tones with reference to the circles that 
mark the pulses. 
Hot cross buns Hotcross buns Oneapenny twoapenny Hotcross 
Pd dd eo De a ee a 
  They have now a united representation of pulse and 
duration. 
We now do for duration what we did for pitch in giving 
the names of the scale. We tell the children that a tone 
which lasts a circle may be represented by a quarter note, 
one lasting two circles by a half note, one lasting half a 
circle by an eighth note, at the same time marking the 
notation on the board. 
As we developed the child’s skill in the recognition of 
tone qualities by singing very short and striking passages, 
so we give him practice by changing the tone durations, 
introducing those with which he is already familiar, i. e., 
quarters, halves, and eighths. He is extremely interested,
-P-A-G-E-74
94 « EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
not only in telling the teacher what he hears but in writing 
it down; and in all new songs learned afterward his skill 
is put to practical use in those portions that are within his 
grasp. 
FOURTH STAGE ?Srmpririgp PITCH NOTATION 
We now take up the fourth stage of the work, the ob- 
servation of pitch, and with the purpose of discovering some 
more accurate way for its notation than the rather rough 
and ready picturing so far employed, we begin with a prim- 
itive picturing of songs. he children have already made 
pitch pictures of songs in a crude way on the blackboard by 
placing dashes up and down to show pitch changes in the 
melody. They see that the dashes give a visible outline of 
the melodic movement, and a child enjoys making such a 
picture of some song of which he is thinking and then hay- 
ing his classmates guess what the tune is. 
Now a song is taken in which the same tone recurs of- 
ten, and while the children recognize the familiar air and 
sing it correctly the teacher draws attention to the fact 
that although a certain dash represents the pitch of a cer- 
tain tone throughout, in this free way of suggesting the 
pitch it is impossible to put the tone exactly on the level 
that the pitch idea requires. Difference of ability among 
pupils in this respect is very marked. The more precise 
and exact ones come quite near what is intended, but 
the majority require considerable guessing. The teacher 
shows how valuable it would be if we could tell exactly 
where the same note would come each time. She takes  
-P-A-G-E-75
Le en re nce a 
SECOND YEAR WORK , 75 
great pains to have the pupils feel the necessity for what 
she wishes to teach them. 
She then asks for suggestions as to the means that might 
be employed to help get the same note on the same level 
throughout the song. One of the first suggestions is to 
draw a line on which the note can be placed. The teacher 
then sings a song limited to two tones, such as Gently 
Rocks My Light Canoe. (See page 49.) 
The usual way \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
The new suggestion ote Nia he 
A line will define the lower tone, and the children quickly 
see that the space above the line serves to show when to 
sing the other tone. 
The next step is to have the children outline a song 
which includes three tones, one above and one below the 
_ center tone, such as “I want to go.” (See page 66.) 
\ a v 
The children discover that a single line defines three 
tones; the one on the line, the one above and the one be- 
low it. 
Thus the function of lines and spaces is thoroughly 
learned in its simplest form, and by using melodies which 
call for more and more pitches, the need of new lines and 
spaces is brought to the children, until at last they have
-P-A-G-E-76
eae ee am 
76 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
built up a primitive staff of five lines and six spaces. In 
writing on this staff we can use the note heads, which the 
children already understand, while for the circles we sub- 
stitute vertical straight lines which show the accent of the 
rhythm represented hitherto by the big circles. 
But as the circles are to be omitted and the vertical line 
represents only the accent, there is nothing to tell how 
many pulses there are between the lines. Again, the teacher 
develops the necessity for some mark to show the number 
of pulses. The children see that some songs have two, some 
four, and others, three pulses. 
So far we feel the necessity for marking only the number 
of pulses. The necessity for the lower fraction in the 
meter signature must also be equally well prepared for 
by comparing melodies in the compound time of six- 
eight with simple time. For the children*will readily 
realize that the large circles they have been making in com- 
pound meter can be broken up in groups of three circles 
each. Thus the two circles representing the larger groups 
may be represented by six small ones. The Mother Goose 
rhymes will furnish many excellent illustrations for this. 
When the necessity for differentiating between the two- 
part grouping of simple meter and the two-part grouping 
of compound meter is thoroughly realized, the necessity 
for a second figure to state the nature of the pulse, placed 
underneath the one that gave the nwmber in the measure, 
will be felt and clearly understood.*

by Topics,” Chapter XVIII, page 191.

Thus all the characters for writing simple music have 
been developed out of a necessity in the musical experience 
of the pupils. 
In connection with the staff we have now given, the 
children sing passages that run on the lines of the three 
fundamental chords, the tonic, the dominant, and the sub- 
dominant, although we do not give the names. Variety 
and interest are lent to these exercises by varying the 
rhythm and manner of singing the chords, and through 
this practice the children come to feel the difference in 
musical meaning between the group that runs doh, mi, soh 
and the group that runs ¢i, re, soh or doh, fa, la. We place 
the chord passages on a group of five lines and the children 
can see that when doh ison the line, mi and soh are on the 
two lines above it and re, ja, and /a are on the spaces; while 
if doh is on the space, the reverse is the case. The acquire- 
ment of this knowledge sounds like a mere mechanical 
bit of information. In reality it is a significant step, for it 
means the beginning of rapid music reading by tone
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
grouping instead of by separate notes. The moment the 
child thinks of a particular form of musical expression, 
as a familiar group, when he sees a succession of three 
notes on three successive spaces, of which the first is doh, 
he has begun to read music by the words instead of by 
the letters; he is on the way to understand what he 
reads. 
Another bit of apparently technical work which can 
come in the latter part of the year is to have the children 
read scale passages, commencing on some other tone than 
the tonic and taking various pitches, calling them first mi 
and then soh, and singing them to the doh above or the doh 
below. Drill of this kind develops the child’s command 
over tone relationships, for if he starts to sing the scale up 
from a tone thought of as mi, he has to sing the second tone 
only a half step above the first, a mode of progression 
wholly different from that when the first tone thought of is 
doh. The ear and the mind are alike trained. 
FIFTH STAGE: APPLICATION OF KNOWLEDGE 
Under four stages we have described the formal work of 
the second year. The last stage will be taken up with the 
unifying of this knowledge through its practical applica- 
tion. This is carried out by means of two distinct lines of 
work, 
One of these is by the teacher singing a short motif 
consisting at first of only three or four tones taken from 
actual song material, the children being asked to tell how 
it should be written. The process is then reversed, the
-P-A-G-E-79
  SECOND YEAR WORK 79 
teacher writing a motif and the children singing it. From 
the very first attempts at sight singing, we must insist 
that the children conceive the idea of the movement 
suggested by the three or four notes as a whole, not as a 
series of individual notes. 
To cultivate the children’s skill in reading music, va- 
rious devices suggest themselves. They may be told to 
look at a motif, then to turn the head, or shut the eyes and 
‘tell what they saw and sing it; or, the little motif may be 
written on the blackboard and rubbed out, the children 
then being asked to sing it or to show its pitch and rhythm 
by action. 
Two points are insisted on:—first, concentration of 
attention for observing what is written; and second, weld- 
ing what is observed into a musical movement. We do not 
use motifs which consist wholly of tones of the same length 
and which lack accent, for, even though we limit the 
motifs to a few notes, we must present all the factors,— 
such as pitch, change and variety in tone length,—that 
are always present in music, and we must insist on a 
musical rendering, not a mechanical spelling. When this 
is done musically the necessity for the application of ideas 
of interpretation will be felt by the children. Thus, in 
this motif work, we are combining interpretative ideas 
with pitch and rhythm ideas through their notation, prac- 
tically applying all that has been gone over. 
But this is only the first of the two ways in which this 
knowledge is to be applied. The second makes vividly 
clear to the child the necessity for the knowledge of the  
-P-A-G-E-80
\ 
  80 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
structure of music. This new work is in the form of song ~ 
making. , 
In connection with some appropriate event, such as the 
first appearance of the birds or flowers or the coming of 
the pussy willows, or the reading of some unusually in- 
teresting story, the teacher will begin by asking the chil- 
dren if they would not like to make up a song about it. 
Suppose the arrival of the pussy willows has supplied the 
impulse. Left to themselves, the majority of the children 
would be at a loss for ideas about the pussy willow that 
would be appropriate for a wal Wes the subject of a 
good song we need either some movement idea which 
lends itself to verbal or musical description, or some 
emotional idea which will serve to color words and music. 
The teacher’s work is to develop a situation dramatic 
through either motion or feeling and then let the children 
put it into words. In preparing the way for the pussy 
willow song, the teacher will ask the class questions that 
suggest the feeling of the brown and gray fuzzy things 
peeping out into the cold. Would they not be timid, 
venturing out thus long before warm weather came? 
When the story or emotional idea of the song has been 
established, we ask the class for suggestions for the first 
line of poetry. We write five or six of the best on the 
board, the class discuss them, and observe the good and 
bad points, and vote for the one to be adopted. So with 
each succeeding line. Sometimes the lines come rapicly 
and ate quickly accepted; sometimes there is much dis- 
cussion and modification of phrases.
-P-A-G-E-81
———— 
SECOND YEAR WORK 81 
When the couplet or quatrain is finished, we ask for the 
opening phrase of the melody. A number of children sing 
their suggestions, and with the aid of the class as to time 
and duration, we put the phrases on the board. This 
process forces the singer to have his phrase clearly in mind, 
in order to sing it over and over in the same way. A good 
many phrases will be sung which are obvious imitations 
or variations of others. We throw these out of court. 
When a number are on the board—three or four are 
usually enough—the class discusses which is the most 
suitable. The argument between the partisans of the 
different versions is often spirited, and the keenness with 
which the children give reasons why one is better than 
another would surprise the person who has never attempted 
this work. The constant insistence in all the songs the 
children have had that the music interpret the words, has 
given them the fundamental ideas of the musical language 
needed. They know very well that the rhythm of a march- 
ing song is different from that of a cradle song, and, though 
they might not be able to put it into words, they have 
deduced the fact that plaintive effects, for instance, have 
mi, ja, and la prominent and that vigorous effects make 
much use of doh and soh. 
In writing the songs that they themselves have com- 
posed, their previous work in breaking up the song into 
its elements becomes valuable to them. If they had never 
clapped to a song, though they might have made up mu- 
sical phrases, they would have had no idea of the particular 
element of time in it, By writing songs themselves, they 
Music—6 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
  82 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
learn to use casual discoveries concerning the elements of 
music made in the course of clapping, circling, and pictur- 
ing, and they likewise perceive that the particular way the 
elements are put together gives the song its emotional char- 
acter. The exercise connects the expressive song work with 
the structural work. 
This stage also develops the musical judgment in the 
keenest form in which it can be exercised. For after chil- 
dren have made up a song and have discussed the reasons 
for using certain tones and rhythms, they are quick to 
apply the same judgment to the rote songs they have 
learned. Hereafter their interest in a new song depends 
not only on the sensuous feeling for melody and rhythm, 
but on an intelligent appreciation of the way effects are 
produced. This addition heightens enjoyment and makes 
it possible for them to sing songs demanding higher ar- 
.tistic perception. 
\\There are, however, two serious drawbacks to this 
work. First, it takes considerable time. Second, it re- 
quires a reasonable amount of either musicianship or 
poetic feeling on the part of the one who conducts the 
exercise. Unfortunately, the necessity for making the work 
conform to a schedule in our public schools leaves little 
play for creativeness on the part of the teacher. Instead of 
being a suggestive inspiration to her pupils, she becomes 
an automatic guide to direct them to certain formal acts. 
To take up this song-making work as nothing but a mu- 
sical exercise, approaching it from the technical rather 
than the poetic side, would be to rob it of all its value.

Rather than that, it would be better to have the children 
do the regular singing work. 
At the end of the second year, the child has individ- 
ualized the tones of the scale; with the aid of song senten- 
ces and hand signs, he has learned the simpler notes and 
their metric values, has constructed the primitive staff, 
and has learned to read short passages or motifs on that 
staff, as a single whole. In interpretation, his tone quality 
and feeling for musical expression have been directly de- 
veloped by his daily rote song work. An incentive for 
more intelligent observation has been supplied, while at 
the same time the growth of musical judgment has been 
powerfully stimulated by song making.

  CHAPTER VIII 
INTRODUCTORY TO THIRD YEAR WORK: 
TWO ASPECTS OF STAFF REPRESENTATION 
One essential fact in regard to the staff is commonly 
\ forgotten, or at least ignored, in teaching it to children, i. e., 
that the staff represents tones as fixed instead of as strictly 
relative. When the G clef appears upon it, the space be- 
tween the second and third lines represents the pitch A, 
the international standard for which is 435 vibrations a 
second. It always represents this one pitch, whatever the 
key. 
The tendency of the instrumentalist is, as soon as he 
sees the notation, to think what he shall do to produce the 
sounds called for. That is, unless he be very musical, the 
concepts he forms from the notation are those necessary to 
produce the tone, and since this production through his 
instrument depends upon rapidly relating the notation 
with what he has to do in order to gain the tones called 
for, the notation thought tends to become one of fixed 
rather than of relative pitch. 
On the other hand, the vocalist who does not play an 
instrument is indifferent to the actual pitch, and does not 
care if it be a little higher or a little lower than that called 
for by the staff. His whole concern is the interrelation- 
84
-P-A-G-E-85
oe ae erm 
INTRODUCTORY TO THIRD YEAR WORK 85 
ship of the tones presented: After he has sung Yankee 
Doodle in the key of F, he would add nothing to the 
difficulty of his performance by singing it a minor second 
higher, although it would then be in the key of six sharps 
instead of one flat. But the physical operation of the in- 
strumentalist in producing Yankee Doodle in six sharps 
is totally different from that required for it in one flat. The 
staff presents these differences, and it is therefore true to 
the conception of the instrumentalist, although confusing 
to that of the vocalist. 
“The vocalist needs a knowledge of the staff so thor- 
ough that he can rapidly interpret fixed pitch notation into 
the relative pitch by means of which he thinks tone 
relationships. This process is often simplified in the early 
stages of music teaching by going around it instead of con- 
quering it; by telling the children, for instance, that be- 
cause doh is on the same space for one flat and six sharps, 
it is therefore the same doh or tonic. 
So long as the piece stays in the same key, the fixed 
pitch character of the staff will not bother the child by 
forcing itself upon him. But if his piece passes from the 
key of F to its nearest related key, that of C, he will find 
a cancel mark on the third line. On the other hand, if the 
piece is in F sharp and makes exactly the same modulation, 
he will find a sharp on the third line—an apparently 
opposite mark, rather difficult to explain to a person un- 
familiar with the fixed pitch character of the staff. Such 
accidentals are very frequent in modern music; sometimes 
they entirely contradict the key signature.  
-P-A-G-E-86
  86 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
The vocalist who, in the manner of children, thinks of 
the staff as representing merely relative pitches, is obliged 
either to stop while he figures out the real key of the pas- 
sage before he can sing it; or, depending on his musical 
instinct and the general up and down movement of the 
notes, to guess what the passage is. If, however, the vo- 
calist has a knowledge of the staff like that of the in- 
strumentalist, that is, of its fixed pitch character, although 
he may not be able to state in what key the passage is, he 
recognizes the exact intervals presented; hence he knows 
the relationship between the tones, and this helps him to 
sing the passage with certainty. 
His advantage over the singer who thinks of the staff 
as representing only relative pitches is apparent. For in- 
stance, a musical passage might lie along the track of a 
chord consisting of a major third, a minor third, and a 
perfect fourth. This chord might be number one, the 
tonic, in one key; number five, the dominant, in another 
key; or number four, the subdominant, in still another 
key. If the vocalist has grasped the relationship of the 
four tones that represent it, he can form a clear conception 
of the group, though the context may be such that he is 
unable to tell instantly in which of the three keys the pas- 
sage lies. But if he were entirely dependent on key feeling 
as expressed through the doh, re, mi names, he would find 
that the necessity for deciding the exact relationship of the 
chord would prevent him from conceiving it rapidly enough 
to sing it in time. But if his knowledge of the staff, like 
that of the instrumentalist, presented to him definitely the
-P-A-G-E-87
INTRODUCTORY TO THIRD YEAR WORK 87 | 
distance between intervals, he could with this knowledge 
think of how they would sound, and for the moment ignore 
the more definite analysis the key thinking would require. 
Instead ‘of depending on the doh, re, mi names, in order to 
know. that the distance from one line to the next is like 
that from mi to soh, la to doh, or ti to re, through his knowl- 
edge of the staff he would recognize it as a minor third, 
and with the aid of the tone feeling produced by the con- 
text he would be more likely to sing the passage correctly 
than if he had to wait until he settled what the sound 
names should be with reference to the key of the passage. 
Besides this ability to recognize the interval from the 
staff representation without waiting to figure it out ac- 
cording to the key, fixed pitch notation involves a second 
element which can be made of great help to the singer, 
i. e., the actual pitches of the tones themselves. Without | 
training, very few people can remember fixed pitches ex- 
actly; but the ability exists in every one in a more or less 
rudimentary state, and when developed it greatly facili- 
tates music reading. If, for instance, we ask the pupils 
to sound the pitch C before we give it to them, it will not 
take long for them to learn to strike it with a fair degree 
of certainty. By constantly testing the children in this way, 
and by always starting pieces on their actual pitches, and 
using the letter names in giving the tone, we can establish 
a memory for the pitches. In reading, pitch memory is 
of little help without the key feeling, but is of great assist- 
ance when combined with it. 
The work of the third grade should do for the students 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  88 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
with reference to the staff, what the formal learning of the 
multiplication table does with reference to arithmetic. If 
instead of thoroughly learning the whole table at first, the 
pupil were to learn only parts of it at intervals and never 
gain a knowledge of it as a whole, he would very likely go 
through life without being able to use it readily. This is 
what happens ordinarily as regards the staff. For eight 
years the pupils have been told various things about the 
staff, but in such driblets that they have been practically 
vaccinated against a comprehension of it as a whole. The 
result is that, while capable of solving difficult problems in 
other subjects, they seem unable, even with serious effort, 
to pass a simple examination in the notation of music.
-P-A-G-E-89
CHAPTER IX 
‘THIRD YEAR—COMPLETION OF THE PROCESS 
FROM SONG TO NOTATION 
THE work of the third year completes the first phase of 
music teaching. In this the aim is to have the pupils con- 
nect what they do with the particular effect desired, to 
make the tone sweeter and more expressive, so that they 
gradually form the constitutive ideas of interpretation. 
Similarly, they learn to connect by means of observation, 
by acting and picturing what they feel as the movement of 
music, with the particular rhythm and pitch forms that 
produce this movement: thus they develop constitutive 
ideas of structure. 
Besides developing these two classes of ideas they have 
learned much of how to note the structural ideas on paper. 
Their need now is to complete the notation of music and 
prepare for the new phase of the work which, instead of 
passing from the song to its notation, reverses the process 
and passes from the notation to the song. 
FIRST STAGE: REVIEW WORK 
The first few weeks of the school year will logically be 
spent in reviewing the old songs for tone work similar to 
89  
-P-A-G-E-90
EE =e 
go EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
that suggested in the first stage of the second year; the pu- 
pils will also learn new rote songs, and practice singing 
short motifs from the staff. This plan recalls the techni- 
cal knowledge gained in the previous year and introduces 
new pupils to the methods of work. 
SECOND STAGE: COMPLETION OF STAFF NOTATION 
It may seem, perhaps, that already the essentials for 
staff notation have been given; and as a matter of fact, as 
much as is usually attempted has been done. But there 
still lacks one essential element to make this notation com- 
plete, i. e., the knowledge that the pitches represented by 
the staff are not relative but fixed; up to this point the re- 
lationship idea has been suggested by means of the sound 
names, and the staff has indicated only the order and 
number of steps; not their actual distances as whole or 
half steps.   FIRST STEP: BASES FOR COMPARISON 
The first need is for the children to attain the power 
to sing -gellm eong and down from any 
given tone. en they gain this ability it will enable them 
to compare the relative series represented by the key with 
the fixed pitch series of the staff, with the result that they 
will then understand the nature of the staff and apprehend 
the necessity for sharps and flats. 
To begin this work, a song is selected that introduces 
the minor second out of its regular key position, Nevin’s 
Wind Song, for example; or a song sentence such as the
-P-A-G-E-91
  THIRD YEAR gt 
following made up by one of the pupils, “ Here I come 
creeping.” 
Here I come creeping,creeping,creep-ing like a mouse.   
    
  
  
Although the children have been singing minor seconds, 
they have particularly observed them only in their key 
position, as ti, doh or mi, ja and the peculiar nature of the 
interval has been necessarily associated with these two 
places. When they sing these illustrations, however, they 
find that the minor seconds can be produced in any position 
resembling the mi, ja or ti, doh with-whith they are already 
familiar, and they-begin toTealize its true nature. 
Yet, although they can sing the minor second as mi, fa 
or ti, doh in the key position, they find much difficulty in 
producing it simply as a minor second starting from any 
tone. Hence, the song experience where the minor second 
is introduced chromatically is given to the children first; 
then their ‘“‘stunt” performing capacity is appealed to 
and they are given the minor second above doh to sing, the 
teacher always taking care that the tone is thought of as 
doh while the interval is sung to the syllable Ja. They can 
sing it easily enough from direct imitation; but let them 
precede the minor second to /a by singing doh, re, doh first, 
and only the musical ones will show a sufficiently clear 
conception of the nature of the minor second to be able to 
change to it after singing the whole step. 
While the work is commenced with the aid of the key
-P-A-G-E-92
g2 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
names, this is done merely as an introduction, in order to 
make it possible to utilize the skill already possessed in 
singing major and minor seconds. The plan is to gain the 
' , ability to sing such distances independently of any key 
feeling, simply as certain definite intervals. ‘ 
The exercises consist of three formulas sung from the c 
  
        
              
  
  same pitch.

A glance at the above diagram shows that in the first the 
half step is below the initial tone; in the second, above; 
while in the third, the tones both below and above are 
whole steps. The pupil can sing these easily enough if 
they are taken in their key positions; but when thus sung, 
they fail to impress the average mind with the differences 
in distance that the intervals represent. By taking all 
three exercises on the identical tone, their differences are 
brought into juxtaposition in such a way that the pupil
-P-A-G-E-93
 __ — 7 ee 
THIRD YEAR 93 
is vividly conscious of what a whole step or a half step 
from a given tone means. 
The three weeks during which a portion of the music 
time is given to such drill should be adequate to give a 
vivid comprehension of the major and minor seconds to all 
the pupils, even if some do not perform the work readily. 
\The object is not to make the child do it right the first time, 
but to make him ultimately conscious of the nature of the 
two intervals. 
SECOND STEP: RELATIVE AND FIXED PITCH NAMES 
In singing with the sound names, the children are using 
the family names of the tones, and the doh that acts as papa 
and gives his name to the group may be placed on a line 
or on a space; he may be a doh, low or high, but wherever 
he is his entire family cluster about him. Now it is clear 
that to distinguish between a high doh and a low doh we 
must have some definite name to indicate the exact pitch of 
doh. We must know on what street either the high doh or 
“ the low doh lives; in other words, we must have the fixed 
pitch names. 
When the difference between relative and fixed pitch 
names is understood and the necessity for the latter is 
appreciated, the names themselves are given. This step 
may be prefaced by the story of the Greek use of the 
alphabet names, especially if the children have had any of 
the Greek stories; or the fact can be stated that the fixed 
pitch names of the tones are taken from the first seven let- 
ters of the alphabet. The pupils are already familiar with
-P-A-G-E-94
| — 
94 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
the fact that after the first seven tones the first tone re- 
appears an octave higher or lower, and they can be told 
that the same thing occurs with the seven letters of the 
alphabet. 
The pupil is now able to compare an actual experience 
between a song sentence such as ‘“‘I want to go,” sung on 
the tone G (see page 66), and the actual tones required 
from a similar sequence commencing with the same letter. 
The song will call for a half step below G, while the staff , 
will represent a whole step below G. By actually singing 
what the staff calls for with the letter names, and com- 
paring it with what the tune calls for, the pupil is made 
vividly conscious of the necessity for the sharp, in exactly 
the same way that a piano pupil would be, if he did not 
know the keyboard and commenced to play the tune on 
G. He would realize that the white key below G didn’t 
sound right, and he would immediately feel for the tone 
that he wanted. This distinction, which is so easily taught 
at the keyboard, is a difficult one to establish where no 
instrument is used; and without some such device for 
supplying the necessary experience, the knowledge taught 
with reference to the staff is apt to become purely theo- 
retical and\ confused in the minds of a great many of 
the pupils. The basic drill in interval work that such 
practice requires is of greatest importance and becomes 
especially valuable because of its introduction early in the 
course) 
The motive for this work is similar to that of the first 
step; but here there is an additional purpose, i. e., to learn
-P-A-G-E-95
————— 
THIRD YEAR 95 
the actual names of the tones and get the ability to sing 
from the fixed pitch ladder, starting on any letter as the 
initial tone. If the work with the aid of the sound ladder, 
in the previous step, was thoroughly done, the class, as a 
whole, will have no difficulty in singing the fixed pitch 
names. Ji must be borne in mind throughout that these 
pitches must be taken independently of the major key of 
C,—that they must be thought of simply as whole steps and 
half steps,—hence the commencement on A rather than C. 
THIRD STEP: CONNECTING FIXED PITCH NAMES WITH THE 
STAFF 
The problem that the teacher gives the children is how 
to make the staff represent not only doh, re, mi, but also the 
exact pitch or the letter names of the same tones; in other 
words, how to combine both relative and fixed pitch repre- 
sentation. The previous work shows the need for such 
representation and also supplies the material. It remains 
to make the combination. 
The story can be told to the children of how, when the 
staff was invented, people had this same difficulty, which 
they overcame by choosing one of the letters of the fixed 
pitch series and writing it on a line of the staff, thus having 
a particular line represent a particular letter. When one 
line was thus fixed all the other lines and spaces repre- 
sented certain related pitches, which followed in the series 
just as the letters do. The question may now be asked 
what letter the children suppose the early musicians chose 
for naming the staff. By writing a few ornamental G’s in
-P-A-G-E-96
96 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
script on the blackboard it will not be difficult to have them 
realize that the G clef, which they have noticed in music, 
‘The Claves or Clefs '     
is simply an ornamental G, written on the second line of 
the staff, for the purpose of making the clef represent the 
fixed pitch names. 
It will now be necessary to make them observe what has 
happened to the staff through this christening process. 
The first line now represents the pitch of E, because the 
second line has the G clef upon it; the space between, there- 
fore, represents F. Since this line and space represent the 
letters E and F in the fixed series, the distance between 
them will be a minor second. There is the same distance 
between the third line and the space above it (representing 
the letters B and C). The little song sentence Gently 
Rocks My Light Canoe is written on the line and space 
of E and F,   
    ‘_soh. 
This now can be sung to the letter names and the children 
will realize how different it sounds from the way they have 
been in the habit of singing it. In other words, they find
-P-A-G-E-97
EE ee 
THIRD YEAR 97 
that doh cannot now be placed on the staff anywhere we 
choose, but only where the sound ladder and the pitch 
ladder agree. The children practice singing the names of 
the lines and spaces, starting at any letter and passing to 
the one above and the one below, until they appreciate 
the fact that the placing of the G clef on the staff has 
given all the lines and spaces a definite relationship to one 
another. f 
FOURTH STEP: THE SHARP, FLAT, AND KEY SIGNATURE 
We are now ready for the firial step, i. e., to show how 
the staff with the G clef can be made to represent the tone 
relationship of the relative pitch ladder shown on the card- 
board, starting at any tone. The little tune representing 
the intervals of the formula doh, re, doh, ti, doh, that is, a 
major second up and a minor second down, can now be 
sung from the sound ladder with doh on the cardboard 
held against C on the pitch ladder.* The children will 
find that the sound names and the pitch names exactly 
agree. The ladder can now be slipped up to F and the 
same thing tried; there will be a similar agreement be- 
tween the two series of names. 
But if we slip it up to G, and then sing the series with 
the fixed pitch names, we shall find that we are singing the 
formula not as the little tune calls for it, but as if it were 
re, mi, re, doh, re, that is, a major second both up and down. 
In other words, the tone F does not represent the tone we 
want below G. The children know that there is a tone 
* See illustration, page 96. 
Music—7
-P-A-G-E-98
  98 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
there, for they can sing from the sound ladder the formula 
for that pitch. What is lacking is room on the staff to 
represent it. The next sound below G is F, a major 
second away. The tone the children are singing, as in- 
dicated by the sound ladder, they realize is a minor second 
below. The problem now is how to represent this upon 
the staff. 
They will probably announce that a sharp must be 
placed on the space for F; when asked what this will 
represent, they will probably state that it will raise the 
pitch of F. It is best to nip this incorrect form of speech 
in the bud and show that F cannot be raised because it 
represents only a minor second from E, and that if we 
raise its pitch it ceases to be F. What we really sing is an 
augmented prime above F. 
‘As we have no place on the staff between E and G to 
represent this tone, except on the space of F, we do it by 
putting a sharp sign on this space. It is not F raised a 
minor second but is a tone a minor second higher, repre- 
sented in the place of F by means of a sharp. 
The same formula can be repeated at A, when the neces- 
sity for a sharp on the line of G will be appreciated. By 
holding the tone ladder up against B, repeating the song 
and comparing it with the series required by the letter 
names, we find not only that the tone below is too low, as 
in the other cases, but that the tone above is also too low. 
Thus the possibility is realized of using the sharp on any 
line or space which represents a sound a half tone lower 
than that we wish to sing. 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
THIRD YEAR 99 
When the function of the sharp has thus been learned 
thoroughly, that of the flat is studied, and the necessity for 
a sign to take the place of a tone that is represented too 
high on the staff is noted. Taking such a song sentence 
as I want to go so far away, doh, ti, doh, re, mi, fa, fa, 
mi, and singing from F, the pupils find no difficulty in 
  
      
    
    
      introducing all the tones. rit.

I want to go so far a - way. 
Now let them sing the same series, but with the letter 
names, repeating the tone of A often enough to destroy the 
_ tendency that the memory of the song would have to make 
them sing a minor second above instead of the major 
second which the A B represents. The children recognize 
that while the distance from the space of A to the line of B 
represented the distance between mi and fa when they 
sang with the doh, re, mi names, when they sing the same 
thing with the names that the staff calls for, the distance 
between A and B requires a major second instead of a minor 
second. In other words, they discover by actual singing 
that mito fa requires a minor second and A to B represents a 
major second. They will be made to see that they are sing- 
ing the tone halfway between A and B, and that there is no 
way to represent this on the staff, for the next tone above   
Ais B,a major second. They now realize that the sharp 
sign they have been using will not do, because this repre- 
sents a tone above that of the line or space on which it 
occurs.

OO V0 ee 
100 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
Now the necessity for a new sign may be fully developed 
so that even the more thoughtless children will understand 
. what is required. As in the case of the sharp, the flat 
should not be given until the need for it has been thor- 
oughly felt and the object that it will accomplish realized 
by the entire class. Then the flat sign can be put upon the 
line B and the children will perceive that in singing with 
the fixed pitch names, as required by the staff after the 
flat is used, they are singing exactly the same tone that 
the song requires. ; 
They can now be shown that this relation between mi 
and ja may be represented on lines or spaces a major 
second apart. Thus in singing G as mi the space of A can 
be utilized to represent ja simply by placing a flat on it, 
exactly as in the case of A, where a major second was re- 
quired by the pitch names and a minor second by the 
\ sound names. 
™ When the functions of the sharp and flat are thoroughly 
understood, the pupils are ready for the explanation of the 
key signature. Taking the cardboard with the doh, re, 
mi names and placing it so that doh will come against 
G in the letter column, we find that the two series 
agree with the one exception that F sharp is required 
to represent the sound #i below doh. This relation can be 
grasped by singing both pitch names and relative names. 
Since F sharp has become a regular member of the family 
when.doh comes on G, it will save time in writing it to place 
it at the very beginning; hence, it is put on the fifth line 
where it is readily seen, and thereafter every note written  
-P-A-G-E-101
| — | 
THIRD YEAR IoL 
on the fifth line or F is understood to mean F sharp. This, 
the children are told, is called the key signature and always 
necessitates that doh shall come on G. Now by placing the 
ladder on the cardboard so that doh will come on F, it will 
be discovered that ja requires B flat to represent it, and B 
flat therefore becomes a regular member of the family 
of tones in which doh comes on F. Hence, by placing B 
flat at the beginning of the staff we imply that doh is 
on F, 
Parallel to this work, the teacher carries on song sing- 
ing which requires drill in tone work, articulation, and ex- 
pression of the idea. In the process of learning these 
songs, the accurate observation work of pulse, duration, 
and pitch of the previous grades is continued. At the 
same time, the children are made to understand that this. 
accurate learning cf the staff is the main business of the 
singing period, and that a test of their efficiency will be 
given tham at the end of the work dealing with it. Its ac- 
complishment requires three or four months. 
The latter part of the third year work will be taken up 
with practice in the relationship of the three keys C, F, 
and G, songs being used that make transitions from one to 
the other and cause the pupils to appreciate the change of 
key. There should also be considerable writing of the 
same song sentences in the three keys, both on the black- 
board and on music paper, the modifying sharp or flat 
being placed as the key signature. The work now intro- 
duced will apply this knowledge and develop further the 
notation of rhythm.    
-P-A-G-E-102
  102 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
THIRD STAGE: FRACTIONAL PULSE 
Short motifs similar to those previously mentioned are 
now written in the three keys, reviewing the time values 
already learned. Sequences of three or four tones from 
songs may be sung by the teacher or one of the pupils, and 
the class may write them in three keys. 
Although the children in their rote songs have sung all 
varieties of rhythm, the forms they have learned to recog- 
nize are limited to the pulse represented as a quarter note, 
the union of two pulses or half note, the division of a pulse 
into two or the eighth note, and the dotted half and the 
whole note. These same values with their equivalent 
rests have been used in both simple and compound meter. 
The compound meter required one new sign, the dotted 
quarter; but as the addition of the dot to a quarter exactly 
completed the pulse, leaving no fraction of time to be rep- 
resented by a fractional pulse, it resembled in this respect 
the dotted half and was easily grasped. 
The pupils are now ready to study the entirely new effect 
of placing a dot after a note when the dot leaves a fraction 
of a pulse to be represented by a succeeding note. For 
instance, if a dot is placed after a quarter note the tone 
represented lasts one and a half pulses, and a half pulse 
note is needed to complete the second pulse. Again, if a 
dot is placed after a half pulse note the resulting fractional 
note required is a quarter of a pulse. This produces an 
entirely different musical effect from that resulting from 
the use of dots where no fraction of a pulse is left over. 
The musical movement or idea thus represented should
-P-A-G-E-103
Se ee 
THIRD VEAR 103 
be thoroughly grasped, together with the comprehension of 
the sign that represents it. The most characteristic feature 
to be borne in mind is that while the fractional tone that 
follows a dotted pulse or dotted half pulse seems to fill out 
the time in the pulse of the note preceding, it is sung as if 
it belonged to the tone immediately following. If, for in- 
stance, one were to sing the Batile Hymn oj the Republic, 
in which the dotted half pulse is constantly occurring, he 
would notice that the quick, or fractional tones, though 
they seem to the eye to be joined to the tone that precedes, 
are heard as if belonging to the tone that follows. Their 
representation in the printed music gives them as exact 
fractions of preceding pulses instead of relating them to 
what follows. 
   
     : So 
The same characteristic is true of the dotted pulse. If 
one should sing the first two measures of America, he would 
notice that the tone, which comes on the word ‘“‘of,” 
while represented as a fraction of the preceding pulse, is 
sung as if united to the last note of second measure. The 
cesura is after the word ‘tis,’ and would be impossible 
after the word ‘‘of.”

The first thing that we should do, then, is to call the chil- 
dren’s attention to the effect produced by this way of    ee   
  a

| grouping fractional pulses. Familiar songs which involve 
the dotted pulse or half pulse are sung; such are The Star 
Spangled Banner, Home, Sweet Home, The Red, White 
and Blue; in fact, there is hardly a song that does not 
supply many illustrations. It is best to take strongly 
rhythmic tunes which the children have sung by rote, and 
as they sing have them swing the pulses and think how 
the tones are related to them. It will help greatly to have 
on the board a diagram representing the tunes,—by circles 
and dashes,—to show the relation of the short to the long 
tones, and make it clear that the former belong to what 
follows rather than to what precedes. 
After this peculiarity has been carefully observed, the 
way it is expressed in notation will be studied. The chil- 
dren will notice that in writing the tune the fractional tones 
are part of the time measurements of the preceding tones; 
that in this respect dotted pulses and half pulses are alike, 
but that there is a fundamental difference by which they 
can always be distinguished: the dotted pulse requires not 
only the pulse on which the tone begins but the commence- 
ment of a new pulse before the fractional tone and thus it 
follows the second pulse, while in the dotted half pulse 
the fractional tone is sung just before the next pulse; the 
dotted pulse and its fraction complete two pulses; the dot- 
ted half pulse and its fraction complete exactly one pulse. 
It will be seen in this presentation of dotted notes that 
the attention is first drawn to the musical effect, then to 
the idea itself, and lastly to its representation in relation 
to the idea and not in relation to the arithmetical problem  
-P-A-G-E-105
THIRD YEAR 105 
which the notation presents. The latter is really diametric- 
ally opposed to the musical effect, since it represents the 
fractional note as part of what precedes, while the musical 
idea requires the fraction of a note to be united to what 
follows it. 
After this principle has been represented, it is prac- 
tically applied to motifs. For instance, the scale is written 
as dotted quarters and eighths, then as dotted eighths and 
sixteenths, and is sung in both ways, the pulses being 
swung meanwhile. It is also sung at different rates of 
speed, until the children realize that the dotted quarter 
followed by an eighth is not a longer representation of the ! 
same effect, as is the dotted eighth followed by a sixteenth, 
but one entirely different, due to the entrance of the second 
pulse into the first. For if we change the speed of our 
pulses and sing the dotted pulse followed by an eighth so 
that it is faster than an eighth followed by a sixteenth, the 
effect is still the same. 
FOURTH STAGE: APPLICATION AND DRILL 
Motifs are now taken from songs in which the melody 
moves in pulse tones, and the children are asked to change 
these according to their fancy by introducing dotted pulses 
and half pulses. They should write both the original as 
well as the changed version on the board and the class 
should sing both. With this increase of their knowledge 
the children should be practically able to write the notation 
of their own songs. 
The children now have an understanding of the notation,    
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
for all the essentials have been worked out from the feeling 
of the idea in music. This principle has been indicated by 
action and diagram until the idea has been thoroughly 
grasped, and then the notation that represents the idea has 
been learned. What they need now is sufficient drill in 
the application of this knowledge. The rest of the third» 
year is taken up with making perfectly clear the staff rep- 
resentation of both pitch and rhythm so far illustrated. 
With the commencement of the fourth year, as will be 
seen in the following chapters, systematic drill will develop 
a technique for a sufficiently rapid use of this material to 
make it musically practical.

CHAPTER X 
INTRODUCTORY TO THE SECOND OR SYN- 
THETIC PHASE OF MUSIC STUDY 
THE purpose of this chapter is to explain the principles 
that will govern the work in the next three grades and ‘to 
compare it with that of the work of the first three grades, 
in order to give a clearer idea of the principles underlying 
the work as a whole. 
The pupils have been learning the exact differences of the 
pitch and time durations of the tones occurring in their 
songs, At the same time this analytic process has been 
carried on with reference to the song or part of the song 
as a whole, so that the musical significance of what was 
being learned should not be lost. The necessity for recog- 
nizing the separate tones as parts of a melodic movement, 
or musical thought, is especially urgent in music in which 
analytic study so soon loses its significance for lack of 
connection with what it serves. Such connection is not as 
readily lost in studies where the material is presented to 
the eye, as, for instance, in nature work. 
The way in which the study of a flower is taken up will 
serve to illustrate our purpose. From the beginning the 
impression of the thing as a whole is perfectly clear in the 
107
-P-A-G-E-108
    
108 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
mind; the ideas of dandelion and violet cannot possibly be 
confused The aim of the teacher, therefore, is to lead her 
students to discover how these beautiful-wholes are made 
up of complicated parts; hence by a process of analysis 
the flowers are dissected into calyx and corolla, stamens 
and pistil, and these in turn are further subdivided. The 
teacher has no fear that anywhere in the process the parts 
of a dandelion may be confused with those of a violet. In 
other words, the consciousness of the whole is never lost 
because of emphasis upon the relationship of its parts. It 
would be absurd to suggest that the teacher while showing 
how the petals of a rose unfold, runs any risk of having her 
pupils think they are examining a cabbage. This ex- 
amination of parts is as far as nature study goes. 
On the other hand, in the analysis of music, the relation- 
ship of the part to the whole must be constantly kept in 
mind. In this it resembles manual training in which the 
parts of the sled or stool that are being made are constantly 
thought of in relationship to the completed article pres- 
ent inthe mind. In this respect the purely creative artist 
requires constructiveness in a far greater degree than the 
mechanic. In the beginning, the object he is to creat 
exists only in the mind, and he gradually makes this mani- 
fest by combining parts. He is distinguished from the 
scientist in that the scientist is interested in parts because 
they are elements, whereas the artist cares about them only 
as they may influence the effect in the whole conception. | 
\\The aim of all his work is so to relate the parts that one 
strong, dominant impression shall be made; if he be a

painter, all the separate colors must combine to form one 
tone. ‘ 
\\The composer, like other artists, aims to produce a 
certain effect of the whole. By means of various tone 
relationships woven together, he expresses one theme, 
which would be altered were any of the component parts 
omitted. But in his effort to present his composition as 
an entirety, the musician meets an obstacle foreign to 
other artists. “Music, unlike painting or sculpture, or even 
architecture, does not immediately impress one as a uni- 
fied whole. It_has to be "presented in time _through_an- 
infinite series of effects; tone succeeds tone in a melody, 
chord succeeds chord in a symphony. “Tone and chord 
must be held in memory and related to larger and larger 
“units, however unperceived the process may be, until at 
last we have one of the most complex demands on the 
synthetic ability of the human mind. 
Unfortunately, human experience affords but little op- 
portunity to prepare for this demand. The ordinary naive 
experience of the race produced the foundations of music 
in folk song and dance, but between these and the vast 
tonal creations of Wagner or Beethoven there is a gap that 
this folk music does not supply. Where talent and en- 
vironment are favorable this may be easily bridged; but 
unfortunately for the large majority, general experience 
and average ability do not suffice for bridging this chasm. 
An order to give the large majority the possibility of en- 
joying music otherwise beyond their comprehension, it is 
“préeminently the function of the public schools to supply
-P-A-G-E-110
  Ilo EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
the needed training in musical synthesis, or the relating of 
the parts to t ition. 
' In the first three years of school training, starting with 
the song learned as a whole from imitation, we lead the 
pupil step by step to recognize the part that tone color and 
manipulation play in the expression of the whole; in other 
words, we give him ideas of interpretation. Then, too, 
by means of acting and picturing, and finally by nota- 
tion, he has learned the subtle tone relationships that pro- 
duce the movement of the tune. Thus he has developed 
ideas of structure. 
The aid of music teaching is primarily to make possi- 
ble a deeper appreciation. ‘Appreciation is constructive. 
Hence, the work of the following three years utilizes the 
power gained in observing parts in relation to the whole, 
for it starts, not with the whole as in the first three years, 
but with the parts themselves. ‘The aim is to have the 
pupils conceive the whole from the parts, Therefore the 
thetic process, doing for music what we do for architec- 
ture, painting, or literature when we appreciate a building, 
a_picture, or a_poem, by getting the effect of the whole, 
_through becoming conscious of how the parts unite to pro-_ duce lps 
~ This process may scem to lead merely to the attainment 
of the skill necessary for sight singing. But while sight 
singing is the immediate aim, the real aim is to attain the 
artistic power of grasping the unity of the separate impres- 
sions that the eye or the ear conveys to us.
-P-A-G-E-111

SYNTHETIC PHASE OF MUSIC STUDY 111 
On the other hand, that it is impossible to master the 
constructive side of music essential to full appreciation, 
unless one first goes through the analysis requisite to make 
clear the nature of the musical elements, will be evident as 
soon as the relation between the analytic and the synthetic 
_ process is understood. 
™. The first three years’ training has been concerned with 
learning the musical ideas and their notation. The pupils 
are now ready to test the knowledge by putting musi 
ideas together. In the following chapter the first step of 
this synthetic process will be described. 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  CHAPTER XI 
FOURTH YEAR WORK: PHRASE CONCEPTION 
FIRST STAGE: ACCURACY IN PHRASE CONCEPTION 
In order that a beginner may think out how a musical 
passage goes, it is necessary that the passage have a form 
distinct and definite enough to enable him to grasp it as a 
whole; at the same time it must not be so long that it will 
be beyond his capacity to relate all its parts. If the reader 
will sing the first two tones of America (see page 114) he 
will not necessarily be conscious of any characteristic idea 
in connection with the form that the sound represents. Let 
him add the third and fourth tone and a fairly definite 
form will be established; still, the passage does not seem to 
be complete. Now let him add the next tones, making six 
in all, and he will have a clearly defined passage. The 
passage is so clear and well defined that it forms, as it 
were, the text of the entire composition, being repeated 
in different pitches with only slight changes, and these 
in the form of variations rather than of radical changes. 
Take another illustration. If the reader will hum over the 
first six tones of The Star Spangled Banner he will find that 
the first four tones group together, as do the last two, and 
112

that these groups unite to form the rhythmic text of the 
tune.

It is obvious that if we should take a portion of one of 
these units by itself, it would require considerable musician- 
ship to decide from exactly what tune it was taken, but he 
would be a very dull person who could not recognize the 
complete unit. This unit in both these tunes forms a 
complete design which keeps recurring in the remainder of 
the tune, and which gives it a definite character. Hence, in 
training a beginner to grasp the complete musical thought, 
we should take such an organic element for our unit. — 
If the reader will sing America and The Star Spangled 
Banner through, he will see that the rhythm of the phrase 
expressed in the first six notes in both tunes keeps re- 
curring, though it is almost always more or less changed. 
These changes occur sometimes in the number of tones 
used in a pulse, making a variation in duration; more often, 
however, change is in the distance of pitch interval or me- 
lodic curve, while sometimes it is in both pitch and dura- 
tion, leaving only the metrical number of pulses to show 
the relationship of thought to what precedes and follows. 
It is evident that there are two essentials in the study of 
such elements: first, the grasping of the phrase itself; and, 
Music—8

second, the ability to recognize its main features under the 
variations through which it passes. We can recognize in 
both these tunes a number of familiar passages where the 
phrase is well marked. In making this point clear to the 
children these phrases are put on the board, under one 
another. For instance, if we write the tune America in 
two-measure groups, we shall have it in phrases.

  Phrases

-P-A-G-E-115
I — 
FOURTH VEAR WORK II5 
There will be seven groups, all alike with reference to 
metrical grouping, each containing two measures of three ~ 
pulses each. The first, second, fourth, and fifth groups 
vary in pitch as well as in melodic curve, but are alike in 
their duration values; the third, sixth, seventh, and eighth 
vary in durative elements as well as in pitch and melodic 
curve; these variations, however, are only in parts, so that 
the relation to the original is perfectly evident. After a few 
tunes have been thus analyzed the pupils see how changes 
‘in pitch, melodic curv in pitch, melodic curve, and duration are introduced in 
the_metrical pattern, without departing so far from the 
original as to prevent recognition of the relationship. _ 
For further practice the phrase of a familiar tune, or 
of a new one, is taken and the pupils see how many effect- | 
ive variations they can write for themselves. This may be 
done by one at the board, the others criticising and sug- 
gesting; or separately at the desks, with only the original 
phrase written on the board. In the latter case, each pupil 
sings the variations he has written while the class state 
whether the changes introduced are in pitch or rhythm, 
or both combined, and in what pulses. It must always 
be borne in mind that the changes should be only varia- 
tions; through them all must be felt the original. 
There can be little doubt of the value of such an exercise 
in developing the very qualities essential to the aim of 
_ public school music. It draws attention to the idea, brings 
out the structure and nature of the melody, and prepares 
the student to follow the complex designs that hat the great     
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  116 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
SECOND STAGE: SPEED IN PHRASE CONCEPTION 
But this training can be made more intensive if we add 
to it the skill needed by the sight singer. The sight singer 
must not only grasp the original design and hold it firmly 
through the multitude of changes that it undergoes, he 
must also do it rapidly, thinking ahead of his singing, for 
his whole ability to sing at sight rests on his power of 
rapid comprehension. Like the reader of poetry, he must 
see a line or two ahead. This additional feature we shall 
term speed work, for it is necessary for the pupil not 
simply to grasp the idea eventually, but to do it with 
sufficient speed to enable him to sing the passage. If this 
process that precedes the singing is definite, the production 
rarely causes difficulty. 
To give training in this division of work an unfamiliar 
phrase is written,—at first one not longer than an idea of 
three or four notes,—which, after it has been fairly seen, 
is quickly rubbed out, and the children are asked to sing 
the passage. By gradually increasing the length and com- 
plexity of the unit there will be a steady advance in the 
capacity to see and comprehend. Another way to attain 
the same result is to point out a phrase on the blackboard 
staff without writing the notes. This is easier than the 
preceding in one respect: the moving of the pointer suggests 
the rhythm. A third method utilizes the geography charts 
which most rooms have. A number of short phrases can 
be written on the board before the children come in and 
the map pulled down over them. By once raising the 
map and promptly lowering it again, the children get a
-P-A-G-E-117
FOURTH YEAR WORK TE 
rapid glance at the passage; they can sing as much as they 
have been able to grasp. 
The essential thing in this work is that the pupil shall 
not spell note by note, but shall get a conception of the 
phrase as a whole before the first note is uttered. This is 
one of the most difficult things to accomplish, and in the 
early stages of the work even the most experienced teacher 
may be deceived as to which process the pupils are follow- 
ing, because they are so skillful at singing without thinking 
that they can spell out passages fast enough to make them 
sound as if the correct mental process had taken place. 
But the limit of this rapid spelling is soon reached, and 
just at the time when musicianly work is expected from 
children in the upper grades, we unfortunately discover 
that the very foundation of right musical thinking has not 
been laid. Hence the need of the strictest attention in 
order to make sure that in the first steps of phrase reading 
it is a legitimate reading and not a spelling. If this first 
step is taken correctly, practice will develop skill. If not, 
the ability to spell rapidly from note to note will prove in- 
adequate just when the teacher is expecting to see the 
fruit of her labor. 
Children of this age enjoy speed work intensely. It is 
a challenge to their ability, and a chance to show their 
skill and power of concentration. The difficulty lies in 
seeing that every individual does the work, for it is easy 
to get an apparent class response while in reality a few of 
the leaders are giving the idea and the majority are merely 
following. In this event it becomes a stimulating exercise
-P-A-G-E-118
ee ee | rane 
118 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
only for those who least require it, and entirely leaves out 
the slow and dull who really need the practice. This 
result can easily follow and the teacher hardly be aware of 
it. The way to prevent it is by careful selection of the 
material, to the end that it may exactly suit the capacity 
of the pupils. If the passage is too difficult or the changes 
allowed are so radical that the original is lost, a large ma- 
jority of the class will derive no benefit from the work. 
All the exercises so far described in this chapter are 
supplementary to the reading of the music that is used 
, in the grades, and should be carried on in connection with 
it. If the phrases in the songs of the reader are taken 
as material, the exercises become a stimulating aid, not 
only for learning the songs rapidly but for the musicianly 
comprehension of their structure. 
Constant comparison can be made Siete the structure 
of the music and its adaptation to the words. In a good 
song book much attention is paid to this element and the 
words become a helpful index to the structural thought 
of the melody. Unfortunately there are a great many 
songs—some of them fine ones—in which the form of the 
melodic thought and the form of the poetic thought do not 
agree. The first measure of America is an unfortunate 
example of disagreement between the accent of the pulse 
and that of the foot. Where singing is done with proper 
consideration of the ideas of interpretation and structure, 
the pupils become critics of the material given them and 
it is easy to awaken their interest when they find a really 
expressive song. Their pleasure now is not confined to a  
-P-A-G-E-119
FOURTH YEAR WORK 119 
senseless reaction to its jingle or sentimental sensuousness 
but is a real appreciation of the work, for this appreciation 
is being judged for its expressive value in relation to ideas. 
THIRD STAGE: LEARNING NEW KEYS; RHYTHM PRACTICE 
The phrase work, with the training in musicianship that 
it demands, is of so great importance that it"can well be 
made the chief work in structural ideas for the entire year. 
In connection with this it will be well to enlarge the knowl- 
edge of keys by applying the principles learned in the 
third grade. 
The essential thing to bear in mind is that in passing 
into a key requiring one more sharp of one less flat the 
fourth of the old key becomes the seventh of the new; 
while in passing into keys requiring one more flat or one 
less sharp the opposite is true, for then the seventh of the 
old key becomes the fourth of the new. Memorizing the 
relationship of the new doh or tonic to the new signature 
helps in the quick and sure recognition of the key. The 
last sharp will be the seventh, while the last flat will be the 
fourth of the key. By this method the keys are presented 
in their relational aspect and a basis for appreciation of 
modulation is laid. 
The advance work in tone measurement for the fourth 
year will be special practice in compound rhythm. This 
introduces no new duration values, but the swing, or go, 
of its pulses needs practice. The pupils by this time will 
have had plenty of experience in their songs, hence all that 
is needed is to associate the sound of the compound pulse  
-P-A-G-E-120
eee wae ; 7

120 JBDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
with its appearance. The first two units in the even and 
uneven ratios given in Chapter XV, page 152, should be 
practiced in monotone in various combinations until the 
students are familiar with the swing of the pulse. 
It would help to make frequent comparison with the 
similar ratios in simple grouping until the distinction be- 
tween simple and compound can be readily conceived. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
  CHAPTER XII 
SPECIAL WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR: FORMAL 
STUDY OF TONE AND KEY RELATIONSHIP 
Tue regular work of the fifth and sixth years merely 
develops further what was introduced in the fourth, i. e., 
the passing from the notation to its conception and ex- 
pression; or, in other words, learning to think rapidly from 
the way the music looks to the way it sounds, and then 
singing it. Nothing fundamentally new can be introduced 
either in pitch or in notation, with perhaps the exception 
of syncopation, in which the metrical regularity of the 
pulses is disturbed. The complexity of syncopation can be 
easily studied in connection with the songs in which it 
occurs, this practice being sufficient for the use of the 
general student. 
There is, however, some further technical knowledge 
which is of great value in general musical training. The 
introduction of a limited amount of such technical work is 
for the aid its practice gives in music @epreciason. This 
technical work is needed during the“fifth and sixth years, 
but its exact place may be regulated by the efficiency of 
the individual class. We shall, however, describe the 
121 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  122 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC } 
various kinds of work in the order in which they would 
naturally come in this period. 
FIRST STAGE: THE FUNDAMENTALS OF VOICE CONTROL 
In the fifth grade, for instance, it would be well to de- 
velop a more precise knowledge of the essentials of good 
tone. So far, all the work done in tones has been ac- 
complished by focusing attention on the nature of what is 
being expressed. Even in singing scales, chord passages, 
and exercises on vowels, where the aim has been correct 
intervals and pure vowel tones, the expressive purpose of 
what is done has not been lost. Scales, chords, and vowels 
have been so sung that they would be significant—would 
have a meaning in them because of the pleasure they 
awaken. And in trying to make them significant, the 
pupil has made them beautiful. In other words, all the 
study has been so planned that the child should not lose 
the connection between what is done to produce good tone, 
and the idea or reason for doing it. Consequently, by the 
time he reaches the fifth grade, he possesses fairly well- 
established habits of good tone production. The aim of 
the work now is to formulate the principles that underlie 
these habits, in order to enable him to act with greater 
certainty and sureness. What is done is identical with 
what is accomplished in language, where, after habits of 
correct speaking have been established, not by rule alone 
but by appeal to meaning, the pupil takes up, in the latter 
part of his school days, the formal study of the principles 
of good usage as embodied in grammar,
-P-A-G-E-123
DO 
SPECIAL WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 123 
So with regard to tone production, formal rules for some 
of the steps in attaining required results are now presented. 
Ever since entering school the pupils have had experience 
of the closeness between sitting up straight, good breath, 
and tone quality. This experience is formulated as the 
first rule for good singing, i. e., that the tone is controlled 
by the organs with which we-breathe. This doesn’t mean 
that we fill the lungs, then tighten up the throat and hold 
the air in, much as the small boy does with the paper bag 
he bursts; but it does mean that the tone is controlled by 
the muscles about the chest, ribs, abdomen, and back, no 
one held rigid against the others, but all in control and 
moving together. Whatever is done consciously to produce 
good tone is through this breath control. 
. The second principle is that all the muscles about the 
throat and jaw must be loose and flexible. It is necessary 
to state this rule because children knowing that the tone 
is produced in the throat, will probably as soon as they 
endeavor to get good tone, unconsciously make effort in 
the throat; this effort tightens it, thus doing much mischief 
instead of good. 
The third principle is that the body itself is the in- 
strument that sounds. With every change of pitch and of 
vowel, whenever these tones are well-made, there goes on a 
corresponding change, especially in the head. Itis possible 
for the body so to reénforce and develop the tone started 
by the throat, that such changes become practically the 
chief factors in tone quality and color. This vibration 
indicates a harmony between what starts the tone and  
-P-A-G-E-124
  124 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
what gives it character. When the tone is felt as being 
entirely in the throat, without the accompaniment of this 
sympathetic vibration, especially of the lips, face,-and nose, 
it shows that part of the organs which should produce the 
tone are not at work, and the resulting tone will be hard 
and coarse. A flabby, devitalized body has the same effect 
on the tone quality of the voice as the loosening of the 
joints would have on the tones of a violin. Hen¢e, it is 
important to draw attention to the need for a sympathetic 
vibration of the body with the tones which we sing. The 
formulation of these three principles will help in strengthen- 
ing the good habits already formed and will keep bad ones 
from being developed. 
All this can be made practical, however, only when 
presented by good example; for imitation, after all, is the 
main thing to depend upon. At the same time, since the 
pupils have had experience and are sufficiently mature, 
it is necessary to arouse a mental consciousness of the 
agents employed in good tone. In the fifth grade the chil- 
dren’s voices have not yet begun to change and there is 
still time enough ahead of them in school to apply the 
principles taught. They have had four years of practice 
to supply them with the necessary experience upon which 
to base this technical knowledge. The efficiency of many 
public speakers would be vastly increased if only good 
habits of tone production and an intelligent comprehen- 
sion of the essentials had been started in childhood. Even. 
if the early application had not accomplished much, these 
would have borne fruit in maturer years.

SECOND STAGE: DEVELOPMENT OF THE MINOR MODES 
Before formulating the experience which the pupils 
have had in their songs with reference to the minor mode, 
it will be well to consider the problem by itself, since 
among teachers there is considerable divergence of practice. 
One group makes tonality the central thought. To them 
each fonic has two aspects or tonalities—the major and the 
minor—and the nature of a tonic is not thoroughly under- 
stood unless these two tonalities are developed together. A 
second group of teachers emphasize the identity of the 
tones employed as expressed by the signature. To them 
every key signature has two tonalities; but the tonalities, 
instead of being on the same tonic as with the first group, 
are on different tonics, a minor third apart. Those who 
emphasize the unity of the tonic thought would naturally 
first take C major and then C minor, thus changing sig- 
natures, but keeping the same tonic. Those who empha- 
size unity because of the identical tones employed, put their 
stress on identity of key signature, and in studying C major 
would relate A minor as being an identical group of tones, 
but a shifting in emphasis taking Ja rather than doh as 
tonic, thus producing the relative minor mode. 
In the plan about to be given here, I have followed the 
second procedure. The reason for this lies in the practice 
common in America of not changing the key names in the 
ordinary modulations that occur: for instance, in going 
from C to the key of G major, G F sharp will not be sung as 
anew doh, ti, but as soh, ji, in spite of the decided presence
-P-A-G-E-126
  126 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC | 
of the doh, tifeeling. The reason for this practice is probably 
partly in the nature of staff notation, and partly because 
the new key, for the very reason that we expect the return 
of the opening key, is not so completely established in the 
mind as a change in the sound names would imply. In 
the greater number of modulatory changes, pupils both 
young and old prefer to struggle on through a modulation 
with the tones, partly contradicting what the key names 
suggest. Thus so little practice in changing key names 
is obtained that wherever the change would be easier, it is 
not employed for lack of facility to do it readily. For this 
reason, in teaching the minor mode, as well as the related 
key group treated in the fourth stage of this chapter, the 
plan has been to awaken a consciousness of the changed 
key feeling that results from modulating into the tonic 
dominant, and the three relative minors, while continuing 
to use the key names of the original tonic. Through the 
frequency with which these related keys come, the pupils 
learn to adjust themselves to the modifications that the 
sound names of the original tonic undergo from the pres- 
ence of these related modulations. Thus the key names 
are not those of a single key, but those of the tonic of the 
piece, and gradually acquire the wider significance that 
the modulations introduce. This association is helped by 
the modified names that are introduced for the tones ac- 
tually changed from those employed in connection with 
the original key. In accordance with this plan, the minor 
will be introduced first as relative minor, where no change 
in key signature is required, rather than as tonic minor,
-P-A-G-E-127

SPECIAL WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 127 
where an unusual change in key signature is necessitated. 
When we consider how rarely pieces beginning in the 
minor are used in schools, and how by far the larger part 
of the children’s experience with the minor up to this time 
has been in the form of passing from a major tonic to its 
relative minor, the treatment of the relative rather than the 
tonic minor seems fairly consistent with experience. On 
the other hand, to start out with a minor song and call its 
tonic Ja when no relative major is present, seems a gross 
inconsistency, for the excuse of identity of key signature 
is not present. In dealing with such a song as The Jolly 
Miller, after beginning as I have done and developing the 
sense of the new tonic feeling on G, many would prefer, 
instead of keeping the relative sound names of the major, 
to call the new tonic doh and its minor third mi. This would 
greatly help in developing the true quality of the minor 
tonic, but for a successful carrying out, it would necessitate 
that the same practice with reference to a tonic minor as 
is given to the tonic major be carried as far back as the 
second grade, when the nature of the major tonic was first 
established. Since little opportunity is given for singing 
songs which commence in the minor, it has not seemed wise 
to go into the distinctions necessary for presenting this 
method of teaching it, however valuable it might be from 
the point of view of musicianship. The minor as here pre- 
sented is consistent with the experience of the pupils with 
reference both to tone and notation. Its inconsistency lies 
only in singing the minor tonic to /a and in the changes 
hereby involved.
-P-A-G-E-128
128 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
Turning now to the way the minor thought will be pre- 
sented to the pupils, we must bear in mind that they have 
not only sung many minor passages, but that they have 
had an occasional song which began and ended in the minor 
mode. These songs have been learned chiefly by rote and 
the minor effects have been observed only for their ex- 
pressive values, without any attempt at explaining how 
they were produced. 
Some such song as The Jolly Miller is now placed on the 
board and the children notice that, although the signature 
indicates the key of B flat, the doh of the key does not control 
the tune as it does in most of the songs they have sung. 
Owing to their previous experience there will be no diffi- 
culty in drawing from them the necessary observations that 
the /a and mi of this tune seem to be the important tones 
corresponding to doh and soh of their usual experience. 
Other minor tunes are sung in other keys and the children 
make their first generalization that the signature does 
not always tell that doh and soh with their brilliant qualities 
are to be the ruling tones of the key, but that their places 
can be taken by /a and mi, the whole group being thus 
given a darker and more somber effect. Comparisons of 
major and minor tunes are made by singing them in turn. 
and focusing attention on these two groups of tones. If 
the teacher is wise and patient she will be able to lead a. 
large majority of the class to feel that the /a and mi of the 
minor tunes have the same relationship in the minor 
group that the doh and soh have in the major.

SPECIAL WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 131 
the recognition of its tone quality are of the utmost im- 
portance, not only for learning the minor, but also for a 
clearer understanding of what the tonic quality really is. 
When this has been thoroughly felt, the reason for calling 
Ja number one of the minor key, as we have called doh num- 
ber one of the major key, will be grasped, as will the con- 
sistency of naming the minor from the pitch or letter name 
of Ja its tonic. The children will now see that The Jolly 
Miller, which according to their former knowl¢dge seemed 
to be in the key of B flat, is really in the key of G minor. 
Enough minor songs may be given the children to show 
that a major signature can represent a minor key, The way 
in which the same signature can stand for both major and 
minor tunes can be well illustrated simply by transposing 
a tune, or part of a tune, so that a melody which began on 
doh shall begin on Ja. It will be seen that while such a 
transposition from major to minor does not alter the es- 
sential outline of a tune, yet it does give the same group of 
tones a dark instead of a bright aspect. The difference is 
comparable to that between the same object as it appears 
in sunlight and in shadow. 
The essential thing for the pupil to bear in mind is that 
when, on beginning to sing the sound names from the sig- 
nature, as has been his custom, he finds /a and mi the prom- 
inent tones, he must think of the group as being in the 
minor. He must give to these tones not only the color they 
have had in the major, but, more important still, the 
added qualities that their position as first and fifth (tonic 
and dominant) of a minor key demands. He will have  
-P-A-G-E-132
132 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
to be cautioned that hereafter in starting keys, he must 
do something more than look at the signature; he must 
also look at the music and see whether doh or /a is the 
important tone. In other words, he must imagine how the 
music would sound. If the qualities of Ja and mi are pre- 
dominant, the piece is in the minor and must be called 
after the pitch name of Ja rather than of doh. 
After the qualities of the Ja and mi in the minor have 
been thus observed and studied, the chromatic tones that 
so often occur in the minor can be observed. For example, 
just before /a in a minor group instead of soh we may often 
have soh sharp, which we sing to the sound name si. By 
their previous practice the children are able to sing /a, soh, 
Ja and Ja, si, la and can be made to notice that changing 
the soh to si helps to give /a its important position, which 
makes it seem like the tonic of the key. Taking a tune in 
which the melodic form of the minor occurs, they find 
that fa as well as soh is often changed, especially in up- 
ward passages. 
When _all-this~observation-and-analysis has been-care- 
fully worked out from the songs, the work requiring a 
number of weeks, the children are ready to study the scale 
formation of the minor. They will have no difficulty in 
singing what some call the natural minor scale, i. e., the 
sound names just as they occur in the major but beginning 
and ending with Ja. We take this series first, in order that 
the relation between major and minor keys may be well 
illustrated. The fact that the pupils have had soh sharped 
in many of their minor songs makes them see the necessity 
 
-P-A-G-E-133
SPECIAL WORK OF THE FIFTH YEAR 133 
for a scale which substitutes si for soh. In order to sing 
this effect readily it would be well to practice mi, fa, mi and 
la, si, la (above) in succession, one requiring a half step up 
and the other a half step down. Then mi, ja, la or la, si, 
mi can be sung, and finally a half step following the wide 
skip may be introduced,—mi, ja, si, Ja and Ja, si, ja, mi. 
i | | { T | : + | 
Nothing has been said of singing the augmented second. 
Ability to sing the unfamiliar intervals lies not simply in 
recognizing the nature of the distance between them, but 
in feeling their relationship to the strong and fundamental 
tones between which they occur. After singing tunes in 
which the melodic form of the minor scale occurs, a me- 
lodic scale is constructed and practiced. If pupils have dif- 
ficulty in singing the mi, fa, si,/a of the upper passage, it can 
be practiced as soh, Ja, ti, doh until the intervals are clearly 
in mind, the return group being sung as la, soh, fa, mi. 
The children observe how this series both resembles and 
differs from natural and harmonic forms already familiar. 
This practice in constructing and singing the harmonic 
and melodic scales, following as it does experience in sing- 
ing songs based on the keys, makes the technical knowledge 
thus gained, vital and of real value in musical education. 
This work in the minor mode can be supplemented by the 
use of minor phrases in a way similar to that in which 
major phrases were used, by transposing minor phrases 
into major, and vice versa, and by making up minor songs.

  CHAPTER XIII 
SPECIAL WORK OF THE SIXTH YEAR. CHORD 
AND KEY RELATIONSHIPS 
THE regular work of the sixth year continues the study 
of sight singing introduced in the fourth and developed 
in the fifth year. Starting with notation, the pupils aim 
at the quick recognition of short musical passages accu- 
rately enough to sing them as wholes, not spelling note by 
note, but reading by phrases. The sixth year closes this 
second phase, already mentioned as passing from sight to 
sound, and brings the pupil to a point where he can begin 
to apply the power gained in recognizing musical phrases, 
especially those for instruments, so as to combine them in 
larger forms. In considering the’ special work presented 
in this chapter, it must be borne in mind that the largest 
portion of the time should still be given to the regular 
training in sight singing. 
FIRST STAGE: OBSERVING AND NAMING CHORD QUALITIES 
Children from the second year onward have practiced 
singing along chord lines, doh, mi, soh or ja, la, doh for in- 
stance, and divisions of the class have occasionally sus- 
tained the different tones of the chord, an excellent tuning 
134
-P-A-G-E-135
SPECIAL WORK OF THE SIXTH YEAR 135 
exercise. In the fourth and fifth years something in part 
work was attempted. It is now time to gather up this 
experience and organize the knowledge of tones sounded 
simultaneously in chords, thus doing for the chord work 
what the formal work in tone and in the minor mode has 
done for these two subjects. 
While the direct relation of the chord work to the pre- 
vious musical experience of the pupil cannot be as closely 
shown as in the previous topics mentioned, the practice 
in singing and observing chord combination as an inde- 
pendent exercise is of special value in quickening the mind 
to tone relationship. Hence its indirect advantage to mu- 
sical appreciation is great. But this advantage will not 
be realized unless the teacher so conducts the work that 
the pupils are constantly obliged to observe and describe 
what they individually sing in relation to what they hear. 
The work is commenced by dividing the class into three 
parts, or choirs, without any reference to high or low voices. 
The first step is the study of the triad or three-toned chord 
in its root or A position. The pitch of C or D is given, and 
the chord of doh, mi, soh is sung, the choirs taking turns 
in singing each of the tones of the chord. After the pupils 
have tried the chord and know what they are to do, they 
are asked to observe the characteristics of each of the tones 
as they sing them: the ease with which they are sung: the 
quality of each tone which stands out more distinctly be- 
cause of the relationship to the other two tones: and to tell 
for which one of the three tones the chord should be 
named. This work will reénforce the practice that the
-P-A-G-E-136
bina : 
130 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
pupils already have had in recognizing the character and 
positions of the tones in the key. In fact, singing them to- 
gether as a chord makes their quality more distinct than 
when singing them in succession as melody. There will be 
no difficulty in giving positive descriptions as to the char- 
acteristic effects of each tone in the chord, and the pupils 
will decide that doh is the only tone after which the com- 
bination or chord can be named. 
_— The second step will be to arrange the same chord in the 
two other possible positions, that of mi, soh, doh and soh, 
doh, mi, the problem now being to observe and describe the 
new effects produced. For, while the same tones are em- 
ployed, the smooth and solid character of the first arrange- 
ment has given way to one less so. The three arrangements 
of the chord are now named A, B, and C positions of the 
doh chord. They are practiced, compared with each other, 
and described. 
It will be a surprise to a teacher who has not tried this 
work to see how accurately the very large proportion of the 
class can describe what they hear. 
The third step is to combine similar chords to accompany 
this (see page 139, Ex. A, I, II, III, IV). The pupils are 
told that it would be no more than common sense to have 
one tone at least the same in two chords if they are to sound 
connectedly. When people wish to move smoothly they 
take up one foot at a time and take short steps, and so if 
we wish to go to another chord from doh it would be best at 
least to hold one tone and let the other two go to the near- 
est possible position,
-P-A-G-E-137
SPECIAL WORK OF THE SIXTH YEAR 137 
Starting with the doh chord we can try holding doh and 
moving mi and soh to ja and Ja, or we can hold soh and 
move doh and mi to ti and re. These are the only two 
chords that can be formed under these conditions. Each 
of them is now studied as was the doh chord so that they are 
practiced in different positions and the tone after which 
they should be named is described. They are then prac- 
ticed in succession, the teacher calling for them as the doh, 
fa, doh, soh, doh chords, and after this sequence has been 
learned the middle doh chord can be omitted, the choirs 
passing directly from the fa chord to the soh without a tone 
in common. This sequence should be practiced starting 
with the doh chord first in its A position, then B and then C. 
While the chord succession will be the same, the positions 
in which the chords follow each other will be different, 
obliging the student constantly to think not only of the 
tone that is common to the chords, but of the nearest tone 
that they should sing so as not to interfere with the tone 
that belongs to one of the other choirs. While this work 
may be started with the use of the syllable names, as soon 
as the tones are definitely learned the syllable names 
should be omitted, and the various vowel tones practiced. 
This is especially necessary in studying the effects of the 
chord. 
The exercises can be varied by having three of the more 
musical pupils sing the chords from a sequence written 
for them, the class naming from hearing the chord and its 
position. This gives opportunity for excellent ear practice, 
especially for classes who have not the opportunity of hear-
-P-A-G-E-138
| 138 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
ing a piano. The sustained way in which the tones are 
sung are better even than when given on a piano. 
The fourth step is the practice of the minor chord (see 
page 139, Ex. B, I, II, III, IV). The doh chord is again 
taken to start with, but instead of changing both of the up- 
per tones only, the soh is changed to /a, resulting in the doh, 
mi, la chord. The pupils will immediately recognize that 
this resembles in quality the minor scale with which they 
are familiar. After the chord has been practiced in three 
positions there will be no difficulty in seeing that it should 
be called the Ja chord. The fact that this chord has two 
tones in common with the doh chord would justify its being 
named the relative minor to the doh. The ja and soh chords 
are then treated in the same way, and it will be discovered 
that each has a similar minor chord, one on the second 
degree of the scale related to the ja chord, and one on the 
third degree related to the soh chord. We thus have six 
chords,—three major with their three relative minors. 
It is now possible to make long dictations combining 
all six chords. Such dictations will come easily if they are 
first written out on the blackboard, the pupils first suggest- 
ing the chords that will follow each other well, such sugges- 
tions being tested by singing and comparison. 
By starting on different positions of the doh chord a large 
variety of movement can be obtained. By writing the 
chords in different keys, excellent practice is obtained in 
realizing the similarity of effect in different presentations 
to the eye. 
The fourth step is to practice on the four-toned chord  
-P-A-G-E-139
SPECIAL WORK OF THE SIXTH YEAR 139 
of the dominant seventh (see page 140, Ex. D). The pupils 
will have already discovered that the three-toned chord on 
the seventh degree of the scale sounds different from both 
the major and minor chords learned. But by adding soh 
to the three a very interesting and, at the same time, com- 
monly used chord results. In order to practice this it would 
be necessary to double one of the tones of the doh chord. 
The most likely one for such a purpose would be the tone 
that gives its name to the chord. The four-toned chord of 
soh, ti, re, fais then practiced in the position of re, fa, soh, 
ti between two doh chords. 
While this work is not exhaustive from the harmonic 
point of view, it is sufficient to give most v aluable practice 
in tone hearing, and supplements not only the work in 
part singing, but develops a most sensitive feeling for 
harmony, making a deeper appreciation possible.

SECOND STAGE: KEY RELATION THROUGH SIGNATURE * 
There remains but one more technical stage to be pre- 
sented. We have had in the fifth year work the technical 
aspects of tone production, the minor mode and its re- 
sultant scales, and so far for the sixth year, chord charac- 
teristics, both in themselves and in their relationships to 
one another. 
The idea of the key group is the last of the technical 
subjects which need be attempted in this phase covered by 
the fourth, fifth, and sixth years. 
* See discussion introductory to second stage in Chapter XII.
-P-A-G-E-141
  
SPECIAL WORK OF THE SIXTH YEAR 141 
The principles of this relationship are already familiar. 
The children know that every key signature stands for two 
keys, one a major or doh, one a minor or/a. The keys have 
also been introduced as soh and ja keys in relation to a doh 
key. The pupils have had plenty of experience in the rela- 
tion of these keys. They have used soh as a new doh and 
then changed it back to soh. Still oftener the sound name 
has remained unchanged, but soh has taken the doh feeling 
because fi has been sung instead of ja, showing that short 
change has been made to the key of soh. The aim of the 
work now is to gather together and formulate as much as 
has been experienced in key changes. For this purpose,a- 
large number of familiar songs will be tal 
to which they change marked_on the blackboard. The 
children discover that each key change has a chromatic 
tone that serves as an earmark by which the eye, on looking 
at a piece of music, can readily tell the key modifications 
that occur. It should be noted here that a great many of 
the chromatic marks which occur in the ordinary music 
of the public schools only suggest a possible change. They 
are useful in helping to articulate the tune, to break it into 
parts. These changes are so common and uniform that 
to understand their principle helps not only in reading but 
also in hearing music. 
To illustrate the two ways in which the chromatic tones 
are introduced, the children can sing The Star Spangled 
Banner. They will notice that many of the phrases end 
on the chord of soh, or the dominant, and that some of 
these are preceded by a chord having a sharped four in it,

thus making the soh chord that follows it in strong opposi- 
tion to the doh chord of the piece. The children observe 
that what follows is in the original key and that what has 
happened has served merely to emphasize the separation of 
the phrases. Now Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean can be 
sung, and it is found that in this also the fourth of the key is 
sharped but that here it continues through the passage. 
Hence the music is changed to this key. 
After singing in different keys a large number of ex- 
amples which illustrate the sharping of the fourth, the 
children realize that however different the end served, the 
means employed is the same, and, moreover, that the 
change is one of the most common in music. They have 
also noticed that when the return is made after singing in 
the key of soh, the sharped four of the old key that became 
the seven of the new, often required a modifying mark such 
as cancel or flat to show this return. The ear always feels 
the difference, but very often the context is so clear that 
the change is not represented to the eye, the original sig- 
nature being sufficient. This is true of the return in Co- 
lumbia, the Gem oj the Ocean. Furthermore, illustrations 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
  144 EDUCATION THROUGH ee 
should be given of the fact that when we wish to return 
from the key of soh, we flat the seventh of this key. 
A tune can now be taken in which, instead of first 
changing to the key of soh the seventh of the key of doh is 
flatted; and the children discover that the key of fa has 
been reached. Thus what they are already familiar with 
as a change from the dominant to the tonic is applied to the 
change from the tonic to the subdominant, a transition 
‘which occurs much less frequently (see page 140, C, II, 
a, d, e). 
After the formulation of this group of related major keys, 
the next step is to study the relationship to a central tonic 
of the relative minors, i. e., the keys that have the same 
signatures but use da instead of doh for the tonic. From 
their study of the relative minor of the tonic the children 
already know the principle of this relationship. It is 
difficult to find melodies that give sufficient illustration, 
but examples will occur in the three-part music which is 
being studied. 
It can now be shown that when we pass from the key 
of doh to the key of its dominant, or soh, we are passing 
through only one aspect of this dominant key, that is, the 
major; and that we can with equal consistency go to the 
dark key for the same signature, that is, the minor, which 
has the same relationship to soh that la had to doh. This 
would be the minor starting on mi, the third of the scale. 
The same thing would hold good in changing from the 
doh to the fa key. Instead of taking the bright aspect of 
this group of tones we can take the dark aspect represented
-P-A-G-E-145
SPECIAL WORK OF THE SIXTH YEAR 145 
by its relative minor commencing on re. Thus we have 
minor keys on the third and second of the scale which are 
related to doh in that they would have the same signature 
as the majors sok and fa (see page 140, C, II, b, c, f). 
The formulating of these key relationships is especially 
valuable because while they all follow the same principle 
each has a different appearance to the eye. Sometimes 
cancels instead of sharps show the change to the key of soh, 
and similarly they, instead of flats, show the change to the 
key of fa; or again, double sharps or flats may be required. 
So if the chromatic tones necessary to form the melodic 
and harmonic minors for the three relative keys were 
learned in reference to a central tonic, many a passage that 
seems to bristle with tonal difficulties would be recognized 
as a familiar friend. 
The point of all this work is the study of key changes 
in relation to a central tonic. Thus we have a group of six 
keys represented by three signatures, one of which is that 
of the tonic, one that of the dominant, and one that of the 
subdominant. When we change to the dominant and sub- 
dominant, or the soh and fa keys, the signature is not 
changed; only the chromatic necessary to form the new 
seventh or fourth is written. The dark aspect of the major 
keys gives us the three minor keys, one on /a related to doh, 
one on mi related to soh, one on re related to fa, so that 
the six keys have all to be learned from the same signature 
(see page 140, C, II). Each of these minor keys requires 
an additional chromatic tone showing that it is the dark 
and not the bright aspect of the group. This tone is th 
Music—10 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
  140 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
seventh of each minor, that is, the tone below /a, the tonic. 
This seventh when sung with the sound names of the 
original tonic will require soh to be sung as si indicating 
the change to the key on /a; re to be sung vi for the change 
to the minor key on mi; and doh to be sung as di for the 
minor key on re. 
Thus the chromatic tones are introduced as indicat- 
ing a group of six keys, all related to the central tonic 
as the seven tones of the scale are related to the tonic 
tone. 
This study might be continued to include the tonic 
minors of the major keys, but sufficient work is given here 
to establish the principle that keys are related, as tones are. 
In fact, it might be enough in a great many cases to go no 
further than the changes to the dominant and relative 
minor. None of this technical work that cannot be re- 
lated to practical musical experience should be done. It 
can be justified only when it serves to formulate practice.

CHAPTER XIV 
INTRODUCTORY TO SEVENTH YEAR: TWO 
REASONS FOR CHANGE IN CHARACTER 
OF WORK 
Tue work of the seventh year will be better understood, 
if, before describing it, we compare what it aims to ac- 
complish with the two previous aims, the one extending 
through the work of the first three years, the other of the 
next three. The first phase begins with singing songs and 
ends with learning notation. This is brought about by 
observation, acting and picturing, which accompany the 
singing, and enable the pupil to learn the constitutive 
ideas that make up the structure of the song. In the second 
phase this process is reversed. The pupils start with the 
constitutive ideas suggested by the notation, and unite 
these in order to form concepts of the motifs and phrases 
of musical passages. The ability to sing these is the 
practical test of accurate conceptions. 
The question now arises, shall this grade continue the 
work of sight singing in the same spirit as during the 
second phase, or are there reasons for a change? If the 
nature of the pupil remained the same, and if work in 
sight singing included all that pupils should know about 
147  
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC | 
music, there would be no necessity to change. But both 
these hypotheses are contrary to fact. 
The adolescent period into which the pupils of the 
seventh and eighth years are entering produces self- 
consciousness and sensitiveness as to the opinions of the 
other sex, evident in dress and manner. With this external 
change there is more profound intellectual and spiritual 
change, the significance of which is clearly brought out in 
Dr. Hall’s Adolescence. The voices of the girls are affected 
as well as those of the boys, and this makes it wise to lessen 
rather than to increase the use of the voice, especially 
since its exercise gives poor results. The self-consciousness 
that particularly affects boys makes vocal utterance a dif- 
ficult and hence undesirable form of self-expression. Pu- 
pils at this period feel a dislike for “stunt-doing”’ acts, 
which in the earlier music study were both helpful and 
enjoyable. Furthermore, they demand a certain spiritual 
content, a social significance in what is done. These facts 
alone would justify a new grouping and presentation of 
study. 
But there is still the second reason to be considered, 
Does the training in sight singing cover all that the general 
public should know about music? The pertinence of this 
question will not be felt unless we bear in mind that the 
majority of our citizens end their school work with the 
eighth grade or its equivalent. The tone thinking that 
sight singing demands gives the most intensive ear training, 
and hence the best preparation for grasping musical ideas, 
Yet the interest awakened in music simply on its vocal
-P-A-G-E-149
INTRODUCTORY TO SEVENTH YEAR 149 
side, and the musical work that such vocal approach makes 
possible, do not supply a wide enough experience to enable 
the student to apply in the most effective manner the ability 
he has gained in this way to the musical experience of his 
later life. The modern graduate of the grammar school 
when he enters upon life, works under a pressure that 
leaves little vitality for either spiritual or artistic expression, 
and those forms of art that require severe concentration and 
effort are left more and more to those persons who have 
special talent for them. The desire for self-expression is 
as great as ever, but the medium through which it acts 
must hold attention without too severe a demand on vitality 
that is already overtaxed by the pressure of modern life. 
Hence the general experience in music will be more likely 
to take the passive form of listening than the active one 
of solo or chorus singing. 
The truth of this statement will be appreciated if one 
will only stop to think how very much larger is the number 
of those whose musical experience comes to them through 
the work of others than of those who make their own 
music. In fact, of the latter class, the technical demand 
of the music they themselves produce may so absorb their 
attention that they are oblivious to the esthetic side; so 
that they also nourish their true musical life through what 
they hear. 
If now we ask what form of the music which brings us 
intimately into contact with the great masters do we hear 
most, one must admit that it is instrumental music. Apart 
from what is heard in the homes (so wonderfully enlarged
-P-A-G-E-150
een aR ee eee ee ees re eee are rey eee 
150 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
* by music printed on rolls and disks), we have the music 
of the streets, parks, pleasure resorts, steamers, hotels, 
restaurants, and, in addition, the regular concert halls, 
all ministering very largely through instrumental forms. 
This, after all, is the musical opportunity for which the 
public schools should train. For whether this immense 
amount of music shall be good or bad depends upon what 
the musical intelligence of the listener demands. The pub- 
lic school can become a most potent factor in training 
this intelligence. 
After the training already given, it only remains to 
apply to the practical sphere, in which the greater part of 
the future experience of the pupils will lic, that intelligence 
and sensitiveness to sound which sight singing has awak- 
ened and strengthened. Such is the aim of the work begin- 
ning with the seventh year. Starting with the ability the 
pupils have developed for conceiving of motives and 
phrases, the teacher shows how the larger vocal and instru- 
mental forms are developed through a combination of these. 
-——~ The school should furnish the opportunity to hear instru- 
mental music, and it should definitely organize the expe- 
rience given. By this means, the pupil is enabled to enjoy 
music that would otherwise have little meaning for him.

CHAPTER XV 
THE SEVENTH YEAR 
FIRST STAGE: REVIEW 
As the majority of the school population does not go 
beyond the grammar grades, it is essential that the musical 
work should be so planned that it should not be dependent 
on study beyond these grades for results. Hence the work 
of the third phase according to the plan presented in this 
book, covering the seventh and eighth years of school life, 
is designed to accomplish two main results. 
> The first of these is to review and solidify the musical 
knowledge already introduced; and the second is to widen 
the scope of the musical work so that some interest will be 
awakened in instrumental music as well as in the story 
and form of music. 
The review work does not signify that exhaustive re- 
views have not already taken place, but that the review 
itself is to be made more of a feature and presented not 
so much in the form in which the work was originally 
given, as in generalizations, implying that the principles 
are fairly well in mind, and putting the knowledge into 
such compact shape that it would be of service long after 
much that was learned in school is forgotten, 
1§t

  152 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
_> The review for the seventh grade centers about the 
notation for rhythm and pitch. The first will be best 
illustrated by the following table.

It will be seen by this table that the pulse and not the 
measure is taken as the unit in the measurement of tonal 
duration. It is quite true that in simple music moving to 
single pulse tones, the measure grouping is of the utmost 
importance especially to an unharmonized melody; the 
ordinary melody, however, will establish its own pulse 
grouping if the pulses themselves are clearly conceived 
and produced. By bringing the compound and simple, 
the even and uneven pulses into juxtaposition, the whole 
table is easily classified and remembered, and while it is 
not by any means an exhaustive treatment of pulse types, 
it is fundamental, and students who have mastered it 
thoroughly, easily grasp further changes. This table
-P-A-G-E-153
  THE SEVENTH YEAR 153 
should psa meer 
having the teacher point to the various pulse types, while 
sing the various types while the pupils state which one of 
the tables is being produced, and so the new music taken up 
should be rapidly analyzed, at least the first few meas- 
ures, into the pulse types employed, until the importance of 
thinking by pulses is thoroughly reviewed and established. 
The certainty of the pulse feeling itself can be easily 
tested and developed by the practice of syncopation, start- 
last from the last half of the first through the second half of 
The second pulse, when the pupil can feel the entrance of the 
“weak pulse against the tone that continues over it. The 
Syncopation can be changed to the last half of the second 
ure. Here two forms of syncopation are given: the first 
covering the entrance of the weak pulse, and_the second, 
that of the strong pulse. Such exercises may be effectively 
introduced in scale passages, alternating with the regular 
movement, such alternation of a few measures of synco- 
pated and regular time making the work more effective 
than where the syncopation is kept up too long. 
With this practice of pulse types and pulse grouping the 
various forms of the metrical signatures should be re- 
viewed; especially those decided changes in appearance 
that simple time so often takes from the mere fact of chang- 
ing the pulse unit from a quarter to either an eighth or a 
half note,   
  
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
Turning now to the work that centers about the key 
signatures, it will be well to commence this review by sing- 
ing the pitches of the staff as represented by the un- 
modified letters. Excellent practice in singing whole and 
half steps is brought about by singing scale passages, 
starting on all the letters with the exception of C, when 
the fixed condition of the half step between E and F, and 
B and C is well established. The scales should be sung 
and written, starting on each degree of the staff. For in- 
stance, a scale calling C first doh, then soh, then mi, then 
Ja, re, ja, and finally i. This would require that between 
C’ and C’ the scales of C, F, A flat, E flat, B flat, G and D 
flat be sung and written. The same thing should be done 
by taking D and thinking of that as each of the seven tones 
of a major scale. This gives an exhaustive review of the 
scales and the exact function of sharps and flats, double 
sharps and double flats with reference to the staff. In 
writing these scales the“modifying signs should be written 
directly before the note, and the distance measured in 
major and minor seconds; and afterwards, for practice in 
writing signatures correctly, the resulting signatures should 
be placed at the beginning. 
The second most important practice in connection with 
signatures is the ability to place rapidly upon the staff 
when the key is given the repose tones of the scale doh, mi, 
and soh, with the doh above and the soh below this group. 
This can be made very intensive speed work by sending 
all the pupils that can be accommodated to the board, 
having them draw a short staff and place the clef mark;
-P-A-G-E-155
THE SEVENTH YEAR 155 
then stand with the back towards the board and have the 
keys assigned, and at a given signal have the students turn 
about, place the five notes according to the key required 
without stopping to write the signatures, and then turn back 
again. The habit should be developed of not simply think- 
ing where doh is when the key is given, but where the en- 
tire seven tones would be placed. These are easily grouped 
if they are thought of as the repose tones of doh, mi, and 
soh, as the sensitive tones of fa and 4i, one leading up to 
doh and the other down to mi and the passing tones of re 
and la. The essential thing of this work is, however, 
grouping the five repose tones doh, mi, and soh with the 
doh above and the soh below. 
So much for review. The vexed question of part singing 
raises a difficult problem. There is no doubt that singing 
in harmony is one of the best musical practices that the 
pupil can have, and that the result when well done gives 
greater satisfaction to the officers and friends of the school. 
On the other hand, the vocal condition in which seventh 
and eighth grade pupils find themselves is the least favor- 
able for such practice, and a great part of the harm which 
singing teachers often attribute to school music is done 
in injudicious part singing for immature voices. Unfortu- 
nately the greatest damage is done to the best singers, who 
are generally given the lower and constrained parts be- 
cause they are more musical and can sing them, and from 
this very fact are depended upon to lead the others, and 
unconsciously force their voices. The question of part 
singing might be looked at from two points of view. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  156 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
first, that in which independence is developed by having 
other parts moving differently from the one the pupil is 
singing, and the second, the development of feeling for 
harmonic progression. If these two are treated separately, 
more effective work can be done with less harm to the 
voices. The question of independence with reference to 
the part one is singing is easily developed through the 
round and canon. This does not oblige any voice to 
remain low, and thus offers all the freedom of unison 
work and at the same time develops independence of 
part. 
For developing harmonic feeling, simple songs should be 
chosen, where the harmony moves in blocks, the low voice 
taking the root, or a tone of the chord. Opportunity is 
thus given to the embryo basses to take their tones with 
a fair degree of certainty. This would throw out much 
of the clever counterpoint that one sees written for ad- 
vanced grades, but when the musical capacity of the pu- 
pils is taken into consideration, the necessity of passing 
from the simple to the complex would certainly justify 
a much more elementary harmonic treatment for the first 
attempts at part singing than is ordinarily offered to the 
seventh and eighth grade pupils. If this work is sup- 
plemented with the singing of canons, plenty of practice 
is given in getting independence of parts. Such simple 
treatment of harmonic movement is not only valuable for 
the low part, but quite as much so for the soprano and 
alto that move above it, for it is unfortunate to set pupils 
to singing parts who have not yet developed the simple
-P-A-G-E-157
THE SEVENTH YEAR 157 
tonic-dominant movement that lies at the base of the more 
developed treatment. 
SECOND STAGE: AWAKENING INTEREST IN INSTRUMENTS 
The new work is to awaken interest in musical instru- 
ments. How thisis to be done will depend much on the op- 
portunities at hand. An ordinary whistle is sufficient to in- 
troduce the principle underlying wind instruments,—the 
flute, piccolo, pipe organ, and others. When the prin- 
ciple of this group is established, i. e., that the sound is 
produced by the blowing of the wind across an opening, 
the second division of wind instruments can be introduced 
by means of the cornet. Pupils notice here the cup-shaped 
mouthpiece and discover that the lips of the player must 
vibrate in this cup in order to produce the tone. Then the 
whole family of brass instruments can be studied and the 
fact brought out that the tuba, trombone, horn, and 
trumpet all employ the same means. After this group the 
third division of the same family can be introduced,—that 
of wood instruments such as the clarionet and oboe. The 
children observe that here the wind is set in vibration by a 
reed controlled by the lips of the player. Another class of 
instruments which use the reed,—but instead of control- 
ling it by the lips, allow it to vibrate freely in an opening,— 
can be illustrated by the cabinet organ, accordion, or 
mouth organ. 
The second great family of instruments is the string 
group. The violin can be used to illustrate the large divi- 
sion played with bows, while the guitar, mandolin, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
piano exemplify those where the string is plucked or ex- 
cited by a plectrum or a hammer. Finally, there is the 
third great family, such as drums, tambourines, and cym- 
bals, where a vibrating surface is directly excited by blows.* 
Since the object of this work is to awaken interest in 
music through instruments, it is not pursued in a pro- 
fessional or technical way. On the other hand, human 
interest in the subject should be stimulated by including 
as much of their history and their place in literature as 
time will permit. Thus some of the pupils may prepare 
papers on primitive music, showing how drums were used; 
others fresh from their essays on Greek life will describe 
the pipe of Pan and the lyre, showing their relationship to 
modern instruments; others again, the shepherd’s pipe, 
the hunter’s horn, the bugle and its calls, and the bagpipe 
with its drone; until the world-wide interest of the human 
race in music is recognized. Much of this literary work 
can be done in connection with the exercises in English 
and composition as well as with history. 
But this is not the only side. The seventh and eighth 
years pay much attention to manual training. The making 
of simple instruments and the invention of apparatus for 
illustrating how the tones are produced will fascinate many 
an ingenious boy whose interest in music hitherto has been 
none too strong. In like manner drawing and art can be 
made to contribute their quota in the reproduction of the 
beautiful forms and decorations that musical instruments 
present. 
* The pupils, as far as possible, should hear and examine instruments.
-P-A-G-E-159
THE SEVENTH YEAR 159 
Museums are rapidly increasing and children should be 
directed to these as they are to libraries. Failing such aid, 
general and musical encyclopedias supply more material 
than can be used. The musical instrument catalogues of 
a first class house that deals in orchestral and band in- 
struments will supply fairly satisfactory pictures of the 
instruments most commonly used; these could be cut out 
and pasted on cardboard for permanent use. 
For two months half the music time of the week could 
well be devoted to this sort of work, in the course of which 
practical hints could also be given for the care of the mu- 
sical instruments generally found in our homes. 
A second feature of this work consists in drawing at- 
tention to those instruments, which, though less used, are 
at the same time important for instrumental organizations. 
A fraction of the time that is now spent in trying to get 
the technique of such a difficult solo instrument as the 
piano, would if applied to band and orchestra instruments, 
give more musical results. Much of our musical activity 
is dissipated because almost everybody tries to master the 
piano, an instrument so complete that it does not readily 
lend itself to organizations of players. If these streams 
of individual effort could be united into clubs, small bands, 
and orchestras, the musical life of our country would be 
greatly developed and enriched. 
The public school wields an unparalleled influence in 
this respect; for the study of musical instruments gives the 
opportunity to interest the pupil, not only in the ixstru- 
ments themselves, but what is important for instruction, in
-P-A-G-E-160
  
  160 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
organizations, to which these naturall lead, such as the 
band and orchestra. The pupils learn that these are not 
haphazard combinations, but thoroughly organized bodies, 
each class of instruments having a specific place and duty 
in the whole. They know what chords and melody mean 
and they learn to see how the different instruments, ac- 
cording to their nature, take up the parts; they learn the 
bass, tenor, and alto groups and observe that certain in- 
struments, owing to their flexibility and beauty of tone, 
carry the lead, or melody. 
There is hardly a town or mining camp in the country 
that has not its band, or at least a group of instrument 
players, who might be induced to give a concert for the 
pupils, illustrating to both eye and ear this grouping of in- 
struments. The modern school sends the child into the 
park, the country, the factory, and the shop to gain knowl- 
edge by first-hand observation, and the same principle 
can be applied to music work. With the interest now de- 
veloped in instruments and their organization the pupils 
should be encouraged to go to good concerts or wher- 
ever music can be heard, and to bring back definite ob- 
servations of effects produced and means employed. 
These comments should not be in the form of haphazard 
criticism or rhapsody, but should show a scholarly in- 
telligence, even though this is still limited and immature. 
THIRD STAGE: BAND MUSIC 
We have seen how the arousing of interest in instruments 
led to the awakening of interest in musical organizations.
-P-A-G-E-161
  THE SEVENTH YEAR 161 
This naturally goes on to the present stage, the music 
that such organizations perform. All over the country 
bands are much more numerous than orchestras, and in 
band music the dance forms predominate very largely. 
Since these forms lend themselves to observation and 
awaken a more immediate interest, they should be studied 
first. The children have learned to listen by motif and 
therefore have no difficulty in tracing the occurrence of 
similar rhythms and the reintroduction of similar melodies 
after contrasting ones. 
After observations have been gathered concerning the 
nature of what they have heard, the study of the dance 
form will be systematically commenced with the aid of the 
school piano. Often among the pupils themselves some 
will be found who are capable of playing the illustrations. 
It certainly would not be difficult to persuade musical 
friends, or even piano teachers who are interested in being 
known as players, to give illustrations. The modern at- 
tachments for playing pianos make possible the giving of 
excellent illustrations by those who do not themselves 
play. If it happens that the school has no piano, a few 
musicales can be planned at different homes. 
Attention will be directed first to the way in which dance 
music consists of parts related to each other. If a wide- 
awake physical training teacher is connected with the 
school, her services can be enlisted in showing how this 
articulation of the music grows out of the dance. It will 
be found that the means employed, or cadences, can be 
grouped. Some seem to be final, others only partial. In 
Music—11
-P-A-G-E-162
Ee TE NC ee ep ee ee eee ee ere eee Neem 
162 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
noting how this is accomplished by means of chords and 
their arrangement, excellent opportunity is given for re- 
viewing previous chord work and for learning how cadences 
may be formed and infinitely varied. The development of 
sensitiveness to the shades of difference which mark the 
division between motifs, phrases, sections, and periods, 
increases intelligent comprehension of music in the same 
way that attention to punctuation promotes an under- 
standing of language. 
After the pupils have observed that dance music breaks 
up into symmetrical parts, it is not difficult to go a step 
further and show that these parts are dominated by cer- 
tain rhythms producing forms like the polonaise and polka, 
tarantella and galop, waltz and march. The pupils now 
discover that these forms are types of movement and soon 
learn to recognize them. These types, as in the case of 
the instruments, can be associated with their historic origin. 
Here, again, literature and art enrich and widen the mu- 
sical interest and awaken a deeper pleasure than the mere 
sensuous reaction to a waltz or march could ever do. 
This approach through the dance makes it possible to 
induce interest in the form without having the study be- 
come a lifeless intellectualism leading either to disgust or 
priggishness, for seventh grade children readily respond 
emotionally to the minuct or waltz. They enjoy it; it ex- 
presses them: and the intelligence awakened in connection 
with it purifies and strengthens their interest and prepares 
at the same time a starting point toward more complex and 
artistic forms. The Invitation to the Dance used as an 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
THE SEVENTH YEAR 163 
approach to the overture of Der Freischuiz is a better ar- 
rangement than the reverse order would be. 
While the suggestion made here is to pass from in- 
struments to music, it does not necessarily follow that 
this is the best order in all cases. The fundamental idea 
is to pass from experience to knowledge,—to make knowl- 
edge the organization of experience. That order which 
will supply this experience in its most vivid and interest- 
ing way for the conditions of the given locality is the best 
one to follow, even if the logical development of the sub- 
ject itself may not be so well scrved.

WORK: REPETITION IN ART 
By the time the pupil has reached the eighth year, we 
are ready to apply his already awakened interest in mu- 
sical form to those examples in which the masterpieces of 
music have been revealed, and also to arouse his sympathies 
by an acquaintance with the composers themselves and the 
times in which they lived. 
Though this work naturally falls in the eighth year it 
does not follow that it can be completed there. .Only the 
beginning of it can be attempted in one year. Not only 
this, it must be borne in mind that approximately half the 
time of the eighth year will be devoted to singing. The 
closing exercises, as well as many other school occasions, 
require special music and the duty of furnishing this 
generally falls to the upper classes. These are excellent 
opportunities for putting to practical use the pupil’s mu- 
sical ability. The teacher should take pains to have the 
selections well chosen, and should approach their study 
through the observation of structural and interpretative 
ideas. Moreover, attention should be given to the cir- 
cumstance under which the pieces were composed, as well 
164
-P-A-G-E-165
INTRODUCTORY TO EIGHTH YEAR 105 
as to the period and the composer. Thus the pupil can be 
made acquainted with many beautiful gems from the litera- 
ture of music in such a way that they become part of his 
artistic preparation for life, enabling him to drink deep 
of refreshment as invigorating and inexhaustible as the 
springs in a mountain valley. 
Since, as we have already said, the pupil’s musical 
experience after he leaves school will be largely in the 
realm of hearing instrumental music, the preparation for 
this, already begun in the seventh year, should be con- 
tinued. Let us see what this preparation has been. First, 
his musical interests have been broadened through an 
acquaintance with the structure and history of instru- 
ments. This has led to an interest in musical organizations, 
and this in turn to the music performed. As this music 
was chiefly limited to dance forms, the observations made 
were largely connected with its rather rhythmical ideas. 
Pupils have become aware of the symmetry of these mu- 
sical designs growing out of their origin in the dance. 
Their observation has been carefully directed to the 
means of articulating the music. This has led to the 
quickening of the feeling for cadences, which were ex- 
plained descriptively rather than technically. These ob- 
servations, together with the earlier practice of singing by 
phrase give the basis for the new work about to be pre- 
sented. Starting with that which not only awakens in- 
terest most strongly, but also connects most closely with 
experience, we have led the pupils to the technical means 
employed to produce this experience, and we gradually
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
reach those forms of music the comprehension of which 
adds much to musical enjoyment. 
The plan for the observation of pure design in music 
has been developed in connection with work done by High 
School students. But its commencement with the last 
year of the grammar school is suggested for children whose 
school life goes no further. Even eight periods during the 
year devoted to the work proposed in the following para- 
graphs would prove of immense practical value to such 
children. A lesson once in two weeks would be much more 
effective, while a lesson once a week would give all the time 
necessary to accomplish what we intend in the work as 
sketched. It is not expected that the pupil will be able to 
comprehend the full meaning of large forms represented 
by fugues and sonatas, since at this age he possesses neither 
the intellectual nor the emotional capacity. But just as a 
child learns much in his geography, which becomes fully 
significant only after years of travel, so in music by drawing 
attention to the effects of fugues and sonatas and the way 
they are formed, by giving practice in intensive listening and 
awakening human interest through the stories connected 
with their origin, the times, and the composers that pro- 
duced them,—in all these ways are planted the seeds which 
will bear fruit whenever favorable opportunity is given. 
In teaching musical design, the pupils’ experience of 
design in manual training and art work may be made use 
of. This helps in a measure their lack of a larger musical 
experience. Since such a treatment is rather unusual, the 
principles will first be presented by themselves.
-P-A-G-E-167
INTRODUCTORY TO EIGHTH YEAR 167 
The tendency to repeat is strikingly noticeable in all 
the arts that seek to express beauty. By this means unity 
is given to a work; yet mere unity is not beautiful. Its 
value consists in enabling us to organize the forms of art, 
and consequently the impressions they produce, thus 
making possible the accumulation of effects necessary for 
the deep and lasting feeling of pleasure which the beautiful 
awakens. 
The importance of this principle of repetition is very 
great in those arts that are free to develop their own forms; 
as long as they can give the impression of the unity of the 
whole, they can take any shape the fancy wishes. Among 
these arts are music, architecture, and a large class of the 
arts of design, such as deal with surface decoration. In 
contrast stand the arts of painting and sculpture; these 
have to develop the unity of their work largely through 
choice and arrangement of forms already related by 
nature. 
In those arts where repetition is absolutely essential 
for attaining unity, two classes result from the way it is 
used. In the first of these, the unity attained resembles 
that developed through continuity, the same motif or form 
being present in more or less altered forms. This class, 
involving more or less constant repetition, is one in which 
much of the primitive art of the world is expressed. Stone- 
henge with its rows of huge stones; the arts of Egypt 
and Asia with their constant recurrence of such large 
masses as pillars, gates, and sphinxes; decorations on gar- 
ments and utensils where a simple figure appears over and  
-P-A-G-E-168
  
168 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
over; and in music, the endless reiteration of some minor 
phrase in which the Indians and Orientals seem to de- 
light;—all these indicate the symmetry of the whole is 
little thought of, but that attention is given simply to the 
accumulation of effects from moment to moment, suffi- 
ciently gathered up by their resemblance to each other. 
In the second class, the same continuity is present, but 
through greater skill in the control of the material a higher 
unity is made possible by consideration for both symmetry 
and principality. The builder of the Parthenon was not 
content with the simple continuity brought about by rep- 
resentation of details, but he so planned his work that 
the structure as a whole expressed a higher unity through 
its symmetry. The capitol at Washington goes a step 
further in organization, in that its large masses are con- 
nected by means of the idea of principality; for the huge 
dome at the center unites its wings in one whole. 
The difference between these two classes is illustrated 
in the way such buildings are approached. The architects 
of Gothic cathedrals, Egyptian and Oriental temples, in 
which the continuity idea was uppermost, laid little stress 
upon the point of view from which the whole should be 
seen. Houses of the city crowd about a Gothic cathedral, 
walls and gardens hide the temples; they are not primarily 
intended to be viewed as wholes. On the other hand, the 
Parthenon, the capitol at Washington, and the Taj Mehal, 
all are meant to be regarded in the large as well as in detail. 
Their attainment of this higher unity implies a greater 
skill and maturity of their builders,
-P-A-G-E-169
  
INTRODUCTORY TO EIGHTH YEAR 169 
So in music these two classes of repetition are present; 
that where continuity is uppermost took its rise in the 
ecclesiastical music, while the feeling for symmetry con- 
nected itself with the folk music and dance. Each had 
its peculiar problem. The church musician could spin 
tone webs indefinitely, but found difficulty in organizing his 
material, so as to bring about that unity which results 
from symmetry and principality. On the other hand, in 
the spontaneous song and dance of the people, there were 
perfect examples of symmetry, but there was no way of 
massing these effects into larger wholes. These two classes, 
however, developed side by side, each influencing the 
other. The first, under the general term polyphonic music, 
achieved its continuity of effect by the recurrence in the 
various voices of similar motifs or phrases. The second, 
sometimes called homophonic, aimed at repeating large 
portions separated by contrasting parts, thus giving to 
the whole an organic unity, a feeling of symmetry, as 
far as this is possible in music. In many of the Handel 
choruses we have in the polyphonic treatment with the 
emphasized chords at the close what corresponds to the 
Cologne cathedral with its mighty towers at its western end; 
while in the movements of the sonatas of Haydn and the 
simpler ones of Beethoven there is a more distinct feeling 
of symmetry and proportion. Yet it is interesting to note 
that in the culmination of both of these types, the more 
formal symmetry of the earlier Beethoven sonatas disap- 
pears in a deeper thought unity, and in the great fugues 
of Bach the apparent principle of continuity is so deftly
-P-A-G-E-170
  
  170 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
controlled that the work presents the large proportions 
of beginning, middle, and end, characteristic of works 
of symmetry. 
To sum up and show the application of what has been 
said with reference to design: attention has been drawn 
to the importance of repetition, by showing its use in 
other arts besides music; the observation of repetition has 
brought out the distinction that enables us to divide art 
products into two large classes. In the first of these, con- 
tinuity is given by the repetition of a few simple motifs 
with more or less variation constantly appearing. In the 
second, a feeling for symmetry and principality results 
in modifications for the sake of the whole, and in the repe- 
tition of large portions varied by a contrasting element. 
The reason for dwelling so largely on the expression 
of these principles in arts other than music is that in the 
space arts, the way repetition is employed is more easily 
studied and can be made clearer to the mind, than in music, 
where design must be heard instead of visualized. When 
the universal value of this principle for all art is once felt, 
its application to music greatly assists in comprehending 
the various forms. It has the further advantage of show- 
ing that music instead of making its object the attainment 
of a formless feeling, really gains definite results by as 
rigid an adherence to principles of structure as does ar- 
chitecture. 
In applying this work to students as young as those 
of the eighth year, the use of design in the other arts, es- 
pecially to illustrate the principle of repetition, is expected
-P-A-G-E-171
INTRODUCTORY TO EIGHTH YEAR 17t 
to accomplish nothing more than to start them listening 
intensively to what they hear. It will be noticed that this 
comprehensive view of form is presented before the work is 
given for intensive listening to the musical sentence itself. 
The purpose is to follow the principle so often emphasized 
in this book,—the passing from the larger, the more ob- 
vious, the more superficial expression of the subject to a 
closer, a more minute, and more vital study. For the 
same reason, the study in relation to text precedes the 
work given for the general observation of form. In no 
case is this attention to form to be thought of as a study 
of the subject itself, so often attempted in appreciation 
classes. Such work would be inappropriate for pupils 
at this age.
-P-A-G-E-172
  
CHAPTER XVII 
THE EIGHTH YEAR 
FIRST STAGE: REVIEW 
Tue review work of the eighth year continues in the 
same spirit as that of the seventh. The essentials of 
the previous year should be gone over, the knowledge of 
the thirty major and minor keys should be grouped into a 
complete table. The pupils should observe that there are 
but seven different degrees on the staff. Taking the series 
from C to B inclusively, the letter F divides it squarely in 
two. This is the only key starting on an unmodified letter 
that has a flat in its signature. Below this, C, D, and E 
stand for no sharps, two sharps, and four sharps. Above, 
F, G, A, and B stand for one sharp, three sharps, and five 
sharps. The letter F with one flat for its signature divides 
the sharp keys into two groups, naught and even on one 
side, odd on the other. From these we can get all the other 
signatures by remembering that all that we need to do is 
to subtract the signature given from seven and we will get 
the one sought. For instance, the key of F, one flat, by 
subtracting one from seven we get the key of six sharps 
or the key of F sharp. If the four sharps of the key of E 
are subtracted from seven, the remainder, three, will give 
: 172
-P-A-G-E-173
  THE EIGHTH YEAR 173 
the signature of three flats for the same letter. Thus each 
letter of the staff stands for two keys, one the letter by it- 
self, the other modified by a flat or a sharp, and whichever 
is given the opposite can be discovered by the simple rule 
of subtracting this from seven. The letter C, however, as 
it has no sharps or flats can have either seven sharps or 
seven flats. That is, we can subtract the entire group of 
sharps or flats and so get its opposite. 
Thus the letter C gives us three keys and the remaining 
six letters two each, resulting in fifteen key signatures. If 
we now bear in mind that each signature has both a bright 
and dark aspect, the dark taking its name from the color 
which predominates it, this being /a or the third below the 
tonic of the major, we shall add fifteen minor keys to the 
same signatures, resulting in a group of thirty. 
Following this review of the key signatures, there should 
come practice in recognizing the chromatic tones that 
suggest the modulation into the five relative keys; sharping 
four for the dominant, flatting seven for the subdominant, 
sharping five for the relative minor of the tonic, sharping 
the second for the relative minor of the dominant, sharping 
one for the relative minor of the subdominant. It will be 
seen that if these numbers are given from the basis of the 
original tonic, the ordinary transitory modulation will thus 
appear. Where the change is extensive, the chromatics 
necessary for indicating the dominant and subdominant 
signatures in connection with their relative minors will be 
necessary, as will also the changes for producing the me- 
lodic forms of the minor scale.
-P-A-G-E-174
  174 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
With the work previously done in the introduction of 
keys, this review can be easily covered. These chromatic 
tones can be practiced as passing tones by prolonging the 
diatonic tones. We thus have a chromatic scale introduced 
with a definite key feeling. When this can be sung truly 
instead of prolonging each of the diatonic tones, each of 
the tones of the tonic chord should be prolonged; that is, 
doh, mi and soh, while the minor seconds between them 
should be sung rapidly and lightly so that the key feeling 
may be constantly present. Finally, when this is done 
with certainty, the attempt of running the entire chromatic 
scale smoothly and evenly from a note to its octave may be 
attempted, but even then ,it should be thought of as in 
some key, 
A new key relationship can be practiced by changing 
from the tonic major to the tonic minor. This will be 
best accomplished without the use of the sound names, 
The practice of noticing that the same tonic will generate 
a bright as well as a dark key feeling is an excellent ex- 
pansion of a true appreciation of the full character of the 
tonic. 
The cadences practiced in comnection with the chord 
work in the sixth grade can now be practiced with the bass 
voices taking a low part, observing the effect of complete 
and partial cadences. With the preceding practice of the 
tonic minor the cadences could be taken in minor as well 
as major. What was said of part singing for the seventh 
grade is even more applicable to the eighth grade as far 
as condition of voice goes. On the other hand, those who
-P-A-G-E-175
  
THE EIGHTH YEAR 175 
are able to sing have better command of their voices, and 
by singing with greater freedom are’ less likely to strain 
or contract the throat in an effort to produce the right 
tone. Hence, part work introducing modulation, giving 
opportunity for observing the characteristic key changes, 
can be effectively practiced. Much will depend upon how 
» the voice is used whether injury is done or not. Light 
voice practice for developing flexibility starting from the 
upper tones and coming down is the only safe way for 
unchanged voices. While for those whose voices have 
changed, drawing attention to the gradual change in the 
way the tones are produced in passing from the chest to 
the head register between the pitches of A’ and C’, will 
help to protect the voices. 
SECOND STAGE: DESIGN IN RELATION TO TEXT 
The new work of the eighth year will commence with 
that aspect of music so popular in modern times in which 
the thought of the listener is guided by means other than 
that of the music itself. A descriptive title, a bit of poetry, 
running comments relative to the nature of what is in- 
tended, act as suggestions to the listener. In Pieces for 
Children, by Schumann, The Happy Farmer, The Poor 
Orphan, The Hunting Song, St. Nick are all titles that aid 
the imagination in forming the image which the music 
seeks to present. The desire for such help is universal and 
persistent. The tendency to name pieces, even where the 
composer himself has not done so, as in some of Men- 
delssohn’s Songs Without Words, or Beethoven’s Moon-
-P-A-G-E-176
  
176 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
light Sonata, is an instance of this. While to the lively 
imagination such aids seem like impertinences, most of us 
like the ‘‘boost” they give. The way in which the modern 
composer, even in his symphonic works, ministers to this 
tendency shows how keenly he appreciates its value. How- 
ever this may be, it is certainly a great aid to the adolescent 
in giving ccntent to his music. 
If the teacher cannot play she will have to call on her 
musical friends or perhaps the students in the class; or, 
better still, for the scope-of her illustrations, will be the 
assistance of a piano player. After telling something of 
the Peer Gynt story or refreshing the children’s minds 
with the fairy scenes of the Midsummer Night’s Dream, 
she will have Grieg’s Peer Gynt suite or Mendelssohn’s 
overture played. The zest which the human interest adds 
to the music will be clearly felt. So, too, the Wagner 
operas, especially The Ring, supply a rich mine for such 
illustrations. For here the great myths which so effectively 
portray the primal passions of mankind, and with which 
the pupils are already somewhat familiar from their liter- 
ary study, gain an added interest from the way in which 
the great composer makes us feel anew their force and 
beauty. 
But our education will lack its discipline if we stop 
with simply feeling, for such a limitation defeats itself. 
The mind must be awakened to observe the means em- 
ployed, and through this perception still deeper feeling 
will be made possible. Let the teacher give as an exam- 
ple the opening of the Rheingold opera; the dullest, when
-P-A-G-E-177
  THE KIGHTH YEAR 177 
the association is made, will feel the flow of the mighty 
river. Now let her ask for the means used to produce 
this effect and all the previous experience and knowledge 
of the pupils will be immediately brought into play. They 
will appreciate the tonic chord, the way the effect is pro- 
duced by the figure employed, the gradual stimulating of 
excitement through the increase in the number of tones 
used in the pulse. They become conscious of the simplic- 
ity of the means and the effectiveness of the result, and as 
a consequence become better musical judges. This is 
only one of many illustrative passages which that opera 
alone supplies. This continual inquiry on the part of the 
teacher (after the pupil has felt the force and beauty of 
the passage) as to how the result has been obtained not 
only raises such listening exercises to the level of the most 
intensive intellectual work elsewhere done by the pupils, 
but also leads to that observation of music necessary to 
place the pupil in a frame of mind which will enable him 
to take pleasure in the forms of pure music represented by 
the fugue and the sonata. 
THIRD STAGE: PURE DESIGN IN MUSIC 
In beginning the study of compositions where symmetry 
is uppermost, short and simple illustrations from Schu- 
mann, similar to those already mentioned, should be used. 
The children will listen to the Soldier’s March, for in- 
stance, and notice that while the same rhythmic figure runs 
throughout the tune there is a passage in the center which 
is so differently treated that the impression is given of a 
Music—12
-P-A-G-E-178
  
  178 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
beginning, a middle, and an end resembling the beginning. 
They will find that in most music this principle prevails, 
but with infinite variety. In some compositions the middle 
may introduce an entirely new idea, while in the longer 
pieces, like St. Nick, each of the three divisions may be 
subdivided into three parts. Practice in the seventh grade 
has trained pupils to appreciate the delicate way by which 
is suggested the relation of these various divisions to one 
another. 
As suggested in the previous chapter, it will be found 
a great advantage in grasping this idea of design if the 
teacher can illustrate how it is worked out under similar 
conditions in arts that appeal to the eye. Take the surface 
decoration, for instance,—such as book covers, rugs, and 
many embroideries,—where similar conditions that control 
music are exemplified. First, the design is not a likeness 
of any organic thing, as in the case of a picture or statue; 
but an organic unity is secured by so grouping and ar- 
ranging the parts as to give the impression of a single 
whole. Second, the way this impression of organic unity 
is obtained can be graphically illustrated by observing 
a beautiful book cover, rug, or embroidery under the same 
conditions that we have in music; that is, not as a whole 
in either case, but in series, as we hear the tones of music 
in succession. Let the reader cover such a design with 
two pieces of paper, a narrow opening being left between 
them. Let him begin to observe with this opening at one 
side of the design and gradually move the papers until 
the opening has slowly traversed the whole. By looking
-P-A-G-E-179
  
THE EIGHTH YEAR 179 
through this narrow slit while the papers are being moved 
he sees the whole design in succession exactly as he hears 
music; first the portion at the outer edge, then those sec- 
tions which lead to the center, and finally the return of 
what was first seen. He will thus have observed a begin- 
ning, a middle, and an end similar to the beginning. By 
taking as examples a sufficient number of surface designs 
we can show that however infinite the variety there is yet 
a perfectly obvious principle underlying the grouping. 
The center of a book cover may be perfectly plain, the 
design being concerned merely with the edge, yet the unity 
of the whole is due to the relationship of the two. Or the 
arrangement may be just the reverse, the center having a 
design and the edges being perfectly plain, but again in 
this case the very plainness of the edge is necessary to 
make the whole effective. 
So in a piece of music the first part may be important 
while the middle sinks almost to a transition passage: or, 
on the contrary, the first and last parts may consist of a 
few chords, seeming to serve merely as introduction and 
conclusion, while the middle contains the main idea, thus 
comprising the greater part of the piece. In Schumann’s 
Soldier’s March, for example, there is but one main idea 
coming in at first, but by a slight chang> of treatment in 
the middle and by the recurrence of the first idea at the 
end, the principle of succession necessary for unity is 
illustrated. If now we compare this piece with S/. Nick 
we find that this middle part has changed from a mere 
variation of the first to an important and distinct feature  
-P-A-G-E-180
  
  180 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
in itself. Thus the idea of repetition and the end it serves 
in producing the feeling of organic unity can be made 
clear both by graphic and musical examples. It must be 
borne in mind that the pupils of these grades are constantly 
employing this principle in much of their design work, 
both in manual training and in art. 
The teacher can now draw attention to a method for 
bringing about unity in design, in which the aim is not so 
much symmetry as relationship of parts to a whole, the 
class described as polyphonic in the preceding chapter. 
Illustrations will again be found in surface designs,— 
such as carpets and wall papers,—in which a figure is 
repeated over and over, the idea being to give a similarity 
with variety to the whole, rather than to break the whole 
into large proportionate parts. Though borders are sup- 
plied they do not have the importance in reference to the 
design as they have in the preceding class. The same 
experiment of moving an opening over a part of a carpet 
or wall paper design shows that a given figure with its 
accessories keeps recurring. This figure may be extremely 
simple or may be quite complex with many complementary 
figures; but that feature which was most characteristic in 
the other illustration, the formal division of masses into 
beginning, middle and end, will be wanting. 
Now if, as an illustration, a Bach invention or a Handel 
fugue is played a similar impression will be gained. The 
opening figure or subject, with others worked out from it, 
will be constantly appearing, but the formal limitation 
that requires the last part to be a repetition of the first is
-P-A-G-E-181
THE EIGHTH YEAR 181 
not apparent. Although in Bach’s fine works a subtle 
relationship of large masses is distinctly felt by the average 
listener, the piece moves on harmoniously with the con- 
trasts that can be worked out from the main subject. It 
makes little difference whether the piece consists of twenty 
measures or two hundred, or whether the design covers 
yards and yards of surface or only a few feet; the prin- 
ciple is the same. The design has no formal limitation as 
when a border, center, and then border again were ex- 
pected, as in the book cover, rug, or embroidery; of a first 
subject, second subject, and first subject again as in 
symmetrical music. Pupils will realize that repetition is 
the principle underlying both modes of attaining unity, 
but that in one case it is secured through symmetry and 
balancing of parts; and in the other, through continuity 
or the constant resemblance of the material to what has 
preceded it. 
With this distinction clearly in mind a more systematic 
observation of polyphonic music can be begun. The 
children sing rounds and notice how the unity is developed 
through this style of repetition; canons and fugues are 
also played to them. Through all this they realize the 
necessity for grasping the initial subject. Their motif 
work has given them excellent training toward this end 
and they take a delight in seeing how Bach plays with his 
subject in an invention or develops it in a fugue. It is 
not necessary at present to take up the subject and counter- 
subject, stretto, and episode; it is the principle of knowing 
how to follow and the practice in following, which are the  
-P-A-G-E-182
  
  182 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
aims of the work. We wish the pupils to be interested in 
listening; the ability to give technical names is not nec- 
essary. With this introduction to polyphonic music, 
pupils become familiar with Bach and Handel, learn 
something of their lives and the times in which they lived, 
and are able to connect a few characteristic compositions 
with the composers’ names. 
The pupils are now ready to observe the sonata form. 
The necessary introduction has already been made by 
developing the idea of repetition in connection with de- 
sign. By starting with the polyphonic school the connec- 
tion is made with the historical development of music. 
Examples can be played from the Bach suites, where, in 
spite of the polyphonic style, the principle of symmetry 
is present; for a double bar near the center indicates the 
second part as balancing the first, and the change of keys ‘ 
at the end of the first part and the working back at the 
commencement of the second part suggest, though rather 
vaguely, what the pupils have already observed as fun- 
damental to those forms of music controlled by the idea 
of symmetry. 
Passing from these to the simplest illustrations of 
Mozart’s and Haydn’s sonatas, the contrast between the 
old idea of continuity and the new idea of proportion 
and symmetry that these examples illustrate is strikingly 
brought out. It is now necessary to ask the same old 
question, how is this done? The pupils observe that there 
are certain important subjects, and that grouped around 
these are lesser ones, the latter being easily distinguished
-P-A-G-E-183
  
THE EIGHTH YEAR 183 
from the others by their very apparent transitional nature. 
They seem to serve as connection between the more im- 
portant subjects. The first part—as far as the double 
bar—of a number of sonatas should now be played until 
the pupils can observe that though the treatment varies 
there is a similarity in principle, a tendency to have main 
subjects with transitional passages, in some cases growing 
into importance so that they rival the main subjects both 
in length and in the attention they receive. This should be 
followed by playing the middle passage, or the fantasia 
part, of the same illustrations, the pupils observing how 
much freer is the employment of material here, resembling 
in some cases the polyphonic treatment. While in the first 
division there was a certain similarity in key treatment, 
the greater freedom in this part will be noted. Finally, in 
the last part of the same sonata movements, often called 
the recapitulation, the resemblance to the first part or ex- 
position will be observed, as also the change of key to bring 
about symmetry, and the tendency to develop the final 
figure, so as to form a tailpiece, or Coda. 
Such a comparison of movements is sufficient to establish 
the following ideas in connection with the sonata form: 
that the first part is an exposition of the material and re- 
quires close concentration if the rest of the work is to be 
intelligible; that this is followed by a second part which 
serves as a contrast to the first and last, and exhibits the 
greatest amount of freedom and variety; and finally, that 
the last part is a recapitulation of the first, but varies from 
it because it ends the work instead of leading into it. The  
-P-A-G-E-184
  
  184 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
pupils realize as never before that a work taking ten or 
fifteen minutes to perform may, without the use of words 
or any other external aid to tell what it is about, still with 
all its variety give the impression of one complete whole. 
They see that this is brought about by a careful adjust- 
ment of parts to one another, and they feel the necessity 
for attentive listening to catch the composer’s thought. A 
sonata of Beethoven demands as much attention as does 
a play of Shakespeare. 
The great advantage of this attitude of mind will be 
apparent when one remembers that the ordinary listener 
thinks of music only as sensuous excitement and for this 
very reason fails to make the effort necessary for the enjoy- 
ment of its higher forms. Besides this advantage of mental 
attitude, there is another in the fact that the sonata form has 
dominated all great instrumental compositions, and that the 
ability to follow its structure is an aid in comprehending 
even the freer forms of modern composers. Therefore, the 
study of the sonata form is not an end in itself, but a means 
by the aid of which the pupil may learn to listen to music 
more intelligently. 
THIRD STAGE: THE MUSICAL SENTENCE 
The knowledge that the sonata contains expositions, 
fantasia, and recapitulation is of no value to the pupil 
if, when he hears a sonata, he is unable to distinguish the 
musical sentences that make up these parts. A student 
familiar with the theory that a drama should consist of five 
acts with the climax in the third will read one of Shake-
-P-A-G-E-185
THE EIGHTH YEAR 185 
speare’s plays with more intelligence than a person who 
knows nothing about the structural differences between 
a novel and a play; yet, after all, a play is appreciated 
through the grasping of each successive sentence, and no 
amount of theoretical knowledge with reference to the 
structure as a whole can compensate the person who does 
not feel the significance of the material as it is presented. 
Hence in music the primary aim is the recognition of the 
musical thought units, the sentences, if you please, of the 
story. It is not at all essential that the pupil be able to tell 
whether a given passage is the second subject in a Beetho- 
ven symphony or is a well-developed phrase in a transi- 
tional passage. It is well worth while, however, for him 
to hear the passage so that he recognizes its difference 
from, and likeness to, what precedes and follows. In this 
stage, therefore, after the pupils have some notion of the 
larger groupings and their relationship to one another in 
the sonata form, the rest of the time set aside for such 
work may well be devoted, not to an attempt at analyzing 
what they hear with reference to such formal groupings, 
but simply to hearing the subject-matter itself. 
To illustrate the method which is used, let the reader 
hum the tune Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot as 
far as the words given, and with pencil in hand draw a 
horizontal line slowly while he sings, commencing with 
the second syllable. Then let him sing the next phrase 
in the same way, making a line under the first, and so on 
through the tune. Now by humming it through a second 
time and grouping these, it will be found that the eight  
-P-A-G-E-186
  
186 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
unite into groups of two, the second of each answering 
the first, and these pairs also group into two, thus divid- 
ing the tune into two halves the latter parts of which are 
similar; by noticing how they are alike or unlike, it is 
possible to name the parts for discussion and study, 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
And never brought to min’ ) 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
And days o’ auld lang syne ) 
For auld lang syne my dear 
For auld lang syne ) 
We'll take a cup o’ kindness now 
For auld lang syne. ) 
The pupils are first given practice in this work through 
the use of folk songs; afterwards they take the simpler 
pieces of Schumann and Schubert until they can easily 
draw a line the whole length of each passage, the ends 
of the lines marking the important cadences, or points 
of division. Dance music is another symmetrical form in 
which the sentences can be traced with comparative ease. 
After the power of listening to the thought has been 
established, comes the utilization of more complex material 
taken from the simpler forms of modern romantic music 
and sonatas, where the musical thought does not break 
up into similar rhythmic units. These may be main sub- 
jects, transitional passages, developed episodes, or the 
Coda. The passage should be played over a number of 
times until the pupils have mentally decided which they 
consider distinct passages or sentences.
-P-A-G-E-187
THE EIGHTH YEAR 187 
After they have drawn the lines, they should compare 
or criticise one another’s work. It will be found that 
hardly any two judgments agree, but this does not affect 
the value of the exercise. One student in listening to a 
large complex subject breaks it up into two or three parts, 
that is, he notices the differences; another who hears the 
same passage groups it all as one whole, his mind being 
attracted by the likenesses. Both are basing their judg- 
ments on real experience, and one is just as valuable as 
the other for developing ability for listening to music. 
From the point of view of the exercise it is not the aim that 
the passage should be named correctly as a whole, but 
that both the unity and the variety should be recognized. 
Drawing a line to mark a passage aids the memory in 
locating it and thus makes it possible to describe what 
one has heard. 
It is true that such intensive intellectual effort in- 
terferes with the delicious reverie with which one likes to 
accompany music heard for enjoyment alone. It must be 
borne in mind, however, that the purpose of this work is 
to develop the power to grasp the content of the music 
and to appreciate the means employed in giving it effect. 
In this respect it differs from the ordinary process of listen- 
ing, in the same way that the reading of poetry for the 
study of the thought and form differs from reading it for 
its rhythmical swing and sonorous tone quality. The first 
method is subsidiary and is justified by the fact that it 
increases one’s power of complete esthetic enjoyment. 
The study of the sonata will naturally awaken, as in
-P-A-G-E-188
188 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
the case of the polyphonic music, an interest in the com- 
posers and their times. The teacher may stimulate this 
interest by having the pupils prepare papers on the lives 
and important works of great masters, connecting this 
exercise as far as possible with their literary and historical 
studies. This work also will be aided by having the ex- 
amples played,—if not by individuals, by instruments,— 
as was suggested for the previous study. 
The extent of the ground to be covered should be de- 
cided not by the subject, but by the capacity and oppor- 
tunity of the class. As far as the material is concerned, 
this work could be effectively carried on throughout the 
high school course. What is here attempted is merely to 
give the pupil an introduction to instrumental music so 
that he can take the fullest advantage of such musical 
opportunities as ordinarily fall to the lot of the average 
person.

CHAPTER XVIII 
PLAN OF INSTRUCTION BY TOPICS 
A PLAN for teaching a topic may have many divisions, 
but four essential processes will always be present. The 
first step is when the teacher thinks over the subject so as 
to have more clearly in mind just what she is going to 
teach. The second step is to think of the topics in the 
light of the probable experience that the pupils have had 
with reference to the subject. The interest with which 
they take it up, what they get out of it, will be pretty surely 
in proportion to what they already know concerning it. 
In the first step, the teacher makes clear in her own mind 
what she wants to teach; she defines her aim, which grows 
largely out of the subject itself. In the second step, she 
defines the probable attitude of the pupils. This attitude 
will be the pupils’ aim with reference to the subject re- 
sulting from their particular experience in relation to it. 
The third step is a union of the first two. The problem 
is, how to realize the teacher’s aim, given the pupils’ ex- 
perience. This step will require the thinking through of 
the lesson, bearing in mind the particular conditions under 
which it will have to be given. The new knowledge is 
welded with the experience of the pupil so that it becomes 
a part of him, his own experience, capable of serving as 
189  
-P-A-G-E-190
  190 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
the starting point for still further knowledge. As in all 
welding, this step requires that the edges shall be pre- 
pared for each other, free in this application from all 
thought obstructions, such as ambiguity or confusion. 
The fourth step consists in testing the new knowledge; 
the teacher hardens, if you please, her weld, by plunging 
it into water. Is the union solid? Can the pupil employ, 
explain, and defend what he knows? 
The fourth step may be very short in academic subjects 
if simply grasping the idea is all that is required; but in art 
study, especially in music, where a technical application 
of the idea is essential to give it value, this step may occupy 
many lesson periods in which the ideas presented are ap- 
plied over and over until skill is gained in their use. 
Thus the lesson plan principle here suggested must 
not be thought of under the limitations of a twenty-minute 
period; yet the ideas must be so closely presented that the 
relation of the various stages to each other is not lost. 
Lesson plans presenting a new principle will not be fre- 
quent in music. There is not a large mass of material 
to be presented to the students, as in geography or history. 
There is, on the other hand, an infinite application of a 
few important musical principles. These are presented 
in the stages and steps of the work of the grades. 
After the idea of one of these principles has been care- 
fully presented, covering in some cases a number of twenty- 
minute periods in succession, there may follow weeks 
when the work is simply the development of skill in the 
application of the principle.
-P-A-G-E-191
PLAN OF INSTRUCTION BY TOPICS Igt 
Let us take the first steps in rhythmic notation as a 
topic to illustrate our point. This is described under the 
third stage of the second year work (Chapter VII). The 
teacher will begin with the first step of the lesson scheme: 
What ideas are implied in the commencement of rhythmic 
notation? These are, first, various tone lengths. She 
must ‘select a number of these, sufficient to illustrate the 
principle, and yet not so many as to make the subject 
complex. Let us say that she decides to use the half, 
quarter, and eighth notes for her illustrations. But half, 
quarter, and eighth mean nothing unless they are realized 
in connection with time values expressed in pulses, e. g., 
a pint, quart, or gallon of milk means nothing unless there 
is some idea as to what the relative capacities of these 
measures are in relation to the person’s own experience. 
Hence a second idea must be added,—the relation of 
halves, quarters, and eighths to each other, i. e., the pulse 
idea. It is the union of these two, duration and pulsation, 
which produces the idea that notation represents. The 
teacher thinks out how the entrance, grouping, and accents 
of tones make the pulse evident, at the same time that 
the pulse makes evident the nature of their relative dura- 
tion. 
She now takes up the second step in the lesson scheme 
and asks herself, ‘What experiences have these second 
year children had with reference to tone duration and 
pulsation that will enable me to combine them so as to 
reach a new principle?” The children in the first year 
have enjoyed walking, marching, and swaying, in con-
-P-A-G-E-192
  1g2 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
nection with music. They have done this at first for the 
pleasure of it. What a strong, lasting pleasure this is, we 
realize when we think that it commences with the gentle 
rocking of the mother’s arm, the “Trot, trot to Boston,” 
of the father’s knee, and that it is still present when the 
gray head keeps time by swaying to the music of band or 
orchestra. 
This first enjoyment of moving to music has been guided 
according to the second and third principles given in 
Chapter I, i. e., the pulse experience has been organ- 
ized so that the unmusical child has become conscious 
of it, and actions like marking time with the foot and 
swinging circles with the hand have made it possible for 
the child of average musical ability to conceive of the 
rhythmic feature of music in the total musical impression. 
Similarly these same principles have been applied in the 
previous work to the idea of duration. The children have 
enjoyed the fun of telling what they were thinking of by 
clapping the tones; Yankee Doodle goes so differently from 
America. They have gone one step further. They have 
differentiated between those two modes of action, not only 
by making the motion for the pulsation idea different from 
that for duration, but also by picturing one with circles 
and vertical lines and the other with dashes of various 
lengths. That is, the children have ideas with reference 
to pulsation and duration as separate phenomena; they 
have experienced them in their music so that they can 
pick them out from simple songs, and they can act and 
picture them separately. This completes the teacher’s re-
-P-A-G-E-193
  
  PLAN OF INSTRUCTION BY TOPICS 193 
view of the children’s experience, which constitutes her 
second step. 
The teacher is now ready to think through her third 
step, which will be to unite what her pupils have in their ex- 
perience—what they know—with what she wishes to teach 
them; in this case, the ability to form ideas from halves, 
quarters, and eighth notes written on the board. In think- 
ing out this step, she will imagine herself before her class 
actually giving the work. We will therefore describe it 
as taking place. 
Her first act will be to draw on the board a group of 
five lines resembling the staff. This the children are fa- 
miliar with, for they have put diagonal dashes on it to 
represent the tones. Instead of such dashes the teacher 
might write a little motif consisting of a quarter, two 
eighths, and a half tone on the same line. She will precede 
the half notes by a vertical bar, and follow it by two bars 
side by side and place at the beginning the time signature 
two-four. The children’s curiosity is awakened by the new 
signs. The teacher tells them that these show how music 
goes and that she is to teach them to-day just how this is 
done. Since the children are familiar with pitch movement 
as well as with rhythmic movement, she will have to devise 
some way to make them realize which kind of musical 
“go” these signs represent. She hums two measures of 
Star Spangled Banner, and asks the children to describe the 
two ways in which it goes. She tells them that the notes 
she has written represent that form of movement which 
they act by swinging and clapping, and picture by circles 
Music—13  
-P-A-G-E-194
  194 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
and dashes. In order to show them how the signs repre 
sent this, she starts by asking them to sing and picture 
some familiar songs, such as Hot Cross Buns and Ding 
Dong Bell. The children make two pictures for each 
song: one with circles to mark the pulse, the other with 
dashes to mark the duration. 
The teacher now thinks over how she shall unite these 
two ideas in order to show the relationship between them. 
She takes up the duration problem first, and gets them to 
realize how the tones in the two songs vary in length: they 
notice that there is a medium length, a longer and a shorter 
one, making three durations in all. 
The teacher’s next problem is to awaken in the children 
the need of some standard by which to measure these. She 
may do this by placing three books before them. The 
children realize that there are differences in sizes as there 
are in tone lengths. With the books they can tell what the 
exact difference is by using a ruler. One book is, say, 
eight inches in length, the second, four. The essential 
thing in the measuring process is that there be a recurring 
unit by means of which the various objects can be com- 
pared in terms of which their differences can be stated, 
such as inches in the case of the ruler and books. The 
teacher’s aim is to make the children realize that in order 
to measure the differences in tones, they need something 
like a ruler, except that the things marked off must be 
equal lengths in time and not in distance. Turning to the 
board she has the children sing and act what is pictured. 
They readily discover that in each tune the pulses and the
-P-A-G-E-195
  
PLAN OF INSTRUCTION BY TOPICS 195 Mo, 
circles recur regularly. Then by means of these they can 
measure. How shall it be applied? In the same way as 
the size of the book was discovered by bringing the book 
and the ruler together. They try applying their pulse 
ruler vocally. She will sing the first three words of Hot 
Cross Buns and ask children to measure with the circles 
and see whether the word “buns” is like “hot cross” in 
length. She will also reverse this process and ask the chil- 
dren to sing Ding Dong Bell while she swings the circles. 
The children discover that not only is the third tone in 
both songs just as long as the two preceding, but by con- 
tinuing these songs they come to passages where two tones 
instead of one come on a circle. Thus they find that they 
can measure three kinds of lengths: one going with the 
pulse, one requiring two pulses, and a short kind of which 
it takes two even tones to fill up a pulse. What has been 
united in tone and action will also be united in tone and 
picture. This picture consists of circles with vertical 
lines just before, and extending above, each large circle. 
The resulting even space above the circles is filled with the 
dashes representing the tones, the length of the dash repre- 
senting one, pulse tone being made the width of the circle, 
that of the two pulse tone being two circles; thus the re- 
lation of duration to pulse is visualized in such a close 
way that the interrelation of the tones represented is not 
lost. 
The teacher now plans to make direct connection be- 
tween the signs she placed on the board at the beginning 
of the lesson and the means for tone measurement that
-P-A-G-E-196
  
196 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
she has developed. She places the quarter note on the 
dash that represents a single circle, the half note on that 
representing two circles, and the eighth notes where two 
dashes come to a circle. She tells the children that mu- 
sicians use these signs instead of pictures, much as they 
themselves use the word dog to save drawing a picture of 
the animal. So the musician draws a vertical line where 
each strong pulse should come. Each line drawn across 
the staff on the blackboard means that the strong pulse 
directly follows it. 
She will now have to bring out the idea that putting 
in the vertical line is not sufficient to give the complete 
pulse idea, since the number of weak pulses which fall be- ~ 
tween two strong pulses varies with diffetent tunes: some 
have only one weak pulse, some have several. The circles 
represent the total number of pulses, but the vertical lines 
represent only the strong pulses. In order to indicate both 
the strong and the weak pulses between two vertical lines, 
the upper figure is placed at the beginning: in this case the 
two shows that there are two pulses between the vertical 
lines. 
She will next state that musicians do not always use 
the same length of note to represent a pulse. While gener- 
ally it is a quarter note, often they use an eighth note, 
and sometimes a half note. To show which note they wish 
to represent the circle, they put another number under the 
first: in the motif on the board the figure four represents 
the circle and means that each pulse is represented by a 
quarter note.
-P-A-G-E-197
PLAN OF INSTRUCTION BY TOPICS 197 
The teacher has now thought out the specific things 
she wishes to teach, and she has planned to combine these 
with what the children already know, in such a way that 
they will have a clearly defined new principle: in this case 
that tones may be definitely measured, and a specific form 
of measurement has been connected with the specific 
signs written on the board, as quarter, half, and eighth 
notes-with the vertical lines and fractional figures for 
defining the pulses. She is now “ready for the fourth step, 
in which she will test both the accuracy of the idea and the 
strength of its association with its symbols. She will plan 
to sing several short phrases in which occur the durations 
“being studied. ‘These the children name with the aid of 
“singing and clapping where necessary. A second plan is 
to sing extremely simple combinations and have the chil- 
‘dren write them down in musical nota ‘When the 
teacher has convinced herself that the idea and the asso- 
ciation are well established, she may present a third group 
of exercises. For this she may write the same durations 
in short motifs of a few tone TEST on THe same pitch, 
and then in the simplest varying tones, and have the chil- 
dren sing them as complete units without hesitation. Ob- 
viously, the fourth step is one that will cover a good many 
lessons; in fact, the principles implied will be in constant 
use every time the pupils read from notation. However, 
each new step in the learning of rhythm notation from now 
on, instead of being, as is very frequently the case, a new 
and unrelated fact to be mastered and remembered, is 
simply a further application of principles already familiar.   
 
-P-A-G-E-198
  \ 
198 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
What is there more deadening than to repeat the same 
explanations year after year, when, if a principle were 
once understood, it would so germinate in the pupil’s 
mind that he would be more than ready to meet the teacher 
halfway? Too often in the search for quick results, the 
development of principle is forgotten. The teacher puts 
the four notes on the board, says whole, half, quarter, and 
eighth, and illustrates by drawing a circle. In order to 
_give it vivid interest, she may call it a pie. She divides 
it vertically in two. The whole pie has become two half 
pies, and, as if the children were fools, she asks how many 
half pies in a whole one, and they respond in joyous unison, 
two. Then she divides it again horizontally; the familiar 
four quartered pie is before their eyes. The teacher asks 
the perfectly obvious question, how many quarters in a 
whole? How many in a half? The united shout of the 
children shows more enthusiasm than thought. Now by 
diagonal lines the pie is cut into eighths. These fractions 
are connected with the notation, and we have apparently 
all the requirements of a good lesson,—a great deal of 
interest, concrete illustration, close application, and yet the 
vital thing to be taught has not been touched. Arrange 
in a musical passage these notes of which the children tell 
the names so glibly, and the children might go through it 
if the teacher sang with them, beating the pulses strongly 
on the table; but let there be a variation in the passage, 
and let the children be asked to do it individually, or even 
collectively, without the aid of the teacher, and they would 
look at her in surprise, showing that she was asking from
-P-A-G-E-199
  PLAN OF INSTRUCTION BY TOPICS 199 
them something of which they had not the slightest con- 
ception. 
The topic chosen for illustrating how a teacher should 
prepare for her lesson was purposely selected from the 
structural elements in music; for on the structural side 
comes the greatest difficulty in teaching. Pitch relations 
and duration values can be presented with their notation 
in such a formal way that they cease to be real things and 
amount only to verbal distinctions, lacking the vitalizin; 
influence of experience. While the danger of losing connec- 
tion with experience is present in all subjects, it is espe- 
cially present in teaching the structure of music. Children 
readily produce pitch, duration, and pulse relationships 
in their songs, but since they are not conscious of these 
relationships as such, when we begin to talk about them, 
it is absolutely essential that the experience for which the 
words stand be also clear in their consciousness. Hence 
the stress laid upon the development of the necessary ex- 
perience, not only in the plan of the lesson by topic above 
suggested, but also throughout the entire book. 
While, in planning the lesson, the structural element 
is the most difficult to manage, the same principle will 
be applied to the interpretative ideas. These can be taught 
with comparative ease, for when a child changes the qual- 
ity of his voice or the quantity of the tone that he employs, 
the rate of movement or articulation, he is distinctly con- 
scious of how these particular changes affect the expres- 
sion of the song. In other words, the constitutive ideas 
of interpretation are more readily connected with the
-P-A-G-E-200
  200 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
experience that brings them into consciousness than are 
structural ideas. 
A brief illustration will show how the same planning 
by topic can be applied to interpretative work. Let us say, 
for instance, that Nevin’s Wind Song is taken. The trip- 
ping movement of the first part and the imitative refrain 
of the wind at the end, these the teacher decides she will 
use for drill in clear articulation, the production of a good 
quality of tone, and practice in making a good, even cres- 
cendo and diminuendo. This is her first step. She next 
thinks over what probable experience the children have 
had both with wind and with songs in which the wind ideas 
have been expressed. She then passes to the third step, 
and thinks through the way she will bring out the clear 
articulation of the first part, and the imitation of the wind 
sound in the last part, due attention being given to posi- 
tion, good breath, and flexible jaw, the leading of the chil- 
dren to recall how the wind grows louder and softer as 
they have heard it, the forward placing of the tone to 
make it soft and at the same time resonant: in short, all 
the material will be passed over in review in this third 
step. She will then probably select some songs the pupils 
already know, and will see whether they can apply the 
newly acquired observation and skill to a better rendering 
of their old favorites, thus completing her fourth step. 
If the importance and fundamental nature of what is 
accomplished by the longer method be borne in mind, the 
time and work required to think out what such a planning 
needs will not be considered too much, The experienced
-P-A-G-E-201
  PLAN OF INSTRUCTION BY TOPICS 201 
teacher will go through these four steps in the preparation 
of her plan almost simultaneously. Long practice has de- 
veloped the technique of her art. But to establish such 
a technique it is essential to break up what is done into the 
parts that constitute it, and practice these simplified parts 
until they can be accomplished readily and with ease. In 
the complicated processes that go on in a lesson, the in- 
experienced teacher who attempts to do everything at once, 
will form habits involving confusion of thought and false 
relationship which will make it more and more impossible 
to gain the necessary technique. 
In this chapter on the lesson plan we have attempted, 
first, to illustrate the steps in the development of a thought 
with reference to actual lessons given; and second, to in- 
dicate how this thought is related to the larger principles 
in accordance with which the material has been arranged 
and work suggested in this book.
-P-A-G-E-202
  CHAPTER XIX 
THE BROAD AND THE NARROW VIEW OF EDU- 
CATION IN RELATION TO MUSIC 
THE narrow view of music teaching produces two dis- 
tinct types of work. The first emphasizes the intellectual 
element, and makes sight singing its goal. It has two 
advantages. The work lends itself to definite measure- 
ment; written exercises and singing tests show what it 
accomplishes; the world’s coarse thumb and finger can 
easily plumb its results. It gets these results by utilizing 
the formal methods, and so is dear to the hearts of many 
teachers in systematized schools. It places its emphasis 
upon the eye rather than upon the ear; hence a larger 
number of the teachers of general subjects are able by its 
means to get results. This in itself would be of greatest 
importance if the results attained could be proved to have 
musical value in after life. 
The second type, which emphasizes the emotional ele- 
ment, though diametrically opposed to that just de- 
scribed, is classified under the narrow view because it also 
is impatient to get results. It asks, “Why all this harrow- 
ing and preparation for work? The pupils are already 
overstimulated to think. We want them to feel. Let us 
202 "
-P-A-G-E-203
  
EDUCATION IN RELATION TO MUSIC 203 
gather all the honey of feeling from the flowers of song, 
and trust to Nature for providing the blossoms.” Sup- 
porters of this view are not merely those temperamentally 
emotional, but also philosophers and leaders of educational 
thought, who, feeling the significance and value of music 
and realizing how much it means to society, naturally 
think that the time spent in schools on music should be 
taken up with songs that will inculcate friendship, love of 
home, love of nature, of one’s country, and of God. When 
the advocates of this type see the entire time of the singing 
period taken up with the practicing of scales and the other 
machinery of sight singing, and observe that the song 
material used is vapid, both musically and poetically, 
written down to the children in order to enable them to 
read the music, the song being treated as an exercise made 
interesting, they are nattirally disgusted with the whole 
American effort at sight singing, and say, “Away with it 
all. Let us do as they do very largely in Germany. Let 
the teacher with violin in hand, lead the children, thus 
reducing the mental effort on their part to simple imitation 
and placing the whole emphasis on the emotional side.” 
They make the mistake, however, of valuing music only 
asameans. They fail to recognize that, being an art, it 
has beauty for its goal, and that beauty, like truth, must 
be sought primarily for its own sake. One who seeks 
beauty because it is good for his health or his morals has 
not the attitude towards it that will enable him to grasp it. 
For, however highly we may regard the by-products of 
artistic activity, art that is pursued for the by-products

fails, because it ceases to be art. It is like the picture or 
the poem that, masquerading under the lion’s skin of art, 
attempts to inculcate morals, love of country, or religion; 
sooner or later the unfortunate voice betrays the imposture. 
There are those who feel that as long as the imposition is 
not recognized the end justifies the means; but they fail to 
realize that the means become abortive because the true 
nature of art has been violated, so that it cannot exercise 
its forceful influence. Hence we fail, both of our ethical 
and artistic results. 
Not only this, but this type of the narrow view, by seeing 
in art only its emotional worth, fails to recognize the neces- 
sity for the intellectual discipline that its genuine apprecia- 
tion demands. Hence, those who hold it are impatient 
with any musical work that is not constantly bubbling with 
emotional fervor. They see no use in the concentrated 
effort, resembling that required in mathematics, which is 
so often demanded in a complete realization of a work of 
art. 
A third objection to this type is that in emphasizing the 
social and collective aspect requiring expression, the field 
is narrowed and the motive weakened. With reference to 
the former, while collective singing has value through its 
intensity, there is much less opportunity for its exercise 
than through those forms of musical expression that we 
utilize simply by hearing, very largely in the field of in- 
strumental music. While the ear training that results 
develops further ability for the same kind of activity, it 
does not necessarily prepare one for instrumental forms of
-P-A-G-E-205
  
  EDUCATION IN RELATION TO MUSIC 205 
expression. There are those who enjoy singing in choruses, 
but to whom instrumental music is meaningless—a good 
example of the modern psychological view that preparation 
in one form of activity does not necessarily lead to the ap- 
preciation of an allied form, even though it be closely 
related. 
Perhaps the most serious drawback is that it weakens 
the motive for musical activity through the disregard of 
the individual point of view. The individual sings patri- 
otic or religious songs, not because he values the social 
worth of the emotions they awaken, but primarily because 
he lovesto sing. When manis stirred with patriotic fervor, 
either in time of war or by some eloquent address, or under 
any stimulating social feeling, the social song comes to 
the front and is sung with vigor and enjoyment; but the 
average prosaic life does not offer sufficient opportunities 
for such expression. In an ordinary state of mind, a per- 
son will sing a patriotic or religious song for the attract- 
iveness there is in the song; in other words, for what he 
feels is its beauty. The emotional type of narrow view, 
by disregarding the training in musicianship that will pre- 
pare the individual to see the beauty in music independ- 
ently of all extraneous influences, destroys the strongest 
motive for musical expression and, as we have already 
said, defeats its own end. 
Both forms of the narrow view emphasize important ele- 
ments in music teaching. They stand in the way of a more 
comprehensive plan because of the truth they contain. It 
is right that early and definite results should be sought.

206 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
The reputation both of the teacher and of the school system 
are largely judged by what they immediately accomplish. 
It requires self-restraint and discipline for the farmer to 
leave his field fallow when he might be getting crops. It 
takes a broad view to plow deep and fertilize well when 
the immediate harvest can be got with less effort. With 
the pressure for results upon her the teacher needs moral 
courage to allow time for preparing the pupils’ minds, 
when by appealing directly to memory she can have not 
only the forms of knowledge repeated to her, but the proc- 
esses as well, and so cleverly that only the most careful 
observer can detect the lack of genuine understanding. 
These quick responses are the product not of thought but 
of imitation. It is because we are deceived as to the results 
of the narrow view that it is often considered more effective 
than the broad, comprehensive treatment. 
It is not only the intellectual and the emotional aspects 
of the narrow view that are obstacles to the successful 
carrying out of more comprehensive schemes of music 
teaching. There are practical objections. The broader 
view demands special training on the part of the teacher 
and the exercise of the mind in discrimination through the 
use of the ear, an organ almost never used for discrimina- 
tive work outside of music and the incidental phonics work 
in English. When we consider how little training in either 
of these the average teacher gets, it is not surprising that 
when she tries to deal with tonal ideas she should feel 
entirely unable to cope with the problem, like the proverbiai 
hen with her brood of ducklings. Lessening this demand  
-P-A-G-E-207
EDUCATION IN RELATION TO MUSIC 207 
  for special training is the fact that when music is taught 
in a truly educational way, it can easily be related to other 
forms of educational work carried on in a similar spirit. 
The teacher who for nature study and English, requires 
individual observation and the formulation and expression 
of what is observed in cogent and effective manner, who 
makes all the geography, arithmetic, and writing grow out 
of the experiences of a pupil’s daily life and knows how 
to make her work significant, will have little trouble in 
teaching music along the broad view, even though her 
musical training may not be extensive. It is certainly the 
experience of all supervisors that the teacher working along 
true educational lines will get better results in music than 
the merely musical teacher who, unable to analyze her own 
processes, gets only thoughtless and imitative results by 
leading the pupils with her voice, Pay 
Another objection besides the training required, is that 
the carrying out of the broad view does demand time. 
Music in many schools at present fails to get the time it 
needs, because, under the control of the narrow view it 
aims only at, immediate results, and so does not exercise 
that lasting influence upon life which would justify those 
who arrange school programmes in giving it more time. If 
society and school authorities realized how much more 
the broad view would make possible of accomplishment, 
there would be no difficulty in getting either the training 
or the time essential for the work. 
The broad view not only attains all that the narrow view 
aims to accomplish, but adds two distinctive features: in-
-P-A-G-E-208
  208 EDUCATION THROUGH MUSIC 
dividual initiative and the munication of feeling. The development of individ MP tiative renders it possible not only for the act of producing music, but for the far more frequent act of hearing music, to involve an active 
codperation of both the thought and the imagination of the pupil. By demanding thought and imagination, music causes the self to take such a real part in what is heard ——— that throughout life a continual development ever widens and deepens the power for joyous experience. 
The communication of feeling is brought about through 
the development of musical ideas which charge the sen- suous beauty of music with the expressive qualities of language, not duplicating language where it is effective, but conveying the expression where language fails. When the reader considers how vital is language in differentiating 
man from the brute, he will feel the importance of this subtler language, which has the power of carrying man far beyond the limitations of speech. In terms of the aim of artistic education stated in the first chapter: the broad view Tepresents an education through music that quickens per- ception, clarifies feeling, and|stimulates initiative for the beautiful.

PREFACE 
THE purpose of this study is to summarize, supplement, and in- 
terpret the work so far done in mental measurement in the field 
of educational and vocational guidance. 
At present there are three kinds of literature in this field, no one 
of which is adapted to the needs of the general reader among per- 
sons engaged in educational work. First, there are reports on re- 
search in testing. These reports are technical and statistical and 
often forbidding to the general student of education. Second, 
there are books describing, in technical language and at great 
length, the use of tests in education. Such books are indispensable 
to the student of testing, but they rarely furnish a succinct and 
unbiased critical analysis of the sociological and philosophical im- 
plications and applications of the testing movement. Third, there 
is a controversial literature, alternately condemning and extrava- 
gantly supporting the procedures and practices of testing and 
measuring. 
Our aim is to meet the needs of the general reader in education 
who wishes, as we think, a comprehensive survey of the field, a 
brief, clear statement of the findings to date, and a short but com- 
prehensive list of typical books, articles, and reports on studies as 
a guide to further reading on specific points. We intended to con- 
duct certain experiments in measurement fields somewhat neg- 
lected, to illustrate valid procedure necessary to the further de- 
velopment of educational and vocational guidance, but we were 
not able to carry out these experiments. 
The views herein expressed were codperatively formulated as 
an outcome of prolonged study, discussion, and testing. Our posi- 
tions must remain our own responsibility, but we recognize the 
tentative nature of all research in such fields as testing, educa- 
tional guidance, and vocational guidance, all of which, so far as 
modern developments are concerned, are still in their teens.

vi PREFACE 
Our selection of materials for each bibliography is distinctly 
limited on the basis of availability, appropriateness, and variety 
in point of view. Under each section of the study are included a 
few important references, some of which reinforce and some of 
which are contrary to our positions. 
The importance of measurement for educational and vocational 
guidance can hardly be overestimated, though at the same time 
the dangers in its wrong use are great. On the one hand, no care- 
ful work is possible without well-established standards of attain- 
ment which may be used with reasonable accuracy for large 
numbers of children. On the other hand, measurement is a sharp 
tool, and in the hands of those who work too fast or carelessly, 
much harm is likely to result. The present seemed to us an oppor- 
tune time to record accomplishments to date, to outline possible 
and practicable procedures, to state warnings in reference to pos- 
sible misuses, and to set forth other items in a complete program 
. of guidance, with which measurement must be coédrdinated.

  PART I 
INTRODUCTORY 
I. DEFINITION OF FUNDAMENTAL TERMS 
1. Meaning of measurement. As understood in this discussion, 
measurement refers to every attempt to secure quantitative data 
about the present and potential ability or knowledge of students 
or other individuals with a view to the use of such data for their 
educational or vocational progress. 
2. Mental measurement. The term mental measurement refers 
to quantitative data on traits, abilities, and accomplishments in- 
volving educational and vocational experience. The word mental 
is used broadly to represent all phases of thought or feeling. By 
the expression mental tests is meant all tests commonly called 
psychological. Under the term mental we also include the tests 
of mechanical and other skills ordinarily used in occupational 
life. (See II, below.) 
3. Educational guidance. For the purposes of this treatment, 
educational guidance may be defined as assisting persons, either 
through classifying them into appropriate groups or by individual 
or group conferences, in making progress in their educational 
careers. Educational guidance is concerned with such problems 
as how to study, choice of studies and curriculums, and choice of 
schools and colleges. 
4. Vocational guidance. Vocational guidance may be defined 
as informing students about vocations or assisting them in choos- 
ing, preparing for, entering upon, or making progress in occupa- 
tions. 
5. Other factors in guidance. Physical measurement, whether 
anthropometric measurements or the measurement of specific 
physical skills, is not included in this treatment, except as it re- 
lates to mental measurements for educational or vocational guid- 
ance. 
Mental measurement can represent but a small factor in carry- 
ing on educational and vocational guidance. In addition to such

general factors as the influence of home, church, and community, 
the following, connected with school and vocational life, may also 
be noted: survey courses, try-out courses, student activities, 
classes in occupations, counseling, vocational education, place- 
ment, employment supervision, mental hygiene, labor organiza- 
tions, personnel management.

II. CLAssrIFICATION OF MEASUREMENTS AVAILABLE 
1. Testing and rating. There are two chief kinds of mental 
measurements available: testing and rating. The difference be- 
tween testing and rating is one only of degree. A satisfactory test 
should consist of a carefully drawn-up series of questions, the 
answers to which are fairly well agreed upon by specialists in the 
particular field of activity tested. A rating plan, however, is an 
appraisal based on a number of estimates. These estimates are 
likely to be based on opinions or comparisons, and usually concern 
a number of factors or characteristics. The rating plan is thus 
more subjective than the test, and the test is more nearly objective. 
“What is the capital of Spain?” or “What is the product of 16 
and 5?” will illustrate a test question. An example of a rating 
question is the following: Arrange these three pupils, A, B, and 
C, on the basis of each of three characteristics: initiative, scholar- 
ship, and trustworthiness. 
The terms “mental tests,” “psychological tests,” ‘intelligence 
tests,” “aptitude tests,” “trade tests,” etc., have been used in 
various ways in the literature of mental testing. Since all of the 2966

-P-A-G-E-15
  INTRODUCTORY 5 
tests considered in this paper have certain mental elements, the 
term ‘“‘mental test” is used to cover all forms. There need be no 
distinction drawn between the terms ‘‘mental” and “‘psychologi- 
cal,” since the two expressions are logically the same. 
2. Classification of mental tests. Within the field of mental tests 
there are two bases of classification corresponding to two ques- 
tions: (x) Is the test based on mere random or fortuitous experi- 
ence without specific education or is it based on a period of defi- 
nite education, training, or other preparation? and (2) Is the test 
specific or general? 
3. Classification on the basis of fortuitous experience as con- 
trasted with education: 
(a) Fortwitous experience tests are those which are based on skill and knowl- 
edge “picked up” through daily living and experience without any specific 
instruction. Tests in the following information may be cited as examples, 
provided there has been no specific instruction: Reproducing a series of dig- 
its, naming the days of the week, identifying a certain kind of automobile, 
remembering records of athletic teams, assembling a set of blocks, working 
a puzzle, filling a form-board. 
(b) Educational tests are those based on definitely learned material through 
formal instruction; as, for example, tests in arithmetic, history, spelling, 
stenography, battery repair, telegraphy, or blacksmithing, provided these 
are based on instruction. 
Nore. — The distinction between fortuitous experience tests and educa- 
tional tests is at times difficult to make, on account of obvious overlapping, 
and in most cases is of little significance. Where the test is on information or 
skill acquired through casual or uninstructed reading of newspapers or ran- 
dom conversation or unsupervised experience it can hardly be called an edu- 
cational test. When the test is based on a definite period of instruction in 
schools or employment, it is obviously something more than casual experi- 
ence and may well be called an educational test. 
There is no justification for using the term mental test or psychological 
test for but one kind of test. 
4. Classification on the basis of the specific as contrasted with the 
general nature of the test: 
(a) Specific tests are those narrowly related to a definite skill or problem. 
They are related to questions on a specific field of knowledge. Examples may 
be noted as follows: Tests in skill in multiplying, skill in acetylene welding, 
knowledge of the geography of Australia. 
(b) General tests are those based on a variety of specific abilities or specific 
items representing diverse abilities, selected broadly enough to merit the use 
of the word “general.” An example may be noted as follows: A test de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
signed to include all of the following: knowledge of simple processes learned 
in school, manual skill, and common information learned in miscellaneous 
life relationships. A test including several of the school subjects is more nearly 
general than a test in one subject. A test including manual as well as mental 
elements is more general than the ordinary “psychological test.” 
5. Rating as a form of mental measurement. The other impor- 
tant kind of mental measurement is called rating. A system of 
tating by means of careful appraisal may be resorted to in many 
cases where testing is not practicable. Rating as ordinarily under- 
stood in measurement literature consists in the use of a scale of 
points and the estimation of an individual’s ability on this scale. 
The chief difficulties in rating are its ‘‘subjective” nature and the 
fact that it is impossible to formulate any specifications giving the 
location of the zero point or the one hundred point on such a scale. 
Nevertheless, it is possible by means of rating to estimate an in- 
dividual’s qualities of character in a more definite fashion than 
can be done by mere descriptive phrases. Thus an individual’s 
possession of initiative or persistence may be rated on a three- 
point scale: low, medium, or high, if we carefully draw up de- 
scriptive specifications for each of these three points. A rough 
form of rating is universally used in the language of daily life, and 
rating systems seek to refine these methods into measurable and 
comparable gradations. 
6. “Native Ability.” In the nature of things there can be no 
real tests of so-called ‘‘native ability”; acquired ability is the 
only thing which can be tested. The induction is drawn that 
those persons who are alert or well-informed in many fields, espe- 
cially if several of these fields be unrelated to school instruction, 
have high native ability. 
7. Other designations. Certain other terms are used to describe 
various tests, but in every case they will be found to fall under one 
or more of the several categories listed above: 
(a) “Aptitude tests” are usually built out of simple exercises resembling, 
or introductory to, tasks in a specific department of occupational life or other 
activity. Thus the assembling of a door lock and other such objects may be 
used to measure what is called mechanical aptitude. (See below, p. 21.) An 
aptitude test is usually a test of fortuitous experience. 
(0) “Trade tests” are built out of sample jobs, and questions about such 
jobs, in relation to a particular trade. The common kinds of trade tests are 
 
-P-A-G-E-17
  MTSU LIBRARY INTRODUCTORY 
oral, when they are answers to questions based on trade terminology or pro- 
cesses; picture, when they are based on questions relating to pictures or dia- 
grams; performance, when they are based on the doing of actual sample jobs. 
A trade test is an educational test or a fortuitous experience test depending 
on the particular background of the person being tested. It is usually very 
specific in scope. (See below, p. 29.) 
(c) “Commercial tests,” ‘industrial tests,” “professional tests,” etc., are 
terms which are self-explanatory, in view of the above explanations. 
(d) “Standard tests” are any kind of tests which have been standardized; 
that is, the procedure is definitely outlined, and the resulting scores may be 
compared with scores which have been obtained for a large number of per- 
sons, with approximate averages for various groups of persons. 
(e) “Binet tests,” the “Army Alpha test,” or ‘general intelligence tests,” 
“psychological tests” (in the narrow signification of the term), are tests of 
fortuitous experience and are intended to be general in scope. 
(f) Fortuitous experience tests might be designated by other expressions 
frequently used — “‘empirical,”’ “casual,” etc. 
(g) Certain expressions relate to the form or manner of the test; for ex- 
ample, ‘analogy test,” “miniature test,” “‘job sheet test,” etc. 
(hk) Certain other expressions relate to the standard, level, or result of the 
test; for example, “‘apprentice test,” “superior adult test,” “college en- 
trance test,” “‘illiterate test,” etc. 
(i) “Performance tests” are sometimes distinguished from intelligence 
tests. Intelligence tests which use only questions and answers depending 
upon mere knowledge should hardly be called “general.” Hence perform- 
ance tests are sometimes used to supplement tests of a linguistic nature, and 
are concerned with mechanical ability very similar to that required in trade 
tests, though less specialized. 
(j) “Group tests” are designed for the simultaneous testing of a number 
of persons; “individual tests” for but one person. 19 6 
8. Characteristics of a test. The qualities of a good test include, 
among other points, the following: 
(a) It must contain elements selected at random or through careful co- 
operative judgment, and must be wide enough in scope to form a compre- 
hensive test of ability to be measured. 
(6) It must be perfectly clear and unequivocal in its language and direc- 
tions. 
(c) It must be graded in difficulty, in order that it may be neither too hard 
nor too easy. 
(d) It should be wide enough in scope to give a fairly accurate picture 
of the ability to be measured. 
(e) It must be easily administered both as to time, apparatus, expense, 
and qualifications of the examiner. If well planned, it may sometimes be 
given by a person unpossessed of the skill tested. 
(f) It should be easily scored. 
(g) It should be standardized.

  PART II 
MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
I. NEED FOR MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
1. Grouping of pupils for effective learning. Both classroom 
methods and individual instruction require measurement. A con- 
dition of satisfactory progress is that every lesson be well adapted 
to the power of the learner or learners: that it be neither too hard 
nor too easy. When class groupings are to be made, the way to 
find out how the group should be organized is through measure- 
ment of accomplishment and ability. The question, “‘What chil- 
dren shall be grouped together?” requires a careful survey of the 
important learning factors. Further, as the child proceeds in self- 
control and begins to choose his own studies, courses, curriculum, 
school, and college, he must choose to associate himself with the 
groups in which his learning may be most effectively carried on, 
Age alone is not a sufficient basis for choice, promotion, or classifi- 
cation, nor is the composite mark obtained in school studies. 
Scientific classification, even if it must necessarily be somewhat 
of a compromise, requires many other measures. Furthermore, 
measures must be as exact as possible: not based on guesses nor 
dependent wholly upon the personal opinion of the teacher, but 
rather, based on scales or standardized measures as nearly objec- 
tive as it is possible to make them. 
2. Educational progress. One purpose of the junior high school 
being to discover the interests and abilities of students, it becomes 
necessary to provide broad courses in such subjects as English, 
social studies, science, mathematics, practical arts, etc., to explore 
these interests and abilities. Early specialization must give way 
to more diversified work. If these exploratory courses are to serve 
their purpose, measurement will be required to furnish a basis for 
educational counsel. Such educational tests as may be devised 
throughout the various exploratory courses should measure as 
objectively as possible the reaction of the individual to the work 
under consideration. Such tests, consequently, will try out in- 
9
-P-A-G-E-20
  Io MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
terest and ability and thus serve as a basis of prognosis. The 
scores in some forms of progress tests may be thrown into the form 
of learning curves by which the student himself may measure his 
progress and form his own conclusions about the investment of his 
future educational effort.

II. ApprovED PROCEDURE FOR EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT 
1. Tests available. For educational guidance all the tests de- 
scribed in Section II of Part I, above, are available. Mental 
tests of various kinds should be given throughout as much of the 
school system as possible; most certainly to all children who are 
in any way difficult school problems. For accuracy of measure- 
ment, individual tests are to be preferred to group tests. Their 
cost in time and money limits their use to problem cases and to 
the special study of those whose score is very low or high in the 
group examinations, or to those for whom it is thought that the 
group examination has not been sufficiently accurate. 
2. Tests in subject-matter. Educational tests of school achieve- 
ment should be given for the purpose of determining as accurately 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
     MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE Ir 
as possible both the pupil’s accomplishment in all subjects studied, 
and the subjects in which he needs special help. 
3. Use of tests in counseling. Counseling on educational mat- 
ters makes use of specific and general tests to estimate the proba- 
bility of success. As school work is now organized, a person who 
tests low in a general mental test ought to be warned about the 
problem ahead of him if he chooses a college preparatory curri- 
culum, or turns too suddenly to a program of new or abstract 
studies — such a problem as beginning algebra and Latin (as they 
are now usually taught) at the same time. A school program call- 
ing for varied abilities manual, mental, and aesthetic — is 
individually and socially more valuable than the illiberal, all- 
academic one, and fortunately, a greater number of students are 
likely to succeed with it. 
4. Tests do not show certainty. It is statistically fallacious to 
apply averages rigidly to individuals. Tests show mere proba- 
bility of success: there is no “lower level” score, which should 
automatically exclude persons from entrance upon a given study, 
curriculum, or school. 
5. Ratings on traits of character. Approximate measurements are 
possible through rating scales. A person with a moderate score in 
a general mental test may succeed in a rigidly academic program 
if he has a high degree of faithfulness, initiative, persistence, and 
desire to be of service in the world. Such qualities of character may 
be approximately measured by grouping children (provided the 
one who does the rating is well acquainted with them and their 
activities), into three to five separate ranks in each quality, from 
the lowest to the highest. 
6. Composite judgments. Both the level of general mental de- 
velopment and that of educational achievement, together with 
other factors, should be considered in classification or in any other 
attempts at educational guidance. Other factors which, in as far 
as possible, should be considered are: chronological age, physical 
traits, and character development, as shown by persistence, relia-~ 
bility, leadership abilities, and other qualities of character. In 
classification attention should sometimes be given to special abili- 
ties. A “control sheet” giving a composite picture of the class 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  12 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
group being studied should be put into the hands of the teachers 
and supervisor concerned. This sheet should contain data on 
many kinds of tests, educational records, and ratings on impor- 
tant qualities of character. 
7. The plan used in Providence. One of the most comprehen- 
sive and careful plans of educational guidance is that worked out 
at Providence. Estimates of the ability and environment of each 
child are made on the following factors: occupational, educa- 
tional, and economic status of parents; chronological age, mental 
age, and intelligence quotient of the pupil and the median intelli- 
gence quotient of his class; height, weight, health, outside activi- 
ties, and home study; ability in reading, arithmetic, science, 
history, literature, use of language, and spelling, educational age, 
and effort. The card shows graphically the general trend, which 
is then designated as the classification score of the pupil. On the 
basis of these data, tentative suggestions are drawn up for the 
possible modification of the pupil’s ProeEithy The categories used 
are, for accelerated pupils, as follows: “margin of safety,” ‘‘pos- 
sible enrichment,” “enrichment,” “limit of acceleration”; and 
for normal or retarded children, as follows: “normal,” “margin 
of safety,” “danger line,” “possible differentiation,” ‘probable 
differentiation,’ ‘differentiation or specialization,’ “special 
program.’ These, again, are used to estimate whether or not the 
individual should be required to repeat the course, given a trial 
promotion, or accelerated in his school progress. 
8. Classifications. Ability grouping is of greater importance in 
some studies than in others. It is especially advantageous, for 
example, in mathematics, languages, science, and other highly 
consecutive studies. In certain branches of school activity there 
is not so great need for ability grouping within a grade; for ex- 
ample, in music, drawing, practical arts, physical education, all 
student activities, and possibly the social studies. 
9. Adaptation of subject-matter. All attempts at classification 
should be accompanied by adaptations of courses of study and in-

  MEASUREMENT IN EDUCATIONAL GUIDANCE 13 
or at least the pupils of lower mental ability might be segregated 
for specially adapted training. 
10. Grouping tentative. Classification should be tentative and 
with ample provisions for transfer. Classification should be done 
cautiously, so as to prevent any stigma being placed on children 
of low mental ability or low scholastic attainment. Such expres- 
sions as “inferior children”’ should be eliminated. No system of 
grouping should prevent the free contact of all normal children 
with each other in student activities, athletics, auditorium exer- 
cises, and out-of-school activities. 
11. Fair basis of judgment. In the use of tests and rating, too 
much attention must not be given to the results of a score in one 
test. Many tests called “general” are not general at all, since 
they leave out of account manipulative skills, aesthetic, and ethi- 
cal reactions, and practical judgment as shown in daily activities. 
Proved ability to solve daily problems successfully should out- 
weigh all other tests.

  14 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
III. Resurtts AcHIEVED THROUGH EDUCATIONAL 
MEASUREMENT 
1. Classification, promotion, and guidance. The most impor- 
tant result to be achieved by educational measurements is a better 
form of individual and class guidance and instruction, with a rate, 
amount, and quality of learning appropriate to each individual 
and to each of the various groups. This will involve scientific 
classification, based on educational diagnosis and try-out, and 
rapid promotion for some pupils, as well as slower learning for 
others, depending on individual differences. 
2. Tests merely preliminary. Tests must not be substituted for 
instruction or guidance. After buildings, equipment, and teachers 
are provided, and tests have been given, and pupils classified, 
there remains the task of teaching and educating children. 
3. Safeguarding results. For dependable results, the giving of 
tests, unless very carefully supervised, should be in the hands of 
well-trained persons. In all cases the interpretation, application, 
and use of testing results should be made only by well-qualified 
persons. 
4. Additional uses. Other results to be obtained, directly or in- 
directly, in a testing program are as follows: keeping account of 
the progress of individuals; discovery of those who are working 
below their ability; educational guidance for choice of studies, 
courses, curriculums, and schools; enrichment of school program 
for slower pupils who need diversified work, and for bright children 
who can profit by an extra amount of school or outside studies; 
rapid promotion in so far as it is consistent with such enrich- 
ment and with the mental and physical development of the child. 
Tests are also used to increase educational opportunity by 
admitting promising students to work for which their regular 
preparation is lacking. 
An interesting plan of measurement may be applied to a check 
list of desirable accomplishments. Thus each pupil may be graded 
as poor, fair, or good, in such attitudes or activities as the follow- 
ing: liking for school, ability to study, ability in speaking, abil- 
ity to use study tools, attention to classroom work, preparation 
for making important educational decisions.

PART III 
MEASUREMENT IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
EpvucaTIONAL guidance, consistently pursued, leads to vocational 
guidance, just as general education should lead, in a comprehen- 
sive program, to specialized effort in vocational education. 
I. NEED FOR MEASUREMENT IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
1. Lack of standards. Part of the present confusion in occupa- 
tional life is due to the lack of definiteness resulting from the scar- 
city of standards and agreed-upon measurements of ability in 
vocational processes. Furthermore, the public at large is con- 
fused in its estimates, not only about wage standards, but also 
about the skills and knowledges required in the several callings. 
2. Needs for occupational analyses. Specifically, employers 
should include in their job analyses and job specifications the de- 
gree of skill and knowledge required for each task. 
3. Needs of the student. An individual seeking knowledge of oc- 
cupations or a try-out in any one of them, should be able to com- 
pare his knowledge or ability with a standardized test or task. 
An individual faced with the task of choosing an occupation 
should be able to compare his discovered abilities and personal 
characteristics with the requirements of the several occupations 
he is considering. 
4. Needs of the worker. Tests to measure one’s progress in his 
vocational education, and in his progress in gaining the personal 
qualifications and skills required, together with rating systems for 
scientific estimates of such qualities and skills, should be available 
for the guidance of all workers.

II. OccupationAL LEVELS AS SHOWN By TESTING 
1. Arrangement by average scores. There seems to be a consecu- 
tive arrangement of occupations based upon relative scores in 
comprehensive tests. Nevertheless, the overlapping of test scores 
among the several occupations is so great that definite guidance 
on the basis of general mental ability is not possible. Each in- 
dividual evidently might give satisfactory service in one or more 
among a large number of occupations. Observation indicates that 
many occupations need some workers of high intelligence, and yet 
can use to advantage other individuals of far more moderate 
intelligence. 
2. Success probabilities. Since the intelligence ratings of per- 
sons in any occupation are distributed in a normal manner within 
the range of that calling, the general intelligence of an individual 
may be said to suggest, roughly, the probability of his success or 
failure. Thus a boy whose intelligence quotient measures 100 will 
probably, if we consider this measure alone, have a high proba- 
bility for success as a machinist, and not nearly so good a chance 
of success as an engineer.

TII. MEASUREMENTS AVAILABLE IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
1. General mental ability. For vocational guidance it is possible 
to make some use of practically all of the mental tests described 
in Part I. The “general tests” are likely to show, in a rough 
way at least, mental levels upon which the probability of occupa- 
tional success may be predicted. 
2. Rating scales. Furthermore, rating scales for the analysis 
of character traits possessed by an individual are helpful to indi- 
cate possible correspondence between the abilities and interests 
of the student on one side and the traits required by an occupa- 
tion on the other. A self-analysis by means of a rating scale indi- 
cates to the counselor whether or not the student is thinking 
carefully about his problem. (See Gowin, p. 338.) 
3. Simple tasks used as tests. In addition to “general tests” 
based on casual experience and rating scales, “aptitude tests” will 
frequently disclose possibilities, particularly if used in connection 
with work in the practical arts of agriculture, industry, or com- 
merce. Such tests may take the form of informal examinations 
based on the performance of standardized tasks. 
4. Tests of occupational ability. “Trade tests” or “occupa- 
tional tests” of a standardized character were first developed 
effectively by the Committees on the Classification of Personnel 
of the United States Army during the World War. Many addi- 
tional tests are now available, especially in industry and com- 
merce. 
5. Professional tests. Tests of excutive ability and standardized 
questionnaires or check lists, to make an estimate of ability re-

IV. AppROVED PROCEDURE FOR VOCATIONAL MEASUREMENT 
1. Careful formulation. The scientific construction of a voca- 
tional test is described in references noted below. (See especially 
Chapman, Link, Brewer, Proctor, Toops, Thurstone, Yoakum.) 
2. Rating scale. The careful construction of a rating scale de- 
pends generally upon its objective nature, i.e., upon a careful 
drawing up of such descriptive specifications as shall enable all 
intelligent persons to agree approximately and without delay on 
the meaning of the several estimates. (See Scott, pp. 208-225.) 
3. Instruction before testing. Testing or rating should uni- 
versally be preceded whenever possible with definite instruction, 
guidance, and such other educational opportunity as shall enable 
the student to prepare for the test. 
4. Suiting the test to the student’s ability. Tests should, there- 
fore, be standardized on the basis of several levels of education or 
training. Thus, a student of printing who has had ten hours of 
instruction should have a different standard from that imposed 
upon a student who has studied printing twenty hours. 
MTSU LIBRARY
-P-A-G-E-30
20 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
5. Careful use of tests. Testing and other measurement should 
be administered by a person well qualified by psychological train- 
ing and experience. 
6. Tentative use of results. The results of testing and other 
forms of measurement would be used with greatest discretion. It 
is usually good policy to have the person who does the measuring 
submit his recommendation to a second well-qualified person who 
is actively interested in the educational welfare of the individual 
concerned. Thus many mistakes will be avoided and full oppor- 
tunity will be afforded for the consideration of factors which are 
not measurable. 
Succeeding sections outline the use of measurement in the sev- 
eral steps in the vocational progress of an individual.

V. Testinc To Amp IN THE DISCOVERY OF ABILITY 
1. Discovery of aptitude. An estimation of ‘“‘vocational apti- 
tude” must always be based on what it may be possible to learn 
about acquired ability. Thus, an aptitude cannot be discovered 
without an appraisal of the child’s accomplishments to date. An 
“aptitude” is really a potential ability, and a potential ability is 
nothing more than present ability plus faith or a guess as to im- 
provability. This faith or guess can be founded on solid ground 
only when there has been ample opportunity for acquiring some 
of this ability, or closely related ability. 
Suppose, for example, that a boy or girl is able to answer the 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
    
  MEASUREMENT IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 21 
following questions correctly; it is quite clear that he possesses 
skill or knowledge in a technical field which at least suggests apti- 
tude for a certain kind of work connected with the building trades. 
What is used to hold in a pane of glass besides putty? 
How do we make the putty stick to the wood? 
What do we do if the putty crumbles? 
What do we do if the putty is too sticky? 
How can putty be colored? 
What are two instruments used to cut glass? 
Suppose, also, that a simple task is set such as the cutting of a 
piece of glass to a specific size, with the necessary tools provided, 
and this too is done correctly. This ability again suggests certain 
aptitudes which may be capitalized for purposes of vocational 
guidance. 
2. Background experience. Since it is useless to ask persons 
such questions as the above unless they have had some oppor- 
tunity for experiences related to these problems, a background of 
achievement club work, “try-out courses,” exploratory courses, 
or “acquaintance courses” is necessary. This background should 
be broad in scope, including exercises from gardening, industrial 
work, commercial projects, and also activities which develop 
qualities of character particularly necessary for professional 
occupations. 
3. Value of clubs and scouting. Achievement clubs furnish ex- 
cellent opportunity for the discovery of interests and ability. In 
the production and sale of articles a very real (and vocational!) 
standard of measurement is applied. Another source of self- 
discovery for boys and girls is offered through scoutcraft. The 
merit badge tests are genuine measures of skill and technical 
knowledge. Following is the test for the merit badge in Dairy- 
ing, from the Official Handbook of the Boy Scouts of America: 
Merit Bapce Test: DaIRyING 
To obtain a merit badge for Dairying, a scout must: 
x. Understand the management of dairy cattle. 
2. Be able to milk. 
3. Understand the sterilization of milk, and care of dairy utensils and 
appliances. 
Test at least five cows for ten days each, with the Babcock test, and 
make proper reports. 4.
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
4. Measurement necessary. The scientific development and or- 
ganization of try-out courses require the measurement of progress. 
Such measurement is no different from tests of finished ability as 
illustrated by the so-called trade tests given in the United States 
Army. Such tests will be discussed in Section VIII. Their scope 
and general character must obviously be simplified for the testing 
of progress in try-out courses. The form df the tests may be oral, 
written, picture, or performance. 
5. Use of rating. Where definite measurement is impossible, 
methods of rating should be used. Thus, it is possible to group in- 
dividuals roughly according to the degree of such a quality of 
character as patience, perseverance, or codperativeness, as indi- 
cated in Part I, Section II. Since such qualities of character 
are often more important than mental level, measurement in this 
field, with whatever tools we possess, should not be neglected. 
Purposes, motives, aims, must be considered, if abilities are to be 
discovered. In addition to measurement and rating, information 
and advice from the standpoint of physical and mental hygiene 
will frequently be necessary in order to assist individuals in mak- 
ing proper educational and vorational adjustments. 
6. Choice and ability. Though there may often exist interest 
without ability, or a moderate amount of skill without interest, 
there should be a coincidence of ability and interests before defi- 
nite choice of vocation is made.

  MEASUREMENT IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 23 
VI. TESTING THE STUDENT’S OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION 
1. Need for information tests. A knowledge about occupations 
in the working world must be obtained before a wise choice can be 
made in any general field of occupations. In order to find out ac- 
curately a person’s accomplishment in the learning of any amount 
or kind of material, it is necessary to have some standard of 
achievement. 
2. Formulating and standardizing tests. The teaching of occu- 
pational information is new. It is only within the last few years 
that classes in occupations have been taught, hence very little has 
been done in the way of forming standardized tests to show 
achievement in the knowledge about occupations. Occupational 
information is analogous in general character to knowledge in the 
field of geography or history. Tests, therefore, must be based on 
an appraisal of minimum essentials, and standardized on the 
basis of accomplishments in the various school grades. There is 
a great need to have people who are interested and who have 
taught and tested pupils’ knowledge about occupations work out 
the fundamental facts or minimum essentials which should be 
known in each field of occupation. Following are a few samples 
of the questions asked in a test being formulated by one of the 
authors: 
1. The worker who installs bathtubs is called 
metal worker, plumber, machinist. 
2. Ability to read blue prints is likely to be required of the 
sheet-metal worker, watchman, surgeon. 
3. Astore or factory is able to pay wages because of the steady flow of 
money from capital stock, interest on investments, sales, 
bank loans. 
4. Which worker in each pair usually has the greater amount of training 
or education? 
(a) draftsman, (b) stenographer, (c) toolmaker, 
architect, typist, lathe hand.   
assembler, sheet- 
  
tailor, 
  
3. Uses for the tests. Tests of the standardized type should be 
given to students for their general instructional value and for the 
improvement of the course of study. The results of the tests are 
valuable indirectly because of the assistance they give the stu- 
dents in the choice of an occupation. However, the chief use of 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
  24 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
the standardized test is to measure the achievement in the pupil’s 
knowledge about occupations.

tions.

VII. Usrt or MEASUREMENTS FOR CHOICE OF OCCUPATION 
1. Two bases of choice. Choice of occupation must stand on two 
legs: self-discovery and occupational information. Hence meas- 
urements described in the two preceding sections are needed in the 
comprehensive process leading up to choice. This section, supple- 
menting those which have gone before, aims to turn the attention 
more directly to measurable factors and probabilities involved in 
one’s choice of job or vocation. 
2. The aim in choice. In advising on the choice of an occupa- 
tion for any specific individual there should always be the aim 
of securing that form of service which is suited to his capacities, 
abilities, interests, and temperament. 
3. Testing possibilities. Various tests are available for use in 
assisting in intelligent choices of occupations, such as tests of 
general or specific aptitudes, test of mechanical skill, and tests of 
trade knowledge and skill. Presumably, high scores in tests for 
the discovery of ability or in tests of knowledge of occupations 
indicate that an individual is fitted for a more intelligent choice 
of occupation, and that there is available for that person a much 
larger range of occupations from which a choice may be made. 
4. Finding the man versus finding the occupation. It is easier to 
find an individual who may have possibilities of success within 
a particular occupation than it is to find an occupation ideally 
suited to a specific individual. It is difficult to get an accurate 
picture of all the qualities of the individual seeking an occupation 
and then find an occupation which by analysis shows a need for 
just such a man. Job analyses and descriptions are essential if 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
    
                            
   
     
                                                                  ‘ 
MEASUREMENT IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 25 
occupational choices are to be satisfactory. At present there are 
satisfactory job analyses and descriptions of many occupations 
available. 
5. Difficulties in the process. The process of guiding the in- 
dividual by means of tests to choose a satisfactory occupation is 
also made difficult by the following facts: (1) there is a lack of 
clearly defined occupational levels of persons found in the various 
occupations; (2) there is a lack of data on the relation between 
occupational success and failure on the one hand and the varying 
amounts of ability as shown by test results on the other; (3) vo- 
cational tests do not measure interest or other such factors which 
influence success or failure in occupations. 
6. Tentative interpretation. Test results should never be taken 
as a definite indication of the prospect of success or failure in cer- 
tain occupations, except as certain very striking abilities or lack 
of ability may be discovered by the tests. All trade test results 
should be interpreted in the light of the amount of training and 
experience the individual has had in that particular trade. 
7. What scores may show. Tests scores should, however, be in- 
terpreted as showing something of the probabilities of success or 
failure in terms of the experiences of other persons in the same 
occupations making the same relative scores in the tests. This is 
possible only when standardized tests of the types mentioned 
above in 3 have been given to large numbers of persons in various 
occupations and the results correlated with degrees of success and 
failure in those occupations. These estimates of the probability 
of success or failure in various occupations will be made with 
greater ease and accuracy after the mental ability of large num- 
bers of children has been studied in relation to the occupational 
choices which they make and the degrees of success or failure 
which they experience in those occupations. 
8. Physical abilities. Tests for vocational choice should be 
supplemented by tests for physical fitness whenever there are 
specifications of physical qualifications necessary for success in the 
particular occupations being considered. 
9. Testing other qualities. Tests of character are in the for- 
mative stage. As they develop in efficiency they may supplant
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
rating schemes for measuring such characteristics as initiative, 
persistence, sociability, patience, etc., which areimportant in oc- 
cupational life. It is obvious that a sociable person is needed for 
an information clerk, and might fail as a night watchman. Tests 
of moral characteristics, as honesty, righteousness, trustworthi- 
ness, and truthfulness, have recently been attempted. In spite of 
obviously great difficulties, progress may be expected. It is clear 
that honesty and general straightness of character are required of 
a clergyman. Character tests would be a great advantage, at the 
present moment, to aid in preventing prospective law violators 
from entering schools of pharmacy and law. 
10. Summary. In aiding an individual in the choice of his vo- 
cation, then, the following measures are possible: 
(a) Tests and rating to discover interests and abilities, as 
described in Section V. 
(0) Tests of occupational information, Section VI.

VIII. MrAsuREMENT AS AN AID IN VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
1. Definite choice should precede vocational education. Effective 
vocational education implies that a definite choice of vocation has 
been made and that the individual is now ready to acquire skills 
and technical knowledge leading to productive employment. As 
has been indicated above, choice must be based on discovery of 
   
-P-A-G-E-37
  
  MEASUREMENT IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE oF 
ability and knowledge of occupations. Preceding sections of this 
study point the way to a definite procedure which if followed 
should help to make the choice a wise one and thus lead the way 
to vocational education. Both the level of occupation chosen, as 
indicated in Section II above, and the character of the vocational 
training itself will be conditioned in part by the general intelli- 
gence of the individual. In spite of wide overlapping, it is mani- 
festly true that the chances of success in any one of several voca- 
tional courses depend upon the level of general intelligence. Thus’ 
a study made by Dr. Ruth S. Clark shows the average intelligence 
quotient of the graduates of several courses as follows: commer- 
cial course, 109.4; technical course, 108.9; industrial arts, 103; 
dressmaking, 97.4. The lower third of the entire group had an 
I.Q. range of from 80 to 95. Most of these individuals will prob- 
ably find greater success and satisfaction as cooks, laundrymen, 
painters, and rough carpenters, dealing with concrete situations, 
objects, animals, and machines. 
2. The use of job analyses as measurements. In order that every 
person, in receiving his appropriate form of vocational education, 
shall have a self-checking course of study, a series of comprehen- 
sive job analyses is necessary. These analyses should give the 
skills, technical knowledge, and social understanding necessary to 
the occupation. They may be used to measure the comprehen- 
siveness of the training itself and to furnish material for setting 
definite tasks as a means of instruction and guidance. 
3. Job sheets used as measures. The specific tasks drawn from 
the job analyses and used for instruction and guidance may best 
be drawn up in the form of the “job sheet.” The job sheet method 
of instruction is of great advantage for individual instruction 
and self-measurement. With the work assigned individually the 
worker should see the result of his efforts and thus be able to 
achieve his goal and have his products judged against standards 
of quality and performance. 
4. The job sheet as a try-out. Vocational schools must protect 
themselves against individuals who may have chosen carelessly. 
A simple job sheet may be used as a try-out to test the ability of 
such persons. Thus a measured performance in the very simplest 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  
  28 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
questions or tasks connected with printing may show that the 
choice has been made without any real consideration of the trade 
or knowledge of its requirements. 
5. Construction of job sheets. ‘The job sheet is usually made up 
of a series of questions and directions, with the various forms in- 
tegrated and progressive in arrangement and based upon informa- 
tion gained through the job analyses. The first job sheet should 
concern itself with the orientation of the student about shop rules 
and general information as to equipment and care of machines. 
Directions as to need for group discussions and conferences with 
the instructor should be given. 
6. Using tests for instructional purposes. The self-checking job 
sheet may be considered as a contract to be agreed to, thus stimu- 
lating and attracting the worker to a high class of performance. 
If built upon previous experiences it can lead the student to new 
knowledge and thus service as a means of instruction. A sample 
of some of the questions in a job sheet useful for instructional pur- ' 
poses is given herewith: 
Jos Sweet No. 1 
The Use of a File» 
Material: A piece of flat material about 2” wide. Put in the vise. Get 
a 12” bastard file from the tool room and lay it across the piece in the 
vise. 
Can you see between the file and the piece in the vise? 
Is the file thicker in the middle than at the ends? 
What is one reason for having the file slightly convex or bellied? 
If the file were not bellied and warped in hardening, would its useful- 
ness be impaired? Peace 
There are 42 such questions on the use of the various kinds of 
files. Instructors have answer books to which the student may 
refer. There is no incentive to copy the answers from the book 
because later tests will punish such a mistake. The entire job 
sheet can itself be used as a written test or a sampling may be 
made of as many questions as time will permit. 
A further list of characteristic job sheets, all integrated and 
carefully graded, should follow.

    MEASUREMENT IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 29 
Recent experience in vocational training in the army has led to 
the use of the job sheets for three kinds of tests: (z) “ instruction 
tests”; (2) “progress tests”; (3) “ability tests.” 
7. Using trade tests for finished ability. The ability test used to 
measure occupational skill and knowledge is usually called the 
trade test. It was developed by the Committee on Classification 
of Personnel in the United States Army during the World War. 
The trade tests for the measurement of proficiency and finished 
ability should be given at the end of several periods of instruction 
in the vocational course. These may be drawn up in four forms: 
the oral test, the written test, the picture test, and the perform- 
ance test. The job analyses and the job sheets will furnish the 
source material from which the test questions should be taken. 
The oral and written tests are not different from the questions 
shown in the sample job sheet above. The picture test may be 
illustrated as follows: (x) Pictures of three chucks are shown. 
Question: ‘What do you call each of these chucks?” (2) A pic- 
ture of a taper attachment is shown. Question: ‘What do you 
call this mechanism?” (3) A picture of several animal shoes is 
shown. Question: ‘Which of these shoes is for a mule?” 
The performance test is an actual test of real ability, such as 
driving a loaded truck through a number of evolutions or forging 
an iron hook out of the raw material, from a blueprint. 
If comprehensive tests are given they may be used to determine 
the trade rating of the individual. Thus a number of tests based 
on questions, pictures, and performances may lead to such a rat- 
ing in the occupation as novice, apprentice, journeyman, or ex- 
pert. 
8. Using tests for the various parts of vocational education. The 
instruction, progress, or ability tests may be used to diagnose the 
needs of the individual and to supplement his training. Thus his 
rating as an apprentice may be due to his lack of knowledge of 
some one thing, as, for example, blueprint reading. The'carpenter, 
nurse, typist, stenographer, general clerk, dietitian, or any other 
person, provided the necessary job sheets can be constructed, 
may be tested, and then instructed in the specific items needed to 
make up or complete his vocational education. This method is
-P-A-G-E-40
    30 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
valid whether occupational skill, technical knowledge, or social 
understanding is concerned, and whether the occupation is a 
trade in the strict sense or an agricultural, commercial, or pro- 
fessional occupation. Furthermore, the job sheet method, as has 
been shown in the Dalton Plan, may be used for other forms of 
education besides vocational. 
Let us take for an example the job sheets for a dietitian. These 
sheets with the reference material may develop the individual 
ability to recognize various vegetables with their food content 
and value, and may develop skills or technical knowledge in the 
preparation of vegetables, the various cuts of meat, kinds of meat 
and dietetic value, table and tray decoration and setting, the use 
of fuels, characteristic diets needed for various purposes. The 
job sheets for a general clerk may take the individual through a 
series of practice tests having to do with filing systems, billing of 
goods, filling out blanks, computations, copying addresses, and 
writing letters. 
9. Results to be obtained. Through job analyses and self-check- 
ing tests for instruction, progress, and finished ability, the process 
of vocational education may be well rounded out and completed. 
If the individual is receiving his vocational education on the co- 
operative plan, his skél/s will usually be learned on the job and his 
technical knowledge and social understanding will be taught in the 
school. Whenever tests of finished ability show that the occupa- 
tional requirements as shown by the job analysis are completely 
satisfied, the individual will be ready to proceed to the next step 
— securing a full-time position.

IX. TEsts IN SECURING Work, Hirinc, AND PLACEMENT 
1. Use of preceding tests. The workers who are in need of place- 
ment will vary all the way from those who have been tested as 
indicated in the preceding sections to those who have had no tests 
of any kind. Those who have been tested for all of the first four 
steps (self-discovery, knowledge about occupations, choice, and 
vocational preparation) will need no more tests if the previous 
records are available. If the records are not available, or if the 
testing work was incomplete, probably a few tests, at the time of 
placement, will be helpful as a means of measuring the results of 
the previous education and experiences. 
Those who have had few tests or none should be tested with the 
four steps in mind. Tests of try-out experiences, knowledge about 
occupations, general intelligence, interests, temperament, and 
aptitudes will be useful in almost all cases. Trade tests, or other 
tests of actual vocational ability, should be used where practi- 
cable, especially in hiring workers. Of course, the results of the 
tests should be used as measuring probable rather than absolute 
ability. 
2. Measurement of the job. In all cases knowledge of the job is 
as essential as knowledge of the people about to be placed. There- 
fore job analyses of the available positions should be obtained 
whenever possible. 
3. Other criterions. As the tests of temperament and interests 
are not so reliable as the intelligence tests, they should be supple- 
mented by a knowledge of mental hygiene. This knowledge is 
needed by the counselor in steps, three, five, and six especially, 
where choice, placement, and readjustment take place, in order 
to guide people away from occupations for which they are tem- 
peramentally unsuited. An example of this would be showing a 
very talkative, sociable boy that he would probably not be so 
happy in an occupation where he would be solitary as in one 
where he would have contacts with other people. 
4. The aim in placement. The main purpose of tests in place- 
ment is to obtain as nearly objective, scientific information as 
possible about the individuals seeking work, in order to advise  
-P-A-G-E-42
32 MENTAL MEASUREMENT | 
them intelligently, and in order to give more definite information 
to employers. Another way in which tests may be useful is in 
assuring a self-depreciating individual, when he has the necessary 
qualification and can succeed, and thus stimulating him to greater 
effort.

X. Tests In READJUSTMENT, PROGRESS, AND PROMOTION 
1. Need for progressive readjustment. When the worker has se- 
cured an apparently satisfactory position, the work of the coun- 
selor is by no means completed. Sooner or later the problem of 
readjustment is sure to present itself, involving a repetition of 
some or all of the steps previously considered — self-discovery, 
try-out, choice, vocational education, and placement. 
2. Testing subsequent to experience. Frequently, after a person 
has engaged in actual work in a given position, readjustment is 
necessary if the worker is to render the best service. Specific abili- 
ties or disabilities, not brought out by the tests, become known 
under actual working conditions. Fresh counsel must be given, 
based upon a reconsideration of previously known facts in the 
light of newly acquired information. Ifa careful quantitative ap- 
praisal of success in the present job reveals the necessity of radical 
readjustment, the worker may need to be tested for his aptitudes 
and qualifications for an entirely different kind of work. 
3. Tests for promotion. When a person has worked long enough 
in a certain position to get some idea as to its possibilities, and his 
own fitness for it, he is often ambitious to get ahead, either by 
progressing to more demanding work of a similar kind, or by being 
promoted to some position requiring other new skills and abili- 
ties in addition to those needed in the present work. Here time 
and expense may be saved by the use of tests designed to show the 
probability of success in the desired job. Another physical test- 
ing and a rerating of character qualifications, as well as specific 
trade tests, may be desirable. 
   
-P-A-G-E-43
  MEASUREMENT IN VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 33 
4. Need for follow-up. In all steps of vocational guidance, in- 
cluding placement, the counselor will need to supervise the learn- 
ing and experience of the individual. It becomes especially im- 
portant that the young worker, who usually leaves the supervision 
of the school, should be followed up into the environment of his 
occupational experience. Thus the counselor may know whether 
the advice given has lead to success or failure and whether any 
adjustments are needed. In sucha program of follow-up work the 
use of tests and rating will be of increasing assistance and value. 
A rechecking of certain points, such as aptitude, knowledge of 
occupation, or level of general intelligence, will furnish a known 
basis, in the light of recent experiences on the job, to advise the 
young worker.

PART IV 
IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATIONAL AND 
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
1. It has been frequently remarked that testing and other 
forms of measurement were in the research stage and could not 
be successfully used for the guidance of the individual. This study 
was undertaken for the specific purpose of making a survey of 
progress thus far. It has indicated, as repeatedly shown in the 
preceding pages, that actual accomplishment in individual guid- 
ance has resulted from the testing movement. 
2. It is quite true, however, that all testing work is tentative 
and that a constant rechecking of our methods is required; con- 
sequently every item mentioned throughout this study may be 
made the basis of further research. 
3. It is especially important that research effort should not be 
confined to laboratory workers. Industry managers, employ- 
ment managers, time-keepers, visiting teachers, plant physicians, 
classroom teachers, supervisors, deans of men and women, voca- 
tional counselors, and all others engaged in the educational and 
vocational guidance of the youth, must coérdinate their efforts 
for the purpose of continued research in testing and measurement. 
4. The smallest of rewards for such testing and measurement 
will be happy and efficient workers whose tasks are well adapted 
to their needs and whose service is beneficial to themselves as in- 
dividuals and to their fellows. Great as this smaller reward may 
be, it is of less importance than will be a more harmonious co- 
operation throughout occupational life which should result from 
more effective work in educational and vocational guidance.

the chapter, “Who Will Succeed in School?” the data given show clearly 
that the exceptions to the rule of probability are so numerous that there 
is little certainty so far as any individual child is concerned. The last

tests in non-technical language, and gives a critical survey of the various 
processes of measurements. Problems arising from the use of these tests 
are discussed and their attempted solutions given. Several chapters deal 
with statistical methods. An extended bibliography follows each chapter. 
The classification of pupils by means of tests is strongly favored by the 
author and is briefly discussed in a chapter devoted to school achievement 
tests. The use of tests in determining vocational fitness is also taken up 
very briefly. Dr. Gregory’s book is, upon the whole, a valuable contribu-

tests to industrial problems. Methods as well as results are described. 
The book is valuable for people interested in the use of tests in vocational 
guidance or in business and industry. 
McCatt, W. A. How to Measure in Education. The Macmillan Co., 1923. 
The author aims to give in one volume a reasonably comprehensive dis- 
cussion of measurement in education, the need of tests, their construction, 
use, and statistical interpretation. Part I is a detailed account of the use 
of measurement in classifying pupils, discovering individual differences, 
evaluating teaching efficiency, and giving vocational counsel. Part IT 
deals with the preparation, standardization, and scaling of tests, while 
Part III gives the tabular, graphic, and statistical methods of interpreting 
the results of such tests. Bibliography.

NATIONAL Society FOR THE Stupy oF Epucation. Twenty-first Yearbook, 
Public School Publishing Co., Bloomington, Illinois, 1922. The book 
aims to give a clear and accurate explanation of the “theory, nature, and 
practical use of intelligence tests.” Part I discusses general intelligence, 
showing how this may be measured by standardized tests, and how the 
results of such tests may be interpreted. Part II gives detailed accounts 
of the administrative uses of intelligence tests, from the first grade to the 
university. Part I, the discussion by experts of the need and use of such 
tests, is most clear. The accounts in Part II, by workers in the field, are 
valuable suggestions both to classroom teachers and to those grappling 
with administrative problems. Bibliography.

“ability” and of “achievement.” It discusses how to use tests, represen- 
tative subject tests, tests of general intelligence, and the administration 
of a testing program in a school system. Four appendices include a glos- 
sary of terms used in testing. The authors have produced a simple, read- 
able, clearly expressed text with each chapter topically arranged and 
summarized. Bibliography. 
Procror, Wi111AM M. The Use of Psychological Tests in Vocational Guid- 
ance. National Vocational Guidance Association Bulletin, Vol. I, No. 9, 
April, 1923, pp. 147-154. Professor Proctor reports here his plan for ad- 
mitting certain Veterans’ Bureau men into Stanford University on the 
basis of “general intelligence” scores. Some of these men had no high- 
school education whatever, and nevertheless made good in regular uni- 
versity work, standing well above the average of the regular students. 
This is an excellent example of the proper use of tests: to increase edu- 
cational opportunity.

  GENERAL BIBLIOGRAPHY 43 
I, No. 7, July, 1923, pp. 277-282. An analysis of the psychological fac- 
tors determining efficiency of dressmakers’ apprentices, and an attempt 
to devise a series of tests in speed, quality, ability to follow directions, 
and observation, all based more or less directly on actual tasks related to 
dressmaking. Many such attempts in home economics have been made, 
and several have been reported in various issues of the Journal of Home 
Economics. 
STENQuIsT, J. L. The Case for the Low I.Q. Journal of Educational Re- 
search, 4: 241-254. November, 1921. States the need for measurement 
to discover mechanical abilities as well as intellectual. Suggests a means 
for charting test results for aid in discovery of an individual’s abilities. 
—— Measurements of Mechanical Ability. Teachers College, Columbia 
University, Contributed to Education No. 130. One great contribution 
of this author is the devising of simple mechanical tests which measure 
ability to assemble common articles and thus indicate aptitude for indus- 
trial occupations. He presents a strong argument for supplementing the 
so-called “general intelligence” tests with tests of manual dexterity. His 
results indicate that a large minority of children who may not be able to 
score high on a verbal test nevertheless can do well with simpler industrial 
processes. 
Tacc, Max. The “Make-Up” of the Engineering Worker. The Journal 
of the National Institute of Industrial Psychology, Vol. I, No. 8, October, 
1923. Mr. Tagg has outlined the personality required for industrial work- 
ers under four heads: general intelligence, specific abilities, temperament, 
and physical characteristics. Under intelligence he has divided the work- 
ers into five grades and has estimated the grade of intelligence required 
for drafting, pattern shop, forge, metal smiths, cost accounting, tool work, 
foundry, machine shop, and assemblers and erectors. Very suggestive, 
also, is the treatment of temperamental factors. 
TerMaN, Lewis M. The Intelligence of School Children. Houghton Mifflin 
Co., 1919. The wide extent to which school children differ in their mental 
ability, and the problems thereby presented to the schools, led the author 
to produce this book in the particular interest of the education of excep- 
tional children. Several investigations of individual differences at various 
grades are described together with the question of mental tests for the 
feeble-minded. Facts and case studies of certain superior children are 
presented as evidence of their need for special training. In one chapter on 
Intelligence Tests in Vocational and Educational Guidance, Terman de- 
scribes their value and illustrates it with the account of the testing of 
seven different vocational groups and comparisons of their I.Q.’s. 
—— The Measurement of Intelligence. Houghton Mifflin Co., 1916. In 
this book Professor Terman deals with the importance of measuring the 
intelligence, and describes fully the Stanford Revision of the Binet Tests. 
He discusses the technique of administration and gives detailed directions 
with each test. Too well known to require general comment, and offering 
little that bears on guidance, he makes two significant statements that he 
  
-P-A-G-E-54
    44 MENTAL MEASUREMENT 
believes “the time is not far distant when intelligence tests will become a 
recognized and widely-used instrument for determining vocational fit- 
ness” and that ultimately it will be possible to “determine the minimum 
intelligence quotient necessary to success in any occupations.” Bibliog- 
raphy. 
TERMAN, Lewis M., Dickson, V. E., SUTHERLAND, A. H., FRANZEN, R. H., 
Tupper, C. R., and FERNALD, G. Intelligence Tests and School Reor- 
ganization. World Book Co., 1922. This book shows ways of using the 
results of intelligence tests. A few experiments, typical of the leading 
methods now being attempted in different parts of the country, are de- 
scribed. The types of procedure vary all the way from the use of tests as 
affecting the entire school enrollment and the administrative system to 
their use in regard to individual cases of readjustment and pedagogical 
methods. Introductory statements by Terman at the beginning of the 
book and before each chapter unify the whole. This book offers many 
valuable suggestions for administrators or psychologists interested in the 
use of tests in schools.

trade. 
—— The Technique of Vocational Guidance as Investigated by the Institute 
of Educational Research. National Vocational Guidance Association 
Bulletin, Vol. I, No. 6, January, 1923, pp. 86-93. The author attempts to 
draw up a composite picture of the present standing of each individual, 
based upon such characteristics as height, weight, advancement in school, 
arithmetic and reading, conduct, regularity, etc., and such aptitude tests 
as clerical tests and assembly tests. Out of such a composite the coun- 
selor draws up a profile and makes recommendation. The plan is very 
similar to that used extensively by Dr. Richard D. Allen, at Providence, 
and is suggestive and helpful, particularly where there is little opportu- 
nity for knowing individual children intimately. 
—— Tests for Vocational Guidance of Children Thirteen to Sixteen. Teach- 
ers College, Columbia University, Contributions to Education, No. 136. 
The author devised a large number of measures out of which to advise 
boys and girls about their future careers. His categories are: ability with 
ideas and symbols, ability with things and mechanisms, ability with 
clerical items and procedures. The scores are based on questions and

true-false statements, the assumption being that a child with a leaning in 
the direction of one occupation rather than another ought to have picked 
up, out of his environmental experience, the information necessary to 
score high in the questions. A large number of questions as a suggestion 
for further research is given. Bibliography.

1919. This book explains in detail the system used in the United States 
Army during the World War by the Committee on Classification of Per- 
sonnel. Volume I relates the entire history of the project, and Volume 
IL is the personnel manual. These books are of priceless importance as a 
history of the great stimulus which the testing movement received on ac- 
count of the war; they are also full of suggestions for the progress and 
application of testing to all phases of educational and vocational guid- 
ance.

VOEKLER, PAUL FREDERICK. The Function of Ideals and Attitudes in Social 
Education. Teachers College, Columbia University, Contributions to 
Education, No. 112. This book aims to indicate a method by which the 
objectives of social education may be analyzed, achieved, and evaluated. 
The author worked out ten tests of ethical qualities which were supposed 
to indicate and measure such manifestations of character as fairness of 
statement, perseverance, independence, returning borrowed property, 
honesty in money matters and returning lost articles, ability to follow 
directions, refusal to cheat, etc. He gives an interesting argument for in- 
struction and guidance in matters of ethical behavior.

Woop, BEN D. Measurements in Higher Education. World Book Co., 
1923. This book sets forth a new type of examination in college studies. 
It describes in detail how the experiment was inaugurated, furnishes a 
critical description, analysis; and validation of the examination, lays 
down appropriate general principles for measurement in college studies, 
and describes in detail, with samples, the examinations in a number of 
subjects. The appendix contains suggestions for improvements. The 
plan has as its chief value the comprehensiveness of the new form of ex- 
amination, its relative objectivity, and consequently, its fairness to the 
student. Perhaps the only reservation possible is the necessary emphasis 
in such a form of examination on knowledge as knowledge, and the rela- 
tive lack of emphasis on constructive thinking, critical analysis, and 
judgment. Bibliography.

INTRODUCTION 
The history of English secondary education in the sixteenth 
century reveals two inovements, one of destruction, the other 
of reconstruction. The former movement reached its climax 
in the destruction of the monasteries,’ guilds, and chantties,? 
since with these there perished a very large number of the 
insti utions of English secondary education. But before this 
clim..x had been reached, the latter movement had exhibited 
itseli in the foundation of such schools as St. Paul’s* and the 
City Grammar School of Bristol. While the former movement 
was spending itself, the latter continued to grow. Close upon 
the destruction of the monasteries and their schools followed 
the refoundation of the cathedrals and the cathedral schools by 
Henry VIII.,° while simultaneously with the destruction of the 
guild and chantry schools occurred the foundation of increasing 
numbers of independent schools.* 
It is with these independent schools as they existed in the 
teign of Elizabeth that the present study is concerned, since it 
is hoped that through the study of the facts concerning their 
foundation and support, their government, their teaching staff, 
their curricula, and the school life of their pupils there may 
result not only a description of the schools as they existed at 
that period,’ but also the discovery of at least some of the chief 
characteristics of the education and educational institutions 
of this reconstructive movement in the English secondary 
education of the Elizabethan period. 
*The lesser monasteries were suppressed in 1536; the greater abbeys in 1539. As to the importance of the education furnished by the mon- asteries at this time, there is considerable difference of opinion. Leach, English Schools at the Reformation, p. 19, is inclined to rate the educational influence of the monasteries very low, while Brown in his Study of the English Grammar Schools before ihe Reformation believes that Leach has underestimated their influence.

CHAPTER I 
FOUNDATION AND SUPPORT 
The subject of the present chapter will be considered from 
the following points of view: (1) number of schools founded 
during the reign of Queen Elizabeth; (2) types of foundation 
(a) with respect to founder and (b) with respect to character of 
endowment; (3) motives of founders; (4) relation of schools 
to charity. 
Tue PRoBLEM OF THE NUMBER OF ScHOOoLsS FouNDED 
(1558-1603) 
The impossibility of obtaining the necessary data makes the 
solution of this problem not only difficult but very probably 
impossible. Leach has shown how hopeless is the inquiry into 
the number of schools founded in the reign of Edward VI. 
In dealing with each case one is never quite sure whether it is 
one of foundation or refoundation,—whether or not a school 
existed in the place previous to the date under consideration. 
The number of letters patent granted to schools cannot be 
‘taken as representing the number of schools founded, since 
they were issued in not a few cases in favor of schools already 
in existence or of schools to take the places of those destroyed 
with the monasteries, guilds, or chantries.? Notwithstanding 
the difficulties various attempts have been made to estimate 
the number of schools founded during the reign of Elizabeth. 
M. Jacques Parmentier® is quoted by Leach‘ as crediting this 
reign with the foundation of 150 grammar schools; de Mont- 
morency gives the number as 148 schools founded and 34 addi-   
1 English Schools at the Reformation, 2-7. He calls attention to the 
very divergent results of attempts to fix any definite number Thus 
Strype gives the number as 22, Green as 18, Mr. J. Bass Mullinger as 33, 
and M. Jacques Parmentier as 44, and others as 51 and 82. 
? Vide Blackburn, Faversham, Grantham, Old Maldon, and other 
similar cases quoted in Appendix A. i

tionally endowed,* while Adams* places the number at 137, 
the number given in the Report of the Schools Inquiry Com- 
mission.’ This latter cannot be taken as representing the 
number of places in which schools first came into existence in 
this reign, since the data collected in Appendix A shows that 
in 33 of these cases schools existed previous to 1558.* An 
estimate based upon the authorities quoted in Appendix A 
would place the number at about 78, but even such a moderate 
estimate would not be free from the objections raised above. 
Considering the material contained in Appendix A from another 
point of view, there are 135 schools concerning which our 
information dates back only as far as the reign of Elizabeth.* 
Considering the material from still another point of view, it will 
be noted that there are 78 cases of ‘‘foundation’’, 32 of letters 
patent granted in favor of schools, 12 of letters patent granted 
to schools already in existence, 6 of letters patent confirming 
and enlarging previous charters, and two known cases of refoun- 
dation. While these figures are of little value in the solution 
of the problem before us, they do have positive value in that

‘The list contains the following places: Hartlebury, Bangor, Bristol, 
Godmanchester, High Wycombe, Darlington, Netherbury, Thetford, 
Keswick or Crosthwaite Burford, Coventry, Eye, Bedford, Faversham, 
Colchester, Topcliffe, Halsall (not included in App.), Stainmore, Well- 
ingborough, Bedale, Bodmin, Fotheringay, Leyland, Nantwich, Penryn, 
Ashburton, Biddenden, Bromyard, Cheltenham, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 
St. Albans, Wakefield, Normanton. Since the list given in the Report 
includes three schools in Wales, Presteign, Caemarthen, and Ruthin, 
which are not included in the scope of our inquiry, the balance left is, 
therefore,1or. 
° The list of these schools would include the 101 cases given by the 
Schools Inquiry Commission (cf. supra footnote 8), 5 cases of “foundation” 
(Aylesbury, East Adderbury, Gravesend, Nort*leach, Rothwell), given in 
Appendix A, and 29 cases of schools concerning which information dates 
back only to the reign of Elizabeth (Barnestaple, Berwick-upon-Tweed 
(three schools), Cambridge, Chipping Norton, Coleshill, Gillingham, 
Godmanchester, Greenwich, Hadleigh, Hoddesdon, Ilkley, Lavenham, 
Lichfield, Little Walsingham, Maldon, Market Bosworth, Martley, 
Norfolk, Ratcliffe Risley, Rochester, Saffron Walden, Saint Giles, Scar- 
brough, Stow-on-the-Wold, Wethersfield, Wigan) also contained in 
Appendix A.

English Grammar Schools in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. 11 
they indicate very clearly a genuine interest in secondary 
education, an interest which showed itself in the foundation 
and improvement of the institutions of that education. 
Somewhat related to the problems just discussed is that of 
the number of schools of which there is record during the period 
under study. Lee!® emphatically asserts that the number of 
schools at this time was less than 200. That he underestimated 
the number is conclusively shown by the material contained 
in Appendix A which includes 281 schools concerning which 
our information dates back to this reign, 51 schools concerning 
which data are lacking for the exact years under study but are 
given for those closely preceding or following, 9 schools whose 
existence between 1558-1603 is more doubtful, and 2 schools 
founded in the reign of Elizabeth but actually begun later." 
These figures’? indicate that by the close of the reign of Elizabeth 
the number of schools at the time of the Reformation had been 
equaled if not surpassed.!* Thus in the rapid growth of the 
grammar schools of this period is to be seen the expression of the 
interest in secondary education. 
Types oF FounpDATION 
As the interest in secondary education thus expressed in the 
foundation and improvement of grammar schools was manifested 
by the Crown, guilds, cities, parishes, and private individuals, 
the types of foundation considered from the point of view of 
the founders may be classified as Royal, Guild, City or Corpora- 
tion, Parish, and Private Foundations. 
Royal Foundations—While the Queen may or may not have 
actually founded the twenty-five schools with which Adams

quotation from Harrison’s Description of England, Bk. II. Chapt. iii, 
Po 8go) ices ane so there are not manie corporat townes now under 
the queenes dominion, that hain not one grammar school at the least,” 
since he gives the number of cities as 26 (p. 244) and the number of 
market towns as from 300 to 400 (p. 259). 
"8 Leach, English Schools at the Reformation, 6, gives the known number 
of schools as 200, and estimates the probable number at 300.

credits her,* yet she was directly or indirectly concerned with 
a large enough number of foundations and improvements to make 
certain the interest of the Crown in secondary education. This 
interest, however, was not always spontaneous, since in some 
cases it had to be awakened by petitions addressed to the Queen 
by those interested in the particular projects for schools. Thus 
in Faversham the inhabitants, after an unsuccessful attempt to 
have their school refounded in the reign of Henry VIII., suc- 
cessfully petitioned the Queen when, in 1576, she spent two nights 
in the town.'* Nor was the foundation of a school always the 
primary matter in the letters patent. Thus in the case of 
Bridgwater the great and small tithes of the parish were granted 
to certain persons for a long term of years subject to a number 
-of conditions among which was the payment of a charge of 
£6 13s. 4d. per annum for the support of a schoolmaster.'* Nor 
was the Royal foundation always a strictly new grant; sometimes 
itwas but a transfer of grants. Thus in the case of Salisbury the 
school was founded by discontinuing schools at Bradford and Trow- 
bridge and transferring their annuities to the new foundation.’ 
‘* Adams, History of the Elementary School Contest in England, 18. 
His figures are from the S. I. C., i, Appendix, 48-57. The data contained 
in Appendix A would throw suspicion on four of the cases given in the 
Report, High Wycombe, Darlington, Chipping Barnet, and Ashborne, 
while a fifth case is one of a Welsh school, Caemarthen. 
8 Carlisle, i, 574; also Edward Jacob, The History of Faversham in 
the County of Kent, 54. The school was to replace the one suppressed 
with the Abbey soon after 1527. Cf. cases of Halifax, Mansfield, Ash- 
borne, Kingston-upon-Thames and others given in Appendix A. 
18 Letters Patent, 1561. C. C. R. xv., 424. 
“Letters Patent, 1569, C. C. R. xxvi., 366. The Royal annuity at 
Bradford had been £10 12s. 7d. and at Trowbridge, £15 9s. 1d. These 
schools were discontinued on the grounds that there was no need of 
schools in these places since they were ‘upland towns of but few people, 
not a resort of gentlemen or merchants.’’ The money thus obtained was 
to be used to pay the salaries of the master and usher at Salisbury, 
while the Corporation was to furnish house and rooms. Another consoli- 
dation of funds occurred in the case of Pontefract (decree of the Duchy 
Court of Lancaster, 1583, C. C. R. xxxii., pt. 2., 811) where the royal 
annuities of four towns not above eight miles distance from Pontefract 
(Carlton, £5 4s.; Crofton, £4 3s. 11d.; Bolton-upon-Derne, £4 135. 4d.; 
Royston, £4 6s. 11d.) were combined with that of Pontefract 59s. 7d. for 
payment of the salaries of the master and usher at Pontefract, and the 
schools continued by commissioners in those towns were discontinued 
on account of the smallness of salary.

Guild Foundation.—The chief and only guild foundation 
mentioned in our material is that of the Merchant Taylors 
School founded by the Merchant Taylors Corporation. There 
were other Guild schools'® but these were founded by private 
individuals, who, however, were usually members of the guild 
to which they deeded their schools.?° 
City Foundations and Endowments.—The cities in their 
corporate capacity were interested in the founding and im- 
provement of the grammar schools. According to an inden- 
ture between the Queen and the Mayor and Comburgesses of 
Leicester”! the Corporation was to pay to Her Majesties Receiver 
of the Duchy of Lancaster £35 for all the lead, stones, and 
timber in and about the decayed church of St. Peter which 
they were to use in the construction of a school house which 
was to be completed within a year after the execution of the 
deed; the Corporation was also bound to repair the school 
house when in need thereof.?? The Corporation of Richmond 
appropriated lands for the support of their school. On July 
18, 1562, the Mayor, Bailiffs and Burgesses of Wycombe deeded 
to the Queen a hospital and land belonging to it together with 
the ‘‘Lady Rents” which had belonged to the Fraternity of the 
Blessed Mary in order that Elizabeth might by letters patent 
regrant to the Corporation the said hospital, lands, and rents, 
on condition that the revenues of the same should be applied 
towards the support and maintenance of a school and four 
poor persons.** Concerning the foundation of the school at 
Sandwich we have the following account in the words of the 
Records of the Corporation:

and feare of God, and that God therefor wold blesse the towen 
the better; and required therefore, that euery inhabitant within 
this towen wold consyder so good an acte and to knowe what 
euery man wold willengly give thereto; and that he and his 
brethern as they did judge that a very godly work so thei wold 
lardgely give of their porcions that the same might be stablished; 
which said mocion liked well all men. And so with one consent 
they offeryd to giue euery man for the same worke according 
to their abillytye as followythe, viz.’’ Ten Jurats subscribed 
amounts varying from £6 13s. 4d. to £20; 34 in the Common 
Council gave subscriptions varying from £10 to £12; these 
sums together with the contributions from the wards amounted 
to a total of £286 7s. 2d. 
Parish Foundations.—Most of the schools recorded in Appendix 
A as having been founded by subscription were probably founded 
by parishes as was the case in St. Savior where the grammar 
school was erected by the parishioners before 1562 when they 
applied for a charter.” 
Private Foundation—The case of Sandwich quoted above 
is interesténg in that it shows how private individuals united 
with corporations in the founding of schools.” The subscription 
mentioned was raised for the purpose of building a school 
house under promise of Mr. Roger Manwood to endow the 
school with lands the revenues of which would be sufficient 
to maintain the school and pay the salary of the master. But 
persons of greater note than Manwood became interested in 
the foundation of this school. Archbishop Parker, who hap- 
pened to be in the neighborhood at the time, became interested 
in the project and showed his interest by applying to the Dean 
and Chapter of Canterbury for a grant of a piece of land, which 
belonged to their church, for the site of the school, and by 
writing to his friend Cecil, who was then Secretary, to use his 
influence in procuring from the Queen her license for the endow- 
ment and foundation of the school.** The license to erect a

71 A similar case of co-operation occurred at Northleach where the 
founder provided in his will ‘‘that the said town of Northleach shall 
prepare a house convenient for the schoolhouse and schollmaster meet 
and necessarie for that purpose or else the school shall not be then.’’

free school in Sandwich was granted to Manwood who is re- 
garded as the founder of the school.** 
Included in the list of private founders and benefactors of 
the grammar schools of this period are the names of men in a 
large number of the trades and professions of the middle and 
upper classes.2* Yeomen*® and gentlemen,*! schoolmasters*? 
and guild members, nobility* and clergy* from vicar to arch- 
bishor,, all, women* as well as men, showed a practical interest 
in secondary education by assisting in the foundation and 
improvement of its institutions. Indeed, when compared with 
the two reigns preceding the one under study, it will be noted 
that percentage of royal foundations is lower and that of private 
foundations much higher.

the school in St. Savior was to 
School of the Parishioners of t ‘as called after that company; 
e known as ‘‘The Free Grammar

in Market Bosworth, ‘‘The School of Wolston Dixie, Knight, 
in Market Bosworth in the County of Leicester,’’** that in 
Hawkeshead, ‘‘The Free Grammar Schole of Edwyn Sands. 
Archbishope of Yorke in Hawkeshead,’’*! and that in St. Bees, 
‘The Free Grammar School of Edmund Grindall, Archbishop 
of Canterbury.’’ One cannot, however, safely infer from 
the name of the school that of the founder, for the schools at 
Ashborne* and Chipping Barnet‘ were named after the Queen 
though there is reason to believe they were not founded by her;** 
the school at Alford was to be called, ‘‘The Free Grammar School 
of Queen Elizabeth,’’ although she contributed nothing;‘* the 
school at Cranbrook was commonly called, ‘‘Queen Elizabeth’s 
Free and Perpetual Grammar School, ” although it was founded 
by Simon Lynch;* while on the other hand the school at Rich- 
mond founded by Elizabeth was to be known by the name of 
its governors, as the ‘‘Free Grammar School of the Burgesses 
of the borough or town of Richmond.’’# 
The power to make and change the statutes of the school 
was not infrequently given to the founder. Thus in the

cases of Sandwich,*® Hawkeshead,** St. Bees,‘ Kirby Stephen," 
and Witton® the founders possessed and exercised this important 
power. 
A power not less important than the one just noted was that 
of appointment of the teaching staff,5* a power which was often 
given to the founder and not infrequently extended to his 
heirs. Thus, in Kirby Stephen,** Hawkeshead,** Highgate,* 
and St. Bees the power to appoint the master was given or 
assumed by the founder, while in Felsted,’* Guisbrough,*® 
Daventry," Marlborough,*? Nantwich,** and Redgrave,“ the 
privilege was extended to the heirs of the founder. Related 
to this power was that of appointment of the governors of the 
school, a privilege assumed by the founder of the school at 
Guisborough."® In two other cases the heirs of the founder 
were to take part in the government of the school,—in Witton" 
they were to be ‘preferred as governors,’ while in Thetford” 
they were given the government and management of the 
school. f 
There are also several cases of privileges granted to the kins- 
folk or heirs of the founder. Thus, in Witton the kinsfolk of 
the founder were to bejtaught freely and were, if fit, to be pre-

Types or Founpations, Sources oF Support 
It is very probable that the majority of the schools of the 
period under study were supported either by annuities or by 
incomes from estates with which they were endowed.” The 
annual value of the annuities ranged from £3 4s. 11d. to £38 
135. 4d.,”? while that of income from estates varied from £10 to 
445 7s. 6d.* There seems to be no correlation between either 
of these chief sources of support and either royal or private 
foundation, although it appears that the Crown favored the 
granting of annuities while a large number of private individuals 
left estates to the schools. The annuities granted by the Crown 
were paid from the royal revenues, while those left by individuals 
were paid from the income of estates held in trust. From the 
standpoint of the schools there is no doubt as to which was the 
better source of income, the annuity or the rent charge. History 
has proved that the latter is by far superior to the former, for 
while annuities of sufficient amount to maintain the schools 
in the 16th century have, by reason of the depreciation in the 
value of money, become insufficient and thereby caused the 
schools either to cease their existence or degenerate into ele- 
mentary schools, lands, which then yielded an income just 
sufficient to maintain a master, increased in value until now 
some of the grammar schools of England are more wealthy than 
many of our American colleges.”* The importance of investing

the funds of the school in land appears to have been recognized 
at that time. Thus, Archbishop Grindal left £500 to St. Bees 
with which to purchase land of the annual value of £30;7 in 
Newcastle under Lyme £100 were left to purchase land,” while 
in Atherstone’® and Tarvin’® £200 were given to each of the 
schools for the same purpose; while in 1589 Blackburn pur- 
chased a rent charge of £20 per annum with sums received in 
endowments and by subscription.** 
A few schools derived their support from money put out at 
interest. Thus, one of the benefactors of the school at Alford 
left to the school 4-5 of the annual interest of £50;* in Ashton- 
in-Makerfield the school received by indenture the interest of 
£60;" while in Daresbury £160 were contributed by Richard 
Rider and others ‘‘to be let out to respectable inhabitants.” ® 
Other schools were supported by city corporations as in the 
cases of Doncaster and Great Yarmouth,** while a few schools 
were partly supported by tuition and other fees.* 
Not uninteresting is the source of support in the cases of 
Manchester and St. Albans. In the former the school was 
supported by the proceeds from mills at which the inhabitants 
were compelled to grind their corn, while in the latter the 
support of the school was provided for in the “Wine Charter” 
1583, Carlisle, i, 162. The figures given in this case together with 
those given in the case of Kirkby Lonsdale (Appendix C, footnote 3)

Motives oF FouNnDERS 
We have thus far noted (a) the existence of a widespread 
interest in secondary education during the reign of Elizabeth, 
(b) the classes of organizations and persons thus interested, 
and (c) the ways in which that interest was expressed. There 
remains to be discussed one other aspect of this interest, viz. 
its dynamic phase as exhibited in the motives which inspired 
the foundation and endowment of the grammar schools. The 
following statements of motives are typical: 
(1) The schools at Uppingham and Oakham are reported 
by Camden as having been erected for ‘‘the training up of chil- 
dren-in good literature.’’ °° 
‘‘The Jurye doth presente yt whereas Duyze (diverse) orders hereto- 
fore made to thend the Inhabitants of the towne shoulde grynde y (their)

(2) The petition of Kirby Lonsdale is based upon the desire 
to furnish an ‘‘education to the boys and youth living and abid- 
ing in the town and neighborhood.’’* 
(3) ‘The promotion of good learning and education” is given 
as the motive in the case of Hexham.” 
(4) The school at Burford was founded in order ‘‘to keep the 
youth from spending their time idly and to teach them their 
duty." 
(5) The school at Highgate was founded ‘‘for the education 
of poor hoys.’’* 
(6) ‘Lhe object of the trust in the case of Ashby-de-la-Zouch 
was ‘‘the instruction of youths, infants, and little ones, in good 
manners, learning, knowledge and virtue.’’ ** 
(7) The school at Halifax was founded ‘‘for the continual 
bringing up, teaching, and learning of children and youth.’’* 
(8) Archbishop Parker founded the school at Rochdale in 
order that the youth of the parish might ‘“‘be brought up in the 
learning of true piety and the Latin tongue.” 
(9) The motive of the founder of the school at Witton was 
“*to increase knowledge and worshipping of God and our lord 
Jesus Christ and good Christian life and manners in children.’’* 
It is stated in greater detail in the following excerpt from the 
preamble of his statutes for the school: ‘‘Forasmuch as God’s 
glory, his honor, and the wealth public, is advanced and main- 
tained by no means more than by virtuous education and bring- 
ing up of Youth under such as be learned and virtuous School- 
masters, whose good examples may as well instruct them to 
live well as their doctrine and learning may furnish their minds 
with knowledge and cunning, (I) have thought it good, not 
only to erect the said Free Grammar School, and to provide 
a reasonable and competent Stypend for the Schoolmaster of 
the same, and that in respect of the zeal that I have to God’s 
glory, and for the love that I bear to my native country.’’**

(10) In 1571 the school at Seven Oaks received from one of 
its benefactors a tenement towards the ‘‘meyntenance of God’s 
glory and the erudition and bringing up of the Pore Scollers of 
Sevenoke in virtuous discipline, godly learninge, and good and 
civill manners.’’!°° 
(11) The motive for making the school at Newcastle-upon- 
Tyne a royal foundation is given in the following excerpt from 
the preamble to the letters patent: ‘‘ Moreover, we have been 
revolving in our mind how much advantage would arise to the 
commonwealth of England, over which Almighty God has 
been pleased to place us, that youth should be well founded 
from their tenderest years in the rudiments of true religion and 
instructed in learning and good manners, we, etc. ordain, etc. 
one Free Grammar School in Newcastle upon Tyne.’’!™ 
Four types of motives appear in the list just quoted, the 
moral and religious, the political, the educational, and the 
philanthropic. The moral and religious motive appears . to 
have been very strong and influential. The religious motive 
had been the leading motive in the foundation of the chantries 
and their schools, but in the foundation of the new schools 
its character changed, its superstitious and selfish nature gave 
way to a more rational and unselfish spirit; the motive was no 
longer the salvation of the soul of the founder with those of 
his heirs by the chanting of prayers for them, but the salvation 
of the children through a more perfect knowledge of God and 
Christ! and the development of strong moral character through 
precept and example.!* The salvation of the children was 
recognized by a few as the salvation of the state, and the political 
motive when stated was the good of the commonwealth through 
the realization of the religious motive. The importance of 
secular education to the welfare of the state does not seem to 
have been perceived by the benefactors of the Elizabethan gram-

12 To be obtained from a study of the catechism and the dogmas of 
the Church of England. 
103 While this is true of the majority of cases, yet there were instances 
of founders ordaining that the masters and pupils should pray for their 
souls and the souls of those dear to them. Cf. infra151, 153, footnote 141.

mar schools. The secular and religious were so closely related 
that they were hard to separate in the minds of the founders, 
but notwithstanding this there were a few cases in which the 
motive is furnished by the purely secular educational aim. 
Pervading almost all of the motives, however, was the philan- 
thropic. There was the desire to aid those who were in need of 
aid, hence the foundation of so many schools for ‘‘ poor scholars” 
who otherwise would have been compelled to go without the 
education which their benefactors thought necessary or good 
for them. This philanthropic spirit is expressed in the pro- 
visions made for charity. Indeed, one of the characteristic 
features of the education of this period was its close relation to 
charity and other humanitarian interests. 
THE RELATION OF SCHOOLS TO CHARITY 
In their foundation, support, and management or govern- 
ment, many of the schools and charities were closely related. 
In not a few cases the school was founded in connection with 
a charity. Thus, the school in Aldenham was founded simul- 
taneously with six almshouses;!* that in Croydon'® and in 
Tadcaster’ with a hospital, while the endowment for a school 
in Blechingley was appropriated to almshouses.'” 
Schools and charities were often supported from the same 
funds. Thus, in the case of Kirby Stephen £26 135. 4d. was to 
be expended annually in payment of the master’s salary and.in 
support of the poor and a mansion house;'"* in that of Hunting- 
don certain funds were to be used for the “maintenance and 
relief of poor people and for the support of a Free Grammar 
School,’ in that of Brentwood part of the land of the school 
was appropriated to the support of five alms people; in that 
of Wycombe the rents of a certain hospital were to be applied 
to the support of the school and of four poor persons, in that

The most vital relationship, however, existed in the manage- ment or government of some of the schools and charities, in which 'the same men were trustees or governors of both the school and the charity and were so incorporated. Thus, in the cases of Rugby,"* Thame,"* Aldenham,"’ West Laving- ton,"* Stepney,"* and Cheltenham, the governors of the school were at the same time governors of the particular charity, while in the cases of New Woodstock," High Wycombe, Bunbury,'* Sherborne and Worcestez,"* the governors of the school were incorporated as governors of both school and charity funds.

  CHAPTER II 
GOVERNMENT OF THE GRAMMAR SCHOOLS 
At least three distinct types of government existed during the 
reign of Queen Elizabeth. Certain schools were governed by 
non-incorporated trustees or feoffees, others by incorporated 
trustees, and still others by bodies of men especially incorporated 
as governors of the school. It is the purpose of the present 
chapter to treat each of these types with respect to their member- 
ship and internal organization, and their powers and duties. 
I. GovERNMENT BY FEOFFEES 
This type of government is the one which is discovered in 
‘cases where the founder does not obtain letters patent of incor- 
poration but simply deeds his property to certain men upon 
condition that they manage the property for the purpose of 
supporting the school. The number of men thus enfeoffed 
varied from two to twenty-seven.1 They were chosen chiefly 
from the middle and upper classes, including in their number 
yeomen, gentlemen, and in one instance at least, a Chief Justice 
of England.? While the original body was chosen by the founder 
or benefactor, provision was generally made for the enfeoffment 
of new members to take the place of those taken away by death 
or removal from the locality. A study of these provisions will 
also reveal a number of qualifications of members of various 
bodies. 
The time at which this new enfeoffment should take place 
varied. In Ashby de la Zouch, within six months after the 
number had been reduced to six, the survivors were “ by writing 
or Indenture Tripartite to re-enfeoff the six and eight others.’”* In 
Tiverton a new enfeoffment was to occur whenever the number 
1 Cf. Appendix D. 
?Sir Frauncis Popham, Chief Justice of England, was appointed one 
of the feoffees at Tiverton. Included in this original body also were 
two infant members, sons of two of the relations of the benefactor, who 
were thus included because he did not wish to run the risk of their not 
being subsequently elected. Carlisle, i., 341. 
* Carlisle, i., 742.

was decreased to thirteen when the number was to be raised to at 
least twenty-five. In Wellingborough’ and Skipton* the lower 
limit was five, the number to be raised to the original, in Whit- 
church the lower number was eight.?. In Warrington, when the 
original number was decreased to four, these were, within one 
month, to enfeoff two honest priests, who in turn were to re- 
enfeoff the four survivors together with twelve other of the 
“most honest and discreet persons” living in four specified 
parishes, who had been selected before by the surviving four,* 
while in ia aie the number, twenty, was to be filled up every 
seven years.°® 
The provision taken by the founder of the school at Witton is interest- 
ing enough to be quoted in full. It reads as follows: ‘‘Because all 
Men be rtal, and through such of the number of Feoffees being dead 
there happen some disorder, not only in the School but also in the lands 
and tenements thereunto given by the Founder aforesaid, might fall to 
ruin and decay or the School-house want such furniture as appertaineth, 
therefore I will as oft as Four of the Feoffees be dead, the rest of the 
Feoffees surviving, within one quarter of a year, shall assemble them- 
selves at the School-house aforesaid, shall not only then and there elect 
and choose Four other of the Founder’s next Kinsfolk to be Feoffees in 
the stead of the other Four Feoffees before dead, if there be then so many 
of his Kinsfolk alive, and if not, then to choose Four of the most honest, 
sage and discreet persons, being Inhabitants of the Parish of Witton 
aforesaid, and especially such as will have a vigilant eye and bear a 
good zeal to the maintenance and continuance of this Free School,—but 
shall then and there also enfeoff the Four by them so chosen, in all the 
lands and tenements given to the School aforesaid, to the use limited by 
the Founder’s enfeoffment, and this order and election to be continued 
forever | t%   
In the above quotation is given not only the course to be 
pursued in the election and enfeofiment of new trustees, but alsoa 
detailed as of the necessary qualifications. The ‘‘Founder’s 
next Kinsfolk” were to be preferred," and in default of these

"This was not uncommon. In the case of Rugby the succession was

the four were to be chosen from ‘‘the most honest, sage, and 
discreet persons,” ‘‘such as will have a vigilant eye and bear a 
good zeal to the maintenance of this Free School” and were to be 
“Inhabitants of the Parish of Witton.’’ This local qualification 
was very common, but hardly less so than the stock phrase, 
men of ‘‘good fame, morals, and condition.” 
While it has been noted that the perpetuity of the trust was 
provided for by new enfeoffments and by qualifications of a high 
grade for members, there remains to be considered the methods 
of managing the estate entrusted to the feoffees, which was the 
chief duty of these bodies of men." In at least one place this 
duty seems to have been referred to the schoolmaster, for in 
Warrington, one year after his nomination, the master was to be 
given a lease of the property of the school for sixty years, a 
lease which was to become void upon the severance of his con- 
nection with the school; the master was given power to demise 
property at his pleasure, but for terms of only ten years." 
While the period for which land could be demised was the same 
in Whitchurch as that which has just been quoted, the power 
was in the hands of the feoffees, who were to render a yearly 
account of all the rents and profits of the property to the church- 
wardens of the parish church at an annual meeting to be held 
in the parish church.'® A somewhat similar arrangement seems 
to have existed at Wellingborough, where the actual management 
was vested in the entire body of feoffees, who were to render 
account every year on Easter Monday and Tuesday at a meeting 
to be held in the schoolhouse and to be open to all parishioners 
who desired to attend. At these meetings the accounts were to 
be examined by the Vicar, the Schoolmaster, and three of the 
men assessed highest at the last assessment. But this was not 
Staunton, Great Public Schools, 365. This was true until 1602, when 
because of some trouble there was a complete remodeling of the trust, 
which was then vested in a body of 12 feoffees, men of standing and 
repute.—Rouse, Rugby, Appendix II. B. |

ifferent but not less interesting was the method of 
ent at Tiverton, where, while the management was to 
hands of the entire body, ‘‘a true and perfect Book of 
Survey of granting and demising the lands of the estate, of money 
received ea paid out, and other proceedings in and about the 
premises ” was to be kept by a “perfect Clarke” to be appointed 
by the feoffees and to receive an annual salary of 4os. for his 
services. He was to take ‘‘warrant of all his doeings from the 
feoffees, or the most part of them, with their hands alwaies to 
bee subs: 
In the ribed,’' 1 
cases thus far studied the estates have been managed 
by the whole body of feoffees except where the management 
has been delegated to the master, a custom which fortunately 
for the masters as well as for the property of the schools does 
not appe at to have been common. In Tiverton much of the 
executive power of the large and cumbersome body of feoffees 
must have been delegated to the ‘‘perfect Clarke.” A decided 
step in ue towards executive efficiency seems to have been 
taken at

rest of the feoffees and the Church Wardens of Witton every 
year upon Jesus Eve.'® 
As the care and repair of the school and its property were 
included in the actual management of the estates, the chief 
duties of the feoffees were such as would arise from acting as 
custodians and managers of estates, and hence the chief powers 
were financial in their nature. Thus while the feoffees at. Welling- 
borough were to pay the salary of the master they had no voice 
in his appointment or removal.’® But while this was true in a 
few other cases, perhaps in a larger number the feoffees had the 
power to appoint and dismiss the master,?* and in one instance 
at least they had the power of appointment and dismissal of 
the usher as well as that of making statutes for the better 
governing of the school.*1 | Commonly, however, the statutes 
appear to have been made by persons other than the feoffees 
who were merely to see that the rules were enforced faithfully.” 
While our study has shown that in not a few places special 
provisions were made for the safeguarding of the trust, it is clear 
that without such provisions too much is left to the individual 
characters of the men who compose the body of feoffees; the trust 
was safe in proportion to the soundness of character of the 
individual feoffee; there was always the danger that the feoffees 
would appropriate the lands or rents to their own use.*® While 
these dangers might exist in the case of a corporation there was 
not the same amount of danger; that more confidence was 
actually placed in government by corporations is proved by the 
greater number of cases of such government. But before pro- 
ceeding to the consideration of the second type of government, 
two transitional cases should be noted. F 
The first is that of Alford, where in 1565, Francis Spanning, a 
Merchant of Alford, placed by deed, the interest of £50 into the 
keeping of ten managers, six of whom were to be feoffees chosen

from the inhabitants of Alford and to be known as the Governors 
of the school, while the other four were to be of the most respect- 
able persons in or near the town and were to be known as Audit- 
ors“—a plan somewhat similar to that at Wellingborough. 
But in 1576, when a Charter was obtained,”* the governors were 
made an incorporated body. 
The second transitional case is that of Thame where several 
rectories left in 1558 by Sir John William, Knight, to his executors 
for the establishment and maintenance of a free school, were 
surrendered by the feoffees in 1574, under license of the Crown, 
to the management of the Warden and Scholars of New College, 
Oxford.** A study of the new form of government of this school 
leads us into the second division of our topic, 
II. GoveRNMENT BY INCORPORATED TRUSTEES 
These trustees differ from those just studied in that they are a 
corporation and have the rights of a corporate body while the 
feoffees were not incorporated and did not have the rights of 
such a body. They differ from those to be studied in the third 
division of our topic, ‘‘Government by Specially Incorporated 
Governors,” in that they are not incorporated for the specific 
purpose of governing a certain grammar school as is the case with 
those under the third division. The trustees to be studied under 
this division are simply members of corporations founded for 
other purposes, with other functions to perform; these corpora- 
tions impressed the founders or those interested in the schools as 
being desirable trustees for the endowments and possessions of 
the school, and were therefore made governors of the school. 
Four types of corporations were thus not uncommonly chosen: 
colleges, guilds, incorporated towns, and cathedral corporations. 
The present division of our topic may, therefore, be treated 
under the following heads: Government by Colleges, Govern- 
ment by Guilds, Government by Town Corporations, and Govern- 
ment by Cathedral Corporations. 
A. Government by Colleges —The endowment of the grammar 
school at Thame, as we have seen, was surrendered by the

original feofiees to the Warden and Scholars of New College, 
Oxford, and their Successors, in order that the trust might be 
better discharged. The chief duties to be performed by the 
new trustees were to ‘employ and bestow the profits of the 
premises according to the mind of the founder,” i.e., to pay the 
salaries of the master and usher, to ‘‘uphold and keep the school- 
house and buildings, and the tomb of the founder,” and to 
maintain an almshouse for five old men and one old woman, as 
well as to keep the property in as good repair as the surplus 
of yearly profits would permit. While the heirs of the founder 
were to have the actual appointment of the master and usher, 
the college was to have the power of nomination.” The Wardens 
and Fellows of New College, Oxford, were also entrusted with 
the possessions of the school at East Adderbury, with the 
revenues of which they were to keep the school in repair and to 
pay the salary of the master.”® 
At least two other Oxford Colleges were made trustees of 
schools: Corpus Christi college was to hold in trust the lands of 
the school at Cheltenham and was to nominate master and 
usher;?* while University College was deeded land to be used 
for the support of the school at Normanton.’ But the grammar

as they had built the schoolhouse and settled the estates, the feoffees 
were, according to the founder’s will, to deed the lands to the college.

8° Deed, 1592. S.I.C. xviii, 190. The following is an extract of the 
founder’s will relative to this subject: 
“‘For the better ordering, government, directing, and establishing of 
this my meaning, I commit the nomination, placing, ordering, and govern- 
ment, and visitation, reformation, direction, displacing, and expulsion 
of the said schoolmaster, usher and scholars of my school at Normanton

shire and to my executors and to the Vicars of Wakefield, Pontefract, 
Leeds, Normanton, and Kirkthorpe and their successors for the time 
being, and to him or them of the scholars that have or shall be main- 
tained by me as aforesaid in either of the said universities, and to my 
said cousin, Richard Freeston of Mendham and to his heirs for ever, or 
the more part of them that have that purpose, shall be assembled in the

school trustees were not picked from the Oxford colleges alone; 
two at least of the Cambridge colleges acted as such trustees. 
The Master, Fellows and Scholars of Trinity college were 
made trustees of the three schools founded by the Rev. Thomas 
Allen (or Allyn) at Stone, Stevenage, and Uttoxeter, and as 
such were to pay an annual salary of twenty marks to each of 
the three masters;*! while by Letters Patent, 1572, the Principal 
and Fellows of Brasen Nose College were incorporated as gover- 
nors of the grammar school at Middleton, and as such they 
were to act as trustees of the school property and as custodians 
of rent charges from which they were to pay annually the salary 
of the master and usher.*? Both colleges were given power to 
make statutes for the government of the schools as well as the 
power of appointment of masters. 
B. Government by Guilds.—The second class of corporations 
to which the possessions of some of the grammar schools were 
entrusted was composed of the various guilds. Thus, at Stepney, 
the government of the school was placed in the hands of the 
Coopers Company ;** at West Lavington, the Mercers Company 
was given the power to dismiss the master and was charged 
with the superintendence of repairs and the maintenance of 
the schoolhouse; at Barton-under-Needwood the Drapers Com- 
pany had the power of appointment of master and: usher ;** 
at Basingstoke the possessions of the School were held by the 
aldermen and wardens of the guild and fraternity of the Holy 
Ghost;** while in Aldenham the lands of the school and of six 
almshouses were placed under the management of the Master 
and Keeper or Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery or 
Art of Brewers of the City of London, who had the power of 
election and removal (‘for sufficient reasons”) of master and 
usher, to regulate the salaries of the same, to admit pupils into     
Church of Normanton aforesaid, and my said cousin, Richard Freeston, and his heirs, if the number of them be equal, having a casting vote, notwithstanding anything contained in my said schedule.’’ Quoted in S.L.C. xviii, rgz.

the school, and to make statutes for the better governing of 
the school.” In the case of the grammar school at Holt the 
Fishmongers Company were incorporated as ‘‘The Wardens 
and Commonalty of the Mystery of Fishmongers of London, 
Governors of the Possessions, Revenues, and Goods of the 
Free Grammar School of John Gresham, Knight, Citizen and 
Alderman of London, in Holt, otherwise Holt Market, in the 
County of Norfolk,’’** with the power to make statutes with 
the advice and consent of the Bishop of Norwich and to appoint 
master and visitors of the school.** 
Two cases are particularly interesting as they give a hint as 
to how estates were administered by these non-resident bodies. 
They are those of Tunbridge and Oundle. In the former place 
the management of the school property was entrusted by the 
founder, Sir Andrew Judde, Knight, Citizen and Skinner of 
London, Lord Mayor of London in 1552,*° to the Master, Wardens 
and Commonalty of Skinners in London,*' who as governors of 
the school had the power to, and actually did, draw up statutes 
for the government of the School. In order to increase their 
efficiency as governors, they inaugurated the custom of visiting 
the School annually in the month of May. In Oundle the 
governors of the School were the Wardens of the Grocers Com- 
pany of London,** who had the management of the endowment 
for the master and usher of the Grammar School and also for 
seven ‘‘Bed Men.’ In this case, however, the governors 
were not to visit the school but were to pay to the ‘‘ Vicar, 
Churchwardens and four of the antientest substantial parish- 
ioners of Oundle’’ 24s. annually, which were to be used for the 
"Statutes, 1599. S.I.C. xii, 65, also Letters Patent, 1595, Ibid 6s.

repair of the schoolhouse, the alms-houses, and the dwellings 
of the master and usher. Thus the actual care of the buildings 
was left to a committee of the most responsible inhabitants 
of the town in which the school was located. The power of 
appointment and removal of master, however, was given to 
the governors.‘ 
C. Government by Town Corporations—While our list of 
schools under the government of town corporations contains 
the names of over forty such schools, it has been possible to 
gather but little information concerning the management of 
the schools by these corporations. This information relates 
almost entirely to the care of the buildings.‘* Thus, in the 
Annals of Ipswich under Mar. 24, 1580, the following entry is 
to be found: ‘‘Orders touching the Grammar Schoole and 
reparacons thereof shall be referred to the Portmen to deter- 
mine and to such as they shall think meet to call to them.’ 
The Corporation of Gloucester had the management of the funds 
of the School of St. Mary de Crypt and also had the oversight 
of all necessary repairs. For the better execution of this latter 
part of their duty the officers of the Corporation were to ‘‘survey 
the schoolhouse every year between Easter and Whitsuntide,’’ 
and for their trouble each was to receive a slight remuneration: 
the Mayor, 4s.; the Recorder, 3s. 6d.; the two senior Aldermen, 
each 2s.; the two Sheriffs, each 20d.; the Town Clerk, 16d.; 
the Swordbearer, rad.; the four Stewards, 12d.; the four Serjeants 
at Mace, each 8d.; and the five Porters at the Gates, 4d. each. 
In Coventry the responsibility of keeping the property in repair 
does not appear to have been so divided. The Bailiff alone was 
to ‘‘see the house kept in reparations,’’ and was also to ‘‘gather 
up the said rents,’’ and for these services he was to receive 26s. 
8d. per annum.*®

for the comfort of the pupils by ordering in 1562 wood and coal, to be 
provided for the relief of the scholars in the winter. Manship, Histcry 
of Great Yarmouth, ii., 368.

In Shrewsbury provision was made in 1571 by Indenture 
concerning the expenditure of money. Money was to be ex- 
pended by the bailiffs and schoolmaster in amounts of not more 
than £10 at a time and its expenditure was restricted to specified 
purposes among which were the repairs of the school. The 
surplus revenues were to be employed (1) to complete the 
school buildings, (2) to build a country house to serve as a 
resort in case of plague, and (3) to found two Scholarships and 
two Fellowships for boys educated at the school.*° 
The most complete account, however, is that of the school 
at St. Albans. The actual government of this school was in 
the hands of two governors, who were to be ‘‘honest and sub- 
stantial persons, inhabitants of the borough’’ and were to be 
chosen at an annual meeting of the Mayor and Burgesses at the 
Feast of All Saints. Elected at this meeting for a term of one 
year these two governors were to take an oath to perform faith- 
fully the duties of their office, which were to see that the statutes 
of the school were kept by the master and scholars of the school, 
that the school was kept in good repair, and that the master 
was paid his wages every quarter, Upon receiving his salary 
the master was to give a receipt for the money, ‘‘an acquintance, 
witnessing that he hath received of the said Mayor and Bur- 
gesses by the hands of the said governors £5 of good and lawful 
money of England towards the payment of his wages for keep- 
ing of the said school.’’* These receipts were kept by the 
governors who were custodians of all the money belonging to 
the school, and were surrendered to the Mayor and Burgesses 
at the next annual meeting when the governors made a com- 
plete report of all their acts during their term of office. As 
governors, their consent was necessary for the admission of a 
new scholar as well as for leave of absence of the master,* 
while together with the mayor they had the appointment of 
two visitors who were to inspect the work of the master once a 
year.’ They also had the power to lengthen the play time 
and to grant more than one day for play.*

Among the powers not uncommonly possessed by the Corpor- 
ations was that of appointment of master and usher,** while less 
common was the power to make and change the statutes of 
the school.*s 
D. Government by Cathedral Corporations.*—This form of 
government is peculiar in that it was adopted by but one type 
of founder, the King.” In other words, the Cathedral Schools 
of this period were royal foundations, and as such were known 
as “King's! Schools,! "5 
With one authority responsible for their creation or lease of 
life, it is natural that the Cathedral Schools should resemble 
each other very closely in many respects.*° In form of govern- 
ment they are virtually alike.** The Dean and Chapter of the 
Cathedral were governors of the Cathedral School held in con- 
nection with their Cathedral. As governors, their duties were 
the same as those governors of other types intrusted with 
annuities for the benefit of a school,” viz., they were to attend

be drawn between this division and Government by Specially Incorporated 
Governors. While some of the cases given in this reference should have 
been included in this third general division of our topic, they have been 
inserted here for the sake of convenience, 
8 While, strictly speaking, the Cathedral Schools do not belong to the 
“independent schools of the reign of Elizabeth’? with which the present 
study is concerned (cf. Introduction), it has nevertheless seemed necessary 
to refer very briefly to them here in order to complete the general topic 
of Government by Incorporated Trustees.

88 Cf, Introduction. 
59 For list of such schools see Appendix A and Appendix U. 
6° lt might be said that they resemble each other in form but not in 
content. Thus a glance at the table given in Appendix U will reveal 
the fact that while the schools resemble each other in the objects for 
which their revenues were to be expended, the amounts to be expended 
differ materially. 
6 From what has just been said this would be expected. 
® For references cf. those given in Appendix A. To those in authority 
these amounts appear to have been considered annuities, but, accordirg 
to Whiston, Cathedral Trusts and their Fulfilment, p. 9, they were not 
annuities, but proportionable parts of amounts derived from the revenues 
from lands with which the Cathedral was endowed. Whiston’s conten- 
tion was that as these lands increased in value and the revenues became 
larger, the parts appropriated for educational purposes ought also to 
have grown.

to the repairs of the building, to pay the stipends of the teaching 
staff, and to pay the scholarships to the pupils."* While the 
Dean and Chapter had power to appoint and dismiss the teaching 
staff and to appoint scholars, the Dean alone possessed the 
power to extend the time of any boy beyond that allowed by 
the statutes of the Cathedral.” 
The law was that every cathedral should have within it a 
cathedral school, or should have near it a free grammar school." 
No cathedral school was supported by the Dean and Chapter 
of the cathedral at Norwich; in its place the Dean and Chapter 
paid £20 annually to the master of the city school of Norwich." 
A somewhat similar condition existed at Lincoln. The govern- 
ing body of the school here consisted of the Town Corporation 
of Lincoln and the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral Church 
of Lincoln, an arrangement brought about in 1583 by an agree- 
ment between the two corporations. According to this agree- 
ment the Cathedral Corporation was to have the appointment 
of the master of whose salary they were to pay £20; as visitors 
of the school, the Dean and Chapter were to have oversight 
of the teaching done by the master and were to attend to any 
necessary reform in his teaching. On the other hand, the Town 
Corporation was to have similar powers and duties with respect 
to the usher. 
GOVERNMENT BY INCORPORATED GOVERNORS. 
While the distinguishing mark of the cases to be considered 
in this division is that of special incorporation, there are two 
distinct classes: to the first class belong the cases in which bodies 
of men already incorporated for specific purposes are again 
incorporated as governors of a grammar school, while to the

In the above table containing forty-nine cases it will be noted 
that the number of men incorporated varies from two to fifty, 
the most common number being twelve. Over 67% of the cases 
lie between six and sixteen.’° 
Turning from the number to the qualifications of governors, 
we discover that the most common qualification is that the

cations were the same as those of Halifax with the exception 
of a difference in age (from 24 to 21) and the addition, in the 
case of Hexham, of ‘‘men fearing God, of good name and fame;’’”? 
while in Wakefield the men were to be ‘‘of the most wise, discreet, 
and religious persons,” ‘within the parish or dwelling within 
two miles thereof.” 
In the above list of qualifications it will be noticed that the 
qualification common to all is that the governor shall be an 
inhabitant of the parish or town in which the school is located.”* 
While this was a very common qualification it did not always 
hold, as for example, in Saint Bees where two of the governors 
were always to be The Provost of Queen’s College, Oxford, and 
the Rector of Egremont.*® Still other restrictions were not 
uncommon. In Crediton three of the governors were to be 
chosen from the village of Sandford.** | In Cranbrook,* Gains- 
borough,®* Giggleswick,* and Kirkby Lonsdale, the vicar was 
always to be one of the governors. In Market Bosworth the 
corporation was to consist of the rector, three church wardens, 
and six inhabitants of the parish;** in Dronfield the Vicar and 
Guardians of the Parish Church were to be governors; in

some places, as in Dronfield* and in Berkhamsted,** the man- 
agement of the possessions of the school appears to be the sole 
function of the governors. 
The right to acquire and hold land which is implicitly recog- 
nized in the title of incorporation is always explicitly stated 
in the letters patent. The value of the land which the corporation 
might hold is also generally given. Thus in 80% of the twenty 
cases of which we have data” this annual value of land lies 
between £30 and £40." In not a few instances it was also 
specified in what manner the possessions were to be held. Thus 
in St. Olave’s they were not to be held ‘‘by thrift or by Knight’s 
Services;’’* in Market Bosworth they were not to be held by 
“‘Knight’s Services or in capite;’’** while in Blackburn they 
were forbidden to be ‘‘holden of the Crown in chief.’’! In 
Horncastle the lands were to be held ‘‘in capite;” 1° while in 
Stafford they were to be held ‘‘by fealty or in free Soccage,’’! 
and in Birmingham ‘‘by Fealty only in free Soccage, paying 
20s. yearly into the Court of Augmentation, at the Feast of 
St. Michael, for all demands and services whatever.’"! In many 
cases also the purposes for which the revenues of the estates were 
to be expended are definitely given. Thus in the case of Bunbury 
twelve men are incorporated as ‘‘The Governors of the posses- 
sions and revenues purchased and assigned by Thomas Aldersey, 
for the maintenance of the free grammar school, and the preacher

In the case of Nottingham the charter granted 4th Henry VIII. had

insufficient to support and maintain the school. Upon the petition of

not only gave the power or right, but also made provisions 
for the management among which were those made for the 
constitution or internal organization of the corporations. In 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne the master and scholars were made a 
corporation with the usual powers while the Town Corporation 
was made patron of the school with the power to appoint the 
master."* In Guisbrough the corporation was to consist of 
two wardens, one schoolmaster, and twelve poor persons; 
the wardens were to be chosen for one year by the founders 
or their heirs, the retiring wardens, and the schoolmaster, who 
was also to be appointed by the founders or their heirs within 
twenty days after vacancy occurred, while the twelve poor 
persons, six of each sex, the women to be at least 63 years of 
age and to have been inhabitants of Guisbrough for at least 
three years, were to be elected by the founders or their heirs 
within the specified twenty days after any vacancy occurred; 
in cases of non-appointment of master or poor persons within 
the specified time the right was to lapse to the two wardens, 
who were to appoint within the next twenty days or to forfeit 
the power to a Robert Rokely of Marck in Cleveland or his 
heirs; but in any case the election to the corporation was to be 
made public." The corporation of the school at Chelmsford 
gained the title of ‘The Knight School Corporation” from the 
fact that the original members appointed by the Crown were 
knights and that the government was settled in their families 
forever; the heir of a deceased member was to be chosen as his 
successor, while, in case of no heir being left by the deceased, 
a knight whose family live in the County of Essex was to be 
chosen, while in case of all of the governors dying without male 
issue, four men from the Order of Knights were to be chosen 
by the Bishop of the Diocese to act as governors of the school."* 
As a rule, however, there were not the restrictions in the consti- 
tution of the corporations just quoted; generally what restric- 
tions there were were of the character of the qualifications 
which have already been noted."

  Before proceeding to a consideration of the internal organiza- 
tion of the corporations let us note briefly some of the provisions 
taken for the perpetuation of the bodies of governors. While 
in the case of Bunbury the nomination of governors was given 
to the Master and Wardens of the Haberdashers Company,” 
this is an exceptional case for, as it has before been noted ,"8 
the corporations were’ generally given the power of self-per- 
petuation’' or of perpetual succession.!® Thus in Wantage 
vacancies caused by death or removal were to be supplied by a 
majority of the remainder.” In at least one case men outside 
of the corporation participated in the election of new members; 
in St. Savior in Southwark the new governor was to be elected 
by the governors and by twelve of the ‘‘discreet and creditable 
inhabitants” of the parish who had been chosen by the governors 
for that purpose.'" In some places the new governors were 
to be elected within a specified time. In Halifax"? and Crediton! 
this time was to be within one month, in St. Bees, Worcester, 175 
and Wakefield,* within six weeks, after the occurrence of the 
vacancy. Further provision was made for failure to elect 
within specified time. In Halifax the election was to go with 
consent of two of the governors to the Archbishop of York, or,

In Wakefield the Lord President of the North Parts, or the 
Archbishop of York with the consent of six of the governors 
was to appoint.'* In St. Becs,"* Atherstone,'° and Spalding"! 
the power of appointment was to be forfeited to the Bishop 
of the Diocese in which the town was situated. 
The newly elected governor was in some places required to 
take an oath of office. Such an oath was required in Wakefield 
before the governor entered upon his duties,"? while in Hartle- 
bury he was not admitted until he had taken such an oath.!88 
The oath prescribed by the lord of Chester for the Governors 
of the Free School of Hawkeshead reads as follows: 
“I, B. C., doe sweare that I haue not giuen Any thing, nor 
haue indirectly laboured, to be Made Gournr of this Schoole, 
And I will Diligently and faithfully to the uttermost of myne 
Ability keep by my sclfe and cause to be keept by others (as 
much as I can) inviolably All these Statutes, and I will not 
doe any act at Any tyme which I shall knowe, beleeue, or thike 
wilbe preiudiciall to the good of the said Schoole, And I wiil 
not Appropriate convert or Apply to myne use, or to the use 
of any of mync, any part of the profittes of the Revenewes

and Ushers in ppctuity, and to such [Ends onely as are sett 
downe in the foundation, and in these present Statutes, and 
noe. otherwse.”? 1™ 
The dutics of the individual governor depended to a great 
extent upon the internal organization of the corporation of 
which he was a member. In Ashborne the corporation was 
to be organized into “Governors” and ‘Assistant Governors;” 
the “Governors of the Revenues” were to be elected by the

governors and assistants from the ‘‘Assistants,” while the latter 
were to be chosen ‘‘ex discretioribus et magis idoneis viris’’ of 
the Parish,’ while in Seven Oaks the corporation was to be 
composed of two Wardens and four Assistants. In these 
cases as in the case of Guisbrough already quoted, it is very 
probable that the real work of the corporation was done by the 
wardens or chief governors. More detailed information with 
respect to other instances supports this view. Thus in the 
case of Dedham the annual meeting of the governors was to be 
held on All Souls Day; at this meeting the governors were to 
elect from their number two ‘‘collectors” who were to collect 
the rents of the school lands, to pay therewith the salary of the 
master, and to render an account at the next annual meeting, 
at which no business was to be transacted until a quorum were 
present and in which a governor might vote by proxy provided 
his vote were given to another governor under his hand and 
seal.'** In Atherstone, according to the statutes made in 1607, 
it had been the custom to elect at the annual meeting two 
members to act as bailiffs and in that capacity to take charge 
of the financial affairs of the school, with power to call extra 
meetings of the governors whenever such meeting seemed 
necessary to them;!** while in Hexham the governors at their 
annual meeting at or within four days after the feast of St. 
Michael elected from their number two ‘‘stewards of the school” 
who were to collect and manage all the revenues, to pay the 
salaries of master and usher, and at the next meeting to render 
account to the governors in the presence of the master of moneys 
received and expended; the master was then to receive the 
surplus money and ‘‘perfect notes” of arrears which were to be

collected by the newly elected stewards but were to be paid as 
part of the salary of the year in which they were due; the accounts 
were to be again audited in the presence of the master by the 
commissary of Hexamshire at his next court which was held 
after the feast of St. Michael.'*° 
While in the cases just considered a large share of the work 
appears to have been delegated to two or more men, in the 
cases of St. Bees, Hawkeshead, and Rivington the duties are 
delegated to one man."™! 
In St. Bees the Governors were to hold an annual meeting 
in the forenoon of Tuesday or Thursday after Easter Week. 
At this meeting the statutes were to be read to them by the 
schoolmaster or usher. After the reading of the statutes they 
were to elect the Receiver of the Revenues for the following 
year, to view the buildings and to take account of the imple- 
ments belonging thereto, to ‘‘look whether the same be clean 
and decently kept” and ‘‘to appoint repairs.” A dinner was 
to be provided by the retiring Receiver of the Revenues, who 
was to allow for this purpose 13s. 4d. Occasionally an election 
of a new member or governor was held at this meeting; but 
when this could not be arranged, the Receiver was to allow 
6s. 8d. for the cost of the dinner on the day of election.? The 
exact minutes of the annual meetings were to be kept by the 
schoolmaster or usher ‘‘in a book for that purpose, with the 
date and year of the same, in the presence of the said Governors,’’ 
who before their departure were to ‘‘subscribe their names or 
marks unto the same.’’! 
From the above it will be seen that the Governors as a body 
did not bother themselves about the details of management.

at Guisbrough for the annual auditing of the accounts of the wardens.

inhabitants of the town by the remaining Assistants within twenty 
days after the occurrence of a vacancy. Letters Patent, 1552. Carlisle

2 Tt would seem from this that not as large an attendance was expected 
upon this occasion as upon that of the annual meeting.

Attention to these was left to the Receiver of the Revenues of 
the school, who, elected at the annual meeting for a term of one 
year, was required to give bond and received for his services 
20s. per annum. His duties were to attend to the repairs 
ordered by the governors, to collect the revenues of the school, 
to pay the stipends of the master and usher as well as all other 
necessary bills, to notify the Governors of a special meeting, to 
notify the Bishop of Chester in case of failure in the election 
of a new Governor, and to inform the Provost of Queen’s College, 
Oxford, when a vacancy in the mastership occurred, and upon 
default of appointment of a new master by that official to notify 
the Master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, of the vacancy at 
Saint Bees.'4 
In Hawkeshead the governors were to elect every year one 
of their number ‘‘to Collecte, and gather upp all the Rents, 
Revenewes, yssues, and pfitts’’ of the Messuages, lands, tene- 
ments, conveyed by the founder, Archbishop Sandys, ‘‘for the 
mayntenaunce of the said Scholemaster, usher and Schole.” 
Before entering upon his duties the person so elected was to 
‘enter into bonde by obligation’’ to the other governors, with 
one or two sufficient sureties to be ‘‘bounde with him or them, 
to make a juste, and trewe accompt, pamente, and satisfaction’’ 
to the governors ‘‘for the time being,” of all the money entrusted 
to him as custodian. Such an ‘‘accompt’? was to be made by 
him whenever the majority of the governors so desired. Should 
he refuse to grant the request, it was to be lawful ‘‘to depose 
and dysplace suche pson soe offendinge from his office, or place 
of gouernor of the said schole, accordinge to ther good dyscrea- 
tions.’ 
In the cases thus far quoted tise ‘‘collector,” “warden,” ‘“stew- 
ard, or “governor” has been elected without respect to any 
particular order. The custom at Rivington was to be somewhat 
different as the following extract from the statutes of the school 
make evident: 
‘‘Every Governour shall his year about in course, beginning 
at the Eldest first, take charge of all goods, tenements, and 
lands belonging to the School,—He shall also receive the rents 
and other money due for that year,—and further shall pay the

as shall go out for that year,—And for the true dealing therein,

have made a full accompt and payment of his receipts and laid 
into the common chest'* what money soever shall remain un- 
“* The ‘‘common chest” appears to have been an important part of the 
possessions of the schools. Its important character, its prominent 
characteristics, and its function will be seen from the following notes 
about it from various sources. 
In Hawkeshead the ‘‘Statuts, Constytucons, and Ordinaunces, touch- 
inge, Concrninge, appteyninge, or belonginge to the said grammer Schole’’ 
together with ‘‘the Queens Maties Letters Patents, conteyninge the 
ffoundacon of the said ffree grammer Schole, And all the Evidences 
chers, writings, escripts, and munymts’’ were to be kept in ‘‘one stronge 
and substanciall Chyste, wth three stronge Lockes and Keyes of thre 
scurall fashons and makings to the same’’ which was ordered to ‘‘be 
made and placed in some convenient place in the foresaid Scholehowse.’’ 
Of the three keys just mentioned, the schoolmaster was to have one and 
two of the governors were to have one each. The chest was not to be 
opened without the consent of these three. (Statutes, 1588, quoted in 
Cowper’s Hawkeshead, 484.) 
In Hartlebury the following statute was made concerning the chest: 
“‘Also, that for the preservation of the evidences and writings concerning 
the said school, one strong chest or coffer with four locks and keys be pro- 
vided, wherein shall be kept all the said writings. Which chest shall stand 
in the Vestry of the Parish Church of Hartlebury, the doors of which V 
shall be locked with two locks, all of which keys shall be committed to 
the custody of six of the said Governors to be chosen by the residue.’’ 
In this chest were also to be kept the Common Seal and the book of 
Register in which were to be recorded and registered ‘‘all grants and 
copies, the decease of the Governors, the election of new Governors, and 
the accompts of the Collectors.’’ (Statutes, 1565, Carlisle ii., 761). 
The following information is contained in the Founder’s Statutes for 
the school at St. Bees: ‘‘The Chest wherein the said Casket, the Register 
Book, this Book of Statutes and other Evidences, together with the said 
Stock, shall be kept, shall have three several Locks and the keys thereof 
shall be kept by three of the Wardens, so as no one Man shall have two 
of the said Keys in his Custody at once, neither shall any one of them 
suffer his Key to be used in his absence, but in extreme necessity, and 
then he shall commit the same to some other of the Wardens that hath not 
a Key.—This Chest shall always remain in the aforesaid Chamber, the 
Door whereof shall have two strong Locks and the Keys of the said Locks 
shall be kept, the one by the Receiver, the other by the Schoolmaster,

The conduct of the governor while serving as chief adminis- 
trator was subject to keen scrutiny, as the following statute 
indicates: ‘‘And because the other Governors may the better 
spie his upright dealing, they shall call for and he shall make 
afore them, twice in the year, at Midsummer and Christmas, or 
within ten days next following, a true accompt, both of what he 
hath received and paid,—and if he be found to have paid any- 
thing, without all the Governors’ consent, or four of them at 
least, besides himself,—except it be the Master and Usher 
wages,—or otherwise to deal untruly with the Tenants, or elsewhere 
touching the School matters, he shall be put out of the number 
of Governors for ever, and one other chosen in his roome.’’'™* 
The results of our study of the internal organization of some 
of the school corporations may be summarized as follows: In 
a large number of cases the corporation met annually. At this 
annual meeting the general business of the corporation was 
transacted and a “collector,” ‘‘bailiff,” ‘“‘steward,” or ‘‘warden” 
(in some cases two or three) was elected for a term of one year. 
The duties of this officer (or officers) appear to have been of 
merely a clerical nature and included the collection and dis- 
pensing of the revenues of the school according to the will of 
the corporation, and the care of the property, for both of which 
he was responsible to the corporation to whom he was com- 
pelled to render account. In none of the cases contained in 
our material does this officer appear to have been granted 
initiative powers, such as the power to sell and acquire land or 
to demise the same. These powers appear to have been retained 
by the governors. Such at least was the case in Rivington 
where this matter was treated in the following statutes: ‘‘The 
Governors shall not make any lease of any lands belonging to 
the School, for more years than Twenty one; or for three lives 
at the most,—nor let more leases forth at once than one,—nor 
renew any leases, until the old leases be forfeited or surren- 
dered, or expired within four years. 
is not Receiver, to be kept by him until there is a new Schoolmaster.”’

‘“‘They shall never seal anything with their Common Seal, 
except Four of the Governors agree to it at the least,—And if 
it be for putting away any lands, they shall not seal anything 
without the consent of all Six Governors,—and that only on 
this condition, to buy as much good land or better as they put 
away, and that not to be done without the advice of Six other of 
the discreetest men dwelling within the Towns of the Corporation, 
or the other Towns next adjoining.’’™* 
The statutes just quoted contain not only information con- 
cerning the leasing and sale of land but also concerning the use 
of the Common Seal,'*° which, as we have noted before,’ was 
one of the powers granted to the corporation. In Saint Bees 
the following statute deals with the safekeeping and use of the 
Common Seal: ‘‘Whereas her Majesty hath appointed the 
said Wardens to have a Common Seal for ever, to be used in 
their Affairs as need shall require, we will that the said Seal be 
kept in a little Casket with a Lock and within the said Chest," 
and the Schoolmaster shall keep the Key thereof,—which 
at his departure from the School, he shall leave with the Receiver. 
—The said Seal shall not be set to any Instrument or Grant, 
but in the presence and with the consent of the more part of the 
said Governors, and in the presence of the Schoolmaster, who 
shall immediately after the Sealing lock up the same again.’ 
The powers and duties of the governors which we have thus 
far considered have been financial or custodial in their nature. 
49 Statutes, Carlisle i., 715. 
18° A large number of prints of these seals are given in Carlisle’s En- 
dowed Grammar Schools. The following description of the seal of the 
school at Hawkeshead is taken from Cowper’s Hawkeshead, 176. 
“‘It is of silver, of massive work, with a diameter of two and one-half 
inches; the engraved design is curious and of great interest. In the 
center upon a large arm chair, we see seated the schoolmaster, cap on 
the head, and magnificent with a long flowing robe. With his left hand 
raised he admonishes the poor little knickerbockered pupil who with open 
book stands trembling before him, while with his right hand he brandishes 
the formidable birch rod. On the master’s right are the arms of the 
See of York, and on his left, the family arms of Sandys (the family of the 
founder) while above on a tablet is the motto ‘‘Docendo Discimus”’ and 
on a scroll surrounding the figures, ‘Sigullum Liberae Scholae Gramatic 
Edwyni Sandes Eboracensis Archispiscopi Eundatoris.’’’

There remain to be considered those which partake of a more 
educational executive character. The power to make statutes 
for the governing of the school might be considered as the 
transitional power for the statutes were usually to contain 
provision not only for the better governing of the estates of the 
school, but also for the improvement of the master and scholars. 
It should be noted, however, that this power was hedged by 
the condition that the statutes were to be made with the advice 
of some other person, usually the bishop of the diocese." 
As the subject of appointment and dismissal of master and 
usher will be treated in the next chapter," it will be sufficient 
here to note that not a few of the corporations had the power 
to appoint and dismiss their staff upon good reason,'* but that 
in some cases the advice and consent of some outside person 
was necessary in the choice of master and usher." Similar 
remarks might be made concerning the power to admit pupils 
which was possessed by some of the corporations." But of a 
more distinctly educational nature than the powers thus briefly 
noticed was the duty of supervision or examination of the 
master’s work. How generally this duty was performed by 
the governors themselves cannot be estimated from the data 
contained in our material. But two cases, St. Bees and Hawkes- 
head, are mentioned. In Hawkeshead the governors or the 
greater part of them were ‘‘at leaste twyse eurie yeare and soe 
often besydes as neede shall require, vysitt the said Schole 
and shall make dyligent inquirie from time to time whether 
the Scholemaster, usher, and Schollers of the said Schole doe 
ther dewtie as becometh them or noe;’’ and if they found 
14 The fact that so much of the material for the present study has been 
obtained from copies and extracts of the statutes of the various grammar 
schools warrants the brief summary treatment of the subject of statutes, 
given in Appendix V., in which are considered such questions as the 
authority by which they were made, their authors, their aim, general 
view of provisions, and means taken for their preservation. Cf. Appen- 
dix V. 
15 Cf. infra. 62ff., 8rff. 
8 Cf, Appendix F. 
181 Cf, infra, 64. Thus in St. Olaves the appointment of Master and 
Undermaster was to be made with the advice of the Bishop of Winchester, 
or, in his absence with the advice of ‘‘some honest and learned man.’’ 
(L. P. 1570). Carlisle ii., 578.

“‘aniethinge amysse or out of Order,’’ they were to ‘‘redresse 
and amende the same putclie or soe sone’’ as they could con- 
veniently do so. Among the duties of the governors of the 
school board at St. Bees was the following: ‘‘They shall also 
with the assistance of some godly and learned man examine 
the diligence and good behavior of the schoolmaster and see 
how his scholars do profit under him and whether he perform 
his Duty in bringing them up in Learning and in the fear of 
God or no,’’ did they find him ‘notoriously negligent or given 
to grievous crime’’ they were to remove him.'*° 
The case just quoted may be regarded as a transition case 
between the visitation by the governors and the visitation by one 
to whom the power of visitor had been delegated. In the case 
of St. Alban’s the change is complete. Here the school was to 
be visited annually by two learned men chosen once a year by 
the Mayor and Governors to visit the school and to examine 
the scholars in order that it might be discovered ‘‘how the 
scholars have profited in learning and how the schoolmaster 
hath done his duty in teaching them, and observed the Rules 
prescribed.’’!% 
While in Halsted the Governors of Christ Hospital were 
appointed visitors of the school at Halsted,’ yet the office of 
visitor seems to have been monopolized by the college and 
church. Thus at Bungay’ the Masters and Fellows of Emman- 
uel College, Cambridge, while at Bedford the ‘‘Wardens and 
Fellows of New College’’ were appointed visitors;'* at Berk- 
hampstead this office was held by the Warden of the College 
of All Souls, Oxford;!** while in New Port the Master of Cajus 
College, Cambridge, or his deputy, was made visitor by the 
will of the founder."** In Bunbury a preacher was to be visitor,’

while in Colchester that office was to be held by the Bishop of 
London,’ and in Yarm by the Archbishop of York.'** 
The powers and duties of visitors varied greatly. In Bunbury 
the preacher was to examine the school twice a year and to 
report to the governors anything which required to be amended.'7° 
In Colchester the Bishop was to cause the revenues of the pos- 
sessions to be employed in the maintenance and support of the 
school and master,’ as well as to supervise both school and 
masters.” In Thame’ and in Berkhamstead'* the visitor 
was to visit the school at least once in three years, and in the 
latter case he had power to dismiss the master and usher for not 
doing their duty and was to receive for his visitation 13s. 4d.17* 
In Newport the visitor was to ‘“‘set down such orders and rules 
as he thought convenient”!"* while in the case of Bedford the 
visitors had the power of appointment of master and usher” 
although it appears that the master and usher were actually 
appointed by the corporation.'”*. 
Such were some of the provisions for the supervision of the 
masters and ushers whose importance makes necessary a de- 
tailed study of the subject of the teaching staffs of the grammar 
schools in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.

  CHAPTER III 
THE TEACHING STAFF OF THE GRAMMAR SCHOOL 
The subject of the present chapter will be treated under the 
following topics: Size of Staff, Qualifications, Appointment, 
Term of Office, Removal, Stipend, and Duties and Conduct in 
Office. 
Size oF STAFF 
The teaching staff of the average English Grammar School 
in the reign of Queen Elizabeth was not a very large body; in 
many cases is consisted of but one person,’ a master, ‘‘peda- 
gogue’’ or ‘‘/udimagister;’’? but in not a few cases the staff 
consisted of two, the master, ‘‘ Hyghe Maister,’’* ‘‘Chief Schoole 
Maister,’’* or ‘‘Archididascalus,’’> and the usher, ‘‘under- 
master,’’ ‘‘submaster,’’ ‘‘Surmaister,’’* ‘‘Hypodidascalus,’”? 
or ‘‘Ostiarius,’’* while cases of staffs of three or more were very 
rare.® 
QUALIFICATIONS OF MASTER AND USHER 
For the sake of clearness of exposition it will be best to treat 
the qualifications o* ushers before those of masters. For reasons 
‘The master of the school at Rugby had the title of ‘‘Schoolmaster 
of Lawrence Sheriffe »f London, Grocer,’’ Staunton, The Great Public 
Schools of England, 351, and Rouse, History of Rugby, 35. 
? Terms commonly used in the Letters Patent of this period. 
‘Term used in the ‘‘tatutes of St. Paul’s School (cf. Carlisle, ii., 71), 
and of the Merchant Taylors’ School (cf. Carlisle, ii., 50). 
‘Term used by the 11aster at Wellingborough in 1597 in reference to 
himself (cf. Carlisle, ii.. 227).

The Great Public School. of England, 133). 
*Term used in the Statutes of St. Paul’s School. 
7™Term occurs in the Statutes of Westminster School. 
® Term used in the rules of the school at Manchester (cf. S. I. C., xvii., 
314). 
*St. Paul’s after 1602 had a staff of three, the office of ‘Under-Usher’ 
being substituted for that of Chaplain (cf. Staunton, The Great Public 
Schools of England, 187). Merchant ‘Taylors’ School was to have a staff 
of four, a High Master, a Chief Usher, and two Under Ushers (cf. Statutes, 
Carlisle, ii., 53). Shrewsbury had a staff of four (cf. Appendix L).

which will be noted later!? not much material concerning the 
qualifications of ushers is to be found and the qualifications 
given are generally rather indefinite. Thus in Rivington the 
usher was to be ‘‘a learned and honest man;’’! in Thame, 
“fan honest and discreet person, sufficiently enabled with 
learning;’’!? in Saint Bees, some poor scholar ‘‘that under- 
standeth his grammar and can write a reasonable hand;’"* 
while in Kirkby Stephen ‘‘one of the poorest borne in the 
parish,’’ ‘‘so that he be adorned with virtue and learning;’’'* 
in the case of Merchant Taylors’ School the chief usher was to 
be ‘‘some sober, discreet man, verteous in lyving, and well 
learned, some single or wedded man, or a priest that hath noe 
benefice with cure, office, nor service, that may lett his due 
diligence in the Schoole;’’® in Hexham the usher was to be 
“‘a sober discreet person,’’ ‘‘a professor of true religion,’”'* 
‘furnished both with Latin and Greek,’’" and ‘‘able to read 
lectures in the master’s absence;’’"* while in Aldenham he was 
to ‘‘be and continue a single man, of good life and conversation, 
able at least to teach the introduction to grammar and inferior 
Latin books for the first two forms’’ as well as to ‘‘ teach English 
books and fair writing and ciphering and casting of accounts.’’!® 
The information concerning the qualifications of masters is 
more complete. In our treatment of this phase of the topic we

shall proceed from the consideration of qualifications of secondary 
importance, such as those relating to place of birth, locality, 
age, marriage, and bodily condition, to the consideration of 
those of primary importance, such as moral, religious, and 
scholastic requirements. 
In two instances at least, the candidate was to have been 
born in certain counties: in St. Bees, ‘‘within the Counties of 
Cumberland, York, Westmorland, or Lancaster;’’?? in Kirkby 
Lonsdale, ‘‘in Westmorland, Yorkshire, or Lancashire;’’?! 
while in a third instance, that of Guisbrough, the master was to 
be ‘‘no Scot, or Stranger born.’’* In Shrewsbury the master 
was to be selected from among the burgesses, if one could be 
found fit for the post; if not, then a native of Shropshire was to 
be chosen; or in default thereof, ‘‘a sufficient man’’ born in 
any other county or shire, preference to be given persons educated 
in the school at Shrewsbury.” 
In the few instances in which we have information concerning 
the age requirement it is rather high. Thus in Hexham the 
master was to be at least 26 years of age,* in Thame from 26 
to 60, and in Cheltenham* and Witton” at least 30 years of 
age; in Witton he was to be at least of that age ‘‘to the end that 
experience may appear in his conversation and life and that 
more obedience may be used towards him for the same.’’* 
With respect to the question of marriage there is but little 
information. In St. Paul’s,?* Merchant Taylors’,s° Abingdon 
and St. Mary Overey, the master might be ‘‘a wedded man’’ or 
‘‘a single man.’’*? In Guisbrough the master was to be a priest, 
or, if such could not be obtained, ‘‘then a Layman, being un- 
married;’’ if he married after being admitted to his office, his

position was thereby forfeited.** Similarly in Manchester* and 
Witton the master was to be ‘‘unmarried.’’* 
But little is said concerning the physical qualifications required 
of candidates. In Oundle,** Merchant Taylors’,*? and St. Paul’s 
the master was to be ‘‘a man hoole in body,’’ * while in St. 
Mary Overey the expression used, ‘‘holy in body,’’ ** would 
lead one to suspect that even in these few cases the qualification 
was a moral or religious one rather than purely physical. 
Statements of moral qualifications are more frequent, although 
in most cases less specific than many of the qualifications thus 
far noted. Such phrases as the following indicate their general 
nature: ‘‘of good report,’’*® ‘‘well reported of,’’ ‘‘sober, 
discreet and undefamed,’’*? ‘‘a meet person,’’* ‘‘an honest 
and mete man,’’** ‘‘fit and honest,’’*® ‘‘an honest and discreet 
person,’’** ‘‘an honest person, sad and discreet,’’*’ ‘‘an honest, 
sadde and discreete man,’’** ‘‘honest and virtuous,’’** and 
‘honest in conditions and living.’’s° 
More specific than the moral qualifications just quoted are 
the statements of religious requirements of candidates. In 
Woodstock the master was to be ‘‘a good preacher of the word 
of God;’’* in Oundle, ‘‘meet for his learning and dexterity in 
teaching and right understanding of good and true religion set

to be ‘‘a zealous and sound professor of true religion’’ and 
‘‘a true abhorer of all papistry.’’* In some places the master 
was to be ‘‘a Priest in Orders at the time of his admission.’ ’* 
While such was the provision at Felsted,** Skipton, and Thame,® ‘ 
St. Alban’s** and Seven Oaks*? specified that the master should 
not be in Holy Orders. Other places like St. Mary Overey," 
Abingdon,” Manchester, and Merchant Taylor’s* and St. 
Paul’s** took a middle course by providing that the master 
might be a priest, but such a one as ‘‘hath no benefice with cure 
nor service, that may let his doing business in the School.’’* 
In Cheltenham both master and usher might be in orders,* 
while in the statutes of the schools at Oundle,** Sandwich,* 
and Witton,’ there are no specifications as to whether or not the 
master may be a clergyman. 
Among the statements of the scholastic qualifications there are 
not a few which possess the same general and vague character 
of the cases noted above. Their vagueness is illustrated by the 
following phrases in which they are couched: ‘‘a learned per- 
son;’’™ ‘‘honest and learned;’’ ‘‘an honest, discreete and

learned man;’’* ‘‘learned and cunning;’’* ‘‘sufficiently 
furnished and enabled with learning and discretion.’’* More 
specific, however, are the following characteristic qualifications: 
“‘learned in grammar and the Latin tongue;’’* ‘‘fit, able, and 
literate person, at least well instructed in Latin;’’” ‘‘sufficiently 
learned and expert in Grammar;’”* ‘‘sufficiently learned and 
exercised in Grammar;’’"® of ‘‘good understandinge in the 
Greeke and Latyne tongues;’’*® ‘‘well skilled in Latin and 
Greek;’’*' ‘‘well instructed and skilled in Latin and Greek

languages, and able to write well (if possible it may bee);’’* 
and ability to ‘‘make Greek and Latin verses’’ and to ‘‘read and 
interpret the Greek grammar and other Greek authors.’ 
From the above it would seem that the Greek requirement 
was not uncommon. Nevertheless there were still cases in which 
the proviso of Dean Colet’s statutes was included. Thus in the 
case of St. Mary Overey the master was to be ‘‘a man learned 
in good clean Latin literature, and also in Greek, if any may be 
got,’’*’ while in Dedham the master was to have sufficient

Not infrequently the scholastic requirements were stated in 
terms of years to be spent in residence at Cambridge or Oxford. 
Thus in Ringwood the master was to be chosen from ‘‘such as 
have been students in either of the Universities of Cambridge 
or Oxford;’’** in Halifax the master was to have been ‘‘a student 
in one of the Universities of this Realm of England the space of 
Five sears at the least’’ and such a student as ‘‘hath well profited 
in Learning.’’*? But more frequently this requirement appears 
stated in terms of academic degrees which were to have been 
received from one of the Universities. While in Newcastle 
under Lyme the master was to be a Bachelor of Arts of either 
Cambridge or Oxford," in not a few cases he was to hold the 
degree of Master of Arts. In the case of Thame the master 
was to be a Master of Arts, or a Bachelor of Arts of eight years 
standing in Oxford University,** while in the cases of Rugby

APPOINTMENT OF MAsTER AND USHER 
As in our discussion of the previous topic we shall treat the 
master and usher separately. 
Power to appoint the master was given (1) to the founder of 
the school during his life and to his heirs or some other person 
or persons after his death,” (2) to the governors of the school, 
(3) to colleges, (4) to the clergy, or (5) to royal or civil authori- 
ties. The first two classes will need but little discussion as they 
have been noted in previous chapters. 
While in Kirkby Stephen* and other places!** the master 
was to be appointed by the founder during his life, there are 
instances in which this appointive power was extended to rela- 
tives and heirs of the founder. Thus in Colne the master was to 
be appointed by two cousins of the founder and their heirs 
and assigns;!" at Hawkeshead the privilege was extended to the 
founder’s son;?* at Dronfield it was extended to the heir of the 
founder;!* in Ringwood the master was to be appointed by 
heirs or owners of estates of the founder;!% in Leeds the master 
was to be appointed by the heirs of the founder and by his 
feoffees,!* while in other places the right to appoint the master 
was to belong to the governors after the death of the founder.'* 
The second class (appointive power vested in governors) was 
probably the largest one. As the cases belonging to this class 
were merely cited in Chapter II., it remains to give some of the 
conditions by which the governors of a few of the schools were

* Non-incorporated governors, Cf. Appendix D. To the list there 
given might be added Abingdon (Deed, 1562. S. I. C., xi., 396) and 
Blackrod (Will of John Holmes, 1568. C. C. R., xix., 185), where the 
appointment was to be made by the trustees.

limited. In Witton the master was to be elected by the feoffces 
and ‘‘certain of the honest men of the parish,’’' while the 
feoffees of the school in Crewkerne were to take unto themselves 
“six of the most discreet men of the town of Crewkerne’’ 
they elected a master.!% In the cases of Monmouth,’ Gilling- 
ham," and Drayton' the master was to be elected with the 
advice and consent of the vicar of the parish church, In Guild- 
ford’? he was to be appointed by the governors with the advice 
and consent of the Bailiffs of the King’s Manor of Guildford ;3 
in Stanford he was elected by the governors with the advice and 
consent of the Master and College of St. John the Evangelist, 
Cambridge ;'* while in the case of Aldenham the Master and 
Fellows of Saint John’s College, Cambridge, were to nominate 
three persons from whom the governors were to select one who 
was not to be admitted to office until he had been examined 
““by some learned’’ man selected by the governors for that 
purpose, and until he was found ‘‘meet to govern both for his 
learning, piety, religion, belief, and dexterity in teaching.’’™® 
In Shrewsbury, while the formal appointment of the master 
was to be by the Bailiffs, the real right of selection was trans- 
ferred by Indenture, 1571, to St. John’s College, Cambridge,"* 
and hence the case really belongs under the third class in which 
the appointive power is vested in College authorities. 
Among the colleges vested with this appointive power St. 
John’s College, Cambridge, is most frequently found in our 
material, for besides being indirectly connected with the election 
of the master at Aldenham, and Stanford, it had the selection of when

the master at Shrewsbury,” Rivington,"* and Pocklington."* 
The only other Cambridge college possessing this power, which 
is contained in our material, was Emmanuel College, the Master 
Fellows, and Scholars of which were to have the nomination of 
the master of the school at Bungay."° Among the Oxford 
colleges which possessed a similar power were Queen’s College, 
whose Provost was to appoint the master of the school at St. 
Bees,'?! All Souls College, the Warden, or Sub-Warden, and Six 
Senior Fellows of which were to hold the nomination of the 
master of the school at Faversham,’ Corpus Christi College 
which had the nomination of the master and usher of the school 
at Cheltenham, and the College of Blessed Mary and All 
Saints Lincoln, the Rector and Scholars of which were to nomi- 
nate two persons for the vacancy, whenever such occurred at 
Sandwich, one of whom the governors were to elect as master.'** 
While the clergy as advisers* and as members of governing 
bodies! were indirectly concerned with the appointment of 
masters, there are a few instances in which they had the direct 
appointive power. Thus in the case of Tenderden the master 
was chosen by the vicar of the parish;!” in that of Lowestoft he 
was to be chosen by the chancellor of the diocese of Norwich’ 
in that of Barnestaple he was to be appointed by Bishop of 
Exeter;* in that of Heighington he was to be elected by the

Dean and Chapter of Durham;'° while in those of Croydon™ 
and Rochdale’? he was to be chosen by the Archbishop of 
Canterbury. Still less numerous are the instances to be classed 
under the fifth class, in which the appointive power was vested 
in royal or civil authority. In Pontefract!** the master was 
to be chosen by the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, while 
in Berkhamsted the power to appoint the master was vested 
in the Crown by an act of Parliament.° 
Before proceeding to the consideration of some of the provi- 
sions made to insure the election of masters let us note a few 
cases which do not belong to any of the classes just described. 
The first is that of Eye where the master was to be elected by 
the ‘‘feoffees of the town lands and the more substantial inha- 
bitants of the borough;’’"' the second is that of Sudbury where 
““since 36 Henry VIII., the masters have been chosen by the 
owners of the impropriate rectory, rectorial tithes, etc. of St. 
Gregory;’’'? the third is that of Burford where according to 
the founder’s statutes the master was to be elected by ‘‘three 
voices,’’ ‘‘the first by the donors of any lands or annuities for 
the maintenance of the school during their lives,’’ ‘‘the second 
by the alderman and steward for the time being’’ and ‘‘ the third 
by the bailiffs;’’* while the fourth case is that of Wellingborough 
where the master and usher were to be chosen ‘‘by the most 
part of the Inhabitants of the Town of Wellingborough that 
were assessed to Subsidy last before the same choice.’’™ 
In not a few places precautions were taken to insure the actual 
appointment of the master within a specified time, which varied 
from twenty days to six months, by providing a second authority 
by whom the master was to be appointed in case of the failure of 
the first to appoint within the specified time. The following table 
gives the information contained in our material upon this subject.

In a few of these places additional precautions were taken to 
insure the actual appointment of the master. Thus in Hems- 
worth, if the Dean and Chapter of the Cathedral Church in York 
failed to appoint the master within twenty days after they 
received notice of the vacancy, the householders of the Parish 
or ‘‘so many of them as should repair to the church when so 
warned by the Parson, Vicar or Curate, or by two honest persons 
of the Parish’’ were to ‘‘nominate Nine honest Householders, 
who with the Archdeacon, Parson, or Curate’’ were for that 
time to have ‘‘the grant of the office to such person as should 
be apte and able thcreunto;’’*° in Hawkeshead, if the Bishop 
of the Diocese failed to appoint within thirty days, the appoint- 
ment was to be made by the Dean and Chapter of Chester;' 
while in Felsted, if the nomination were not made by the Bishop 
of London, the appointment was to return to the heirs of the 
founder.'” 
After the master was appointed he was not admitted into 
office until he had been examined and ‘‘allowed’’ by the Bishop 
of the Diocese. This was in accordance with the Crown's 
Injunctions of 1559, the one referring to this matter reading, 
“XL. Item, that no man shall take upon him to teach but 
such as shall be allowed by the ordinary and found meet as well 
for his learning and dexterity in teaching as for sober and 
honest conversation, and also for right understanding of God's 
true religion.’’"* This injunction was made a law in 1581, 
when the following act was passed: 
‘VI. And be it further enacted, That if any Person or 
Persons, Body Politick or Corporate, after the Feast of Pentecost 
next coming shall keep or maintain any Schoolmaster which 
shall not repair to Church as is aforesaid,'* or be allowed by the 
Bishop or Ordinary of the Diocese where such Schoolmaster 
shall be so kept, shall forfeit and lose for every Month so keeping 
him, Ten Pounds.

‘And such Schoolmaster or Teacher, presuming to teach 
contrary to this Act, and being thereof lawfully convicted, shall 
be disabled to be a Teacher of Youth and shall suffer Imprison- 
ment without Bail or Mainprise for one Year.’’!* 
It is very apparent that the rigid enforcement of this law 
would mean that the appointment of all the masters in the 
realm was virtually in the hands of the Church for the Bishop 
or Ordinary of the Diocese by refusing to grant a license’ to 
the candidate selected by the proper authorities could thereby 
thwart their desires,’ for the license was necessary and could 
be granted by no other bishop than the one who presided over 
the diocese in which the school was located.'** Efforts were 
made by the government to enforce the law through the agency 
of the church. Shortly before its passage the Council addressed 
a letter to Archbishop Grindle requesting him to cause ‘‘all 
such schoolmasters as have charge of children, to be by the 
15 Statutes, (Jan. 16, 1581). Anno 23°, Eliz. C. 1. 
16 For specimen licenses see Appendix I. 
1% This power of the bishop is illustrated in the case of Harrison, 
Schoolmaster at Aylesham in 1573, the details of whose experience are 
given by Strype in his Life of Parker, Vol. II., 335-37. In 1573 the 
mastership of the free school at Aylesham became vacant. Of the three 
men who applied for the position, Mr. Harrison, M. A., Cambridge, 
appeared to be best qualified and was highly recommended by the Mayor 
and Aldermen of Norwich. Rumors of Harrison’s lack of complete con- 
formity, however, had reached Archbishop Parker, who wrote and urged 
the Bishop of Norwich not to admit Harrison, who was finally admitted 
upon condition that he would keep and execute the statutes of the school, 
in reading the authors there appointed (it had been asserted that he had 
condemned the reading of profane authors to children), that he would 
quarrel neither with his Pastor nor with his neighbors, that he would hold 
no ‘‘strange opinions’’ nor defend them obstinately in prophesying, or 
any other conference, and that ‘‘he should use no unlawful games, neither 
vain nor disordered company.’’ Harrison’s term of office was not long. 
While acting as godfather to an infant about to be baptised he requested 
the Deacon ‘‘to change the word of the bok, viz., thou into you; and to 
leave out the sign of the cross: as for Dost thou forsake, he would have had 
him to say, Do you forsake; for Dost thou believe, Do you believe; and when 
it was asked, Wilt thow be baptized in this faith? it was answered, We 
do bring this child to be baptized into the faith of Christ.’’ Such signs 
of non-conformity could not be tolerated in a schoolmaster and the Bishop 
declared his position forfeited, and appointed or admitted a Mr. Sutton 
whose candidacy had been supported by Archbishop Parker.

Bishop of the diocese, or such as he shall appoint, examined 
touching their religion’’"* and giving him power to have such 
as were found ‘‘corrupt and unworthy’’ displaced and to have 
“‘fit and sound persous placed in their rooms.’’ But neither 
in this letter nor in the articles of visitation issued by Arch- 
bishop Grindle upon receipt of the letter from the Council,’” 
is there any references to the subject of licenses. But in the 
direct ons for inquiry in his diocese in 1581 after the passage of 
the act requiring the teachers to be licensed by the bishop of 
the diocese, Archbishop Grindle ordered the authorities to ‘‘in- 
quire whether any schoolmaster of suspected religion or that 
is not licensed to teach by the bishop or ordinary doth teach 
in any public or private place within the diocese.’ Similar 
articles were included in Archbishop Whitgift’s Articles of 
Visitation of the diocese of Chichester in 1585 and of the diocese 
of Sarum in 1588.17? 
While the government thus worked through the agency of the 
Church it also in a few cases came in contact directly with the 
school through the granting of Letters Patent. Thus in the 
Letters Patent issued to the school at Halifax in 1585 it was 
provided that when the governors had appointed the master, 
they were to present him to the Archbishop of York, ‘‘Seda 
Archiepiscopali plena,’’ or, ‘‘eadem Sede vacante,’’ to the Dean 
of the Cathedral Church of York, who was to certify as to the 
fitness of the candidate.’" A similar provision was made in 
the Letters Patent of the school at Ipswich in 1565 where the 
governors were given power to ‘‘present any fit person to 
undertake the office of headmaster to the Bishop of Norwick: 
for the time being to be examined by said ordinary.’’"* Our 
material contains two instances of the execution of this pro- 
vision. In 1580 it was ordered that a certain Mr. John Smith'’*

ohn Burtley, M. A., was ordered to be presented to the Bishop 
of Norwich ‘‘for enjoying of the Mastership of the Grammar 
School of this Towne.’’ 1” 
Some of the deeds and statutes also contain references to the 
subject of licenses. Thus in Daventry'® and Cheltenham'’® the 
candidate was to be presented to the bishop or ordinary of the 
diocese for examination. In the case of Witton the candidate 
was to be examined by the Bishop of Chester and by the master 
of the King’s Grammar School of Chester, ‘‘as well for discretion 
as for learning.’’*° At Hawkeshead the appointment of the 
master was to be with ‘‘ the assent of the Bishoppe of Cheister’’1** 
and the master was to be ‘‘allowed by the Ordinarie of the 
place for the time being, according to the Statute in that case 
your honour peradventure, as he is to me by long acquayntance and 
co’tinuance, to signifie therefore to your Lordshyp not only upon privat

provided.’’'* In Sandwich before the master was admitted 
he was ‘‘to be first allowed by the ordynaire and by examyna- 
cion fownd meete bothe for his learnynge and discreacion of 
teachynge as also for his honest conversacion and righte under- 
standynge of Godes trewe religion nowe sett forth by publique 
awethoritic ;’’'** while in the case of Chesterfield'* it is expressly 
stated in the Will of the Founder of the School that the master 
must be examined and approved by the Archbishop of York.'** 
In a few cases more of the details of election, appointment, 
and admission to office are given. In Sandwich a special 
arrangement was made between the governors of the grammar 
school and the Rector and Scholars of the College of Blessed 
Mary and All Saints Lincoln, Oxford, concerning the appoint- 
ment of master after the death of the founder;'** by this arrange- 
ment within twenty days after the office of master became 
vacant notice was to be given at the College House to the said 
Rector and Scholars, who within the next twenty days were 
to deliver in writing and under their common seal to the Mayor 
of Sandwich, or to the usher at the schoolhouse, the names of 
two duly qualified persons, fellows of the said college. 
In the case of Thame, as soon as a vacancy occurred, the 
usher was to notify the Warden and Nine Senior Fellows of 
New College who were to send the names of two properly qualified 
persons to the founder or his heirs by whom one of the names 
must be chosen within four days. Within two days after his 
election the master was to read either in the chapel or some other 
part of the College the statute, ‘‘ De Officio Paedagogi’’ and must 
promise to fulfil to the best of his ability the office of master. 
As a pledge that he would fulfill his duty he was compelled to 
give a bond of £20, which was to be forfeited by him should he 
receive three warnings supinae negligentiae, and should he after

| the fourth warning refuse to pay the money, the office was to be 
declared vacant, but otherwise the office was to be perpetual." 
In Hexham there was to be a meeting of the Governors on 
the Sunday following the vacancy. The records are not clear 
as to whether the election of a new master was to take place at. 
this meeting or the matter merely discussed. But however that 
might be the usher was to keep a record of the election. An 
instrument of presentation was to be issued to the master elect 
who was to present himself to the Archbishop of York, or, 
sede vacante, to the Dean of the Cathedral Church of York, for 
“‘approbation.’’ If approved, he was to subscribe to the articles 
of religion and to take the oath of supremacy. The Archbishop 
or the Dean was then to issue a certificate which he presented 
to the governors, who administered the oath prescribed by the 
statutes and then admitted him to the office of master.'** 
he ceremonies of admission varied. In Ashborne it would 
seem from the Letters Patent of 1585 that there were to be no 
such ceremonies.'*° In Wakefield they appear to have con- 
sisted of an oath taken by the master in the presence of the 
assembled governors before entering upon the duties of his 
office that he would be faithful to those duties.1*% In St. Albans 
the master before being admitted to take, before the Mayor 
and the major part of the Burgesses, ‘‘the Oath mentioned in 
the Statutes anno Primo of the Queen’s Majestie according 
as by the Statute of anno Quinto of her reign all Schoolmasters 
be appointed.’’*? The ceremonies in the cases of St. Paul’s 
ne the Merchant Taylors’ were to be very similar. The 
Statute concerned with this subject in the Statutes of St. Paul 
is quoted here in the text and that of Merchant Taylors’ in the 
accompanying footnote for the purpose of showing the similarity 
between the two.'%

In Witton the new schoolmaster was to be escorted to the 
schoolhouse by the master of the King’s Grammar school of 
Chester, by the Feoffees of the School, and by ‘‘certain honest 
men of the Parish’’ amongst whom 4os. were to be distributed 
for their trouble at each “‘placing.’” The master was to be 
ver his lodgings, lands, houses, tenements, etc., the con-

Laws, and Statutes were to be-read to him in order that he 
might understand ‘‘his charge and what is required at his

on Kirkby Stephen the master was to meet in the parish 
church at least two of the Governors, the heir or heirs of the 
founder, the Churchwardens, and twelve men of the parish, 
in the presence of whom he was to take the following oath: 
““I do swear by the contents of this book, that I shall freely 
without exacting any money, diligently instruct and teach the 
children of this parish, and all others that shall resort to me, 
in Grammar and other humane doctrine, according to the

| Similar to the above oath was that to be taken by every 
schoolmaster of East Retford, who before his admission was to 
be sworn upon the Holy Bible before the Archbishop of York, 
or ‘‘his lawful Deputy or Deputies,’’ and was to recite the 
following oath: 
“I, A. B., being elected and named as Master of the King’s

The master was then to be put in possession of his office by 
at least six of the Bailiffs and Burgesses, governors of the school, 
who were to deliver the hesp of the School-house into his hand 
and to say: 
“‘Sir, Ye are chosen to be School-master of this School, to 
teach Scholars hither resorting, not only Grammar and other 
virtuous doctrine but also good Manners, according to the 
intent of the most excellent and virtuous Prince King Edward 
the Sixth, Founder of the same—

Before proceeding to the discussion of the next topic of the 
chapter, the Term of office of Master and Usher, let us note 
briefly the data. concerning the Appointment and Admission of 
Usher. 
While in a large number of cases the power to appoint the 
usher was vested in the governors of the school,!*® yet in not a 
few instances the master was directly or indirectly concerned 
with the appointment of usher. Thus in Ipswich the power 
to appoint the usher was vested in the governors who, however, 
were to ‘‘appoint such a man as the master should think fit’’ 
for the office.7°° In Pontefract the usher was to be appointed

additional data concerning the appointment of usher in Ipswich: On Dec. 
5, 1577, it was ordered ‘‘that Joseph, mr Dawes sonne, shall continue 
Usher of the Schoole until Annunc: next (Mar. 25), and that the Bayliffs 
and such as they shall call to them shall allow him to continue still in

by the governors, ‘‘the mayor and brethren,’’ with the advice 
of the master,’" and in Wakefield by the governors with the 
““help and assistance’’ of the master,” while similarly in Hali- 
fax the usher was to be elected by the governors, the city corpora- 
tion, provided they took unto themselves the master ‘‘to judge 
of the sufficiency in learning and aptness in the function of the 
said Usher.” In Hawkeshead the usher was to be chosen by the 
“‘Schole-master and the gounors of the said schole or the most 
pte of them;’’?** in Oundle? and Seven Oaks he was to be 
chosen by the master subject to the approval of the governors;?%* 
in Hexham he was to be chosen by the master and ‘‘allowed’’ 
by the governors;?” in Sandwich he was to be appointed and 
elected by the master and admitted by the governors ‘‘not 
knowing sufficient cause to refuse him,’’ ?** while in Kirkby

316. On April 14, Joseph Dawes resigned and it was ordered that the 
bayliffs and portmen, with the consent of Mr. Dawes, the schoolmaster, 
“‘shall elect another in his roome.’’—Ibid., 323. In 1582 a newly selected 
usher was to be examined by a committee consisting of the rector, the 
school-master, and an ex-schoolmaster, by which he was to be ‘‘approved 
for his learning and religion.’’—Ibid., 331.

Concerning the time within which appointments of ushers 
were to be made, the statutes and letters patent generally make 
no specifications. In Halifax, however, this time was fixed at 
one month,” while in Rivington within the same time the usher 
was to be nominated by the governors and presented to the 
Bishop of Durham or Chester for examination.?"* 
While the information concerning the formal admission of 
ushers is meagre, it is not uninteresting. The ceremony at East 
Retford.and Wakefield?!* was the same for master and usher,??° 
while those of St. Paul’s and Merchant Taylors’ resemble very 
much the formalities accompanying the admission of the master 
as will be seen from the following quotations from the statutes 
of St. Paul’s.” 
‘‘This Surmaister the Hygh Maister shall chose as often as 
the rome shall be voyde, and when the Hygh Maister hath 
the appointment was practically left to the master, it probably was not 
thought necessary to state the qualifications inasmuch as the master 
would be expected to choose such a man as was qualified to perform 
the duties peculiar to his school.

21 The following is the text of the corresponding sections of the Statutes 
of the Merchant Taylors’ School :— 
‘And when The High Maister hath appointed him upon one, The 
High Maister shall call to the Schoole the Surveyors of the Schoole, and 
before them he shall say to the Ussher on this wise: 
‘* ‘Sir, before these my Maisters here, The Surveyors of the Schoole, I 
' shew unto you that I have chosen you to be the Chief Ussher or Under 
Maister of this Schoole, and to teach allwaies, from tyme to tyme, as I 
shall appoint you, and supply my roome in my absence when it shall be 
graunted me by my Maisters, the said Maisters and Wardens, and also at 
all such tymes as I shall be sick of any curable disease.” 
‘*Then the said Maister and Wardens shall exhort the Ussher dilligently 
to doe his duty, and shall say unto him on this wise: 
“**Your roome is no perpetuity, but, according to your labor and 
diligence, you shall contynue: otherwise, fownd not doing your duty 
accordingly, and reasonably warned of us, ye shall departe. 
“* *Yf it shalbe so that at any tyme you will departe of yourowne mynd, 
yee shall give us one yere’s warning before your departure.’ ’” 
The next clause is quoted verbatim. The following clause deals with a 
similar provision concerning approval of the election and the assignment 
of lodgings. Cf. Carlisle, ii., 52.
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 English Grammar Schools in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. 
appointed him upon one, he shall call to the Scole the Surveyors 
of this Scole, and before them he shail say to the Surmaister 
on this wise:— 
‘“ “Sir, before these my Maisters here, the Surveyors, of this 
Scole, I shew unto vou that I have chosen you to be Under 
Maister of this Scole, and to teach always from tyme to tyme as 
I shall appoint you and supply my rome in my absence when 
it shall be granted me by my Maisters, the Mercers, Wardens, 
and Surveyors, and for such more labor in my absence I shall 
somewhat so to you as my Maisters here shall think best.’ 
‘““Thanne the Surveyors shall exorte the Surmaister diligently 
to do his dewtie and shall say to him on this wyse: ‘Your rome 
is no perpetuitie, but according to your labor and diligence 
ye shall continue, otherwise found not according and reasonable 
warned of us, ye shall departe. Yfit shall be so that at any tyme 
ye will departe of your owne mynde, ye shall give us half a year 
warninge. If any controversy be betwixt you and the Hyghe 
Maister, ye shall stand at our direccion in every thinge.’ 
““Yf he will promise this, thenne let The Mercers approve the 
election of the Surmaister, and assigne him his lodgings in 
The Old Chaunge.’’??? 
The ceremonies accompanying the admission of the usher of 
the school at Thame also resembled those of the master in the 
same place. The Sunday after his election, in the presence of 
the Churchwardens and of at least four ‘‘graviores incolae’’ 
of the parish, the usher was to read in English, in the parish 
church, the statutes concerning the duty of the master and 
usher and to promise according to a set form of words to observe 
the rules of the school.?* 
The terms for which the master and the usher were elected 
varied greatly. In the cases of St. Paul’s and Merchant Taylors’ 
they were appointed for one year with the understanding that if 
they were giving satisfaction they would be continued in office.?* 
A similar provision with respect to the master seems to have 
existed in Burford.* In Kirkby Stephen the following statute 
“Cj, Carlisle, i 7a? 
3% Statutes, 1574. S. I. C., xii., 266. The usher gave bond for for 
which was to be forwarded by the master to the warden of New College 
within one month after election of usher under penalty of ten ‘‘solide.’’

ecclesiastical restraint or correction ;’??"* in Felsted the master 
and usher were not to be ‘drunkards, whorchunters, or lewd in 
living ;’’ *° in Oundle neither master nor usher was to be ‘a 
common gamestcr, hauntcr of taverns, neither to exceed in 
apparel nor in other ways to be an infamy to the school or give 
evil example to the scholars,’’ but cach was to be ‘‘in all points’’ 
such as ‘‘to show himself an example of honest, continent, and 
Godly behaviour;’’ *! while in Witton the master was not to be 
“*dissolute in manners, a drunkard,’’ ‘‘a whoremonger,’’ 
or ‘‘entangled with any other occupation repugnant to his vo- 
cation,’’ nor was he to be ‘‘a dicer or a common gamester.’?# 
Another ground for discharge was prolonged absence from 
school. Thus in Saint Bees the master was to forfeit his office 
for being absent fourteen days together, or one month at several 
times, above the twenty days allowed him by the statutes of the 
school;* in Felsted the same penalty was inflicted for absence 
of eighty days in one quarter of the year; while in Crediton 
and St. Mary of Ottery the master was to be removed for 
absence of one month.” 
There seems to be a disposition to give the master and usher 
a fair trial. In the first place there is an effort to make sure of 
the guilt of the accused before passing sentence upon him. In 
Louth the complaint was to be made to the Bishop of Lincoln 
who was to ‘‘interpose his censure,’’ and, if the offense demanded 
it, was to deprive the master or usher of office;** similarly in 
Kirkby Stephen, ‘‘ vices and offenses’’ charged against the master 
were to be ‘‘redressed by the Bishop or ordinary of the Diocese 
of Carlisle according to ecclesiastical order or common law,”’ 
and if found guilty the master was then to be ‘‘expelled out of SoaigG

  in Sandwich it was necessary 
for the master to be ‘‘ sufficiently convicted.’ "** while in Seven 
Oaks the master was not to be dismissed ** without urgent cause 
proved and allowed by the majority of governors.’"* In 
Alford the governors were not to put away anv schoolmaster 
until he had been condemned by two magistrates one of whom 
he was to be allowed to choose.* 
In the second place, there are not a few cases in which it was 
prescribed that attempts were to be made to help the master 
reform. In cases of misdemeanor in Hawkeshead. the master 
was to have three warnings from the governors to leave and 
“‘amende the said faulte and offence;’’ these warnings, or 
“‘monycons.’" were to be made ‘‘openlie before the Stipendiarie 
Mynister of Hawkeshead Churche and some other honeste 
psons of the pyshe;’’ between the warnings a month, and no more, 
was to elapse; if the master ‘mended his ways,’’ he was to 
‘“‘Concynewe his place and office of Scholemastership.’’ ** 
In Sandwich the offending master or usher was to be twice 
‘‘gently warned and admonished"’ by the Founder, and after 
his death by the governors of the school; if, after having been 
twice ‘‘solemplie admonished by the governors. or the greater 
parte of them,’’ he did not amend and ‘‘diligentlie followe 
his office and charge of the school,’’ he was to be ‘‘utterlie 
expulsed and amoved,’’ and another was to be ‘‘received in 
his rome’’. * In East Retford there were to be ‘‘three several 
monitions’’ by at least six of the Bailiffs and Burgesses at

intervals of fifteen days,** while in Kirkby Stephen the master 
was to have two warnings within twenty days, and if he did not 
reform, he was to be displaced." 
Whether or not the master and usher received warning prob- 
ably depended upon the character of the offense. Thus, in 
Hawkeshead the master was to be discharged immediately 
for ‘‘goinge aboute, atteptinge, pcuringe, will assentinge, or 
agreeinge to doe or comytt anie hersie, treason, murder, or 
fellonie;’’ he was to be discharged for being ‘‘a common drunk- 
ard,’’ ‘‘remysse or necligent in teachinge the said schollers,’’ 
for ‘‘havinge or usinge anie ill or notable vice, cryme, offence, or 
condition,’’ or for having ‘‘anie suche grevous dysease or infir- 
mitie rendering him unable or unmeet to teach.’’*** In Dedham 
the master ‘‘on just occasion’’ was to receive a quarter’s 
warning, but was to be discharged immediately without warning 
for any very ‘‘heinous or notorious offense.’’** In Wakefield 
the master and usher were to receive a ‘‘quarter’s notice,’’ 7*° 
while in Eye,? Seven Oaks,” and Witton** the time was 
extended to six months. In Southampton the schoolmaster 
chosen in 1583 was employed with the understanding that he 
might be dismissed at a year’s notice if the mayor and brethren 
should see fit; in March of 1593 the schoolmaster was called 
before the mayor and warned to ‘‘provide otherwise for himself 
by the middle of summer next” ;?* in 1601 the time of warning 
was reduced to six months.?** 
While provision was thus made for the welfare of the master, 
that of the school was not neglected, for in many places the

master was to give similar warning when he intended to leave. 
Thus in Southampton he was not ‘‘to quit under a vear’'s 
notice.’’ 7° In Seven Oaks, whenever the master was not. 
minded to ‘‘continue in the same school,’’ he was to give six 
month’s warning to the governors.*” In Dedham the master 
gave a bond of £20 not to leave without the consent of the 
governors or without giving the required three months’ warn- 
ing.” In Witton the master was to give ‘‘open warning’’ in 
the Church on some Sunday or Festival day six months before 
his departure; did he fail to do this, he was to forfeit 4os. of his 
salary to the feoffees who were to give this amount to forty poor 
people of the parish.*** In East Retford the master was to give 
notice of his intention to leave ‘‘ openly in the said parish church’’ 
at least six months before his departure, and in the time imme- 
diately following this announcement he was to do ‘‘his duty 
diligently in his office or else to lose so much of his salary as he 
aught to have for the said six months.’’?7° 
StipENDS Paip TO MASTER AND USHER. 
As it has already been noted that the stipends of the master 
and usher were generally paid by the governors?’ of the school 
from the rents and revenues of the land and possessions held 
in trust by them,?” from tythes appropriated to the use of the 
school,?”? from royal revenues vested upon the school by the 
Crown,?* or from the common stock of the town corporation,?* 
oniy a few somewhat peculiar cases need be cited before pro- 
ceeding to a discussion of method of payment of stipends. The 
first of these cases is that of Aylesham where the master was to 
be paid by the corporation of Norwich,?* which together with

the Cathedral Corporation of Norwich supported a grammar 
school in its own city.77 A somewhat similar arrangement 
between the town and cathedral corporations existed at Lincoln 
except, as has been noted before, the cathedral corporation 
participated in the government of the school.” As a rule, 
however, the cathedrals maintained grammar schools at the 
expense of the cathedral corporation. Quite different from 
these cases is that of Knutsford where the schoolmaster was 
to be paid by the heirs or assigns of Sir John Leigh who had been 
granted certain lands by Edward VI. upon condition that he, 
his heirs and their assigns would find and support a school- 
master in Knutsford,?”* while in Bowdon a similar condition 
was attached by Edward Janny to his lands when he devised 
them to his ‘‘kynsmen’’ in 1553.78? 
There seem to have been three methods of paying the stipends 
of the master and usher. In the cases where the stipends were 
paid by the Crown the customary method seems to have been 
that of annual payment”! while in the other cases the payment 
seems to have been made either semi-annually or quarterly, 
upon certain feast days. Thus, in Hawkeshead*® and Coventry” 
the master was to be paid ‘‘in two even portions at the Feast of 
the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary and at the Feast 
of St. Michael the Archangel; in East Retford the days were 
the last day of May and November,** and in Kirkby Stephen 
at the Feasts of Pentecost and St. Martin,?** in St. Albans?#*

as well as in St Bees?" the master was to be paid ‘‘at the Feasts

the Annunciation of Our Lady, and Midsummer,’’ while in 
Hartlebury** payment was made upon the same feast days,

the Baptist, ”2%* 
Thus far attention has been called to the sources from which 
the stipends were raised, to the channels through which they 
were paid, and to the dates of payment; there remain to be 
considered the amounts of the stipends and their various sup- 
plements. Much of the data concerning the former of these 
topics is contained in Appendix L and is summarized in the 
following tables:

While the 79 cases contained in the above table are not suffi-

nevertheless suggestive and worthy of study. The most common 
salaries appear to be in order, £10, £13 (to be more exact £13 
6s. 8d. or 20 marks), and £20. The average of the 79 cases is a

trifle over £16} which compares favorably with the average 
pay of the Schoolmaster before the Reformation which is given 
by Leach as £6 9s. 6d. ;?** but as such a comparison gives undue 
weight to the rather exceptional cases at 4o and 50, a more just 
basis of comparison would be between the medians. This in the 
cases under study is £15, and while Leach does not give the 
median of the cases studied by him, still the comparison of the 
median of the one with the average of the other reveals the fact 
that there was a decided increase in the stipends paid the school- 
masters after the Reformation, a fact that is seen very clearly 
when one notes that while before the Reformation £12 was the 
annual stipend of the headmasters of ‘‘the larger grammar 
schools,’’?* almost 76% of the masters included in our 79 
cases received more than that amount. Indeed, the median 
of all our cases does not compare so very unfavorably with that 
of cases of the salaries of the headmasters of the 10 Cathedral 
Grammar Schools established by Henry VIII.,? both being 
£15. It is also interesting to note that if one canon had been 
taken from each of the ten Cathedral Churches established by 
Henry VIII.,? the average of their stipends would have been 
but £23, while the average of the stipends of the highest ten 
masters would have been £30. Not less interesting is it to note 
that in Plymouth (and in 24 other instances)’* the master of 
the Grammar School received £20, the same amount that the 
Mayor of the Corporation received as his yearly fee.*** But 
probably one of the best ways of getting the situation clearly 
before our minds is to note that 80% of the masters under 
consideration received stipends varying from ten to twenty 
pounds, stipends which in America at the present time would 
be equivalent to from $500 to $1,000.7%

Taking the median to Tepresent the tendency we discover that in the 30 cases in which the salary of both master and usher is given the median of difference lies between ten and eleven pounds; or looking at the matter more from the point of view of the group we discover that in 73° of the cases in which data are given the stipend of the usher is from eight to thirteen pounds less than that of his headmaster.

English Grammar Schools in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth. 89 
Just as in the distribution of the stipends of the masters 
there were three distinct modes increasing in amount, so here 
the most common stipends appear to have been £5, £7 (really 
£6 13s. 4d. or 20 nobles), and £10. While the average, which 
in this instance is nearly £9, is £6 less than the median of the 
stipends of the master, it is over £2 greater than the average 
pay of the Schoolmaster before the Reformation. We can safely 
say that the majority of the ushers concerning which we have 
data were much better paid than either the master of many a 
small grammar school before the Reformation whose salary 
barely reached £5, or the ordinary Chantry priest whose salary 
was generally under £5?* since fully 83% of the ushers received 
that amount or more.?* Fully 63% of these ushers received 
stipends varying from £5 to £10, amounts in our time equivalent 
to from $250 to $500.3°° 
In the consideration of the subject of the remuneration of 
master and usher it should be noted that in not a few cases the 
master and usher were not burdened with the payment of house- 
rent,*" since their dwellings were furnished them free of expense 
by the school authorities. Sometimes the ‘‘dwelling’’ consisted 
of but one room. Thus in West Lavington the master was to 
have one of the eight rooms of the school-house,?” and in Drayton 
table No. 1. The case of Hexham (cf. Appendix L) accounts for the 
fact that there are 31 cases given in table No. 3 and only 30 in No. 2. 
298 Leach, English Schools at the Reformation, p. 93. The salary of 
the master at Knutsford, £5 6s. 8d., resembled the salaries paid before 
the Reformation not only in size but also in method and source. Cf. 
Appendix L, and p. 84. 
209 For the purpose of further comparison it might be well to note that 
the median or average of the cases under study is the same as that of the 
salaries prescribed for the ushers in the Cathedral Grammar Schools 
established by Henry VIII. Cf. Appendix U. 
300 While the data of Appendix L cannot be used to give the average 
annual amount expended for instruction in the 76 schools which furnish 
the ‘‘cases’’ of our tables—Shrewsbury furnishing three of the ‘‘cases’’ of 
table No. 1.—yet these data indicate that in some years of this reign the 
expenditures for instruction must have reached £1,496 11s. tod. This 
compares very favorably with the £1,677 5s. o}d. given by Leach, loc. 
cit., as the income of the 259 schools before the Reformation. 
$01 There were cases, however, in which no house was provided for the 
master, as for example, in Boston, where no residence for the master 
was provided until 1837.—Pishey Thompson, History of Boston, 284.

the usher was to have a room in the school-house.** In some 
cases there is evidence that the staff had lodgings in the school- 
house or that the master’s house was used as a school-house. 
Thus in Drayton’ and in Barton under Needwood*"® the master 
and usher had lodgings in the school-house; while in Tamworth 
the dwelling of the master was to serve also for the school.*” 
In Tiverton the master was to have a house, while the usher 
was to content himself with one of its rooms.*% In some cases, 
however, the use of the school-house as a residence for the 
family of the master was definitely forbidden, as in Thame.?% 
These houses were obtained in various ways, In some instances 
they were gifts. Thus in Burton Latimer the master’s house 
was a gift of Wm. Vaux Lord Harrowden and George, his son;3°* 
while in Northampton the master lived in the Vicarage House 
granted by Cardinal Pole to the Corporation as a residence for the 
master.*!° In other cases they were built at the expense of the 
Corporation as in Leicester* and in Huntingdon.** 
More pretentious than those just quoted are the following 
provisions: In Bunbury the master was to have house, orchard, 
garden and croft, the usher, a cottage and land seven by four 
rods,* the value of the former being £3 per annum, of the 
latter, £1 10s.;3 in Rugby the master was to have ‘‘the said 
manyson house with appurten’ce;’’ ** in Hartlebury he was to

master in 1569 besides his salary received £6 13s. 4d. for reading 
a divinity lecture once a week.** But probably most common 
as well as important sources of augmentation of the salaries 
of master and usher were the various fees which fell due to them. 
Without doubt the most common of the fees thus granted 
to the staff were the admission or entrance fees, which varied 
in value from one to twelve pence.*** The grounds for the pay- 
ment of these fees are variously stated. Thus in St. Paul’s 
the child was to pay at his admission ‘‘4d. for wrytinge of his 
name,’’ *” while in the Merchant Taylors’ the fee was rad. ‘‘for 
writing in of his name’’ ** and in the school at Ringwood the 
same amount ‘‘for entering name in book.’’ ** In Lowestoft 
the fee was for ‘‘the nomination and appointment’’ of the 
scholar.¥* In several places there was a difference between 
the fees granted to master and to usher. A reduction from 
rad. to 4d. was made for the ‘‘poorer sort’’ in Bunbury™! and 
for children of inhabitants of the town in Burford,’ while in 
Shrewsbury there existed a system of entrance fees graduated 
according to the rank and place of birth of pupils.™* 
While it is probable that the entrance fees generally went to 
augment the stipends of the staff, yet there are instances in 
which those fees were appropriated for specific purposes. Thus 
in St. Paul’s ‘‘this money of the admissions’’ was to be given 
to ‘‘the poor Scoler that swepeth the Scole and kepeth the seats 
cleane,’’** while in the Merchant Taylors’ it was to be ‘‘given 
to such one, as shalbe appointed by the said High Maister and 
the Surveyors to sweepe the Schoole, and keepe the Court of 
the Schoole cleane, and see the Streete nigh to the Schoole 
Gate clensed of all manner of ordure, caryon, or other fylthy 
or uncleane things, out of good order, or extraordynarily there

quarterly fee of one pence per scholar was to be devoted by the 
usher of the school at Seven Oaks to having ‘‘the school swept 
and made clean once every week.’’** In Thame the admission 
fee of a drachma was to go ‘‘towards the literary use of the 
school.’’*7 
Although perhaps not so common, the tuition fees were very 
probably more important than those just discussed. In a few 
instances the amount of the fees is not given as is the case in our 
records of the school at Aylesbury which although called a Free 
School was supported at least in part by the tuition fees paid by 
the parents of the boys.** As was the case with respect to the 
entrance fees, so here also there appears to have been a gradua- 
tion of fees based upon several kinds of considerations. The 
fee paid to the master was higher than that received by the 
usher. Thus the difference between the two in Thame was that 
between a ‘‘solidus’’ and a ‘‘semi-solidus’’ per annum.*** The 
fee paid by the pupil coming froma distance was not infrequently 
higher than that of the one living in the parish or town in which 
the school was situated. Thus in Burford the former was to 
pay 6d. per quarter while the latter paid only 2d. per quarter ;**° 
in Hexham the former class of pupils paid the master 12d. a 
quarter and the usher 6d. a quarter, while the latter class paid 
the small sum of 1d. a quarter and were required to pay no 
more unless their parents wished to do so;**' while in the case of 
Heighington children from the parish were to receive instruction 
free with the exception of the entrance fee of 4d. and a small 
quarterly fee of 2d., the poor children from outside of the parish 
were to pay 2s. per annum, while the sons of rich men and gentle- 
men were to be taken upon such charges as ‘‘the schoolmaster 
and they should agree upon.’’ Not quite so indefinite was

or friends ‘‘two shillings and two-pence by the Quarter for a 
peece of them,’’ while another 100, “being rich or meane

“*Pyve Shillings by the Quarter for their instruction and learn- 
ing.’’** In Warwick the master was to receive gos. annually 
from the profits of certain lands for teaching the ‘‘petties’’ and 
“‘poor men’s children in the County of Warwick.’’** 
While in St. Saviour the master was allowed to take a limited 
number of ‘‘paying pupils,’ there are not a few cases, where 
tuition fees are definitely prohibited.** The will of the founder 
of the school at Normanton provides that ‘‘the master should 
not command any allowance for teaching the free scholars 
beyond the yearly sum of £10’’ which was paid from the estates 
‘deeded to the school.** The master of the school at Seven

Hawkeshead was to teach ‘‘freelie wthout takinge anie stipende,

fees but allowing him to receive voluntary gifts.%* Thus the 
master of the school at Guisbrough was to teach freely all 
scholars coming to the school, ‘‘never ajter any thing of duty,’’ 
but if any of the parents or friends of the scholars gave him any 
thing ‘‘of their free will,’’ he might ‘‘take it thankfully,’ ’** while 
in Croydon the following rule was to be in effect: ‘‘He (the 
master) shall freelye teach suche of the children of the parishe 
of Croydon, without exactinge any thinge for theire teachinge 
as are of the poorer sorte,—but yet it shalbe lawful for the saide 
schoolemaster to receave that which is voluntarily bestowde uppon 
him by any of the saide poorer sorte of parishioners, and for the 
children of suche as be of the better sorte of the parishioners 
of Croydon.’’** ‘‘Gifts’’ were also permitted in Hartlebury 
where the following statute treats the subject: ‘‘Also, that the 
said School-master shall and may have, use and take the profits 
of all such cock-fights and potations, as are commonly used in the 
Schools, and such other gifts as shall be freely given him by any 
of the friends of his scholars over and besides his wages, until 
his salary and stipend shall be augmented.’’**’ In the free 
School at Warrington,** while tuition fees were forbidden and 
the master was not to take any ‘‘reward, stipend or schoolhire, 
yet it was to be lawful for him to take from his scholars 4d.

annually, a cock-penny in the quarter after Christmas, and three 
potation-pennies in the other three quarters, for which he was 
to ‘‘make a drinking for all the said scholars in any of the said 
three quarters.’’ In Witton the master was permitted to re- 
ceive certain fees called ‘‘Veils,’’ which consisted of the admis- 
sion fee of 4d. and of 1d. from every scholar paid on the first 
Thursday after the Christmas recess.*** 
To sum up briefly before proceeding to the consideration of 
the topic of the duties and powers of the staff the stipends of 
the master and usher of this period were higher than those of the 
master and usher before the Reformation, that of the master 
being proportionally higher than that of the usher;%?° in not a 
few cases the staff was not burdened with house rent; in some 
cases the salaries were augmented by the surplus revenues of 
the estates of the school, in others by profits from boarding 
students or by incomes from lectureships, and in others by 
entrance fees, tuition fees,’ gifts, or fees such as the profits of 
cock-fights and potation pennies. There were also a few instances 
in which the salary of the master might be increased at the ex- 
pense of that of the usher and vice versa. Thus in Kirkby 
Stephen the usher was to have charge of the school during the 
absence of the Master or in the intervals between the leaving 
and coming of masters, for which he was to receive two shillings 
extra per week,*”? while in Opndle during the absence of the one 
the other was to ‘‘supply his office’’ and was to receive such 
869 Statutes, 1558. Carlisle, ii., 132. 
810 There are instances in which the salaries themselves were augmented 
either by the efforts of the master or by increased donations. Cf. Appen- 
dix L. Not uninteresting in this connection is the following extract 
from the Mickletown Jury Roll, borough of Nottingham, for the year 
1588 (Records of the Borough of Nottingham, 223): ‘‘We request your 
‘Woo(r)shippe, Maister Maior, with the rest of your brethren for as much 
as we see our Scoole to increase by mennes wherof much more dellygence 
is vsed than hath benne latlye hertofore, and partlye by a carfulle Ousher 
well lerned and brought vp in teachinge: wee dooe alle most willingly 
request you that, wheras he hath in wadges for the whole year vj li 
xiijs. iiijd. that it may be mad viij li.’’ 
In Bungay (Statutes, rs9r. S. I. C., xiii, 135) the master, if he 
hired an usher at his own expense, could require every townsman having 
children in the school to pay 5s. a year for every such child.

““good and convenient allowance as they can agree.’’*73 Every 
possible effort was made, however, to emphasize the importance 
of regular attendance which was considered as the basal duty 
of every master and usher and hence may well be considered as 
the first of the Duties of Master and Usher. 
Duties or MAsTER AND USHER 
A glance through the following regulations concerning absences 
will bring to light the fact that vacation days were not very 
plentiful. In Witton the master was to have liberty once in 
every thirty days to be absent ‘‘to recreate himself.’ In 
East Retford he was not to ‘‘absent himself forth of the said 
town of East Retford from his school over a space of three days 
in any one quarter,’’ except by the special license of the gover- 
nors.** In Kirkby Stephen the master might be absent twelve 
days in the year, the extreme limit being twenty-four days.*”* 
In Saint Bees he was not to ‘‘absent himself from the school 
above twenty days in the whole year’’ besides the twelve days 
in Christmas, Easter, and Whitson weeks, ‘‘without urgent 
cause and special license’’ to be obtained from the majority 
of the governors;*”" but in such a case he was to ‘‘appoint some 
other meet nian to supply his place,’’ and did he ‘‘tarry away 
longer than twenty days’’ he was to forfeit 12d. per day which 
was to be taken from his wages, and did he remain away for 
more than fourteen days together, or one month at several 
times in one year above the twenty days, he was to forfeit his 
position.*’* Similarly in Ringwood the master was to be absent 
only for ‘‘needful and urgent causes’’ and not over twice in a 
year or for longer than twenty days at one time, when he was 
to furnish a substitute.% Did the schoolmaster or usher of 
Alford wish to leave town concerning business, it was necessary 
for him to obtain the consent of the governors, and if he intended 
to be absent for more than two days, he was to appoint ‘‘some

sufficient person in his place.’’**° In Oundle* and Sandwich? 
neither master or usher was to be absent for more than twenty 
days in the year ‘‘nor somuch but upon good and urgent cause;’’ 
nor were both to be absent at the same time, but one was to 
take the place of the other who was absent; license from the 
governors was necessary for an absence of over twenty days. 
In Seven Oaks it was necessary for the master to obtain the 
consent of the governors whenever he wished to absent himself, 
and even then he was not to be absent ‘‘above thirty days in 
the year,’’*** which he might take ‘‘commutim or divistm.’’*** 
In Hawkeshead neither master nor usher were to be absent 
except when necessary nor were they to be absent at the same 
time; for an absence of over six weeks the license of the gover- 
nors was necessary.*** In Felsted neither master nor usher was 
to be absent above eight days in a quarter ‘‘without good ex- 
cuse,’’*** while the arrangement in St. Albans was similar to that 
in effect at Seven Oaks with the exception that no more than 
six days were to be taken except in cases of sickness.**” 
In making special provision for the sickness of master or usher 
St. Albans was not alone. In Seven Oaks a master ‘‘sick of a 
curable disease’’ was nevertheless to have his wages ‘‘somewhat 
considering the usher for his pains.’’*** In East Retford, in 
case of ‘‘infirmity or other lawful impediment,’’ the master 
was to furnish a substitute,*** while in Oundle**® and Sandwich, 
if the master were sick of a curable disease, he was to be ‘‘ toler- 
ated for the time and his stipend allowed fully, so that his office 
be furnished by his sufficient deputie;’’ but if he were sick of 
an infective or incurable disease, he was to be ‘‘putt awaie’

and another was to be chosen ‘‘in his rome.’’** At St. Paul’s 
the matter is treated in the following statutes: ‘‘Yf the Maister 
be syke of sykeness incurable, or fall into such age that he may 
not conveniently teache, and hath bene a man that longe and 
laudably hath taught in the Scole, thanne let another be chosyn, 
and by the discrete charitie of the Mercery let there be assigned 
to the olde Maister a reasonable levinge of Ten Pounds or other- 
wise as it shall seme convenyent, so that the olde Maister after 
his longe labor, in no wise be lefte destitute. Yf the Maister 
be syke of sikenes curable, yet nevertheless I will that he shall 
have his wages, and in suche sekenes yf he may not teache, 
let him reward the Under-maister for his more labor somewhat 
according.*” 
“‘In sekenes curable, as aches, or suche sekenes, for a tyme 
he (the Under-maister) shal be tolerated and have his full 
wagis. 
“‘Yf after his commynge he fall sick unto sickenes incurable, 
as Lepry, or Frenche Poxe, or, after his longe labor in the Scole 
fall into age ympotent, thenne I commit him to the charitie 
of The Mercers, they of the coler of the Scole, to provide him a 
lyvinge as it may be possible, praying them to be charitable in 
that behalf. 
“‘Y£ both maisters be sicke at onys, thenne let the Scole 
cease for that while.’’*” 
Not so liberal or comprehensive are the following statutes of 
the Merchant Taylors’ which it will be noted omit references to 
incurable sicknesses, old age, and pensionery support: ‘‘Yf 
the maister be sick of a sicknes curable, yet neverthelesse it is 
meete that the Chief Usher, for the tyme that the Maister is so 
sick, shall doe his best endeavor to direct all the Schoole, as the 
duty of the Maister was to have done. The said Usher to his

  English Grammar Schools inthe Reign of Queen Elizabeth rot

Schollers within the said Schoole with all dilligence, as the duty

Under-Usshers to their power to doe their owne duty as they 
did before nevertheless. 
“©Y££ both The Maister and The Usshers be sick at once, (as 
God defend), then let the Schoole cease for that while. ’’*** 
As to enforced vacations caused by the prevalence of con- 
tagious diseases,*** the statute of St. Paul’s is, ‘‘ Yf there be such 
sicknesse in the citie contagious that the Scole cannot continue, 
yet neverthelesse both maisters shall have their wages, being 
always ready for to teache.’’*" The wording of the correspond- 
ing section in the statutes of the Merchant Taylors’ School is 
rather odd: ‘‘Yff there be such sickness contagious in the 
Cytty, that the Schoole cannot contynue,’” then both The 
Maister and The Usshers must have patience in such a case.’’** 
In Sandwich and Oundle‘ it was provided that, if the school 
were compelled to be closed on account of contagious sickness, 
the master and usher were to receive their regular salary, ‘* being 
in rediness to teache so sone as God shall make suche contagious 
sickness cease.’’4* f 
An excellent statement of the chief duties, moral, intellectual 
and religious, of the master and usher is contained in the follow- 
ing section of the statutes of the school at Hartlebury: ‘‘ Also 
that the said School-master and Usher, and either of them, shall 
instruct, teach, and bring up their Scholars as well in Virtue 
and Learning according as the capacity and wits of the said 
Scholars shall ask and require, as also shall instruct them in 
the true knowledge of God and his holy Word, as much as in 
them lieth, and further shall execute and do all such things as

and belong, and according to such order as the said Lord Bishop*” 
shall by writing in Articles prescribe unto them.’’*® 
In the execution of the duties there was generally a division 
of labor between the master and usher. As a rule the master 
had general oversight of the whole school having also the super- 
vision of the work of the usher; who customarily was given the 
lower forms or such forms as the master should designate to 
instruct‘ and whose chief virtue was to be obedience to the 
master.*°® In case of the absence of one the duties of both were 
to be performed by the other,‘ and so when a vacancy occurred

4% Thus the master in Saint Bees was to have general oversight of 
the usher (Statutes, 1583. Carlisle, i, 157). In Sandwich the master 
was to have supervision of the usher’s work, and the usher was to ‘‘ prac- 
tice and use suche order and forme in teaching as the master should thinck 
good to prescribe,’’ while at least twice a month the master was to 
examine the pupils under the care of the usher, ‘“‘to understand how 
they profyt and go forward in learning’’ (Statutes. Boys, History of 
Sandwich, 228). In Felsted the usher was to ‘‘teach the children in such 
manner and form as the master shall direct’’ (Statutes, 1564. Carlisle 
i,. 432). Similarly in Oundle the usher was to ‘‘follow such order in 
teaching as the master shall prescribe’’ (Statutes, 1556. Carlisle, ii., 
21s). Cf. also the statutes of St. Paul’s and Merchant Taylors’ quoted 
supra, p. 78. For account of the supervision of the work of the master, 
cf. supra, p. 52ff. 
4% Thus in Hawkeshead the usher was to ‘‘teach such Children and 
Schollers in the said Schole of the loweste fformes as to him shall be 
appointed by the said scholemaster’’ (Statutes. Cowper, Hawkeshead, 
480). In East Retford the usher was to teach ‘‘such Lower Formes and 
young Scholars as shall be to him appointed by the School-master’’” 
(Statutes, 1552. Carlisle ii, 281). Similarly in Ipswich (Bacon, The 
Annals of Ipswche, 418), and Saint Bees (Carlisle, i., 157) the lower forms 
were assigned to the usher. For detailed account of duties, see Thesis, 
Pp. 109. 
4 Thus in Hawkeshead the usher was to be ‘‘obedient’’ to the master 
(Cowper, Hawkeshead, 480) while in East Retford he was to be obedient to 
the master ‘‘in all things honest and lawful concerning the said school’’ 
(Statutes, 1552. Carlisle, ii, 281). 
4 Cf. supra, goff. 
4% In Hawkeshead upon the death of the master, the usher was to 
‘*teach the Schollers in the said School as master therof, untyll ther be a 
Scholemaster placed in the said Rowme and Offic,’’ and for the time during 
h he acted as master he was to have ‘‘the stypende and allowaunce

qualified for the position of master was to be preferred.° In 
cases of disagreement between the master and usher the gover- 
nors were usually to be arbitrators and their decision was to be 
final." :

In Oundle (Statutes, Eliz. Carlisle, ii., 216) and Sandwich (Boys, 
History of Sandwich, 226) the executors or assignees were to be paid 
the money due the deceased up to the time of his death. 
409 Cf. supra, goff. In Oundle and Sandwich (loc. cit.) the usher was 
to take the place of the master and was to receive the salary due both 
until the appointment and admission of a new master, but in Hawkeshead 
during the time that the usher acted as master he was to appo nt a 
“*scholler of the same schole to be usher under him,’’ and the ‘‘scholler’’ 
thus substituting was to have the ‘‘Stypende and allowaunce belonging 
to the usher’’ (Statutes. Cowper, Hawkeshead, 474).

“*Yf the Under-Maister be in literature and in honest lyfe accordynge, then

(Statutes, St. Paul’s, 1512. Carlisle, ii., 72). ‘‘And yf the said Chief 
Ussher be in literature, discretion, and honest lief, according, then The 
High Maister his roome being vacant, lett him be chosen before another’’ 
(Statutes of the Merchant Taylors’, 1561. Carlisle, ii., 51). In Ipswich 
in 1604 there is record of a James Leman being elected as master of the 
Grammar School (Bacon, The Annals of Ipswche, 418) while in 1594 
there is record of a James Leman being ‘‘ p’mitted to execute’’ the place 
of usher until another should be elected. (Jbid, 377). In Whitchurch 
the usher was to be preferred if thought sufficient\—Statutes, 1570. 
CeGiR., Bxve 3876 
4 Cf. supra, p. 73. In Sandwich the matter was to be referred to 
the founder during his life and after his death to the governors of the 
school. Failure to abide by the decision of either of them was to be 
punished by forfeiture of office (Boys, History of Sandwich, 225). The 
same provision existed in Oundle (Carlisle, ii., 216).

  CHAPTER IV 
ENGLISH GRAMMAR SCHOOL CURRICULA 
While the academic entrance requirements of the grammar 
schools varied, yet where such requirements existed they gener- 
ally included ability to read and write. Thus in Redgrave! and 
Alford the candidate was to be able to ‘‘read perfectly and write 
legibly,’’? while in St. Paul’s and Merchant Taylors’ the follow- >) 
ing sections of the statutes treat this matter: ‘‘The Maister | 
shall admit these Children as they be offirid from tyme to tyme; 
but first se, that they canne saye the Catechyzon, and also that | 
he can rede and write competently, else let him not be admitted 
in no wise.’’* ‘‘But first see, that they can the Catechisme in | 
English or Latyn, and that every of the said Two Hundreth and 
Fifty Schollers can read perfectly, and write competently, or 
else lett them not be admitted in no wise.’’* In not a few cases 
ability to read meant ability to read Latin as well as English. 
Thus in Oundle* and Sandwich the candidate was to be able to 
“‘write compententlie and to reade perfectlie both englishe and 
lattyne;’’* in Tunbridge the master was to have authority to 
reject such as applied for gratis instruction unless they could 
““write competently, and read Latin and English perfectly ;’’? 
while in Eye the candidates were to be able ‘‘distinctly to read 
as well Latin as English,’’* in Norwich they were to be able to 
say their catechism, read ‘‘perfectly both English and Latin, 
and write competently,’’* and in Saint Savior the child was to 
be examined by the master before the Wardens, ‘‘whether he 
tead English and Latin perfectly, and write his name, and being 
found able,’’ his name was to be entered into the Register Book

and he was to be admitted.'° In a few instances the require- 
ments are more specific. Thus, in St. Alban’s the candidate had 
to pass an.examination given by the master to determine how 
well he had mastered his ‘‘Accidence without booke.’’" In 
Thame no scholar was to be admitted unless ‘‘ Anglice legendi 
bene longo usu confirmatus, primis rei grammaticae rudimentis 
tmbibendis maturus,’’* while in Shrewsbury the following 
statute deals with entrance requirements: ‘‘(the candidate 
must be able) to write his own name with his own hand; read 
English perfectly; have his accidence without book, and give 
any case of any number of a noun substantive or adjective, any 
person of any number of a verb active or passive, and make a 
Latin by any of the concords, the Latin words being first given 
hima? 
While some of the schools thus insisted upon an elementary 
education as preparation for the grammar school and admitted 
“‘none under a grammar scholar,’’* not a few schools were 
burdened with the task of furnishing the elementary education 
as well as the higher.!® Thus the school at Burford was to con- 
sist of ‘‘grammarian scholars’’ and ‘‘petties, so that every 
man in the town and parish, minding to set his child to school, 2786,

1% Brinsley in his Grammar School indicateg the ideal in the words 
of Philoponus: ‘‘For it were much to be wished, that none might be 
admitted to the Grammar schooles until they were able to reade English: 
as namely that they could reade the new Testament perfectly, and 
that they were in their Accidences or meet to enter into them’’ (p. 13). 
The following words of Spoudeus probably express the feeling of many ot 
the masters thus burdened: ‘‘It seemeth to mee an unreasonable thing 
that the Grammar schooles should be troubled with teaching A. B.C.....: 
Because it dooth take up almost one halfe of our time, and thereby dooth 
deprive us of a chiefe part of the fruite of our labours... ....The very 
little ones in a towne, in most countrey townes which are of any bignesse, 
would require a whole man of themselves, to be alwaies hearing, poasing 
and following them:...... Besides, it is an extreame vexation, that we 
must bee toyled amongst such little pettyes.’’—John Brinsley, The 
Grammar School, p. 13. The school at Stevenage was released from 
this burden about 1562 when an endowed school was established by ‘he 
parishioners for the teaching of English, writing and arithmeuc.—

the pryncyples of the Greeke tongue, wth other Scyences neces-

hours he and his usher were to teach ‘‘all suche good Aucthors

the master might see how the scholars had ‘‘pfyted’’ ‘‘the 
Chiefest Schollars of the said Schole’’ were, at the breaking up 
time at Christmas and Easter, to ‘‘make Oracons, Epistles,

or leave as he thinketh meet, to be appointed for every Form, 
saving that the Accidence, the Queen’s Grammar, and the 
Catechism aforesaid, shall not be omitted. And the School- 
master shall not suffer his Scholars to have any lewd or super- 
stitious books or ballads amongst them.’’* 
While in the statutes just quoted mention is made of ‘‘forms,’’ 
no information is given concerning either the number of such 
forms or the amount of work to be done in each. As the forms 
varied in number from three to seven, the amount of work to 
be accomplished varied accordingly. Our information con- 
cerning some of the schools thus divided into forms is very 
limited. 
In Oundle there were to be three forms. In the first, the 
master was to teach grammar appro by the Queen’s 
Majesty, and the Accidence and English les; in the second,

In Guisbrough and East Retford there were to be four forms. 
The statute in Guisbrough reads as follows: ‘‘The School 
shall be divided into Four several forms,—and in the first shall 
be placed young beginners, commonly called, ‘ Petits,’—whom 
the Master himself shall not be bound to teach so long as they 
continue there, but only assign so many of his Scholars in the

they were able to ‘‘read perfectly’’ they were admitted into

into four forms, the Sixth, Fifth, Fourth, and Lower Fourth

in making verses and in writing prose. The books recommended 
to be read were Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Plautus, Cicero, Livy, 
Salust, Justin, Herodian, Terence and Lucian.”? 
While it is not explicitly stated in our material that the 
school at Cheltenham was divided into forms, it is evident 
from the following provisions that some such division was 
contemplated: the school was to consist of fifty pupils; four 
at least of these were to have a knowledge of the Greek and 
Latin tongues sufficient to make exercises in prose and verse 
in them and to speak Latin extempore; four others were to be 
“‘able to make a sentence of true Latin’’; fourteen others were 
to be ready to learn the accidence, while the residue were to be 
children of ‘‘good aptness to learn.’’78 
The cases thus far noted have been (a) those in which there is 
no information concerning any division, (b) those in which there 
is a division into master’s and usher’s schools, and (c) those 
in which the division is into forms. Still another type, a com- 
bination of (b) and (c), existed. The case is that of the school 
at Sandwich, which was divided into six forms,’* the lower three 
of which were known as the ‘‘Usher’s Forms,’’ the other three 
as the ‘‘Master’s Forms.’’ The division of work into Forms 
was defended by the founder of the school on the ground that “‘digressinge in order of teachinge accordinge to the seuerall 
natures and disposicions of everie scholemaster or usher was a 
great hindrance to the scholars,’’ and he believed that ‘‘a con- 
venient direccion therein of some ordinarie bookes to be read 
and some exercises to be used might greatly further the schol- 
ars.’’*° But the following outline was not to be a hard and fast 
manual, as the master was bound to follow only what he thought 
most expedient.

As to the number of books to be read, Roger Manwood, the 
Founder, expresses the following opinion: ‘‘In myne opynion, 
during a schollers remayninge in the grammer schole, he should 
learne but a fewe books in lattin, and in greek correspondent 
to them,’’ and was not to be suffered to ‘‘rove in many awcthors, 
but fewe should be learned most perfectlie, and then he maie 
after with better judgement reade as many as he lyste.’’® 
While in s cases the content of the curriculum was pre- 
cribed or indi ed by the statutes of the, school, it is evident 
from the silence of many of the statutes on this subject that 
mu ch if not all was left to the discretion of the master. “In'a 
w Cases a church official was authorized to exercise this dis- 
cretion. Thus, in the case of Tadcaster the master was to give 
instruction in ‘‘Grammar and such like authors and books as 
shall be thought meet by the Lord Archbishop of York.’’® 
while in Heighington the schoolmaster was to instruct his 
scholars ‘‘in the accidence and Lilly’s grammar and in the 
Greek grammar, and other easy Latin and Greek authors, 
according to their capacities and as the Bishop of Durham for 
the time being shall direct.’’** The Latin grammar here men- 
tioned was the one which was supposed to be used throughout 
the realm during this” reign as it” had not ‘only been allowed** 
by Her Majesty but its use commanded by Queen Elizabeth 
in_her injunctions.of 1559,°° and by the _Archbishop | in his 
articles of visitation.” ; 
     
  % Statutes. Ibid, 231-2. 
In Kirkby Stephen the master was to read to his scholars the ten 
commandments in the Latin and ‘'Cato, 42sop’s Fables, Tulley’s Offices, 
and de Senectute, and likewise, Sallust, Virgill, and Terence, and such 
others.’’—Statutes, 1566, Carlisle, ii., 717.

**In Cheltenham (Deed, 1586. S. I. C., xv., 33) and Aldenham the 
master was to use the ‘common Latin grammar approved by the autho- 
rity of the Queen’s Majesty (Statutes, 1599. S. I. C., xii., 65).

Meagre as is the material contained in sources concerning the 
content of the grammar school curricula, still less information 
is to be obtained from the statutes, letters patent, and deeds, 
con erning the methods of instruction. In Seven Oaks the 
master was to teach according to the methods used in the ‘‘ School 
of St. Paul’s in London,’’” while in Wimborne the master was 
to give instruction according to the usage of the Schools of 
Eton and Winchester.** From the absence of specifications 
in the many other cases, it is safe to conclude that the majority 
of masters were left to follow their own ideas, or the methods 
in common used in the schools at that time. Philoponous in 
Brinsley’s Grammar School is probably a good example 
of master following his own ideas, while Spoudeus, the creation 
of the same author, is a fair representative of the master sub- 
servient to the customs of the day. In fact it is from the part 
of the latter in the dialogue that we learn the most concerning 
the methods in teaching the A. B. C. as well as composing and 
delivering orations then in common use. 
In teaching the A. B. C. the common practice seems to have 
been to have the children read over and over the letters for- 
wards and backwards until they could say them.* This was 
followed by drill in combinations of letters and sounds.** Where 
writing was taken up with this work, in many cases daily copies 
were ‘‘set’’ by the teacher or one of the scholars, the teacher 
sometimes guiding the hand of the learner and showing him 
how to ‘‘amend’’ his letters.** As for the other elementary 
within this diocese than that set forth by the authority of king Henry 
the Eight.’’—Quoted in Cardwell’s Annals, i., 213.

‘‘wandering scriveners,’’ who, according to Brinsley, drew ‘‘away the 
mindes of many of the Schollars from their bookes; even of all such as 
cannot indure to take pains, nor have any great love of learning’’ and also 
caused many ‘‘of good hope to leave the schoole utterly.’’—The Grammar

subject, ‘‘numbers,’’ the results do not seem to have been very 
gratifying for, according to Brinsley, scholars almost ready to 
go to the University were to be found who could ‘‘hardly tell 
you the number of pages, sections, chapters, or other divisions 
in their books, to find what they should.’’” 
When the child entered upon the study of Latin, his English, 
which app appears to have generally suffered great neglect, °8 was 
anything | but improved,*® since attention appears to have been 
focused upon Latin alone. Accidence was the first to_receive 
attention. In learning to ‘‘reade the Accedence’’ the pupil 
by himself read it over and then the master heard him recite; 
while in the harder lessons the master read it over to the pupils; 
the accidence was thus read over several times with the book 
before the scholars attempted to get it without the book when 
the same method was used, the pupils being compelled ‘‘to keep 
what they had learned by weekely repetitions,’°° and by saying 
parts.’’1% The process of learning the rules of grammar appears

* The following extract from the dialogue throws light on this point: 
Philoponus. 
‘*But to tell you what I thinke, wherein there seems unto mee, to 
bee a verie maine want in all our Grammar schooles generally, or in 
most of them; whereof I have heard som great learned men to complain; 
That there is no care had in respect to traine up schollars so, as they 
may be able to expresse their minds purely and readily in our owne 
tongue, and to increase in practice of it as well as in the Latine or Greeke,’’ 
Spoudeus. 
‘I do not know any schoole wherein there is regard had thereof 
to anie purpose.’’—The Grammar School, 22.

‘When my children doe first enter into Latine, manie of them will 
forget to reade English, and some of them bee worse two or three yeeres 
after they have been in construction, then when they began it.’’— 
The Grammar School, 21. 
100 Thus in East Retford (Statutes, 1552. Carlisle, ii., 283) and in 
Sandwich the pupils were upon Saturdays, or upon Friday, if Saturday 
happened to be a holiday, to rehearse the ‘‘learning of that week neare 
spent” (Statutes, 1580. Boys, History af Sandwich, 231).

of the morning in the first four days of the school week was devoted to

lecture as to hear it given by the upper forms.—Grammmar School, 89 
107 Parsing was done chiefly in the lower forms. In parsing the master 
noted ‘‘what part of speech every word was,’’ how it was declined or 
conjugated and ‘‘all questions belonging thereunto;’’ ‘‘what each 
word is governed of, the rules for everything, and the like."'—Granonar 
School, 125. Concerning the time spent in parsing:—'' There is so much 
time spent in examining everything; the Master asking each question 
particularly, and the scholar answering; which besides the loss of time, 
is a very great wearinesse to the Master. ’’—Granunar School, 138. It 
was probably to avoid this ‘‘loose of time’? and ‘*great wee rinesse to the 
Master” that the following statute was made in Sandwich: —''In the 
pearcing the teacher shall not need more than to exe OND which scholler 
he will at adventure which words he will in the lesson."’—Boys, /istory

Verse writing was probably the mo most difficult work attempted 
by_the hool scholars, It was found to ‘‘be full of” 
difficultie, both in the entering, the progressc, and also in the 
end.’’?* H.C. Maxwell-Lyte, writing of Eton life in 1560, 
says concerning this subject, ‘‘No Gradus ad Parnassum then 
existed, to assist the would-be poets in finding suitable words 
for their compositions, and they had to rely on the contents 
of thei = s_ for flowers idi 
speech, antitheses, epithets, synonyms, proverbs, similes, c 
parisons, anecdotes, descriptions of times etc.’’127, While the 
following sentence was included in the statutes-of but one 
school, it probably stated a custom very common in England 
at that time: ‘‘The phrases, synanomies, and elagancies 
shall be chosen owte and appointed to the schollers to write.’’'* 
The writing and declamation of orations does not appear to 
have been as common as efforts in the. other ‘lines of Latin com- 
position. Brinsley thus describes its ‘place in the curriculum, 
its object, and the chief characteristics of the average oration: 
“‘T take them to belong rather to the Universities........ 
Yet, because in Schooles of special note, and where there are 
auncient schoolars, sometimes it may be expected amongst 
them, that some one of them should make an Oration to enter- 
taine a Benefactor, or other person of note; and it may be, to 
do it ex tempore, as their comming is of a sodaine; therefore    
      
before; others also haue been made so feareful, that they would rather 
desire to go to any base trade or drudgery, then to be Schollars, & hereby 
haue very much reproached my Schoole: Because, as they haue ouer- 
rightly complained, they must bee beaten for not doing that, which they 
knew not how to doe; so that this feare is worse to them, then the first 
for making Latines. 
“’And yet notwithstanding, in their entring to make Theames, and 
so likewise into versifying, I haue not knowen how to auoid it, but haue 
pin enforced to vse so much sharpnesse, as to make them to call all 
their wits together, and to stir them vp to diligence and paines; or other- 
wise I should not have done no good at all.’’ Brinsley, The Grammar 
Schoole, pp. 171-2. 
128 Spoudeus continues, ‘‘that my schollars haue had more feare in 
this then in all the former, and my selfe also driuen to more seuerity; 
which I haue been inforced vnto, or else I should haue done no good at 
al with the greatest part.’’—Grammar School, 191.

  CHAPTER V 
THE PUPILS; SCHOOL LIFE AND CUSTOMS 
The number of pupils per grammar school varied greatly. 
Thus the endowment for the school at Penryn was for the educa- 
tion of three boys while the attendance at Shrewsbury in 1581 
is given as 360.! From the list given in Appendix Q, however, 
it would appear that the attendance of a large proportion of 
schools varied between 40 and 60. 
It appears to have been the purpose of those interested in the 
grammar schools that the schools be of assistance to children of 
all classes.? While the sons of the rich and of the nobility 
attended grammar schools as at Shrewsbury,’ the schools were 
founded for the poor as well as the rich‘ and in some-places the 
poor were to be given the preference.’ Even when tuition fees 
were allowed the master there were usually a ccrtain number 
of ‘‘foundationers,’’ or poor pupils who were freed from the 
1 Cf. Appendix Q. 
> Thus, according to the agreement made between the Cathedral and 
City Corporations in Lincoln in 1583 (S. I. C.,xvi., 259), the school was 
to be open to children of freemen, of such as dwell within the city, liber- 
ties, and county thereof, of the inhabitants within the close of the cathe- 
dral church, and the liberties of the same, and of the choristers and poor 
clerks of the said cathedral. 
* Cf. Appendix L. | 
‘Thus, the school at St. Savior was erected in order that the ‘‘male 
Children and youth as well of the poor as the rich inhabiting within the 
said Parish’’ might be ‘‘freely and successfully, instructed and educated 
in grammar.’’—Letters Patent 1562. Carlisle, ii, 583. Again, the 
master and usher of the school at King’s Lynn (Records of the Corpora- 
tion, 1594. C. C. R., xxviii., 25), were to teach the ‘burgesses’ children 
and other poor men’s children.’’ This last reference would indicate 
that the term poor does not necessarily apply only to the most destitute. 
SE. G., Redgrave (Statutes, 1576. S. 1. C., xiii., 129); In St. Albans 
‘‘poor men’s children’? were to be ‘‘received. into the school before 
others’’ (Statutes, 1570. Carlisle, i., 516), in Seven Oaks the master 
was to teach grammar to ‘‘whatsoever poor children destitute, of help, 
coming thither for Learning for God’s cause freely’’ (Statutes, 1574. 
Carlisle, i., 619), while in Abingdon the preference was to be given to 
the fatherless, widows’ and poor men’s children (Founder’s Deed, 1562. 
Sial.Ce xis, 300) 5 :

payment of tuition fees.? In a few cases positive assistance 
was rendered to poor students.’ In Lichfield six poor pupils, 
selected from the children of poor men in Lichfield were to re- 
ceive #1 6s, 8d. each for the purchase of books and brooms with 
which to sweep the school for four years.’ In Witton the foun- 
der wills that ‘‘there shall be forever given and distributed and 
bestowed among the poor Schollars of my Free School and 
Parish of Witton tos. in the Vigil or Eve of the birth of Our 
Lord God, one half thereof among the said poor folks.’’* 
In Crediton the Queen, in her Letters Patent, willed that the 
governors of the school should ‘‘distribute yearly £8 out of the 
revenues of the said Rectory and Church of Crediton amongst 
Four boys of the same Parish of the best disposition and capacity 
for Grammatical Learning’’ and in the greatest need of ex- 
hibition and maintenance;!® while in Kirkby Stephen a poor 
scholar was employed as usher." 
Restrictions, where they existed," _pertained_to_sex, age, ip,'? and territory rather than to the social andweconomic 
* Thus, in Colchester 16 of the 60 scholars were to be ‘‘ Free Scholars’’ 
(1583, Thomas Cromwell, History of the Ancient Town and Borough of 
Colchester in Essex, ii., 312) while in St. Savior the master was to be 
allowed to take 40 pay scholars out of the 100 (Statutes, 1562. Carlisle, 
ii., 684). 
7The ‘‘foundationers’’ in a large number of the cathedral and col- 
legiate schools received board and lodgings and a small sum of money. 
Cj. Appendix U; ¢j. also following quotation from Harrison’s Descrip- 
tion of England, Bk. ii., Chap. iii, 83-84: ‘‘There are in like maner 
diuerse collegiat churches as Windsor, Wincester, Eaton, Westminster, 
and in those a great number of poore scholers, dailie mainteened by the 
liberalitie of the founders, with meat, bookes, and apparell, from whence 
after they haue beene well entered in the knowledge of the Latine and 
Greek toongs, and rules of versifieng (the trial whereof is made by cer- 
taine apposers yearelie appointed to examine them), they are sent to 
certaine especiall houses in each universitie, where they are receiued 
and trained up in the points of higher knowledge in their priuate hals, 
till they be adjudged meet to shew their faces in the schooles.’’

grammar schools were open to boys and youths al ig the 
from 6 to of leaving     
4% In Bunbury girls were to be admitted but their number was to be 
small and none were to continue ‘‘above the age of nine nor longer than 
they may learn to read English.’’—Statutes, 1594. S.I.C., xvii., 23. 
18 Six or over was the entrance age at Witton (Statutes, 1558. Carlisle,

and between 8 and 18 at Cropredy (Deed, 1574. S. I. C., xii., 232), 
while William Burton entered Nuneaton at 9 (D. N. B., viii., 18). 
Spoudeus in Brinsley’s ‘‘Grammar School,’’ p. 9, says concerning the 
age of admission: ‘‘For the time of their entrance with us, in our 
countrey schooles, it is commonly about 7 or 8 yeeres olde: six is very 
soone. If any begin so early, they are rather sent to the schoole to keepe 
them from troubling the house at home, and from danger, and shrewd 
turnes, then for any great hope and desire their friends have that they 
should learne any thing in effect.’’ 
© Ralph Brownrig, later Bishop of Exeter, left Ipswich for Cambridge 
at the age of 12 (D. N. B., VII., 83); 15 was the age at which John Overall 
left Hadleigh (D. N. B., XLII., 375) and Sir Edward Coke, Norwich 
(D. N. B., XI., 229) for Cambridge; William Burton left Nuneaton at 16 
for Oxford (loc. cit.), while Robert Bolton left Blackburn for the same 
university at the age of 20 (D. N. B., V., 330). 
1 Such was the provision at Wakefield (Letters Patent, rs91. S.I.C., 
Xviii., 294). 
18 Such was the provision at Kendal (Deed, 1588. S.I..C., xix., 363), 
Abingdon (Deed, 1562. S. I. C., xi., 396) and Kimbolton (Deed, 1600. 
C. C. R., xxiv., 47). In Norwich the parents or friends of the pupils 
tad to be residents of the city (Statutes, 1566. S.I.C., i, Appendix 44). 
19Thus, the schools at Highgate (Letters Patent, 1565. Carlisle, 
ii, 162) and Richmond (Letters Patent. S. I. C., xviii, 562) were 
founded ‘‘for the education of poor boys living in’’ the town and ‘‘neigh- 
boring parts;’’ in Ashton (Deed, 1588. S. I. C., xvii., 159) the master 
was to ‘‘teach all youth and young children of Ashton and the adjoining 
places gratis;’’ the school at Hexham was founded for the ‘‘education 
of the youth of the parish of Hexham and other adjacent towns’’ (Letters 
Patent, 1599. S. I. C., xix., r10); in the case of Rugby the school was 
“‘to serve chiefly for the children of Rugby and Brownesover, and next 
for such as bee of other places thereunto adjoyneing’’ (Founder’s Will,

tion was peculiar in that while the number was to be made

Will, 1594. Carlisle, i, 434); the scholars in the school at Cropredy 
were to come from the villages comprised in the peculiar of Cropredy 
or in default from the next towns (Founder’s Deed, 1574. S. I. C., xii., 
232); the school at Boxford was founded for the ‘‘instruction of youth 
of Boxford, Groton, and Edwardstone”’ (Letters Patent, 1596. S. 1. C., 
xiii., 131); the free scholars of the school at Great Bardfield were to con- 
sist of the founder’s kin, 12 children from Great Bardfield, 4 from Bard- 
field Laling, 4 from Little Bardfield, and 6 from Finchingfield (Founder’s 
Will, 1584. S. 1. C., xiii., 12); the master of the school at Elmdon was 
to instruct freely ‘‘al children and scholars as should repair or be sent 
thither to be taught, being born or whose parents should be dwelling 
within the townships of Elmdon, Crissall, Stuthall, Wendon, Lofts, 
Over and Nether Chishall, Arkeshen, Barler, Barkway, Manewden, 
Langley, and Clavering’’ (Founder’s Deed, 1559. S. I. C., xiii., 55); 
the free grammar school at Dedham was founded for the education of 
“20 of the poorest men’s children apt and meet to receive learning in 
Dedham, Ardleigh, Much Bromley, and Bradfield in Essex and Stratford 
in Suffolk’’ (Founder’s Will, 1571. S. I. C., xiii, 47); while the free 
grammar school at Daresbury was founded for the better education 
of the children of the inhabitants of the townships of Daresbury, Preston, 
Newton, Kekwich, Moor, Halton, Acton Grange, Over and Nether 
Walton, and of such foreigners as had contributed to the foundation 
of the school (Founder’s Deed, 1600. S. I. C., xvii., 38). 
20 While, in the case of Felsted, children born on the manor of the 
founder were to be preferred (C. C. R., xxix., pt. I., 205), yet those born 
in the county of Essex were to be admitted (Founder's Will, 1564. 
Carlisle, i., 432); the master of the school at St. Bees was to ‘'refuse none 
being born in the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland” (Statutes, 
1g85. ° Carlisle, i... 156). 
Thus in the case of Tiverton while preference was to be given to 
scholars raised the first six years in Tiverton, children of ‘' foreigners 
of honest reputation’’ were to be admitted also (Founder’s Will, 1599. 
Carlisle, i., 340); the school at Halifax was founded ‘‘for the Continual 
bringing up, teaching, and learning of Children and Youth of the said 
Parish and Vicarage of Halifax, and also of other Villages and Hamlets 
near adjoining unto the same, and of other Our faithful and Liege people, 
whosoever they be, to be taught, instructed and learned there’’ (Letters 
Patent, 1585. Carlisle, ii., 808); the school at Whitchurch (Statutes, 
1s7o. C.C. R., xxiv., 337) was to be open to ‘‘children of all countries 
that would come, except such as were infected with any contagious dis- 
order (N.B.—A similar provision existed at Alford concerning disorders: 
none were to be admitted having ‘‘any corrupt or noisome disease on the 
body or head which is loathsome.’’—Statutes, 1599. Carlisle, i., 784);

master as in Redgrave (Statutes, 1576. C. C. R., xxii., 151) and in St.

make a ‘‘just account to the Wardens of the Grocers of all such scholars 
as came thither;’’ he was also to note therein their time of departure, 
the reason thereof, and ‘‘whether they went to the universities or no.’’ 
—Statutes. Carlisle, ii, 217. Likewise in Sandwich the book was kept 
by the master who entered therein the name and surname of pupil together 
with date of admission. He was to ‘‘make account’’ to the governors 
on the ‘‘Mundaie nexte after the feast of St. Mychaell the Archangell.’’

were in some places features not less interesting. Thus in 
Witton the schoolmaster at the admission of every scholar 
was to read the Statutes, Orders, Rules, and Laws belonging or 
pertaining to the scholar in the presence of the parents or friends 
of the pupil, who were to promise to be responsible for the keep- 
ing of the same by the pupil.** Similarly in Sandwich the 
statute were to be read by the schoolmaster to the new pupil 
and hi: friends who were to promise to be obedient to the stat- 
utes.*® In St. Paul’s School the master_was to ‘‘rehearse’’

‘Also ye shall fynde him convenyent bokes to his lernynge- 
“‘If the Offerer be content with these Articles, than let his 
Childe be admytted.’’*° 
Of a slightly different nature were the articles to be read by 
the master of the school at St. Albans to those offering their 
children to be taught in the school. They read as follows: 
“‘Ye shall submit your child to be ordered in all things, 
according to the discrecion of the Schoolmaster. 
‘‘VYe shall find for your child ink, paper, pens, wax-candles 
for Winter, and all other things at any time requisite and neces- 
sary for the maintenance of his study. 
“Ye shall allow your child at all times, a bow, three 
arrows, bowstrings, a shooting glove, and a bracer, to exercise 
shooting.“ 
‘Ye shall see dilligently from time to time, that your child 
keep duely the ordinary hours and times in coming to 
School. 
“Tf your child be absent above three days in a Quarter (ex- 
cept he be sick) then he shall be banished the School. 
“Tf your child shall prove unapt for learning, then upon 
warning thereof given, ye shall take him away. And again,if 
he prove apt, then shall ye suffer him to remain till he be com- 
petently learned.’’” 
It will be noted in the above rules that in admission the 
privileges of the school were not once for all time granted the 
pupil but were granted him upon condition that he prove him- 
self worthy of and able to profit from them as well as regular in 
his attendance. There resulted in some schools a period of 
probation or testing time. Thus in Oundle,* if the master or

usher ‘‘upon proof or trial of the capacity of the scholar, should 
find him not meet to learn,’’ they were to ‘‘signify the same 
to his friends to remove him,’’ while in Sandwich“ if the pupil 
was found not ‘‘meet to learne,’’ his friends were to be notified 
and when the consent of the Mayor, or his deputy, and two 
Jurats had been obtained, the unsuccessful scholar was to be 
removed. 
The problem of regular attendance, however, appears to have 
been a more difficult and serious one than that of keeping up 
the grade of scholarship. Spoudeus,‘* commenting upon the 
troubles of the schoolmaster, says, ‘‘Although I haue been 
troubled by that diuersitie (of grammars) yet much more by 
the absence of many of my schollars, when some of them are 
away, two or three dayes in a weeke, and sometimes happely a 
moneth together, or almost a quarter of a yeere, as in the haruest 
time, and it may be that they haue no bookes neither; and yet 
the Parents will expect, that they should profit as much as 
if they were there daily, and as if they had all necessary 
bookes.’’ : 
The serious results of irregularity in attendance probably 
accounts for the severe penalties administered in cases of non- 
attendance. The penalty varied from forfeiture of money to 
complete expulsion from school. Thus, in Sandwich the pupil 
absent from school for cause other than sickness and without 
the consent of the master was to be ‘‘corrected’’ and to ‘‘paie 
to the common boxe** for every dayes absence a penny as the 
dayes come to;’’*’ under similar circumstances a pupil at Oundle 
was to pay to the usher ‘‘so many pence as the days be in num- 
ber;’’** while in cases of reinstatement of scholars expelled on 
account of irregularity in attendance the custom appears to

school who were unable to write ‘‘competentlie’’ at the time the statutes

Stephen the penalty for being absent 20 days in the school year 
“without reasonable cause to be allowed by the said Governors. 
or two of them,"" by the heirs of the founder, and by the school- 
master, was to be complete forfeiture of the ‘‘benefits of the

the following statute deals summarily with the evil: ‘‘If any 
child, after he is received and admytted into the said Schoole.

The amount of attendance required was very great. There 
were usually but two vacations, at Christmas and at Easter.” 
There were. however,a considerable number of holidays and half-

since in some cases it meant attendance upon church services®

and in others a change of occupation. The half-holidays 
were as a rule ‘‘remedies’’ or times for play. They were 
usually granted by the master about once a week*®* and on 
occasion of the visit of some noted person,** and probably did 
not amount to more than 48 days altogether in the year. The 
school year contained, therefore, from 40 to 44 weeks," of six 
days per week. A glance at the following schedules will show 
what an enormous amount of time was therefore spent in school 
by the grammar scholars of this period.* 
%In Bungay ‘‘writing and casting accounts, with pen and counters’’ 
was to be taught holidays and Saturdays and on those days school was 
to be kept until 3 P.M. for that purpose.—Statutes, 1591. S. I. C., xiii., 
135. In Heighington writing and casting accounts were to be taught on 
festival days.—Statutes, 1601. S. I. C., xix., 42. 
5§ Custom in St. Bees.—Statutes, 1583. Carlisle, i, 161. In Witton‘ 
however, the pupils were to ‘‘refresh themselves’’ Thursday and Satur- 
day afternoons.—Statutes, 1558. Carlisle, i., 133. 
5 In Seven Oaks the schoolmaster was in ‘‘no wse’’ to give ‘‘ license 
or remedy to his scholars in the week days except it be at the pleasure 
of some Honorable or Worshipful person; or of any of the honest persons 
of the aforesaid Parish of Sevenoaks or other cause reasonable.’’— 
Statutes, 1574. Carlisle, i, 621. In Sandwich the master was not to 
give ‘‘remedie or leave to plaie aboue once in a week,’’ unless ‘‘the said 
gouernours or some honorable or worshipfull person present in the school 
house shall require the same,so as that farther license be but once a week 
and not two days together nor in the forenoon and not withowte shewing 
some exercise of learninge in presence of hym that asketh the same.’’— 
Statutes, 1580. Boys, History of Sandwich, 228. In the Merchant 
Taylors’ School the teaching staff were permitted to grant one remedy 
per week upon Tuesday or Thursday afternoon when no ‘‘Holliday’’ 
fell in that week, but in the weeks in which holidays fell, no remedies 
were to be granted.—Statutes, 1561. Carlisle, ii., 56. The provision at 
St. Paul’s was the most rigorous, however. It reads: ‘‘I will also that 
they (the children) shall have no Remedyes. Yf the Maister grantith 
any Remedyes, he shall forfeit 40s., totiens quotiens, excepte the Kyng 
or an Archbishopp, or a Bishop present in his own person in the Scole

was in the summer term five hours, in the winter term four hours, 
that the afternoon session varied from four to five hours in the

total number of hours per day varied from nine to ten in the

that the average number of hours per day for the year varied

7 Even when so constructed the building was not infrequently located 
in a church yard, e. g., schoolhouse erected in 1582 in Faversham was 
Jocated on the north side of the church yard. (Carlisle, i., 575.) The 
school at Rochdale was to be located on a site in the church yard given 
by the vicar for that purpose. (1565, Carlisle, i., 718). 
73 Thus the schoolhouse at Hampton was situated in the church yard 
(Will, 1556. C.C. R., ix., 282), while in Ringwood a stone house standing 
in the churchyard was to be converted into a schoolhouse (Founder’s 
Will, 1587. C. C. R., xiv., 529). 
™ The school in Witton was held in the parish church. (Carlisle, i., 
133)- 
%8The school in Wymondham was held in the Chapel of the Virgin 
Mary and St. Thomas a Becket (Letters Patent, 1559. Carlisle, ii., 199; 
also Deed, 1577. S. I. C., xiii., 387); in Ashburton in the Chapel of St. 
Lawrence (Deed, 1593. S. I. C., xiv., 275); in the Parish of St. Mary 
Redcliff, Bristol, in the Chapel of the Holy Ghost, a building 26 ft. x 56 
ft. situated in the churchyard of St. Mary Redcliff (Letters Patent, 1571, 
Barrett, History and Antiquities of Bristol, 596); in St. Albans in a chapel 
in the east end of the Abbey Church (C. C. R., xxv., 177; also Ashdown, 
St. Albans, 158); and in Crediton in Lady Chapel of the Old Cathedral 
Church, (S. I. C., xiv., 289). In Yeovil the chapel was converted into a 
school house at an expense of £12 13s. 4d., which was borne by the 
parish. (Account of Church Wardens, 1573. C. C. R., iv., 325).

hall’* or chantry house.) When not so located and when built 
especially tor schoolpurposes the schoolhouse was generally 
erected at the expense of the community,?> the cost varying 
from £34 8s. to £600.7" It is very probable that some of the 
schoothouses, especially the converted chapels, were not com- 
fortable in the winter season, as was the case in Louth where 
the children suffered from the cold in the Church of St. Mary 
the Virgin until 1560 when a new building was erected by the 
governors.*° The schoolhouse was generally surrounded by a 
small vard which was inclosed by a high stone wail penetrated 
by the little ‘‘school gate."’™! 
    
In Basingstoke the school was located in 1583-8 in the Chapel of 
the ancient fraternity of the Holy Ghost (Baigent and Millard, History 
of Basingstoke, 668); in Norwich in the ‘‘ Frater or Firmary’’ belonging 
to the dissolved Convent of the Black Friars, (Carlisle, ii., 184); in Reading 
in the Hall of the nunnery, St, John’s Hospital (Coates, The History and 
Antiquities of Reading, 312); in Nantwich in the Common Hall of the 
Guild, a timber building situated in the church yard (G- N: -C.,-225; 
also Hall, History of Nantwich, 277). 
™The schoolhouse of Martley, near Worcester, was formerly the 
Chantry House (Carlisle, ii., 767). 
8 Cj. supra 13, footnote 22. The schoolhouse at Faversham was erected 
‘by general benevolence and an assessment upon the whole town (Car- 
lisle, i., 575). In Kirkby Kendal the land for the site was granted by a 
private individual while the building was erected in 1588 by a subscription 
opened in 1582 to which all classes contributed (Nicholson, Annals of 
Kendal, 189). In 1576 the schoolhouse in Marlborough had to be 
‘‘propped up;’’ in 1577 a mew one was erected by the mayor and bur- 
gesses (Waylen, History oj Marlborough, 465). The mayor and burgesses 
of Boston erected the new schoolhouse in 1567; it was built of brick and 
situated in the Mart yard where the great annual fair was held (White- 
field, Homes of Our Fathers in Boston, Old England, and Boston, New 
England, 24). It should also be noted that the expenses incurred in con- 
verting a chapel into a schoolhouse were frequently borne by the commu- 
nity, as in Yeovil where the expenses were borne by the parish (1573, 
Ss. C., xXiv., 247): 
“The total cost of the schoolhouse erected in Louth in 1557-8 was 
£34 8s. (cj. Appendix R). The cost of the school at Marlborough was 
4112 (Waylen, History of Marlborough, 465), of that at Kirkby Kendal 
£159 18s. 3d. (Nicholson, Annals of Kendal, 189), of that at Boston 
tgs 11d. (Thompson, The History and Antiquities of Boston, 238), of 
that at St. Bees in 1587 £300 (C. C. R., iii., 12), and of that at Kingston-

In such ‘‘places of learning’’ the beginner came at the age 
of six to nine to spend so many hours of the next five or six® 
years of his life to be trained intellectually, morally, and spirit- 
ually. What we have noted concerning the curriculum," its. 
content and method, will explain in part this enormous amount 
of time spent in the training of the pupil.** The ground to be 
covered was extensive; the classes to be taught were numerous 
and variously graded; and the teacher was compelled to use 
some form of the lecture method, since his pupils were not as 
a rule supplied with books. In a few instances the pupils 
were required to be supplied with books,*’ but even in some of 
these cases they were not deprived of the privileges of the school 
8 This was the length of time which the pupil might spend at the 
school in Oundle. It was necessary to obtain the consent of the governors 
to remain longer.—Statutes, 1556. Carlisle, 216. 
88 In Sandwich no pupil was ‘‘to tarrie aboue sixe yeres in learninge 
there, without a great cawse alleged and allowed by the said governors,’’ 
while no pupil was to be taken from the school ‘‘under one monethes 
warninge and not otherwiese but by publique order in the presence 
of the major or his deputie and twoe of his brethren, and so openlie 
to take his leave, and further shewinge some probable cause of his depar- 
ture.’’—Statutes, 1580. Boys, History of Sandwich, 226. 
% Cf. Chapter IV. 
®5 Concerning this subject Mr. Fearon in his report (S. I. C., vii., 264) 
says: ‘‘The great amount of time spent,in school by the boys according 
to this time-table (cf. Appendix P) may, perhaps, be explained by remark- 
ing the following facts: (1) The scholars were broken up into small classes 
Lice es each of which classes was to do work more or less differing from 
that of the others. It is not probable that the boys did much real hard 
work, except when actually engaged with the teachers. (2) Owing to 
the scarcity and dearness of books, all lessons in the classical authors 
were prepared with the master. He must have done orally for the boys 
the work that the Latin Primer, grammar, exercise book, lexicon, dic- 
tionary of antiquities, classical atlas, gradus, and numerous other hand- 
books. = yar now perform. The boys could not then, as now, prepare 
a piece of Virgil quietly by themselves........ their business consists in 
remembering and reproducing on a subsequent occasion what he has told 
them.’’ x

prefering them to higher places.’’ The ‘‘slothful and untoward’’ were 
to be ‘‘dispraised and displaced’’ in order that ‘‘either for love of com- 
mendation or fear of shame’’ they might be provoked ‘‘to learn and 
profit at their books.’’—Statutes, 1583. Carlisle, i., L575 Z

of this period, e.g., cf. the seal of the school at Louth, a print of which

* The following case is probably an extreme one: ‘‘The Schoolmaster 
(of Braintry), Mr. Denman, was very able, and excellent in his faculty; 
but exceedingly austere, insomuch that the eldest son John, tho’ of 
good parts, yet not bearing the severity of his Master, grew so out of 
love with learning, that his parents were forced to take him home. But 
William, on the contrary, being of excellent natural parts, and especially of a strong memory, had such a love to learning that no harshness of 
his Master could beat him off, but rather it so heightened his diligence, 
that his proficiency did not seem to contend with, and even to conquer 
his Master’s rigour, yet with a bloody victory: For ona time he received 
such a blow from his cholerick Master, that he was beaten off a pair of stairs, and had one side of his head so bruis’d, that the blood gush’d 
out of his ear, and his hearing was in consequence so impair’d that 
he became in process of time wholly deaf on that side.’’—A True Relation 
of the Life and Death of William Bedell, Camden Society Publications,

regular and punctual in attendance,” to memorize and recite 
their lessons, and to speak Latin in_and near the school.” While     
    The tardy pupil at Seven Oaks was to be ‘‘corrected by the Master 
and in his absence by the usher, but not rigorously.’’—Statutes, 1574, 
Carlisle, i., 622. 
® The custom of speaking Latin at school was not uncommon. In 
Sandwich (Statutes, 1580. Boys, History of Sandwich, 228) the master 
and usher were to speak in the ‘‘lattyn tonge to their schollers that do 
understand the same;’’ in Hawkeshead (Statutes, 1588. Cowper, Hawks- 
head, 481) the pupils were to ‘‘contynuallie use the latyne tongue, or 
the Greeke tongue within the Schole, as they shall be able;’’ while in 
Oundle the pupils were to speak Latin to each other ‘‘as well in the Schol 
as coming and going to and from the same’’ (Statutes, 1556. Carlisle, 
11.237): 
The task of compelling the pupils to speak in Latin was not an easy 
one. Spoudeus in Brinsley’s Grammar School, p. 212 thus describes the 
difficulties :—‘‘This I haue found passing hard to acquaint my schollars 
withall, to bring them to any ripeness or commendable faculty, but still 
they will speake as a boy who is saying his lesson; though I haue both 
directed them how to pronounce, vttering the sentences oft before them, 
and haue very much called vpon them for the same......... I haue 
laboured and striuen by Ferula, and all means of seuerity, yet haue 
not benne able to make my Schollars to vtter their mindes in any 
tollerable manner, of ordinary things, but in very barbarous phrase, nor 
so much as to put it in practice amongst themselves; much lesse to vtter 
their minds in Latine easily, purely, and freely as it were to be wished.’’ 
The common practice seems to have been to require the Latin conversa- 
tion only in the higher forms. Thus, in Guisbrough the pupils of the two 
higher forms were to ‘‘speak nothing within the School-house but Latin, 
saving only in teaching of the lower forms.’’—Statutes, 1561. Carlisle, 
ii, 806. Cf. also Brinsley, The Grammar School, 214. 
As the pupils would persist in speaking English and winking at each 
other when out of the master’s sight (Brinsley, Grammar School, 219), 
the custom of appointing Custodes grew up. It and the evils arising from 
it are thus described by Brinsley (loc. cit.) :— 
‘‘That is a vsuall custome in Schooles to appoint Custodes, or Asini 
(as they are tearmed in some places) to obserue and catch them who 
speake English in each fourme, or whom they see idle, to giue them the 
Ferula, and to make them Custodes if they cannot answere a question 
which they aske....... Oftimes, he who is the Custos will hardly attend 
his own worke, for harkening to heare others to speake English. 
“‘Also there falleth out amongst them oft-times so much wrangling 
about the questions, or defending themselues, that they did not speake 
English, or were not idle, that the whole fourme is troubled. So like- 
wise when the Custodes are called for, before breaking up at dinner and 
at night, there will be so much contention amongst them, as is a dis- 
quieting and trouble to the Master. Moreouer, that I haue obserued, that

some of the pupils may have had ‘‘their diligence heightened’’ 
by such treatment,*® not a few came to dislike both.school.and 
learning, and, according to Brinsley,’ ‘‘thought themselves 
very, happy, if their parents would set them to any servile or 
toiling business, so that they might keep from school.’’ While 
the dislike thus fostered was revealed in some places by barring 
out the master at certain seasons of the year,’ yet submission 
euer if there be any one simple in a fourme or harder of learning then 
the rest, they will make him a right Asinus, causing such to be the Cus- 
todes continually, or for the most part, if they cannot answere: and to 
this end will be alwayes watching them; whereby many such are not 
only notably abused, but very much discouraged for being scholars, 
when they see themselues so baited at by all; some others are made ouer 
malipart thereby.’’

101 The custom is mentioned in the following terms in the Statutes 
of the school at Witton (1558, Carlisle, i., 133): ‘‘A weeke before Christ- 
mas and Easter (according to the old Custome) they barre and keepe 
forth of the Schoole the Schoolemaster in such sort as others Scholers doe 
in great Schooles.’’ Mr. Sinclair in his History of Wigan, vol. 1., i82, 
says concerning this custom:—‘‘The custom was allowed by deeds of 
endowment in many schools and was looked forward to by the boys 
with greater glee than if it were a holiday. Under the captaincy of the 
head boy on a special day, generally before Christmas, books were packed 
away, the army of pupils arrayed, and the master pushed roughly or 
gently, according as he was a tyrant or favorite, to the door. Then all 
hands to work; forms and desks were piled one above the other behind the 
door with the master’s chair on top. The door was barricaded and the 
master barred out. Then there were wild revelry and lusty cheers. 
The head boy took the cane and in the middle of a ring of smiling pupils 
broke it and threw the pieces to be broken by the younger furies. In a 
few minutes was heared a knocking at the door, and everyone knowing 
well it was the exiled master called out, ‘‘Who’s there?’’ ‘‘It is I, open, 
you rogues!’’ the master would call in pretentious fury. But they were 
masters of the situation and would only open conditionally. The condi- 
tions were that all past and present offenses should be forgiven, and on no 
others would the door be open. At last the master would feebly yield to 
the conditions and be admitted with three hearty good cheers—no 
punishments for that day,—and the usual routine commenced.’’ It may 
have been with an eye on the possibility of injury to school property in 
escapades similar to this just described that the following article was 
included in the Statutes of the school at St. Albans: ‘‘If anything shall 
be broken or any hurt done anything belonging to the school by any of the 
scholars, the same shall be repaired forthwithand amended at the charges 
of the friends of the child that did that hurt, and if the friends refuse

was necessary, since resistance meant expulsion.'% Did the 
pupil leave one school for another he was liable to run the risk 
of being denied re-admittance to the former,’ while in some 
to amend the said hurt, being thereunto required, upon such refusal 
the child that did the hurt shall be banished the school until his friends 
have satisfied the said hurt.’’—Statutes, 1570. Carlisle, i. 516. 
12 Thus the founder of the school at Witton wills ‘‘that all the Schol- 
lars of what estate, condition, or degree soever they be, shall submit 
themselves to due correction of the Schoolmaster, which at their entrance 
shall be promised as well by their Friends as themselves,...... which 
correction shall always be referred to the direction of the Schoolmaster, 
and not to the opinion or mind of the Schollars, and for disobedience 
and resistance thereof they shall be expelled the School for ever, unless 
their Friends by earnest suitors to the Schoolmaster, and can prevail 
with him and get in such sort that their humble stubborness;...... 
And also forseeing the great inconveniency and enormity that wilful 
persons and ignorant, who had rather Children through dissolutness and 
over much liberty should commit offences worthy of punishment, to their 
shame and undoing, then to have them corrected by the discretion of the 
Schoolmaster, according to the quality, quantity, and gravity of their 
(OfENCES! 2h ais and upon complaint of the Children, their Parents come 
to molest and disquiet the Schoolmaster against reason and order, I will 
that all such mentioned Children, after due proof of such folly and fond- 
ness of the Parents herein, shall be utterly expelled this School for ever, 
unless they shall be able to prove that the Correction done was unreason- 
able and that to be proved before and to the Feoffees of the said School 
and Overseers for the time being:’’—Statutes, 1558. Carlisle, i., 132. 
In Kirkby Stephen any pupil ‘‘despising the master’s authority and his 
reasonable correction’’ was to be expelled until he gained the consent 
of the governors and the patron of the school to return and was ready 
‘‘to receive the schoolmaster’s reasonable correction.’’—Statutes, 1566. 
Carlisle, ii., 718. 
1 In the case of St. Paul’s the statute dealing with this subject reads 
as follows :— 
‘‘Yff any Childe after he is receyved and admitted into the Scole, 
go to any other Scole, to learne there after the maner of that Scole, 
than I will that suche Childe for no man’s suite shall be hereafter received

shall be better learninge. And this I will be shewed unto his friendes. 
or other that offer him at his first presenting into the Scole.’’ Carlisle, 
ii., 76. While the statutes of the Merchant Taylors’ School were equally 
tigorous (1561, Carlisle, ii., 56), those of the school at Sandwich provided 
that the pupil might be re-admitted upon ‘‘special consent of the master 
and that upon such cawse as shalbe allowed by the said governours.’’—

this p e of education was very definite. Silent on the sub- 
ject of the intellectual preparation of its schoolmasters it in- 
sisted that they should be men who ‘“‘professed the true relig- 
jon.’’#3 Silent also concerning the details of the secular life 
of these masters, it insisted not less forcibly that the appropriate 
hours of Sunday and Holydays be spent by them in attendance 
upon divine service.* The same injunctions which made the 
use of Kings Grammar compulsory contained also the three 
following articles: 
“XLI. Item. That all teachers of children shall stir and 
move them to live and do reverence to god’s true religion now 
truely set forth by public authority. 
“XLII. Item. That they shall accustom their scholars 
reverently to learn such sentences or scriptures as shall be most 
expedient to induce them to all godliness.   
    in which the school was situated. In some places permission was given 
to the teaching staff to furnish board and lodging for such pupils (cf. 
supra, 92). In Gilpin’s School in Houghton la Spring a large number of 
the boys attending the school were boarded and lodged in Gilpin’s house 
free of all charge (D. N. B., XXI., 379). In Sandwich the pupils were to 
board and room in Sandwich or within a mile and a half of the town. If 
the pupil did not live with the master or usher, the party who took 
him to board was to ‘‘faithfully promise to the master before his...... 
admission to keep him contynually from all unthriftie pastimes and games 
in his howse, and further to lett the master betimes haue informacion in 
case that they be lewdlie occupied within or without his howse, not in 
aney pointe boulstringe up their evil;’’ upon failure to keep this promise 
complaint was to be made by the master to the governors, and if the evil 
were not then reformed, the party was to be deprived and excluded ‘‘from 
having aney schollers of this school to boerde.’’ It should also be noted 
that parents having boys in school were to exercise the same diligence 
and that failure to do so meant the dismissal of the boy from the school. 
—Statutes, 1580. Boys, History of Sandwich, 226-227. : 
In Oundle the parents of a boy who was to board in the town were to 
consult the master and usher so that the boy might not be placed in a 
family where it was known that ‘‘the good man and his wife were such as 
should give example to the scholars to follow gaming or other vain 
pastimes not meet for students.’’—Statutes, Eliz. Carlisle, ii., 217.

The attitude of the Church was not less definite. In their 
visitations, bishops were to inquire into the religious condition 
of master and pupils,"* while clergymen were to give religious 
instruction to the children.” Both State and Church"® were 
alive to the danger from papist and puritan masters, whose 
influence, in spite of the vigorous action taken against them, 
continued to be felt.1! 
The interest of the school in the religious education of its 
pupils was not less than that manifested by State and Church. 
With these institutions it insisted upon its masters possessing 
certain religious qualifications'?* and the stamp of approval of 
the bishop of the diocese in which the school was situated. 
It was left to the school to attend to the details of that train- 
ing which was to realize the ideals of State and Church, to 
devote itself to the religious education of its pupils. In this 
education emphasis was placed upon instruction and devo- 
tional exercises.

Religious Instruction 
The character of this instruction was doctrinal and dogma- 
tic. The chief text book appears to have b Nowell’s 
Catechism. The English catechism “was” some 
places for admission to the School;"* while in others it was taught 
‘usher. In the higher - forms the Latin and Greek trans- 
lations were learned,'* and in some instances the Greek New 
Testament and a Latin translation of the Ten Commandments 
were read.’ The character of the texts used indicate that the 
method of instruction was chiefly catechetical,” the pupil 
in some places being examined not only in his catechism, but 
also on the sermon preached in the parish church the preceding    
    
  Sunday.'8 a 
Devotional Exercises 
While intellectual religious conceptions were developed through ) 
instruction, effort was made through the devotional exercises 
of the Church and school to develop the emotional and volitional | 
phases of the religious life. The devotional exercises of the. 
Church were her services.* Upon these services pupils as well

x., 194. At Bungay (Statutes, 1591. S. I. C., xiii, 135) the scholars 
were every Saturday afternoon to learn ‘‘all such things as concern the 
Christian faith and religion, both in Latin and English.’’

instruction. Thus in East Retford one of the pupils every Sunday was to

nion, as well for their own instruction as for the instruction of other 
young Children.’’—Statutes, 1552. Carlisle, ii., 284. 
130In Burford the scholars were to come to the house of the master 
every Sunday morning at eight to say prayers and to go with him to the 
parish church; when there was no service, they were to sing ‘‘ psalms and 
read a chapter in the school.’’—Monk, History of Burford, 134. In Oundle 
all the pupils, upon the Sabbath and Holydays, were to ‘‘resort to the

While the items of information concerning church attendance 
are thus rather meagre, the statute of the School at Sandwich 
concerning this subject is complete and interesting enough to 
be quoted in full. It reads as follows: 
‘‘Ttem, I ordeine, that all the Schollers upon the Sabbath date 
and holy daies resort in dewe time to the Schole-house, and from 
thence by two and two in order to goe to Devyne Service in the nexte 
Parishe Churche in Sandwich wherein English Service is used, 
the Master, if he be there, going before them, and the Ussher, 
if he be there, after them; but one of them at least being present 
to oversee them; And, in like order to departe by two and two 
owte of the churche when the Master or Ussher then present 
shall apointe them to departe. And, on every Saturday in 
the afternoon, before their going to churche, the Master and 
Ussher or one of them with all the Schollers devoutlie on their 
knees, the Schollers aloud, to saie one prescribed forme of 
Praier, wherein shall be made mencion of the Church, the Realme, 
the Prince, the Estate of the Towne, and the Fownder and his 
Posteritie. And I ordayne, that the Master and Ussher duelie 
everie Munday or nexte Schole day after the Sabbath daie, in the 
morning call to reconing all such of the Schollers as ither absent 
themselves from such comminge to the Churche, or from being 
att the Churche, or came tardy to it, or otherwise use not them- 
selves reverentlie there in prayer, everie of them having a Prayer 
booke in Latyne or English according to the Master his appoint- 
ment, and in that behalfe to use correccion as shal be convenient, 
and that by the said Governours there be appointed in the 
Churche, place convenient for the said Schollers to be together, 
and not any other boyes or children to be there emongst them, 
183Jn Oundle each of the scholars, ‘‘as the master shall appoint,’’ 
was to have a Prayer Book, either in Latin or English.—Statutes, Eliz. 
Carlisle, ii., 218. 
1% In East Retford those scholars ‘‘apt and meet for the same’’ were 
to ‘‘help in the Quire to maintain the said Divine Service there.’’— 
Statutes, 1552. Carlisle, ii, 284. The scholars of St. Albans while 
in the church, either before or in the serivce itself, ‘‘kneeling on their 
knees’’ were to say after the master or Curate, the Lord’s Prayer, the 
Ten Commandments, and prayers for the Royal Foundress and other 
Benefactors of the school.—Statutes, 1570. Carlisle, i, 515.

While attending the services of the Church, the school also 
held devotional exercises. Sometimes these were in the church 
as in the case of Kirkby Stephen,'** but more often they were 
held in the schoolhouse.'* As a rule they appear to have been 
of the nature of morning and evening pravers,"* which consisted 
of either reading from the bible, singing psalms, and saying 
prayers,'** or merely saying prayers.4° These prayers were 
8 Statutes, 1563. Carlisle, i., 603. 
The Statute referring to these exercises reads as follows:— 
“‘And, I will that every morning and evening at Six of the clock, 
which are the days for learning of Schollers and keeping of Schoole, the 
Schollers by two and two, and the Schoolmaster, shall go from the School- 
house into the Parish Church, and there devoutly upon their knees before 
they doe enter the quire say some devout prayer, and after the same they 
shall repaire to-gether into the Chappell or quire, where I have made 
and sett up a tomb, and there sing together one of these psalms hereafter 
instituted, such as the Schoolmaster shall appoint....... so as every of 
the said psalmes be sung within fifteen days together, (viz.) 103: 130: 
145: 46:3: 61: 24: 30: 90: 96: 100: 51: 84: 86:45: ...... and that done, 
repaire to the School house, and in the evening quietly to their lodgings; 
and if any of the Schollers be absent at any time of the said prayers 
or psalmes, then the Schoolmaster to doe due correction for his or their 
absence.’’—Statutes, 1580. Carlisle, ii., 717. 
‘' Prayers were to be said daily in the school at Moulton.—Statutes, 
1560. Carlisle, i., 837. 
88 In Alford the scholars were to say morning prayers ‘‘for the better 
speed and success in their labors;’’ they were also to say prayers at 
five o'clock in the evening before leaving the schoolhouse.—Statutes, 
1599. Carlisle, i., 784. In St. Bees the scholars, the usher, and the 
master were with ‘‘audible and distinct voice’’ to say prayers ‘‘upon their 
knees, both at their coming and departing.’’—Statutes, 1583. Carlisle, 
i, 161. In St. Albans the master and pupils “every working day in the 
morning at their first coming’’ were to say ‘‘upon their knees, the Suf- 
frages, the Lord’s Prayer,’’ and prayers for the Foundress and other 
benefactors,. 3}: “‘And every Evening, before they depart the School, 
the Ten Commandments, the Lord’s Prayer, and the Creed.’’—Statutes, 
1570. Carlisle, i., 516. 
°In Bunbury some portion of the Scrintures was read and prayers 
were said at the meeting of the school; before dinner some portion of the 
New Testament was to be rendered from Greek or Latin into English, 
while at night before their departure the pupils were to read a chapter 
from the Bible, to sing a psalm, and to say prayers, each pupil, ‘‘according 
to his capacity and his friends’ ability, to be provided with a Bible, 
Testament, and Service Book.’’—Founder’s Will, 1§94.. C.C.R., x. 194.

sometimes appointed by the master,'! not infrequently by some 
Church official, while in some cases they were prescribed by 
the founders or by the governors.'* Their character can be 
judged best by considering some of the prayers themselves. 
The following cases are typical and will indicate the chief charac- 
teristics of prayers said by the pupils in the daily devotional 
exercises of the schools. 
441 In Sandwich the master and usher, or one of them at least, with 
their pupils were ‘‘at halfe hower before seaven of the clock, firste de- 
voutely kneling on their knees’’ to ‘‘praie to almightie God according to 
the fourme by the master prescribed,-on every schole daie,’’ and likewise 
in the evening before leaving the school they were ‘‘devoutly on their 
knees’’ to pray ‘‘in fourme by the master to be prescribed.’’—Statutes 
1580. Boys, History of Sandwich, 288. Similarly in Oundle the morning 
and evening prayers were to be in the form prescribed by the master but 
they were always to contain mention of the Church, the Queen’s Majesty, 
the Realm, the Lady Laxter (wife of the founder), and the Company of 
Grocers of London (the governors of the school).—Statutes, Eliz. Car- 
lisle.., ii., 2Ty. 
12 Daily ‘‘at their coming to school in the morning and at their de- 
parture at night and at such time as they go to play’’ the pupils of 
the school at Seven Oaks were to say ‘‘such prayers as shall be appointed 
by the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury’s Grace.’’ These prayers were to 
be ‘‘written in a table and kept in the school for the same purpose.’’ 
On every Friday morning throughout the year, the pupils were to hear the 
Procession said or sung, after which they were to pray for the ‘‘good 
estate of the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury’’ and to give God thanks for 
the benefits bestowed upon them by their benefactors, ‘‘in such manner 
and sort as shall be prescribed in the said Table.’’—Statutes, 1574. 
Carlisle, i., 622. In Burford, the master was to exhort his scholars four 
times a year ‘‘to give thanks to God,’’ and he was then to recite the names 
of all the founders and benefactors of the school, and then they were to 
sing a psalm and ‘“‘depart from the school.’’"—Monk, Hist. of Burjord 134. 
18 The following statute was made by the founder of the school at 
Witton concerning this subject :— 
‘‘And that they thrice a day serve God in the School, rendering him 
thanks for his goodness done to them, craving his especial grace that 
they may profit in virtuous learning to his honor and glory, praying for 
the Soul of their Founder by name, and for the Souls of his Father and 
Mother and all Christian Souls,...... and once every week, that is to say 
on the Friday, to say the Seven Penetential Psalms with the Litany of 
Prayer and Collect, and every second Friday the Psalms of the Passion 
with Psalms of Mercy and de Profundis with a Collect at the end thereof, 
ce and once a year, that is to say on Jesus Day in the afternoon, in 
whose name this school is erected in the Parish Church aforesaid, to say 
the Dirigay and Comondasony.’’—Statutes, 1558. Carlisle, i., 133.

The founder of the school at Hawkeshead, Bishop Sands, 
Archbishop of York, treats the subject in his Statutes as follows: 
‘‘Also I ordayne and Constytute, that certayne godlye Prayers 
hereafter set downe and ymediatelie followinge in these Con- 
stytucons, be made in the said schole by the scholemaster for

Made possible by the gifts and endowments of many men and 
organizations and maintained through the labors of governors 
and masters, the influences just described were such as tended 
to develop in the grammar-school boys of this period a peculiar 
type of character moulded by Morality and Religion as well as by 
Scholarship. As an ideal, the realization of this type of charac- 
ter in the lives of deserving boys furnished the most powerful 
motives for the foundation and maintenance of the schools; as 
a standard, it was applied to determine the type of master who 
was to control as well as to be a part of these influences; while 
as the chief educational aim of this period, it determined both 
content and method of the curriculum of the English Grammar 
Schools of the Elizabethan Age.

lowing item: 
“Item, Whether your grammar school be well ordered? Whether the 
number of children thereof be furnished? How many wanteth; and by 
whose default? Whether they be diligently and godly brought up in the

receyved for money or rewards; and by whom? Whether the statuts, 
foundations, and other ordinances touching the same grammar school,

or interest therein, be kept? by whom is it not observed; by whose 
fault?’’—Strype, Life of Parker, Vol. iii., 135.

nances of the same school. And that once every year a full and 
perfect account be made of all the revenues belonging to the said 
school, before the Bishop there, or his substitute, the first week of 
November yearly without any fraud, delay or collusion.’’—Strype, Life 
of Grindle, 317. 
Letter of Queen’s Council to Archbishop Grindle, June 18, 1580. 
‘‘And for as much as a great deal of the corruption in religion grown 
throughout the realm, proceedeth of lewd schoolmasters, that teach and 
instruct children as well publicly as privately in men’s houses; infecting 
eachwhere the youth without regard had unto (a matter... .chiefly to 
be looked into by every Bishop within his diocese) it is thought meet for 
redress thereof, that you cause all such schoolmasters as have charge of 
children, to be by the Bishop of the diocese, or such as he shall appoint, 
examined touching their religion: and if they shall be found corrupt and 
unworthy, to be displaced, and proceeded withal as other recusants; and 
fit and sound persons placed in their rooms.’’—Strype, Life of Grindle,

known to resort to public services and to be of sound religion; doth he 
teach the catechism to his scholars which was set out for that purpose; 
and doth he train up his scholars in the knowledge of true religion now 
established and in obedience to the Prince or no.’’ Strype, Life of 
Whitgijt, Appendix, vol. iii., 179. Also Cardwell’s Annals, ii., 7.

Copy of a letter from Sir John Dean, founder of the School at Witton, 
toa friend concerning some trouble in the election of the master at Witton." 
‘‘After my hertie comondacons, whereas I am crediblie enformed by 
the report of Mr. John Maisterson and Philip Downes, your neyboures 
and parishioners, that there is contencon amongst you about the noatinge 
and choosinge of a schoolmaster in your towne; I have thought good, as 
one to whome me thinke the thing being by me founded apperteyneth, 
to require and will you, that in your contencon you have some regard to 
my meanynge in the foundation and therewithall to dispose the same 
upon some virtuous and learned, and ahable man for that purpose, 
leaving your affections asside, and bynde your elecon simplie upon the

the schole, were openlve redde in the church at my last being there. 
th’ etfect whereof in this parte is, that he shall be chosen and admitted 
by the bishopp of Chester for the tyme being.” or else by the schole-master 
of the Free-schole in the citie of Chester aforesaid, which ordre methinks 
you should not breake. The premises well wayd ad consideredd, I 
praie you send me up the statutes hither to London, to th’ intent I may 
set my hande to them in confyrmacon, and in the meane tyme those that 
you have, to hange them up in the schole; further you shall understand 
my meanynge and will is, that 2 feoffees shall be chosen to receyve the 
rentes of the landes, and shall give account yerelye for the same to the 
other feoffees and to the churchwardens of Wytton for the time being;* 
and that those two bailiff feoffees, together with the churchwardens 
aforesaid, shail, from tyme to tyme, yerely, surveye the reparac’ons 
necessary to be done, and make declarac’ons thereof to the rest of the 
feoffees. And besides theyes myn entent and meynyng is, that this my 
letter shall be redde in your church to th’ end your hool parishe may 
knowe my minde in the same, and thus I bydd you hertylye farewell.

? The section treating this subject in the statutes reads: 
‘‘Also, because friendship and ignorance might be an occasion that 
oftentimes the Schollars be frustrate of a Master as aforesaid, I will that 
those Feoffees and certain honest men of the Parish of Witton aforesaid, 
shall present, such a one as they procure and elect, before his admission 
into the School, to the Bishop of Chester, and to the Schoolmaster thereof 
(The Kings’ School) for the time being, to be examined of them and to be 
found and thought meet for that vocation.’’ Statutes, 1558. Carlisle,

‘‘The lower boys had to decline and conjugate words, and their seniors 
had to repeat rules of grammar, for the illustration of which short phrases, 
called ‘Vulgaria’ were composed and committed to memory. Some 
sort of Latin composition, however brief, was a necessary portion of 
the daily work of every Eton scholar. In the lower forms it was con- 
fined to the literal translation of an English sentence or passage, while 
in the Fifth Form it consisted of a theme on a subject set by the school- 
master. The boys in the Sixth and Seventh Forms used to write verses.’’?

‘‘O Most merciful God and giver of all understanding which, at the 
invocation of the faithful, hast ever given things necessary for the setting 
forth of thy Glory, as the examples of all ages recordeth, and for because 
nothing is more needful than Wisdom and Understanding we there- 
fore congregate in this place to learn the same, most humbly beseech thee, 
O Eternal Father, so to illuminate our Wits and Understandings, that we 
may have our whole affection upon Wisdom in these years of our infancy. 
And furthermore may ever after receive, love, and embrace, the same, and 
accordingly to the precepts thereof may direct our acts, and last of all 
that the true Wisdom of God may so shine in all our living, as may be to 
the Glory and Praise of him from whom all Wisdom cometh. Grant this 
we beseech thee, O God, for the love of thy most dearly beloved son Jesus 
Christ, Our Lord and Saviour. So be it.’

APPENDED AY: 
Brier Discussion oF GRAMMAR SCHOOL STATUTES. 
In a large number of cases the right to make statutes was included among 
the powers granted in the Letters Patent to the corporation (Cj. text, 
Pp. 40), but in some cases the only authority appears to have proceeded 
from the will of the founder (e.g., Stone, Uttoxeter, and Stevenage, 
Founder’s Will (1558). Carlisle, ii., 498). 
While in some instances as in Saint Bees (Letters Patent granted 
and statutes drawn up in same year. Carlisle, i., 152-3) and in Hawkes- 
head (Statutes drawn up three years after Letters Patent were granted, 
Cowper, Hawkshead, 482ff) the statutes were made soon after the authority 
was granted, this was by no means the common case (In Hartlebury 
7 years (1558-1565) elapsed between the two dates;—Carlisle ii., 758. 
In Grantham 18 years (1553-1571);—Carlisle, i., 805. In Alford 23 
years (1576-1599);—Carlisle, i, 780. In Faversham 28 years (1576- 
1604);—Edward Jacob, History of Faversham, 55. In Birmingham 124 
years (1552-1676);—Carlisle, ii, 622. In Ashbore 211 years (1585- 
1796);—S. I. C., xvi., 463. While Kendle (Carlisle, ii., 712), Pockling- 
ton (Carlisle, ii, 863), and Reading (Coates, Reading, !315) appear 
to have been without written statutes as late as the beginning of the 
1gth century) and from the cases just cited it will appear that not a 
few schools must have been without written statutes during the period 
of our study. 
The privilege of making the statutes was granted (a) to the founders 
(cf. Text, p. 17) or their heirs (cf. Text, p. 17), (b) to college authorities 
(cf. Text, p. 32), (c) to guilds (cf. Text, p. 32-33), (d) to town corpora- 
tions (cj. Text, p. 36), (e) to incorporated governors (cf. Text, ‘Disa 
also Appendix F,) (f) to men not officially connected with the school, 
as at St. Albans, where the statutes were made by Sir Nicholas Bacon 
(Statutes quoted Carlisle, i., 514), at Grantham, where they were made by 
Nicholas, Bishop of Lincoln, and Sir William Cecil, Knight (Carlisle, i., 
806), at Wellingborough, where they were made in 1596 by Sir Thomas 
Egerton Knight, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal (Carlisle, ii., 227), and 
(g) to church dignitaries as at Colchester, where the statutes were to be 
made by John Lord Bishop of London and by Alexander Nowell, Dean 
of St. Paul and their successors (Letters Patent, 1584; Joseph Strutt, 
Colchester, i., 119; also C. C. R., xxxii., pt. 4., 526) and at Brentwood 
where they were to be made by Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London 
and Dean Nowell (Carlisle, i., 408). 
As has been noted in the text, page 52, these statutes were as a rule 
to be made with the advice and consent of some bishop of the church 
or of some other learned church dignitary, or when made were to be 
confirmed by such persons (Cj. Appendixes E and F). Thus in one of 
the cases just cited, (Grantham) the statutes received the confirmation 
of Thomas, Bishop of Lincoln, in 1571; the statutes made by the Parson, 
two Wardens, and four Assistants were confirmed in 1574 by the Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury (Carlisle, i., 619); while those made for the school

at Tunbridge by the Skinners’ Company of London were submitted 
to Dean Nowell and after having been slightly corrected by him were 
submitted to Archbishop Parker (Carlisle, i.,627). In one of the instances 
in which no mention is made of the necessity of the statutes being ap- 
proved by the bishop uf the diocese, the statutes were to be made by 
the Governors of the school together with the Warden or sub-warden 
and six senior fellows of All Souls College, Oxford (case of Faversham 
given in Jacob’s History of Faversham, 55), while in High Wycombe 
they were not to be at variance with the laws of the realm (Letters 
Paten’, 1562. C. C. R., xxvi., 150). 
The general purpose or aim of the statutes was to ‘‘better regulate 
and order’’ the affairs of the school as a glance at the outlines of the 
contents of a few will make clear. In Marlborough the mayor and 
burgesses were given the power ‘‘to make proper and wholesome ordi- 
nances and statutes in writing concerning the government and order of 
the schoolmaster and also of the scholars of the school, and other things 
touching or concerning the school’’ (James Waylen, A History of the 
Town of Marlborough, 464). The emphasis is here placed upon the 
educational aspect of the work of the governors. In Alford, however, 
the statutes were to be concerned with the financial rather than educa- 
tional matters (Carlisle, i., 780). In not a few cases, the two phases are 
fairly well balanced. Thus in Kingston upon Thames the governors were 
to make ‘‘fit and salutary written statutes and ordinances concerning 
and touching the ordering, governing, and direction of the master and 
undermaster, and the school aforesaid, and the stipend and salary of 
the said master and under master, and other things touching and 
concerning the said school; and the ordering, governing, preservation, 
and disposal of the rents and revenues appointed and to be appointed 
for the maintenance of the said school’’ (George Roots, The Charters 
of the Town of Kingston upon Thames, 95). Similarly in Bruton the 
statutes and ordinances were in the language of the Letters Patent, to 
be ‘‘concerning and touching the order, government, and direction of 
the schoolmaster and scholars of the school, the nomination, constitution. 
and appointment of the stipend or salary of the schoolmaster, and other 
things touching and concerning the same school, and the order, govern- 
ment, preservation and disposition of the rents and revenues...... of 
the same school’’ (Letters Patent, 1551. Carlisle, ii., 417). 
It has been noted (Text, p. 49, footnote 146) how the common chest 
was used for the preservation of the written statutes. These, however, 
were not intended to be entombed as dead letters, but were to be ‘‘ observed 
inviolably’’ (James Waylen, History of Marlborough, 464). They were 
to be impressed upon governors, teachers, scholars and friends of the 
school. In Hawkeshead the governors upon taking office swore in their 
oath, ‘I will dilligently and faithfully to the uttermost of myne Ability 
keep by myself and cause to be keept by others (as much as I can) inviol- 
ably all these Statutes’’ (For entire oath cf. Text, p. 45). In Saint Bees, 
at the annual meeting of the governors, the statutes were to be read 
before them by either master or usher (Text, p. 47). In the installation 
13

ceremony at East Retford the master and usher were to swear in their 
oath, ‘‘I shall not fraudulently, maliciously, nor wittingly of my part 
neglect or break any Ordinance or Statute of the said School lawfully set 
forth and made, so far as to me doth appertain. But shall invielately 
observe and keep them, and every one of them, as near as God shall give 
me grace’’ (Statutes, 1552. Carlisle, ii, 286); while under similar 
circumstances the master at Kirkby Stephen was to swear, ‘‘ And further 
shall observe all the statutes and ordinances of this schoole now made, 
or hereafter to be made which concern me, and shall doe nothing in the 
prejudice thereof, but help to maintain the same from time to time 
during my aboad herein to the best of my power’’ (Founder’s Statutes. 
Carlisle, ii., 715). One of the duties of the two governors of the school at 
St. Albans was to see that the orders and statutes were obeyed by the 
schoolmaster and scholars (Statutes, Carlisle, i., 514). In Witton, 
at the admission of every schoiar, the schoolmaster was to read the 
Statutes, Orders, Rules and Laws applying to the scholar whose friends 
when the reading had been completed, were to promise that they would see 
to it that the scholar kept all the rules, etc. pertaining to him (Statutes 
Carlisle, i., 132. For further information about the preservation of the 
statutes at Witton cf. Appendix K). 
In order that the statutes might be preserved various means were 
taken to prevent their becoming lost or destroyed. In Kirkby Stephen the 
founder made the following provisions for the preservation of his con- 
stitution: ‘‘And, I will and ordain that these Constitutions shall be 
fair written in parchment’’ (In the account of the expenditure of the 
Bridgemasters of the Borough of Nottingham for the year 1582 there is 
the following: ‘‘Item ye copyes of ye charter and of ye ordinaunces of ye 
Free Schoole, iijs. iiijd.’’"—Records of the Borough of Nottingham, iv., 
zor) ‘‘and shall be sett in a frame of wood, and the same so written and 
made shall be hanged in a convenient place within the chapell wherein 
my tomb is within the church of Kirkby Stephen, and my son and heire 
for the time being, to have one part of the said constitutions fai: written, 
and that part to remain and be in my Chappell of Wharton, and a third 
part ‘to remain and be in the said Free Schoole, to the intent that all 
manner of persons, Schoolmaster, Schollers, and others may knowe the 
said Constitutions for the better executing the same; and if any of the 
said Constitutions by the continuance of time doe frett or wear, so as 
the same cannot be plainly read, that then and before they be so freet 
or worne, they shall be fair written again upon parchment and set and 
kept in the said four places as before in this articule is written, and the 
same to be so written and order by the Governors, my son and heire or 
heires, and the Schoolmaster for the time being or any of them’? (Statutes 
quoted in Carlisle, ii., 719-20). 
The founder’s wish with respect to his statutes was occasionally incor- 
porated in them. The following extract from the statutes of the school 
at St. Bees is a forceful statement of such a wish: ‘‘And we pray and 
charge the Wardens as they will answer unto God at the dreadful day of  
-P-A-G-E-187

Judgment, that they see these Statutes Faithfully observed to the uttermost 
of their Power’’ (Quoted in Carlisle, i.. 160). Some of the statutes 
made at and even before this time were observed well into the 19th 
century (E.G., Manchester, Statutes made in 1525. S.I.C., xvii., 313).

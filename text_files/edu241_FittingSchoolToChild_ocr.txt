  PREFACE 
THE experiment described in this book was, briefly stated, 
an attempt to make the school fit the child. It was carried 
on in one of the largest elementary schools in New York City, 
attended daily by 3,000 pupils. It was not merely a problem 
of finding space and sittings for this large number of children. 
We believed it possible to create a school environment in which 
the child himself could feel that he belonged. 
The experiment covered the period from September, 1916, 
to January, 1922. Its conclusion at this date was due to the 
introduction of the junior high school into the New York City 
system, which has led to a radical alteration in the character 
of many elementary schools. Among those affected by the 
change was Public School 64, the home of the experiment 
described in this book. Its excellent shop equipment made it 
a desirable building for the type of work projected by the 
junior high school organization, and it was therefore decided 
to take over the premises for that purpose. The lower grades 
were shifted to schools near-by, so that eventually only the 
upper grades remained. With this change of character, 
Public School 64 became no longer available for an experiment 
which emphasized the earliest possible study of the school 
child; its special problems had changed. For this reason, 
the experiment was transferred to a school for young children 
at 535 East 16th Street. 
In the meantime, the experiment had progressed sufficiently 
to justify a recapitulation and a detailed record. It seemed 
¥

vi PREFACE 
that the time had come to relate the story of the pioneer work 
which had been done, to give an account of the successes and 
failures encountered in specific directions. To give such a 
survey is the purpose of this book. 
The basis of the experiment was a program of codperation 
between Public School 64, Manhattan, and the Public Edu- 
cation Association of New York City. The writers wish to 
acknowledge their indebtedness to Mr. Howard Nudd, Di- 
rector of the Public Education Association, whose loyal sup- 
port and educational vision have been indispensable elements 
in their codperative plan; to Miss Jane Culbert, Execu- 
tive of the Visiting Teachers’ Staff, who has been affiliated 
with the experiment as a close adviser and whose valuable 
counsel has assisted the staff in overcoming many obstacles 
and discouragements incidental to the undertaking; and to 
Emily Leonard Brown, who, during three years has, as a visit- 
ing teacher, brought to the experiment a unique understanding 
of personal problems growing out of the family situations or 
school maladjustments of the children under consideration. 
Mrs. Brown has specialized on mental adjustment cases and 
has worked in close connection with Dr. George M. Parker, the 
psychiatrist ; Miss Regina C. Burke, formerly Assistant Prin- 
cipal of Public School 64 and now Principal of Public School 
39, the Bronx, has contributed to our combined endeavor her 
genius for organization and her open-minded and experi- 
mental attitude. Without the help of all the teachers in the 
school and of the school officials, the experiment would never 
have assumed the practical form outlined in the following 
study. 
To conduct a grading experiment in so large a school nec- 
essarily required an extensive amount of psychological testing 
and research work. The regular staff had the constant as- 
sistance of advanced students from Teachers College and Co-
-P-A-G-E-7
PREFACE vii 
lumbia University, whose services in the aggregate amounted 
to the full-time work of several persons. 
Dr. George M. Parker has given his services two mornings 
every week to psychiatric work, in the belief that through 
the study of the emotional trends of children, we should be 
able in time to make suggestions regarding the universal needs 
of children which the present school courses are not attempting 
to meet. 
Dr. J. L. Stenquist, of the Department of Reference and 
Research of the Board of Education, has made an extensive 
though brief study of mental and pedagogical tests in this 
school, in order to obtain data for recommending certain tests 
throughout the system for similar experiments. This study 
was concerned with group tests intended for the classification 
of children in large numbers. We shall have occasion to refer 
to this study in one of the later chapters. 
Miss Elizabeth Farrell, Inspector of Ungraded Classes, has 
codperated in a generous and sympathetic spirit with the 
experiment by the creation of special observation classes for 
young children, and classes for neurotic children. 
Toward the latter period of the experiment, the resources 
of the school were increased by the addition of a full-time 
vocational counselor, Miss Cornelia Beall. The Vocational 
Guidance Bureau initiated the work which was later strength- 
ened and extended by the amalgamation of the Vocational 
Guidance Bureau and the State Employment Service for 
Juniors. This organization has maintained vocational coun- 
selors in nine public schools, of which Public School 64 is one. 
Its recent specialization as a junior high school had made 
the contribution of the vocational counselor an indispensable 
part of the school activities. 
The most important experiment in the school in actual 
modification of curriculum was directed by Mrs. Marietta  
-P-A-G-E-8
  viii PREFACE 
Johnson of the School of Organic Education, Fairhope, Ala- 
bama. Mrs. Johnson visited our school weekly, raised the 
necessary budget for her experiment, provided her own equip- 
ment and supplies, and furnished the salary of a specially 
trained teacher for a year. Several of the regular teachers 
have undertaken experiments on their own initiative under 
her direction. A more specialized study of curriculum was 
undertaken by the assistant psychologist, Miss Zena C. 
O’Connor, toward the end of the experiment. 
An effort toward the enrichment of the curriculum was 
made possible by the codperation of a number of social agen- 
cies. The Neighborhood Art School of Greenwich House, 
although in a different part of the city, loaned two teachers for 
a year and a half to work with the classes of bright children. 
Mrs. Harriet Ayres Seymour’s Music School contributed for 
one year the services of Miss Marjorie Kneeland for these 
classes. The work done in art and music was much more 
extensive than anything of the kind undertaken by the reg- 
ular school department, and offered a happy opportunity for 
the creative spirit of this group of gifted children. Of equal 
significance was the course in natural science, conducted by 
Miss Laura Garrett. It was her inspiration that led to the 
establishment of the animal room as the best medium for this 
type of science teaching. A further extension of our teaching 
resources was made possible through the assistance of members 
of the Junior League, who aided the experiment as tutors and 
teachers of French. 
Valuable assistance has been given by the Boys’ Club, under 
the leadership of Mr. Louis C. Downer. This club occupies a 
seven-story building just across the open square from Public 
School 64. Without access to the splendid gymnasium and 
swimming pool of this club, and without recourse to its facili- 
ties for club work, summer outings, and personal attention to
-P-A-G-E-9
PREFACE ix 
special cases, we should have been greatly handicapped in our 
experiment. It would have been impossible without this 
coéperation to carry out at least half of the recommendations 
of the psychiatrist, since these were largely concerned with 
proper after-school activities. We had the use of the Boys’ 
Club for a number of classes during school hours as well, and 
thus we were able to achieve, partially at least, an extension 
of facilities such as every city public school should in some way 
possess. Similar support was given by Miss C. I. McCall of 
Christadora House, a settlement adjacent to the school. The 
gymnasium of the settlement house has enabled the school to 
make up partly for its own lack of equipment. In addition, a 
Boy Scout group has stood ready to receive members recom- 
mended by the school for this type of activity. Christadora 
House has loaned its music room for special classes in music, 
and has allowed the use of its club rooms daily for tutoring, 
testing, and class work. It has also done extensive summer 
work for individual children, and during one season took care 
of all the children from the nutrition classes for an entire 
summer. 
The Children’s Aid Society, which maintains a school 
building just around the corner from Public School 64, gener- 
ously donated classroom space for special classes. The ex- 
periment with a group of normal children was carried on here 
for one year. The class for cardiopathic children was initiated 
and grew to its full size under the hospitable roof of this Eighth 
Street building. The sympathetic coéperation of Miss Emma 
Sinn as Principal of the Children’s Aid School contributed 
very largely to the homelike atmosphere which helped these 
classes to thrive from the beginning. 
The Tompkins Square Branch of the New York Public 
Library has given special attention to the needs of the classes 
for bright children. It has been possible to plan class work on
-P-A-G-E-10

the basis of a permanent supply of reference works and other 
books near at hand. 
The coéperation of hospitals and dispensaries should be 
especially acknowledged. Yet health work within the school 
has remained the most limited aspect of the experiment. The 
regular routine of the Board of Health has been, unfortunately, 
of such a character as to be of little practical assistance in 
really studying the health of the children. So far as any con- 
structive aid could be secured, we were obliged to limit its 
benefits to selected groups. The Eye Clinic of the Board of 
Health is located in the school and has done a great deal in the 
way of examining the children of the entering classes and in 
following up those who required glasses. Dr. Robert Kahn, 
the physician in charge, has given unstinted service to this 
work. 
Dr. L. A. Leichter, a dentist practicing in the neighborhood, 
has given several mornings a week to the children of the 
school. His efforts have been centered upon the nutrition 
group and the Terman classes. 
The Department of Physical Education of the Board of Edu- 
cation has also codperated on special problems. Dr. Harry I. 
Goldberger of this department has given his services as a 
pediatrist in the individual examination of special groups of 
children, including the nutrition classes. 
The nutrition experiment was carried out in the school for 
two years and a half by the Bureau of Educational Experi- 
ments. While essentially intended as a piece of research work, 
it also had practical benefits. A description of this experiment 
has been published by the Bureau of Educational Experiments 
in a volume entitled Health Education and the Nutrition Class. 
Through the assistance of Dr. Robert H. Halsey, Secretary 
of the Association for Prevention and Relief of Heart Disease, 
it was possible to establish the special classes for cardiopathic
-P-A-G-E-11

children, a valuable and unique contribution to the health 
education of the public school system. The Children’s Aid 
Society provided a room for these classes, the Board of Educa- 
tion supplied the teacher, a trained nurse was secured from the 
Henry Street Settlement, and a salary for her services was 
contributed by the Public Education Association. 
To the generous codperation of the Commonwealth Fund 
we owe the services of Katharine Anthony, who has given 
editorial assistance in the production of this record of the ex- 
periment. 
The experiment from the beginning has been directed and 
supported in all of its aims and efforts by the Public Education 
Association of New York City. 
Especially do we wish to acknowledge a deep and abiding 
indebtedness for scientific guidance in the work of classification 
to Professor Lewis M. Terman of Leland Stanford University. 
Without the researches of Professor Terman and his stimulat- 
ing suggestions for educational applications, our experiment 
would never have been attempted. We are especially happy 
in paying tribute to this conscientious scholar, who has con- 
sistently followed a high standard of professional candor in 
the acknowledgment of his own intellectual debts. By 
reference to Professor Terman’s works, where full credit is 
given to the creative investigations of Alfred Binet, we can 
most adequately acknowledge our own obligations to the 
great French pioneer in dynamic psychology.

FOREWORD 
Tue following story of an experiment in grading children in 
one of New York City’s largest public schools — an experiment 
conducted over a period of years— has many interesting aspects. 
The purpose in view and the methods utilized are fully 
presented in the text itself and require no extended comment 
here. The aim was two-fold. It was sought to ascertain, as 
accurately as possible with existing measurements, the mental 
and physical capacities of the children as they entered school. 
On the basis of this information and of supplementary data 
regarding the forces which were affecting the welfare of the 
children, in and out of school, an effort was made to adapt 
educational experiences to individual needs. The measures 
adopted and the success achieved naturally were conditioned 
by the public school situation and the degree of codperation 
that could be secured from the home and from community 
resources. 
As the project was begun at a time when efforts in this di- 
rection were comparatively new, many interesting and baffling 
trails had to be blazed. The fact that the experiment was 
conducted in a large school in the largest public school system 
in the country, with all the problems such a situation inevitably 
presents, made the work unusually exacting but proportion- 
ately significant to the broad field of public education. Con- 
ditions had to be faced and met as they arose from day to 
day, and always the machinery of a large school organization 
had to be given due weight and consideration.

-P-A-G-E-20
xXx FOREWORD 
The experiment is quite as significant, however, as a demon- 
stration of how an unofficial organization of citizens can co- 
operate with the educational authorities in furthering the 
welfare of the public schools. The school staff and the staff 
provided by the Public Education Association, with the 
additional codperation they were able to enlist, have shown 
clearly how a great public school can be administered to func- 
tion more effectively for the children. 
The task undertaken in this experiment is by no means com- 
pleted. In fact this account of the work in Public School 64, 
Manhattan, may be regarded as but an opening chapter in the 
movement toward dealing with the pupil as a child. Its 
appearance at this time is actuated by a two-fold purpose: 
First, it is believed that a recital of the trials and achieve- 
ments in this particular experiment will be stimulating and 
helpful to those who are conducting or contemplating work 
with a similar purpose elsewhere. 
Second, the reorganization of Public School 64 as a junior 
high school made it advisable to transfer the experiment to 
another school where the fundamental purpose of the work 
could properly be carried out. As has been indicated, this 
purpose was to ascertain the children’s capacities and their 
problems at the very beginning of their school life, rather than 
after they had drifted along for several years. Because of the 
obvious necessity for this transfer to another elementary 
school, it seemed that a logical point had been reached for tak- 
ing account of stock and for presenting to those who might be 
interested the history of the preceding years in evolving the 
procedure. The experiment is now being continued as an 
annex to Public School 61, Manhattan, located at 535 East 
Sixteenth Street and known as the “Little Red School House.” 
The Public Education Association takes this occasion to 
thank the school authorities for the opportunity to codperate

in making possible this illuminating experiment, and to 
acknowledge the assistance received from many sources. 
Most of this assistance is indicated in the Preface and in the 
course of the following narrative. But, at this point, we wish 
to acknowledge particularly the generous financial assistance 
of the Commonwealth Fund. This help has made possible 
not only the preparation of the present volume, but also the 
enlarged staff which the Association is now enabled to provide 
for continuing the experiment in untouched fields revealed by 
the earlier work at Public School 64.

EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Dur1rnc the past two decades, an enormous amount of ex- 
perimental work has been undertaken by American psycholo- 
gists and educators for the purpose of developing serviceable 
methods for determining the intellectual capabilities of individ- 
uals, particularly of children of school age, and also for the 
purpose of devising ways and means of measuring achievement 
in school work. The data derived from all this experimen- 
tation has been presented in written form in books and 
magazines and in oral form at psychological, educational, 
and parent-teacher association meetings. Practically all that 
has been written and spoken on the subject of measurement 
of intelligence and achievement has been concerned with 
the presentation of evidence relating to the validity of 
measuring scales and educational tests, and with arguments 
stressing the desirability and the necessity of employing 
measuring scales in diagnosing the mental characteristics of 
pupils with a view to grading them accurately in school work., 
Those who have been conducting investigations have been 
conscious of a widespread belief that pupils of the same age in 
school do not differ markedly in capacity or in needs, either in 
respect to intellectual training or to management. Investi- 
gators have, therefore, thought it necessary to impress upon 
teachers and also upon parents and others who are responsible 
for the care and culture of the young that in a group of children 
of the same age there are likely to be important differences in 
intellectual power and emotional traits, which differences

xxiv EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
require that the individuals concerned be treated somewhat 
differently while they are undergoing educational training. 
Recent educational books and periodicals and even news- 
papers and popular magazines are burdened with complaints 
relating to the apathy of teachers and parents in respect to the 
problem of differentiating children and dealing with them 
according to their capacities and their temperamental and 
energic characteristics. There has also been a vast amount of 
literature published during the last few years which has had 
for its aim the convincing of the public that we are now in 
possession of means of determining with a considerable degree 
of accuracy what a pupil is capable of accomplishing intellect- 
ually and whether he is achieving in his school work up to 
the full measure of his capacity. 
In all this written and oral discussion relating to the adoption 
of psychological methods in organizing and conducting schools 
and in dealing with individual pupils in accordance with their 
capacities and needs, there is very little that shows concretely 
and convincingly how these methods can be utilized in typical 
public schools having all sorts and conditions of pupils. There 
are but few and incomplete reports of efforts that have been 
made to conduct schools in accordance with the requirements 
of psychological diagnosis of the pupil population. As these 
lines are being written there are rumors that certain school 
systems are to be administered henceforth on the basis of 
intelligence and educational tests. Newspapers are saying 
that several cities have decided upon a reorganization of their 
schools with a view to utilizing the results of that development 
of useful methods of diagnosing mental traits and powers which 
has taken place during the past two decades; but, thus far, 
there has been no impressive account of an actual experiment 
on a large scale showing how a school can be conducted on 
the basis of intelligence and educational tests and giving the

results of a thoroughgoing application of accurate measure- 
ments in determining the treatment best suited to individual 
pupils. 
The present volume shows how a large public school in 
New York City with an extremely complex pupil clientele, has 
been reorganized and administered in view of the results of 
recent investigations showing wide variation in the physical 
and psychological constitution of children of the same. chrono- 
logical age. Miss Irwin and Mr. Marks undertook this dif- 
ficult task several years ago. They first made a survey of 
their pupil population, and the results of this survey are 
presented in Chapter II of the present volume. The account 
of their experiences in the utilization of psychological tests for 
diagnostic purposes and of how the results affected the organ- 
ization of the school and the classification and treatment of the 
pupils is illuminating. It is also fascinating as told by the 
investigators. . 
Perhaps the most interesting and important phase of the 
story relates to the remedial treatment of children who had 
not been favored by nature or who were not fortunate in the 
environmental circumstances of their lives. Probably no 
teacher can read this story without realizing the importance of 
the questions to which the authors of this volume undertook to 
find an answer and without a feeling of gratitude for the con- 
tribution they have made toward the solution of problems 
which confront everyone who is responsible for the conduct of 
a school or a classroom. It is not too much to say that the 
life and work of Public School 64 were transformed as a con- 
sequence of the adoption of the psychological methods em- 
ployed by Miss Irwin and Mr. Marks — methods which could 
be easily used in almost any school provided they were directed 
by an equal intelligence. The authors have made it more 
evident than it has perhaps ever been made heretofore that
-P-A-G-E-26

when pupils are dealt with according to their capacities and 
needs rather than according to formule established and ap- 
plied without any regard to native differences in mental and 
physical constitution, the spirit and temper of the school, as 
well as its pedagogical achievement, will be greatly improved 
because teachers will be working with and not against nature. 
The authors of this volume are endowed beyond most 
educational writers with a gift of clear and graceful expression. 
They have aimed to present the results of an elaborate and 
complex educational experiment in terms that the non- 
technical reader can understand and in a style that he can 
enjoy. The editor believes that the authors have had unusual 
success in the accomplishment of their task. The illustrative 
figures and tables in this volume are fitted into the story in 
such a way that even persons who shudder at the sight of a 
table or a graph can assimilate what is presented without 
serious inconvenience. 
It may be predicted that anyone, whether teacher or layman, 
who will read this volume will conclude that it is possible to 
organize and conduct a school today with the aid of accurate 
measures of intelligence and achievement with far greater 
success than has been possible with less modern methods — 
success, in the sense of fitting the school to the pupils rather 
than of attempting to make the pupils adapt themselves to a 
school program determined ab extra with but slight reference 
to the varied traits and capabilities of those whom the school 
is designed to educate.

FITTING THE SCHOOL TO 
THE CHILD 
CHAPTER I 
INTRODUCTION 
The use of psychological and standardized tests in public 
education is a self-evident outcome of scientific progress. 
Like many practical applications of modern science, it has 
been slow to establish itself within our public schools. Up to 
twelve years ago, there were no typewriters in the administra- 
tion offices in New York City and not without a struggle were 
they acquired. Only within the last seven years has the tele- 
phone been in use in these offices. At present, the installment 
of adding machines is going on, and tomorrow we shall wonder 
how we ever did without them. Who would think of trying 
to run a city school today without telephones and typewriters ? 
Who would think of trying to get along without the school 
nurse, although her resources were unknown to us fifteen years 
ago? The whole public high school movement in New York 
City has taken place within the last thirty years, yet high 
schools ceased to be an innovation almost as soon as intro- 
duced. In the same way, the use of scientific tests is a con- 
venience which, once used in connection with the educational 
process, is rapidly assimilated as a permanent and indispen- 
sable instrument. 
The resistance of the public schools to any innovation ac- 
counts only in part for the neglect of psychology by educators.

2 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
The typical laboratory psychologist of the past has been too 
little interested in real children and too much inclined to be 
satisfied with a synthetic specimen of hisown. The technique 
of mental measurements has been in process of development 
for more than a decade. Their efficiency was accepted in the 
scientific world several years before any wide practical appli- 
cation was made. This first occurred in connection with the 
problems of children who deviated extremely from the normal. 
In selecting children who required institutional care and treat- 
ment, it was found that the standardized mental tests afforded 
very definite aid. They were also used in clinics and in select- 
ing children for special classes. The first time they were used, 
however, in classifying a large school and in analyzing the 
curriculum was in connection with the experiment which 
forms the subject of this study. So far as it has assisted in the 
establishment of scientific methods in the schools, it has pro- 
moted a mutual and much-needed service between psychologi- 
cal research and public education. 
In the pages that follow, an account is given of the methods 
by which this experiment in classification and analysis 
was carried on. The types of treatment used with varying 
groups and individuals are discussed and results are indicated 
where this is possible. While essential and important technical 
details are introduced, the effort has been to offer a discussion 
that will carry a definite message, not to educators alone, but 
to all who are interested in bettering the educational oppor- 
tunities of children and who desire for the youth of today a 
finer and fuller emotional and intellectual life than has been 
possible in the past. 
In recent years it has become a truism to say that the school 
should fit the child rather than that the child should fit the 
school. We have come at last to admit that there are in- 
dividual differences in children which make it impossible for
-P-A-G-E-31
INTRODUCTION 3 
them all to progress at the same rate. All the changes made 
to meet this situation, however, have been based upon the 
tacit assumption that the standard curriculum of the ele- 
mentary school was the true measure of the normal child, and 
that any child who did not fit was in some way inferior or 
afflicted. Certain provisions were gradually made within the 
school system for the definitely handicapped. They took the 
form of classes for the mentally subnormal and for those with 
physical disabilities — the blind, deaf, crippled, those with 
cardiac defects, etc. 
The establishment of special classes for children with physical 
disabilities was originally dictated by humane considerations 
and was in fact often directly due to the efforts of welfare 
societies outside the school. The classes for mental defec- 
tives, although originating within the school system, were at 
first regarded as an expedient for the welfare of normal chil- 
dren. The defectives were segregated for the same reason 
that bruised apples are taken out of one barrel and put into 
another, for the sake of the sound apples that are left behind. 
Although this was far from the point of view of their origina- 
tors, it was the idea which made headway with the public 
and the school authorities, by whom the special classes were 
accepted as a receptacle for ‘“‘seconds.” Their true educa- 
tional value was not at first generally recognized. It con- 
sisted in the simple but significant fact that here for the first 
time, the school was consciously trying to study the human 
material in its hands and to adapt the school program to the 
actual limitations of the pupil. In time we shall see that this 
spirit must underlie the education of all the children in the 
schools and not that alone of the small minority of the im- 
mature and handicapped. 
The obligation imposed upon the public school by our com- 
pulsory education act has never been fully appreciated. The  
-P-A-G-E-32
4 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
first compulsory education law of New York was passed 
in 1894. Few of us in New York City realize that, within 
the memory of most of our present principals, the child came to 
the public school as a petitioner. ‘‘Where do you live?” the 
principal might ask. If the reply was, in such and such a 
street which happened to have a bad name, the principal 
might then dismiss the applicant, by saying, “We have no 
place for you.” The school existed for selected pupils. It 
narrowed the educator’s task by a process of elimination which 
is no longer lawful, and simplified the problem to a degree 
which is no longer possible. 
The tendency of the compulsory education law since its 
first adoption has been steadily to extend the span of its con- 
trol without at the same time increasing the school’s appre- 
ciation of its responsibilities. The compulsory school life of 
the New York child has been almost doubled within the last 
quarter of a century. Beginning with a rigorous requirement 
of attendance between the ages of ten and twelve, followed by 
conditional working papers, it was extended at the upper 
limit to fourteen years and at the lower to seven. The present 
law raises the working-paper age to fifteen years for all those 
who do not graduate at fourteen, besides requiring attendance 
at continuation school up to eighteen years. The enforcement 
of the school law has grown correspondingly more strict, so 
that the claim of the school upon the child’s attendance has 
become more and more peremptory. 
This power creates a responsibility of a complex nature, not 
to be wholly. discharged by the mere provision of adequate 
“sittings.”” The public school is not simply a place where a 
child is compelled to “sit” for eight years, although this seems 
to be the current view and in far too many instances corre- 
sponds to the facts. So long as the child has no alternative 
but to attend school, we should strive to make it Ais school in
-P-A-G-E-33
  INTRODUCTION 5 
the sense that it adapts itself to his educational needs. We 
must accept the logical consequences of compulsory education 
and devote ourselves to the science of child nature with the 
same devout respect and exactness of technique which we have 
hitherto reserved for geography and arithmetic. The primary 
aim of the publicschool should be the conservation of the human 
material over which it has been given such mandatory powers. 
Let us not forget that truancy on the part of the pupil is 
punishable by the imprisonment of parents. Would it not 
be more logical if the teacher were subject to arrest for not 
making the child want to come to school rather than that the 
parents should be punished for not making the child attend 
against his will? This is by no means the absurd suggestion 
it will doubtless seem to most school teachers and officials. 
There is a grave responsibility inherent in our own compul- 
sory education system which has never been sufficiently 
recognized and accepted. 
The public school is an influence only secondary in impor- 
tance to the stock which produces the child and the family 
which begins his education. The successes and the failures 
of adult life have their origin in the years over which home 
and school join in a monopoly of control. Almost any adult 
individual distinguished by great achievement or degraded by 
crime will testify to the truth of this. The school, which 
holds so much of the future within its grasp, cannot with im- 
punity become a perfunctory institution instead of a place 
of intelligent educational effort. Everyone is now agreed 
that an institution is no substitute for the home; for the 
same reason, the institutionalized school is no substitute for a 
personal and individual school life. As babies die in insti- 
tutions for lack of personal love, so children suffer in school 
for lack of the inspiration that comes from being regarded as 
persons with individual traits and affectionate relationships.
-P-A-G-E-34
    6 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
Let us acknowledge at the outset that there are difficulties 
in the way. To individualize every child so that his special 
needs may be understood and met is no slight undertaking. 
The tendency of public education is toward larger schools 
and crowded classes. We live in a period which regards 
quantity production as justified by common sense and prin- 
ciples of sound economy. It is only natural that mass edu- 
cation should be considered as highly desirable from the 
economic point of view. Sometimes we seem to forget that a 
child is a vital, growing thing not comparable to any factory 
product whatsoever. Perhaps the day may come when a 
greater knowledge of the economy of human nature may enable 
us to adjust the size of our educational groupings on that 
basis rather than on the present basis, which is solely that of 
the economy of public funds. 
In the meantime we must face conditions as they are and 
recognize the difficulties which confront the teacher. For 
her the individual child is doubly obscured; in the first place, 
by the fact that he is one of too many children, and in the 
second place, by the curriculum which obstructs the view. 
These are very real obstacles. It is useless to exhort the 
teacher to consider the individual child without giving any 
practical procedure for doing so. 
There are definite objective aids to the better understand- 
ing of a child in the form of physical and mental tests. The 
introduction of such tests and of an experimental staff to 
apply them affects the atmosphere of the school appreciably. 
The teachers all want help not only in solving their problems 
but in seeing them. The presence of a psychologist to measure 
intelligence, of a visiting teacher to present the family angle, 
and of a psychiatrist to contribute his findings — all this makes 
it worth while to the teacher to study the peculiarities, dis- 
abilities, and superiorities of her children. When the children
-P-A-G-E-35
INTRODUCTION 7 
are grouped in such a way that the grosser differences of in- 
telligence are removed, the teacher becomes more observant of 
differences in character and personality. Every failure in 
discipline, scholarship, and social adjustment is seen in a new 
light. It becomes possible to discover, if not always to solve, 
a large number of problem cases before they have grown to 
be anything more than a family matter; that is, before they 
have become truancy or delinquency cases. 
In a school where everyone is concerned merely with peda- 
gogical progress, the teacher quite naturally feels that the per- 
sonal problems of a child are not a sufficiently worthy and 
dignified subject for study and attention. Yet the intelli- 
gence of both teacher and pupil are surely to be as properly 
applied to the problems of living as to the specialized attack 
on pedagogical tasks. Already we have come to speak of 
school work as something artificial because it seems to have 
so little relation to the child’s future life. The real problem, 
however, is how to make the child’s school work a part of his 
contemporary life and to effect for his welfare a lasting rec- 
onciliation between lesson-learning and experience.

CHAPTER II 
THe Home of THE EXPERIMENT 
The experiment of which this account has been written was 
carried on in a public school situated on the lower East Side of 
New York. The children came from a typical tenement 
district of Manhattan; that is, a neighborhood where ten to 
twenty families are housed beneath the same roof, and sun- 
shine and fresh air are correspondingly subdivided. In spite 
of congested conditions, however, the standard of living is on 
the whole much better than in many other districts of Man- 
hattan where the state of congestion is much less intense. 
Although poverty and delinquency are found, they are not 
characteristic of the neighborhood. Lawlessness in general 
is not prominent, and truancy does not assume the discour- 
aging proportions reached in some other districts. The local 
atmosphere is one of hopeful striving such as we should expect 
of a vigorous immigrant population. 
Parents are ambitious for their children, and it is no un- 
common occurrence for whole families to unite in making 
sacrifices in order that one member may have a better edu- 
cation than the others. Evidence of the extent of this ambi- 
tious spirit exists in the large quota sent to high school by 
Public School 64 — the school in which was carried on the 
experiment to which this book relates. 
At the end of the term which concluded the experiment, 
the proportion of eighth grade graduates entering secondary 
schools throughout the city was 61.7 per cent; of the grad- 
8
-P-A-G-E-37
  THE HOME OF THE EXPERIMENT 9 
uates of Public School 64, the proportion at the same time 
was 84 per cent. While several influences within the school 
may have helped to raise the percentage above the average 
for the city, the chief credit doubtless goes to the aspiring 
spirit of the neighborhood, where every mother wants her 
boy to be ‘“‘something high.” 
The neighborhood from which the children come is practi- 
cally homogeneous as regards nationality, economic status, 
and religion. The parental generation is predominantly 
foreign-born ; nearly all the parents have come from homes in 
Eastern Europe and still preserve many common traditions 
and customs. There are practically no recruits from Western 
Europe. The nationalities immediately surrounding the 
school are Russian, Austrian, Polish, and Hungarian. These 
families dwell together in a segregated community with a 
special transitional culture. It is a colorful blend of foreign 
customs and American habits. The large group of Italian 
parents indicated in the table on page 10 means that the 
school overlaps the Italian community on the north where a 
singularly segregated culture is maintained, with its own 
occupations, markets, and festivals. Outside of the school, the 
two groups do not intermingle. 
NATIONALITIES 
The table on page ro shows the nationalities of the par- 
ents of 1000 children attending Public School 64. It is 
based on data collected by the vocational counselor from the 
children of the upper grades, that is, the seventh and eighth, 
and comprises one-third of the entire school registration. It 
should be borne in mind that the families represented in the 
table, except those of Italian origin, are almost all Jewish, 
families. The table therefore indicates religion as well as 
nationality.

From the foregoing table we note the great predominance 
of the foreign-born among the parents of our school children. 
Of the fathers, less than 4 per cent; and of the mothers, less 
than 5 per cent were born in the United States. In about 
equal proportions, the fathers and mothers came from Russia, 
Austria, Poland, Hungary, and “Europe,” which, in the 
local childish vernacular, usually indicated one of the fore- 
going countries. In all, 77 per cent of the fathers and 77 per 
cent of the mothers came from this Eastern European group. 
The Italian parents formed about 11 per cent of the entire 
number, and, taken together with the few scattering nationali- 
ties from Western Europe, represent the largest non-Jewish .

element of the neighborhood. All together this group, it seems 
safe to say, did not rise to 15 per cent of the families repre- 
sented in our school. 
Let us turn now to the analysis of the birthplaces of the 
children of these same parents. The following table shows 
these facts:

About 80 per cent of the children were born in America ; 
about 15 per cent were born in Russia, Austria, Poland, 
Hungary, and “Europe”; and the remaining 5 per cent were 
born in Italy and other foreign countries. It appears from a 
comparison of Tables I and II that, while nearly all of the 
parents were foreign-born, about four-fifths of the children were 
native-born. This means that in most cases they were born 
in the vicinity of the school on the East Side where the ex- 
periment was made. These figures give statistical expression 
to the fact that the school children were largely bi-lingual, and 
that the conversations of home-life and school-life were to a 
considerable extent carried on in separate languages.  
-P-A-G-E-40
I2 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
It must not be supposed, however, that six-year-old chil- 
dren came into the school devoid of the use of English. Even 
if other teachers had been lacking, the street had not failed to 
educate them in this regard, as it had also provided them with 
a wide variety of experiences in other directions. The school 
does not begin with strictly family-made material alone, but 
with a modified product of home and neighborhood influences 
and with a complex individual who needs and rewards a serious 
attempt to study him. 
HEALTH CONDITIONS 
Another significant fact about our foreign-born district 
is that the local population belongs to a stock distinguished 
by great longevity. . This is the peculiar contribution of the 
Russian Jews to American civilization; they help to increase 
the national vigor and vitality. From the statistics of the 
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company we learn that the 
Russian-born Jews have a lower death rate and greater lon- 
gevity than native-born Americans of native-born parent- 
age. ‘Their addition to the population of New York State,” 
writes Dr. Dublin, “has therefore an effect very different 
from that of other foreign-born peoples. They increase the 
longevity of the total population rather than decrease it.’’? 
According to this statistician, the average fourth grade boy 
in Public School 64 has a longer life before him than the boy 
descended from native American stock. ‘‘At age 10, the 
expectation of Russian-born males is 53.44 years, as com- 
pared with 52.96 years for native males of native parentage.” 
It is hardly necessary to comment on this fact beyond the 
following statement made by Dr. Dublin: ‘The full sig- 
1 Dublin, Louis I., Statistician Metropolitan Life Insurance Company — 
“The Mortality of Foreign Race Stocks,” The Scientific Monthly, January, 
1922. Page 96.
-P-A-G-E-41
  
THE HOME OF THE EXPERIMENT 13 
nificance of this fact appears when we consider the very un- 
favorable conditions of life of this people in their new environ- 
ment. They are, for the most part, relatively newcomers, 
and many of them are still suffering from the difficulties aris- 
ing out of poor housing and of bad economic status incidental 
to a period of adjustment in a new country. This fact again 
bears out what is generally known — that the Jews as a people 
have extraordinary vigor.” + 
The second largest racial group represented in the school 
was the Italian. Consulting the same study of vital statistics 
we learn that the life span of the Italian male in New York 
State is next to that of the native-born male of American 
parentage. ‘It is important to note,” comments the study, 
“that in spite of the marked change in the environmental 
conditions in New York State as compared with their native 
country, which for the large majority of the Italian immi- 
grants is the warm South, the Italian-born live longer and 
suffer less from most serious diseases in their new abode than 
in their home country.” ? 
Notwithstanding the reassuring tenor of such statistics, 
we did not feel that the health conditions of the neighborhood 
were to be regarded with complacency. This actual longevity 
represented a triumph of stamina over environment. So 
far as the Jews were concerned, the hygienic rules of their 
religion, the early retirement of the men from active earning, 
the lighter occupations in which they chiefly engage — all 
these facts doubtless have a tendency to prolong the average 
span of life. In spite of their longevity, the Jewish families 
are the greatest frequenters of medical clinics of any race in 
the city. A social worker who came into our school from 
another part of the city was overwhelmed at the frequency

with which these families consulted doctors. She would go 
to see the mother of a child to counsel a visit to a physician 
and would be met with the information that three doctors 
and three clinics had been visited and the mother would cheer- 
fully seek out a fourth if so directed. Whatever may be in- 
dicated by this practice — no doubt a part of this running to 
hospitals and doctors is hysterical —the need of genuine 
health education is clearly evidenced. The children should 
receive it early in life in order that its results may be con- 
tinuously and progressively realized throughout not merely 
a long but also a healthy life. Our experiments in this direc- 
tion, although limited, had suggestive aspects which will be 
described in a later chapter. 
OCCUPATIONS 
An important aspect of the environment of these children 
is represented by the occupations followed by their fathers. 
The following table indicates the economic and social condi- 
tions of the neighborhood environment. 
The following classification reflects in general the features 
of the great industrial city in which the thousand families had 
found their home. About 33 per cent of the fathers were 
employed in the various branches of the clothing industry ; 
about 13 per cent were employed in other branches of light 
manufacture, such as the making of leather goods, paper 
goods, foods, etc.; 8 per cent were in the building trades, 
many as painters; 6 per cent were in household and personal 
service; 8 per cent were merchants whose business in this 
district merges into that of the peddler, so that all together the 
group of small merchants rose to 10 per cent of the entire 
number; 2 per cent were in professional occupations; 10 per 
cent did not give the information, and 5 per cent were out 
of work. ‘

16 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
The range of occupation and income seems considerable when 
we remember that this is a homogeneous group of tenement 
dwellers. Poverty occurs in the vicinity in regrettable pro- 
portions, but we had comparatively few children who came 
from homes of chronic poverty. Unemployment is more 
familiar but is largely a concomitant of the special industries 
represented. On the whole, the Jewish fathers lived up to 
their general reputation of being ‘‘good providers” and 
faithful family men. 
The following table shows the occupations of the mothers 
of 1000 boys:

It appears from the foregoing table that 82 per cent of the 
mothers were housekeepers in their own homes; to these 
home-workers we might add the 3 per cent who were listed as 
storekeepers but worked under a semi-domestic régime. 
The local store is likely to be a family occupation in which 
the children also take their turn. Of the mothers who did 
go out to earn, the largest group was employed in the same 
industry which engaged the largest group of men — the cloth- 
ing trades. Thus the homes of our district were to.a very

great extent dependent on the needle trades for their main- 
tenance and security. The industry is subject to season fluctu- 
ations, but is, on the other hand, better organized than most 
American trades. The economic background of the children 
in Public School 64 was not an especially unstable one. 
FAMILY CONDITIONS 
The families of these children were larger than the American 
average. The following table shows the size of family for tooo

The average family of the district was larger than that of the 
census standard. According to the foregoing table, the 
average for the neighborhood was 4.39 children per family 
as compared with the census average of 2.8 children per 
American-born mother. Of the total 1000 families considered, 
66 per cent had four children or more; that is, they exceeded 
the number per family which prevails in strictly American 
communities. This reflects the Eastern European origin of 
our school parents and represents what might be called an alien
-P-A-G-E-46
18 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
birth rate, since so marked a difference exists between Eastern 
Europe and the United States in this respect. 
Assuming four children to a family, we realize that our 
school, with a register of three thousand children, was in a 
position to influence the future lives of many thousand indi- 
viduals. The school represented to the children the new 
society into which their parents had come more or less as 
strangers, but in which they were to grow up at home. All 
of them would form their permanent attitude toward society 
on the basis of their direct contact with a school authority, 
which their parents had not known. 
The boy who fights with the school is not the casual and 
transient problem that teachers and parents like to believe 
he is; the habit of antagonism is likely to have a past and 
also a future. It has an influence on the lives of his brothers 
and sisters also, for the experiences of one child in his rela- 
tion to the school are likely to carry over to the others of the 
family. The emotional solidarity of the family in relation 
to the outside world is always something to be reckoned with. 
So far as our three thousand boys lived at peace with our 
school, we could be sure that six or eight thousand children 
were feeling the results of whatever good morale we were able 
to maintain among our own immediate group. The pre- 
vention of delinquency can be achieved only by the expendi- 
ture of real personal consideration for the individual child. 
A cheaper way does not exist. It is not a matter of indiffer- 
ence whether a boy wages an eight years’ war with his school 
or not, or whether the family takes his side or not; it is a 
large part of the real business of education. 
SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT 
The district is marked by the provincialism which is typical 
of the tenement areas of New York. This partly reflects a 
 
-P-A-G-E-47
THE HOME OF THE EXPERIMENT 19 
Jewish social habit, but is more largely due to economic con- 
ditions. Carfares are not a casual feature in the family 
economy, nor do they tend to become so in a district where 
schools, shops, and even jobs are within walking distance. The 
children seldom use the street cars until working years are 
reached. Pupils of all ages were subject to “car sickness” 
and it was common for a child to forego a school treat which 
involved riding on the cars. When one considers that these 
were metropolitan school children in the year 1920, one ap- 
preciates the significance of such seeming trifles. Should 
teacher and public school concern themselves about this kind 
of thing? A bright child is expected to master decimals and 
the geography of Asia by putting forth the necessary effort. 
There is no reason why he should not be encouraged to master 
his environment by the same process. Our school did not 
prize provincialism as an educational influence; on the con- 
trary, we encouraged the children — the bright ones especially 
—to go beyond their neighborhood and become acquainted 
with the city in which they lived. 
Life is so thick and colorful in this little compact East Side 
world that the boy has little incentive to look beyond it for 
excitement and adventure. Up to the age of fifteen, he can 
easily keep going on the happenings of the streets near by. 
The streets are never emptied; an endless processional of 
human life passes and yet ever stays. The people demand 
the outdoor markets of Europe, and the narrow streets of the 
neighborhood are obliged to furnish them. Push-carts rival 
the department stores in the variety of wares displayed, and 
even the shopkeepers are forced to set up push-carts in front 
of their own premises to compete with the more popular out- 
door merchants. As the Jewish holidays come around, the 
push-carts pile on their mountains of pots and kettles, new 
dishes and new clothes, matzoths and candles, and the scene
-P-A-G-E-48
20 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
becomes denser and gayer. The children have a share in the 
busy spectacle and are content to drink it in from year to year, 
over and over again. A large New York department store 
only six blocks to the west is almost unknown to them. Chil- 
dren who were conducted in a party to see this typical Ameri- 
can institution surveyed it with wide, strange eyes as if it 
were a true Leviathan. 
After the public school day is over, further lessons and in- 
struction for the children are common. There is scarcely a 
family in which at least one member does not take music 
lessons. The window-cards of struggling music teachers are 
one of the familiar sights of the streets, and numerous little 
shops hung with violins testify to the local opinion that music 
is a necessity of life though surface-car travel is not. In the 
school were hundreds of children not over ten years of age who 
played the violin. This widespread appreciation of music 
indicates a type of cultural achievement not common in the 
older American communities, a definite social value to be con- 
served. 
Religious instruction is a necessary part of the Jewish boy’s 
education. Hebrew schools are regularly conducted, after 
public school hours are over, in buildings dedicated to the 
purpose or more frequently in basement classrooms, where 
light and ventilation are at their poorest. The teachers, who 
are called by courtesy rabbis, receive a weekly tuition fee which 
varies according to the size of the class, but which is never 
large enough to pay rent for large, well-ventilated, and well- 
lighted quarters. However, since the instruction is rather 
formalistic and depends mainly upon rote memory, the danger 
of eye-strain is reduced to a minimum. A false notion of 
learning is the most undesirable product of this method. 
The children are in attendance at these schools four or five 
days a week during the winter months and for a period covering 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
THE HOME OF THE EXPERIMENT 21 
three to six years. Here they learn to repeat the prayers 
which belong to the family services and those of the synagogue. 
At thirteen, they receive an examination, the Bar Mitzva, 
as the ceremony is called, and are henceforth qualified to take 
full part in the family ritual and that of the synagogue. 
While the religious school exists primarily to impart a 
religious discipline, it is incidentally a school of languages. 
Hebrew is acquired only in the most mechanical way; not 
even the brightest children are expected to make any free use 
of it. On the other hand, dull boys are sometimes known to 
forget the prayers after they have once learned them and must 
be sent to ‘‘Schul’’ once more to con them over again. But 
the modern Jewish language, more commonly called Yiddish, 
is also taught to the extent that the children learn to read and 
write it. After a fashion, some degree of literacy in Yiddish 
is necessary in this neighborhood where it exists as current 
speech and as the language of the most popular newspapers 
and theaters of the district. The children are nearly all bi- 
lingual, the majority of them speaking Yiddish at home. 
The pedagogical methods employed in the Hebrew schools 
are naturally of the most antiquated kind ; the so-called rabbis 
are the oldest men of their profession, and usually preside over 
the class, ferule in hand. They are still literal practitioners 
of an educational system simply based upon the ancient maxim, 
“Spare the rod and spoil the child.” Yet from one of these 
quaint colleagues of ours we received a most valuable educa- 
tional hint. The case may as well be told here, as it illus- 
trates a common problem and an uncommon treatment. 
There was in our school, in the earliest stages of our ex- 
periment, a very troublesome boy whom we shall call by his 
nickname, ‘‘Splits.”” The boy was of the familiar type known 
as “Smart Aleck” and the despair of his teachets. He was 
constantly in the office of the principal, who had no recourse   
 
-P-A-G-E-50
22 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
but to pass him on from one teacher to the other; fortunately 
we had several for every grade. The boy exhausted each 
teacher in turn and was generally considered an incorrigible 
nuisance. The arrival of the psychiatrist aroused a faint. 
hope and Splits offered himself cheerfully to the ministrations 
of this new type of disciplinarian. In the course of the con- 
versation, the psychiatrist elicited an interesting fact. Splits, 
it appeared, had attended the usual Hebrew class under a 
“separate rabbi,’”’ as the basement teacher is called, and was 
letter-perfect in religion. The aged rabbi had fallen into the 
habit of going to sleep in the corner while Splits instructed 
the class in his stead. This hint resulted in a psychological 
test in which the boy evinced a level of intelligence much 
above the average. 
This was a complete surprise to all his teachers, who were 
obliged to give the ‘credit for superior acumen to the aged 
rabbi. A new type of treatment now suggested itself, how- 
ever; and Splits was surprised by a sudden promotion. At 
eleven he was put ahead one term; and then two terms. 
He was over-sized anyway and looked more at home in the 
upper grades in which he now found himself. It was quite 
true that he had been insufficiently loaded for his strength; 
he responded to the new demands made upon him with a 
better focusing of his energies. From that time he was less 
often in the principal’s office and more often in the classroom 
where he belonged. He kept up easily with the class to which 
he had been promoted and with which he graduated early in 
his thirteenth year. ; 
We were under no illusion that Splits had been “cured” ; 
his bumptious disposition and his habit of showing off rested 
on other and deeper lying causes than the one accidentally 
uncovered. But his comparative adjustment during the last 
year and a half in school represented an improvement which
-P-A-G-E-51
THE HOME OF THE EXPERIMENT 23 
his former teachers had thought was impossible. Since these 
are just the years when antisocial tendencies already estab- 
lished are likely to increase progressively, we felt that even a 
partial reconciliation between Splits and his environment 
was a constructive and salutary experience for him. 
THE SCHOOL 
The public school in New York shares the problem of the 
home in regard to space and elbow-room. It is obliged to 
place the question of mere house-room above all others. Pub- 
lic School 64 is a five-story building, designed to accommodate 
as many children as possible. It has fifty classrooms and 
fourteen shops on four floors above a large undivided base- 
ment. It was constructed and opened in 1906, and conforms 
to the H-type of building which was hopefully regarded at 
that date as providing a maximum of indoor light and outdoor 
space. The school is well lighted in contrast to most of the 
houses of the neighborhood. The two courtyards, however, 
are entirely inadequate as playgrounds for so large a school; 
but it was fortunately possible to establish outdoor headquar- 
ters hard by in Tompkins Square Park. The building itself, 
with its large windows and light-stone fagade, presents a 
rather cheerful aspect. In the midst of a foreign-born popu- 
lation, it enjoys the peculiar moral prestige which is obtained 
so easily by our American public schools, and which they 
sometimes fail to make due effort to deserve and keep. 
In September, 1916, Public School 64 was a pre-vocational 
school with classes from the kindergarten through the eighth 
grade. On its register were listed 3000 children, all boys 
with a few exceptions to be explained hereafter. About 250 
children were enrolled in the entering class each year, and 
about the same number were graduated in June. The school 
was practically divided into two schools by the assignment of
-P-A-G-E-52
24 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
pupils to X-time and Y-time respectively. The hours of the 
X-school were 8.30 A.M. to 2.30 P.M., and those of the Y-school 
were 9.30 A.M. to 3.30 P.M. The two programs were arranged 
by a method of dovetailing, so that more than eighty classes 
were accommodated by the fifty classrooms and the fourteen 
shops. The most important supplement to the school was 
the Tompkins Square playground where the children had 
physical training and supervised play during two periods a 
day. Only in the most inclement weather was the basement 
used for this purpose. It is surprising how few days in the 
year appeared to be unsuitable. Schoolboys are not squeam- 
ish about the weather, and the hours in the Park were rarely 
omitted. “Shop” was the only rival of the playground. 
One notable feature of Public School 64 was the growth of 
special classes. This was the result of the experimental policy 
adopted. As the school recognized its problems, special 
classes of various types were created in the effort to meet 
them directly. The easy solution of elimination had been 
abandoned at the outset. During the four years of the ex- 
periment, no boy was sent to disciplinary school nor to any 
other place of last resort. On the contrary, many children 
were sent to Public School 64 by other schools, both public 
and private, and were frankly offered and accepted as extreme 
problems. Furthermore, it was our practice to seek out bright 
children in the neighborhood and enroll them in our school. 
Thus it came about that, in the development of the plan, the 
number of special classes grew to be larger than the number 
of regular classes in the school. 
The special class is the most direct aid possible in the in- 
dividualization of the child. The regular classes are the 
carriers of the traditional methods and must wait for their 
improvement upon the indirect influence of methods learned 
from the teaching of admittedly exceptional children. In
-P-A-G-E-53
THE HOME OF THE EXPERIMENT 25 
Public School 64, the number of special classes was an indis- 
pensable part of the experiment, since it provided within the 
school itself a recognized field for a special kind of educational 
enterprise. 
It happens that the three R’s may be taught and rote 
memory cultivated in the smallest possible amount of space. 
But the moment we begin to relate the curriculum to life in 
any other direction, the tendency to expand becomes evident. 
The moment we begin to individualize the child, he seems to 
take up more room. He even begins to want to move around. 
With the young population already crowding the school 
buildings beyond their actual capacity, the distraught au- 
thorities are inclined to favor educational methods which 
act upon the individual as the compress on a cotton bale. 
The appeal for new facilities, for movable equipment, for 
cultural advantages, falls on deaf official ears. This is in- 
evitable. So long as we have so much illiteracy in the coun- 
try, so much part-time in New York and other cities, the 
improvement of our educational procedure would seem not 
to be considered a burning issue. The taxpayer does not 
wish to hitch his wagon to a star; if the school system will 
eliminate part-time, he is willing to call that progress and to 
dismiss all further demands as impractical idealism. 
These are familiar obstacles, to a greater or less extent, 
confronting all public schools. At the close of the war, which 
suspended the normal physical growth of our school plants 
for a five-year period, these difficulties were everywhere en- 
hanced. At our school, we found that the best way to over- 
come our physical and traditional limitations was through 
codperation with social agencies engaged in educational work. 
It seems to us that such codperation is an excellent and prac- 
tical basis for experiment in the public schools. The de- 
velopment of a superior type of social work in America is a 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
26 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
significant and a recognized fact. Increasingly this develop- 
ment has been along scientific lines; increasingly it has be- 
come a special effort to make our social and psychological 
sciences contribute to the practical ends of social service. 
So far as this is true, the various activities loosely grouped 
together under the general name of social work have a direct 
bearing on the educational problem. So far as such activities 
have succeeded in developing a sound technique, they should 
be enlisted in the business of public education. Otherwise 
they will be confined too largely to the handicapped and 
atypical elements of the child population. Many attempts 
have been made to establish agencies for child welfare out- 
side of the public schools, but such agencies have had a 
tendency toward serving a selected and unrepresentative 
clientele. 
Only as educators and social workers codperate will it be 
possible to bring the tangible benefits of the latter’s method 
within the reach of all kinds of children. This is a problem 
which school administrators must face. It cannot be solved 
by excluding all alliances with the field of social work as ir- 
relevant and unsettling to traditional school routine, because 
the workers in this field have demonstrated that they have 
something to give to the children which the public school is 
not yet ina position to provide. Social workers, on the other 
hand, should welcome the discipline which comes from work- 
ing with or through a public school, where theory must meas- 
ure itself against fact and children are close-up human realities 
and not imaginary entities. 
Our experience with codperation in Public School 64 has 
been gratifying in its results. In the course of our four-year 
experiment, a great variety of aid was forthcoming on every 
hand for which detailed acknowledgment has been given in 
the preface. That outside social agencies should be stimulated
-P-A-G-E-55
THE HOME OF THE EXPERIMENT 27 
to codperate with the public school and the public school to 
welcome such coédperation is an achievement of no little im- 
portance. Our attempt to link up the two factors was not 
merely an incidental feature but one of the most vital aspects 
of the experiment.
-P-A-G-E-56
CHAPTER III 
DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 
Nowhere throughout the school organization is it so diffi- 
cult to form an estimate of a child’s ability as in the first 
grade. There is no accumulation of opinion inherited from 
a previous teacher. Among the children, there is no uniform- 
ity of previous experience. They come from various types 
of homes and frequently, in our school, from the environment 
of another language. The “spoiling” which many children 
experience up to school age does not help to prepare them 
for their first contact with the unknown world of school. 
Every fall we received from 150 to 200 of these little exiles 
from home, and it was our task to group them into classes. 
Less than one-fourth of them had come by way of the kinder- 
garten. 
At first the classes were graded upon entrance simply on 
the basis that the first comers made the first class. When 
that was full, another class was made. Finally, there were 
five rooms full of children, all learning the same thing pre- 
sumably at the same rate from five different’ teachers. 
In contrast to the studied inattention accorded to the en- 
tering child, the curriculum awaiting him has been carefully 
worked out, and on its requirements the eye of the teacher 
is fixed. She must train the child in certain definite skills 
— in reading and number-manipulation — and must give him 
a slice of subject-matter carefully prescribed. The latter 
28
-P-A-G-E-57
DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 29 
consists of facts in nature study and geography and the learn- 
ing of songs. At the end of five months, it is found that some 
of the children meet the requirements. They show their 
proficiency by passing carefully prescribed tests. Some of 
the group will fail to meet these requirements and the teacher 
will not recommend them for the next higher class. These 
unfortunates are “‘left back” and have to begin all over again 
the work which will be repeated in exactly the same way the 
next term. 
The question of why some of the pupils have failed is very 
seldom raised as early as the first grade. It is assumed that a 
second exposure to the panorama of the curriculum will leave 
a deeper imprint on the pupil’s memory. Seldom is it even 
admitted that, if the requirements were rigidly and honestly 
enforced, some of the pupils would remain in the first grade 
indefinitely. 
That they are not so enforced, however, a glance at later 
developments will show us. If we study a typical seventh or 
eighth grade from the point of view of the actual abilities 
of the pupils, we shall see that, in spite of the great amount 
of retardation, school promotions proceed more by chronologi- 
cal age than by anything else. Early in our experiment, 
before the psychological classification had been made, an 8A 
class! was carefully gone over by the teacher in charge for 
the purpose of discovering the actual intellectual standing 
of the pupils. It was made up of about 30 boys ranging in age 
from 13 to 16 years. A few of the pupils — 10, or one-third 
of the class — had by the end of the term qualified for en- 
trance into the 8B grade. The rest, although the teacher’s 
time had been chiefly expended on them, were actually fitted 
for the following distribution :

Total Slraurkau 
The teacher discovered early in the term that an appreciable 
number of her pupils were mentally subnormal. They would 
have been much better off had they entered the ungraded 
class when young. In short, there was a total misfit between 
two-thirds of the class and the curriculum of that particular 
grade. 
In fairness it should be stated that this was the slowest of 
the three classes which composed the 8A grade at that time. 
The organization was large enough to support from three to 
six classes for each grade. These were roughly grouped in the 
order of proficiency — class 1 being made of the best material, 
class 2 of the next best, and so on. The assignment of the 
pupils had been according to the teacher’s recommendation. 
The class that we have examined was the lowest group in that 
grade; yet it must be remembered that all the pupils had, by 
a series of promotions, reached the point where they were 
supposed to be doing 8A work. This experience could prob- 
ably be matched in practically every graded school through- 
out the country. It is g ven here because it is believed to be 
typical, and because of the light it may shed upon the problem 
of grading in general. 
Would it have been fair to redistribute the twenty boys 
among the several grades for which they were actually qual- 
ified? Obviously, this would have been as unfair as it was 
impossible. The fault was not so much that of the boys as 
of the school, which, with a pretense of rigorous exactitude 
and justice, had really proceeded in a hit-or-miss fashion from
-P-A-G-E-59
DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 31 
the first. This much at least we may deduce from the ex- 
amination of this particular class: the problem cannot be 
unraveled at the eighth grade end. Hitherto nearly all the 
efforts made have centered attention on the difficulties en- 
countered in the seventh and eighth years of school. On the 
other hand, the first grade child has been consistently neg- 
lected. There has been almost a superstitious prejudice 
against knowing too much about him; it was as if the teachers 
thought that scientific observation was a kind of “evil eye” 
that might jeopardize his chances. 
We decided to grapple with the problem of grading squarely 
at the outset of the child’s school career. We believed that 
the school should make the first term, when the child is be- 
tween six and seven years old, a period for studying him 
rather than for merely teaching him. If this period is de- 
voted to an intensive study of the facts about each child, it 
should facilitate adjustments on the part of the school, the 
child, and the home, so that the following years may proceed 
with a minimum number of unnecessary obstacles. The 
plan has distinct advantages. It means that the school is 
seizing its first rather than its last opportunity for the work 
of prevention. By using whatever means of scientific fore- 
sight there may be at our command, it is possible to avoid 
waiting several years while the child’s school life develops 
along unprofitable lines and while he himself perhaps achieves 
a permanent maladjustment. Not the least of the dangers 
he faces is a scoliosis of character extremely difficult to rectify 
at the age of fourteen. 
Already there exist standards and criteria which may be 
brought to bear upon the individual child. It is a false idea 
that a child loses his individuality by being submitted to 
measurements and norms; on the contrary, he becomes more 
of a person to his teacher because she knows more about him.
-P-A-G-E-60
32 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
We undertook, by the application of scientific standards, 
to learn certain strategic facts about every incoming child. 
He was given primarily a psychological test and received a 
psychological rating. This was set down tentatively to be 
revised by a retest at the end of a year. He was given an eye 
examination and, when glasses were needed, they were with 
a few exceptions provided and worn. This. was achieved 
with the assistance of a competent social worker. The child 
was weighed and measured and his percentage of underweight 
or overweight computed by standard tables. The children 
who had a normal psychological rating, who had no eye defects, 
and who were within a small percentage of the proper weight, 
we considered good risks from the school’s point of view. 
They represented at a rough estimate between 60 per cent 
and 75 per cent of each class. Care of the other 25 per cent 
became the task of the visiting teacher and the health worker 
and their volunteer aids. On the basis of these physical and 
mental examinations were developed the various types of 
special classes which will be described later in this study. 
As we have said before, the use of the psychological test 
was not entirely new in the school. It had been previously 
used in the selection of children for the ungraded and the 
gifted classes. It naturally followed, from dealing with the 
groups of children belonging to the lowest and highest grades 
of ability, that attention should be drawn to those pupils 
whose ability lies in varying degrees between these two ex- 
tremes. The efficiency of the mental test in determining the 
general intelligence of the extreme types of children gave 
us confidence in its more general application. 
WHAT IS GENERAL INTELLIGENCE 
Just what general intelligence is, the science of psychology 
is hardly prepared to say; indeed, it is less prepared to give
-P-A-G-E-61
  DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 33 
a dogmatic definition than it was a few years ago. Psycholo- 
gists have long since relinquished the convenient habit of 
referring to the different faculties of the mind, such as mem- 
ory, attention, judgment, as if they were separate entities, 
and are striving more and more to look upon intelligence 
as an integrated whole. Psychological tests aim to approach 
intelligence from as many different angles as possible in an 
effort to detect its presence or its absence. When a test 
seeks evidence of memory or ingenuity, it is always with a 
full appreciation that these qualities cannot be isolated from 
each other or from the general mental make-up. Each test 
represents only an avenue of approach. A so-called memory 
test well passed is very likely to be indicative of high intelli- 
gence along other lines. Likewise, size of vocabulary, ac- 
curacy in computation, and other special types of reaction 
are being found more and more to correlate with each other. 
In combination, they afford a general estimate of the individual. 
The idea, for some reason dear to human nature, that a 
person who is very poor in one thing is likely to be very good 
in another, is not borne out by psychological investigation. 
There are children with special abilities and special disabilities 
but they are rare. This does not mean that all children or 
all adults are equally gifted in all directions; but it seems 
very likely that personal interest, emotional bias, or family 
tradition dictates the line along which specialists and experts 
develop rather than any isolated inborn trait. The fact 
that three generations in a certain family have produced em- 
inent surgeons may be just as easily accounted for by interest 
as by endowment. In short, intelligence tends to be general 
and its early specialization is naturally rare and educationally 
undesirable. 
The discovery by Alfred Binet, the French psychologist, 
that general intelligence grows by law and not by accident,
-P-A-G-E-62
34 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
is one of those sublimely simple truths which it has taken 
centuries to arrive at. The theory underlying the whole 
testing idea is that children’s minds develop more or less 
evenly from one level to another according to age. Each 
succeeding year in the life of a normal child shows him just 
that much better able to comprehend and cope with his en- 
vironment than did the year before. 
It was one thing to discover that intelligence was measur- 
able in chronological units, and still another to develop ac- 
curate instruments for gauging it. Ten years have passed 
since Binet’s death, and the work of refining and improving 
his methods is still going on. Binet’s method, which is the 
basis of most of our modern tests, was to discover by ex- 
periment the kind of intellectual tasks which show steady 
improvement in their performance from year to year as chil- 
dren develop, and to establish norms for each successive year. 
The best tests are those which reflect the age differences most 
accurately. The policy of the psychological test is to pro- 
vide a maximum of chances, both to fail and to succeed, and 
to regard as diagnostic only the composite result of a liberal 
series of performances. As Terman says, “By a given mental 
age we mean that degree of general mental ability which is 
possessed by the average child of corresponding chronologi- 
cal age.” 
After a mental age is computed, it has meaning only in re- 
lation to the chronological age. Having reduced the child’s 
mental age and his chronological age to months, the ratio of 
the former to the latter is found. This ratio is called the 
Intelligence Quotient (IQ). It not only places the child in 
relation to children of his own age, but orientates him in com- 
parison with all other children whose IQ is known. This 
makes it possible to compare the abilities of school children 
of all ages, since the IQ has a tendency, as we shall later have
-P-A-G-E-63
  DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 35 
occasion to show, to remain fairly stationary as the child 
progresses in his actual age from year to year. This mental 
development continues with amazing steadiness and regularity 
from birth up to a year not as yet exactly defined during 
adolescence. ‘‘Although we are not as yet justified,” says 
Dr. L. S. Hollingworth, ‘‘in stating on the basis of experimen- 
tal evidence exactly the age where mental growth ceases on 
the average, we are justified in stating that it most probably 
lies between thirteen and twenty years. Thus development 
is normally ‘arrested’ in all human beings between these 
limits. Such advantage as the average forty-five-year-old 
has over the average twenty-year-old in the management of 
affairs consists in additional knowledge, experience, and help- 
ful specific habits, — not in additional capacity for learning 
new things, which are equally unfamiliar to both.” 1 
If it seems strange that one’s mental growth should stop 
so soon, one needs only to compare it to the physical growth 
of the individual, which also reaches its stopping point during 
the period of adolescence. The reports concerning the ap- 
parently low mental age of the army seem to have caused 
much popular concern, which is partly based on a misconcep- 
tion concerning the mental maturity of normal intelligence. 
Psychological tests are so new that an accurate appreciation 
of the significance of mental age has not yet become general. 
The middle-aged man who hears that the mental age of the 
majority of the drafted men was beneath fourteen years com- 
pares this with his own chronological age, which gives him a 
startling advantage. In point of fact, this advantage is 
illusory, as we have seen. The mental progress of adult 
years is not a continuation of the mental growth experienced 
up to and during adolescence. The adult may add to his

36 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
equipment in the way of special training, information, and 
expertness, but he does not go on increasing in native physical 
and mental capacity ad infinitum. 
Much of the opposition to psychological tests is founded 
upon an emotional reaction against the idea that human 
limitations can be declared. Once this possibility is admitted, 
everyone feels that his privacy is invaded. Each one makes 
a personal application and is alarmed at the thought that his 
secret inferiorities may now be published to the world. Evi- 
dence of this is the stereotyped retort: ‘‘I’m sure I couldn’t 
pass the eight-year-old test myself; I should turn out to be 
an imbecile.” Growing out of this personal reaction is the 
more altruistic but no less violent revolt against the mere 
suggestion that every human being does not hold infinite 
possibilities. We like to believe that every child, given a 
proper environment, may turn out to be a genius. 
Yet when we face the problem with scientific candor, we 
are obliged to admit that only two alternatives exist. Either 
everybody is born with the same intellectual potentialities 
or not. Either everybody is equally endowed or differently 
endowed. If the latter is true, the whole matter of classifying 
intelligence becomes merely a question of method. Have 
we, so far, discovered a means of measuring the intellectual 
capacity of an individual early enough in life to conserve 
and cultivate his specific possibilities? Or must we go on 
learning too late and only through experience what might 
have been an invaluable guide in the choice of an educational 
program? Those of us who believe in psychological tests 
feel that, however crude and inadequate our present methods 
may be, we have at least at our command a means of dis- 
covering the grosser differences in intellectual endowment 
in early childhood. 
How large a part of the human personality is determined by
-P-A-G-E-65
DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 37 
the intellectual status of a person is a question which we must 
of necessity leave open. We do not wish anywhere to convey 
the idea that we overestimate the part which intellect plays 
in the development of personality. While undoubtedly 
intelligence is the greatest single factor in the ability to do 
school work, we are certainly entitled to doubt whether ability 
to master the school curriculum as it is today is the most im- 
portant factor of success in after-life. The- usefulness to 
humanity of a person emotionally well educated, though of 
limited intelligence, is largely undemonstrated because of 
our insistence upon the fetish of the three R’s. On the stub- 
born rocks of such a narrow conception of education, how 
many dispositions have been wrecked we shall never know. 
How many antisocial characters have received their original 
bias from continuous conflict with uncongenial school tasks is 
probably inestimable. Most modern educators have sufficiently 
departed from the stern New England tradition of education 
to believe that a child thrives better in an atmosphere of suc- 
cess and hope than in one of threats and punishment. 
Once we have determined to the best of our belief that a 
child is so limited intellectually that he is not going to find 
joy and success in the pursuit of academic learning, why 
should we consign him to the uncongenial tasks for which 
he is unfitted and the companionship of those who make him 
daily and hourly conscious of his inevitable failure? On the 
other hand, there is little to be gained in character by the 
child of superior intelligence who easily grasps each problem 
as it is explained and must then sit idly by until the others 
have caught up. Correspondingly, all along the line, char- 
acter development is least interfered with where the intellec- 
tual stimulus is adapted to the child’s real ability to respond 
and where success in competition with his peers is a daily 
experience. When a task is too hard or too easy, the result

38 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
is overstrain or under-effort; neither of these is a mentally 
hygienic or a normal condition of childhood. 
CLASSIFICATION OF A FIRST GRADE 
We started out to classify the six-year-old children as 
they entered school on the supposition that we should find a 
distribution of intelligence conforming more or less closely 
to the normal curve of distribution. The normal frequency 
surface is represented by Figure 1. The tables in the following 
pages show that these expectations were justified except in 
regard to the lower end of the curve where our figures showed 
  Fic. 1. — Normal frequency curve. (From McCall’s How to Measure in Edu- 
cation, page 356, Fig. 27.) 
markedly higher percentages than the normal curve. As 
McCall says, ‘‘A random sampling of most facts gives the 
normal surface. Morality, intelligence, the weights and heights 
of men, the blueness of eyes and, doubtless, the intensity of 
halos, fit the normal curve. It is seldom that mental and 
educational scores make a perfectly normal surface, but they 
usually give a rough approximation to it.” 
The actual distribution of intelligence among the six-year- 
old children of Public School 64 was made the subject of a 
special study. Every child in the entering classes of four

At first we believed that this was due to the language diffi- 
culties encountered in testing six-year-old children coming 
from bi-lingual homes. However, the curve derived from 
the tests of the older children in the upper grades, as will be 
seen hereafter, showed the same general tendency. Also, 
when our six-year-old children were re-tested, they did not 
indicate a more marked tendency to raise their IQ’s than 
did the children of other ages. We must therefore infer
-P-A-G-E-70
42 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
that the deviation from the normal curve is due to some 
process of selection in the neighborhood, since these six-year- 
old children represent all the children in the district, rather 
than to the inadequacy of the test itself when applied to 
children at this early age.

CLASSIFICATION BY GROUP TESTS OF UPPER GRADES 
In the upper part of the school, beginning with the fifth 
grade, the National Intelligence Test was given to groups of 
forty for the purpose of classification. When these tests 
were gathered together, it gave us the first picture we had 
had of the distribution of intelligence in the upper part of the 
school. The scores from the tests were turned into mental 
ages from which IQ’s were made. The following record shows 
the mental ages by years and months which correspond to the 
scores by National Intelligence Test A. 1

the children of that age had been placed in the ungraded 
classes, a few in the gifted classes, and a considerable number 
had left school to go to work. In spite of this fact, there was 
a great similarity between the curve showing the distribution 
of intelligence here and that of the six-year-old group. We 
were obliged to conclude that our work of classification in 
the upper grades had been to a large extent offset by the influx 
of children from other schools where the extreme types had 
not been removed from the regular classes.

Also, the fact that we had a pre-vocational course to interest 
children who would ordinarily go to work early helped to 
reduce the number thus lost to the school. In the years 1920 
and 1921, jobs were unusually hard to get and no child was 
permitted to receive his ‘‘working-papers”’ without a signed 
slip from his prospective employer. Another counterbalanc- 
ing factor has been that our school has attracted children

of the problem type because of our shops and our reputa- 
tion for handling such cases. It seems probable, therefore, 
that while this upper group was not unselected, the forces 
of selection had more or less counterbalanced each other. 
We probably shall not err far in concluding that these two 
curves — the six-year-old group and the older group — are 
fairly representative of our neighborhood population.!

  DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 49 
THE YOUNG CHILD AND THE INDIVIDUAL TEST . 
In the work of grading our school, we tried to give special 
attention to the best method of classifying young children; 
that is, children who are below ten years of age. The children 
studied were in the first, second, and third grades, but mostly 
in the first and second grades. The following conclusions 
therefore should apply only to young children. 
The group tests included were made at different times and 
given to children all of whom received the individual Terman 
Test. Sometimes the Terman Test was given before and some- 
times after the group test.!. These tests were given for the 
purpose of exploring new tests rather than the purpose of 
classifying the children, as the children were classified by the 
individual test. After four years’ work the amount of mate- 
rial accumulated suggested the comparison shown in Table 
XIV. 
The correlation of the teacher’s estimate with the Terman 
Test is included because it is suggestive of the older method of 
classification, although it has little statistical value. It is 
only fair to note that the correlation would necessarily be low 
owing to the small number of cases and the homogeneity of 
the group. Wherever we have worked out correlations be- 
tween psychological tests and the teacher’s judgment, they 
have usually given .3 and .4, also being subject to the above 
limitations. Terman quotes the correlation which he found 
as .48. 
The Terman Tests included in Table XIV require a separate 
explanation. During the six years in which we have given 
Terman Tests to children in the lower grades, we have dis- 
covered: pragmatically that the abbreviated scale consisting 
of the four starred tests was almost as accurate as the complete 
'The authors are indebted to Mary Cover, M.A., and Hazel A. Sco- 
field, M.A., for giving the group tests.

scale and frequently more practical. None of these abbre- 
viated tests are included in the comparison between long 
and short Termans. Instead, roo full tests covering the 
whole range of IQ’s were selected merely on the basis of being 
full tests. On these roo test sheets, the IQ’s were also cal- 
culated as if the starred tests only had been given. Then 
again, the IQ’s were calculated on the basis of two tests to 
the year. These two tests for each year were selected from 
among the four starred tests purely on the judgment of the 
psychologist who had had the most experience in giving 
tests to the children of the school. The criterion of selection 
was the diagnostic value of the test and its quickness in giving. 
The two tests per year selected are given below.

From the foregoing table we see that the teacher’s estimate 
correlates with the Terman Test, .369; the Pressey Primer 
Scale, .325; the Haggerty Delta 1, .486; and Myers’ Mental 
Measure, .547. All of these correlations are so low that it 
makes their value to the school very questionable. On the 
other hand, the abbreviated four-test Terman correlates .973 
while the two-test Terman correlates .953. This contrast be- 
tween the low correlation of the group test and the high cor- 
relation of the abbreviated scale points to the distinct supe- 
riority of the individual method, no matter how brief the test. 
We do not wish to be misunderstood as advocating the use 
of the short test when the complete test can be given. When  
-P-A-G-E-80
52 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
the purpose is a diagnosis which seriously affects the life of the 
individual, such as a court decision or granting a scholarship 
to a gifted child, no time or pains should be spared. In such 
cases, one often wishes for more rather than fewer tests in 
order to make the estimate of the individual as reliable as 
possible. These cases, however, are the exception rather 
than the rule, and as a matter of fact, there is no temptation 
for the psychologist to slur the exceptional child. 
These findings are in the main very similar to those of 
other workers in the same field. The scale has in actual 
practice been abbreviated in various ways. In the second 
edition of Terman’s record booklet, a short scale was in- 
dicated by starring four tests in each year (six in year 12) and 
this is the most commonly used abridgment. Terman goes 
so far as to recommend the vocabulary test alone as a brief 
intelligence scale. Although we have found this to be the 
best single test above the age of ten, we should prefer always 
to add a number test in each year. The vocabulary test for 
the eighth year has been practically useless in our foreign- 
born community. The children come from bi-lingual homes, 
and it is not until between the eighth and tenth years, when 
they have access to books through learning to read, that the 
process of compensation is completed. From that time on, 
we have found that the vocabulary is as adequate a test of in- 
telligence in our neighborhood as in any other. 
Further corroboration of our experience is found in the 
report on psychological examining in the United States Army. 
“The reliability of the abbreviated Stanford-Binet Test had 
been determined in pre-war work at Stanford University 
with several groups of subjects. For a group of several hun- 
dred male adults, including ‘hoboes,’ prisoners, and reform 
school inmates, mental age based on three tests per year 
(four tests in year 12) correlated 0.96 with the mental ages of 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
  DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 53 
the same subjects based on the entire scale. The mental age 
range of this group corresponded closely to that found for 
soldiers, except that it had a somewhat larger proportion of 
low-grade cases. The corresponding correlation (between 
the two halves of the scale) for several groups of public-school 
children varied from 0.93 to 0.97. It is evident, therefore, 
that the reduction of the scale from six to four tests per year 
involves but slight loss of accuracy.” 1 
Yerkes and Yoakum, in their briefer account of the army 
tests, refer to the successful use of a two-test scale. ‘‘The 
abbreviated form of the Stanford-Binet scale, consisting of 
only two tests per year, extensively used in the army, cor- 
relates .g2 with results for the entire scale.” ? 
These correlations show what several years’ experience has 
taught us—that, in the classification of young children, 
group tests as so far devised are not very helpful. If, as so 
often happens in practical school work, the saving of time 
is an important element in the choice of a test, it would seem 
far better that some abbreviated form of an individual test 
be used. When pressed for time, we have frequently used 
the four-test abbreviated scale and found it satisfactory as the 
correlation of .973 would indicate. In Public School 64 we 
have never used the two-test scale. The correlation shown in 
the table above is purely statistical and deductive. However, 
in undertaking a new piece of work where a rapid survey of 
young children is necessary, we should not hesitate to use this 
in preference to any group test with which we have as yet had 
experience. 
The common sense explanation of why an individual test 
is more diagnostic with young children seems obvious. First

  54 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD: 
grade children have not yet become accustomed to listening 
or obeying in a group. Scarcely have they been weaned from 
the individualistic régime of home, where every command 
has been in the form of a personal appeal. In the individual 
test, no matter how brief, the examiner has an opportunity 
to look each child in the eye and discover whether the question 
has penetrated before he records a success or failure in re- 
sponse, while in a group test a very small proportion of the 
children realize that they are being addressed and are ex- 
pected to do something in response. The group test with 
little children becomes therefore merely a test of attention and 
yields, very largely, negative results. Many a six-year-old 
child with a zero-score on the group test will prove the next day 
on an individual test to have an IQ of 100+. Such cases are too 
numerous to be discounted in the classification of a first grade. 
PRACTICAL, NOT NUMEROUS, TESTS ARE NEEDED 
In the process of experimenting at different times and in 
different parts of the school, we have employed many of the 
group tests that are in current use. The results of these have 
been very interesting and enlightening in helping us to choose 
the best tools for classification. We have felt, however, that 
a multiplicity of tests applied to the same groups of children 
would add to the confusion of our work without adding ma- 
terially to its accuracy. We have encouraged experimenta- 
tion in the school with various new tests as they have come 
along, always scrutinizing the results with a view to increasing 
our resources for the purpose of classification. The only 
tests which we have actually employed for this purpose, how- 
ever, are the following three: The Stanford-Binet (both 
complete and four-test scale) ; the National Intelligence Test 
(Scale A); the Pintner-Patterson Performance Test, where a 
non-language test was needed.
-P-A-G-E-83
" DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 55 
There are three criteria’ which a group test must satisfy 
in order to qualify for school classification. They are the 
following : 
1. It shall have diagnostic value over a wide range of in- 
telligence. 
2. It shall be simple and easy to give and to score. 
3. It shall have reliable norms made on a large number of 
cases. 
The National Intelligence Test was chosen in preference 
to the other group tests for several reasons. It was prepared 
under the auspices of the National Research Council and 
was the first test to take advantage of the wide experience 
gained in the army. It promised therefore to have the most 
accurate and expeditious technique as yet devised. During 
the two years of its use in Public School 64 it has fulfilled our 
expectations in this respect. 
During the first month of its release, the National Scale A 
was used as one of six psychological tests which at that time 
were being given in the school under the direction of Dr. J. L. 
Stenquist, of the Bureau of Reference, Research, and Statis- 
tics, to 560 children from the fourth to the eighth grades in- 
clusive. This gave an opportunity to compare the National 
Scale A with a composite of six tests which included, in 
addition to the National Scale A, the following: The National 
Scale B; Haggerty Delta 2; Otis Advanced; Myers’ Men- 
tal Measure; and Kelly-Trabue Language Completion Test 
(considered here as an intelligence test).1 
The survey showed on 560 cases a correlation between the 
National Scale A and the composite of .801, with a probable 
error of .or. This was not absolutely the highest correlation

-P-A-G-E-84
56 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
obtained, since the Haggerty Delta 2 had a correlation with 
the composite of .808, with a probable error of .or. How- 
ever, in spite of this slight difference in favor of the Haggerty, 
the National Scale A was preferred because of its greater ease 
in giving and scoring. The teachers who had taken part in 
giving and scoring the six intelligence tests and four subject- 
matter tests were asked to rank the ten tests in order of their 
preference in regard to giving and scoring. In both respects, 
the National Scale A ranked first while Haggerty Delta 2, 
its only rival, ranked seventh in regard to giving and eighth 
in regard to scoring. This accorded with our own experience. 
Another advantage of the National was that we might expect 
norms on a larger number of cases than on any other test 
because it was destined for a wider use, owing to its deriva- 
tion from the army tests and the auspices under which it was 
produced. We therefore decided upon the National Scale A 
as a routine group test for all grades from the fourth to the 
eighth inclusive. 
In the spring of 1921 a study was undertaken by a Columbia 
student, to find the correlation between the National Intelli- 
gence Scale and the Stanford-Binet. 
A random sampling of children, consisting of 33 cases rep- 
resenting the intelligence distribution of the entire 5B grade, 
were given individual Terman Tests and their IQ’s correlated 
with their N. I. T. scores. The correlation found on this small 
group was .842 with a probable error of .341. The limitations 
of this study are evident, but it is mentioned here for whatever 
corroborative value it may have. 
The correlation which was found later in the upper part of 
the school on the cases which had both the National Intelli- 
gence Test and the Stanford-Binet, added evidence as to 
1 Helen M. Seidman, in a thesis presented at Columbia University for degree 
of M.A 3
-P-A-G-E-85
  DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIFICATION 57° 
what might be expected in a classification on such a basis. 
On 129 cases, we found the correlation to be .796 with a prob- 
able error of .o42. While we do not regard the Stanford- 
Binet as infallible, it is conceded to be so far the best measure 
we have with which to compare newer and less established 
tests. 
It was always our intention to place a higher value on the 
accuracy with which a classification or evaluation works out 
practically than on its statistical relatidn to an existing stand- 
ard; yet we must use the scientific means at hand in forming 
the hypotheses on which we work. In short our ideal is to 
use a realistic check on academic theory. 
Many psychologists seem to think that it is profitable to 
use as many tests as possible on the same children. We have 
come to the conclusion, however, that, interesting as this may 
be from the point of view of studying the tests, it is not the 
thing to do in the classification of a large school. Here the 
prime requisite in the choice of a method is the ability to put 
into accurate and definite form the best possible rating that 
can be obtained for each child in the shortest possible time. 
The complications arising out of the complexities of a public 
school organization and the large numbers of children to be 
handled at promotion time, absolutely demand a simplifica- 
tion of technique. We are firmly convinced that much of 
the excellent work that has been done throughout the country 
in making surveys has been practically lost to the schools 
themselves because of the neglect of this important considera- 
tion. Of course one appreciates that much of this type of 
work is done for the training of students and the compilation 
of statistical material. From this point of view, no one can 
doubt that light has been shed upon educational problems 
and valuable investigations have been stimulated. However, 
we believe that a great deal of good work has been wasted,
-P-A-G-E-86
eT ae ee ear TS Ne Tee roa pore err ne ate pRR Un RT SRT Eng hema eee pret aay 
- 58 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
so far as school procedure is concerned, because psychologists 
have insisted on elaborating their material instead of sim- 
plifying it. The academic array of material that is so fre- 
quently returned to the school rather intimidates the executive 
staff and paralyzes activity on the part of the teachers in- 
stead of stimulating it. 
No survey should be considered complete unless it is 
followed up for at least one term by the services of a psycholo- 
gist who remains in and with the school to interpret the tech- 
nical findings for the practical use of the teachers. In our 
school, whatever our limitations, we have always had at least 
this advantage: that the psychological staff has been con- 
stantly on the spot to interpret its own material and learn by 
its own mistakes. 
Nothing so convinces the teacher of the general applica- 
bility of psychological tests as their ability to throw light on 
the difficulties of individual children. Many teachers, es- 
pecially those who have been for several years in the system, 
look with skepticism on all new methods which claim to offer 
a panacea for the general problems of the classroom. But 
fortunately it is the rare teacher who has been so long at her 
task that she has become hardened to the emotional appeal 
of the misfit child. It is through the individual problem that 
psychology must, for a long time, still make its most effective 
approach to educational service.  
-P-A-G-E-87
CHAPTER IV 
Tue TEACHER AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST 
We started our experiment in psychological grading with 
three main purposes in view: (1) To reduce or eliminate re- 
tardation, (2) to make homogeneous groups for instruction, 
and (3) to increase our understanding of the individual child. 
The first is logically the most promising aim of the three, but 
has been the hardest to accomplish. In the second, we have 
undoubtedly succeeded to a considerable degree. In the third, 
we have succeeded rather beyond our original expectations. 
Let us turn our attention first of all to the matter of re- 
tardation, which has offered the most stubborn resistance to 
our efforts. As is well known, this is a problem which we 
share with every school in the country. Many statistical 
" studies have been made showing the extent of retardation on 
the basis of chronological age. The work of Leonard P. 
Ayres! was the first of a series of such studies setting forth 
distressful facts. The results of G. D. Strayer’s? investiga- 
tion showed that in 318 cities, one-third of the children are 
retarded one year or more. The most recent report for New 
York City * states that 31 per cent of the children are over- 
age, that is, one or more grades behind the grade to which

60 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
their age entitles them. In all these studies, the child is 
allowed almost, if not quite, two years to a grade, so that this 
chronological measurement of retardation is to be regarded as 
a lenient rather than a rigorous one. 
The pioneer investigators were inclined to take an optimis- 
tic view of the evil: they considered the most important causes 
resided in objective factors to a large extent removable. Ter- 
man’s ! analysis of retardation emphasized the importance of 
the subjective factor and pointed out, as the chief cause, the 
variability of mental endowment among school children. He 
called attention for the first time to the fact that the over-age 
and therefore apparently retarded child was sometimes in a 
grade beyond the one for which he was actually qualified. 
These considerations made the problem now appear in its true 
complexity, and suggested for the first time a new objective 
cause: the standard school curriculum. The production of 
laggards must go on so long as the sacred inviolability of the 
scholastic curriculum persists. 
WHERE TO ATTACK RETARDATION 
The studies of retardation which have been published have 
served to stimulate further studies but little effort at practical 
improvement. Administrators and teachers read the reports 
from other cities and conclude that their own schools are no 
worse than the others — they may even be two per cent better 
—and decide to let well enough alone. If they do decide to 
take action, they usually attack the problem from the point of 
view of the extreme cases. The place where retardation is 
most curable is when the child is only one year or even one 
term behind. In this group are found those who are adventi- 
tiously retarded and for whom something may be done. The 
1 Terman, Lewis M. The Intelligence of School Children. Houghton Mifflin, 
Boston, 1919.
-P-A-G-E-89
THE TEACHER AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST 6r 
child who graduates from the school one term or one year 
late might possibly have been saved this delay by a little 
timely help; but the child who is four terms behind is prob- 
ably in a situation caused by a factor which also operates to 
make him unable to compensate for it. 
Our school budgeteers and economists who desire to save 
money for the city should take a lesson from the modern 
health movement. Nowadays, we try to increase public health 
by teaching health habits to those who are not necessarily 
ill but are candidates for illness because of their unhy- 
gienic habits. The anti-tuberculosis society does not con- 
centrate all its money and attention on hospital cases and 
hopeless invalids, but puts into the forefront of its work the 
fresh-air camps and nutrition classes for the children with a 
tubercular tendency. If the school adopted a similar policy 
against retardation, it would not, as is now the rule, spend all 
its effort on the over-age child instead of the one who is 
slightly retarded. The summer school, for instance, accepts 
the over-age retardate and turns away the child who is pro- 
moted on trial. If the problem is to be sincerely attacked, this 
policy needs an outright reversal. 
As the housewife gets used to a backache and drags along 
with it from day to day; as the child is a little underweight 
and stays so, and the mother doesn’t mind ; — so the school 
remains indifferent to a great amount of remediable retarda- 
tion. This can easily be located by a combination of psycho- 
logical and pedagogical tests. If the child can make good on 
both of these, it shows that he can really do the work. If he 
isn’t doing it in his daily program, there is some objective 
reason which needs to be searched out. Also, as Terman 
points out, there is much remediable retardation among 
bright children who are placed too low. If sufficient atten- 
tion were given to the proper placement of these children and
-P-A-G-E-90
62 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
of those who are normally endowed but accidentally retarded, 
we should not only encourage the children themselves but 
should save enough terms to pay for the smaller classes and 
added equipment for the special training of those children whom 
we now consider as retarded but who are really underendowed. 
During one term in our school, one hundred over-age boys 
were skipped on the basis of the intelligence test. Their 
cases had been brought to light in the course of the regular 
group test. All but three of these made their promotion the 
following term. Since it costs $32 a term to educate a child 
in the New York public schools, this means that approx- 
imately $3000 were saved by the extra promotions thus 
successfully made. Although we are not recommending psy- 
chological tests as a measure of economy, and believe that 
more rather than less money should be spent on public educa- 
tion, this experience may suggest to other schools that psycho- 
logical testing need not necessarily be an extravagance. The 
saving to the boys who were thus encouraged in the matter of 
ambition, spirit, and character was a consideration of far greater 
weight, but one which is often forgotten by those who watch 
the columns of the financial budget. 
MEASUREMENT OF RETARDATION BY PEDAGOGICAL TESTS 
We shall give here in detail our experience in dealing with 
retardation in a large school. In the first place a measure- 
ment was undertaken, not on the basis of age, but of ability. 
An extensive survey was made by J. L. Stenquist of grades 
within the school which had not yet been classified by psycho- 
logical tests. This considered retardation on the basis of 
educational tests given to 2033 children from the third to the 
eighth grades, inclusive. In Table XV we have a picture of the 
retardation in the school, estimated on this basis. The 
measure here used is the relationship of the child’s ability to
-P-A-G-E-91
THE TEACHER AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST 63 
do grade work to the actual grade in which he is placed. The 
ability to do grade work was determined by three tests: 
(r) Kelly-Trabue Language Completion Exercise ; (2) Woody- 
McCall Fundamentals of Arithmetic; (3) Thorndike Visual 
Vocabulary Test. 
In Table XV no reference is made to chronological age. 
Each of the groups is composed of children of different types 
and ages. They are arranged horizontally by actual grades 
and vertically by grade achievement. Clearly, the children 
in the upper right-hand triangle are too advanced for their 
ability. That is to say, 59 children in the fifth grade are doing 
third grade work; 31 in the sixth grade are doing third grade 
work; 2 in the seventh and 1 in the eighth grade are doing 
third grade work. In the second line, 72 in the sixth grade 
are doing fourth grade work; 19 in the seventh are doing 
fourth grade work; and so on. In the lower left-hand tri- 
angle we find the children who are able to do work above the 
grade in which they are placed. These are the children who 
are actually retarded although they are not usually considered 
so. That is, 1 child in the third grade was found to be able to 
do fifth grade work; 12 in the fourth grade were able to do 
sixth grade work; 18 in the fifth grade were able to do seventh 
grade work; and so on. In the same way, the figures be- 
tween the triangles may be interpreted, being susceptible to a 
similar analysis. The same conditions exist but are more 
amenable to treatment, because the children have not deviated 
so far from the normal rate of progress as in the instances cited. 
Such a table as the following should always be accompanied 
by a list of the individuals who compose each group. It can be 
interpreted only in the light of the following facts for each 
child concerned: (1) his chronological age, (2) his school 
record, (3) his intelligence rating by individual test, (4) his 
health record, and (5) the findings of the visiting teacher. Let
-P-A-G-E-92
64 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
us take, for instance, the 59 children who are in the fifth grade 
and are found to be able to do third grade work. In such a 
group we should expect to find a certain quota of mental defec- 
tives who had not yet been assigned to an ungraded class; 
a much larger quota of dull normal children for whom the 
curriculum was already too unpalatable to stimulate their 
efforts; the remainder would constitute a group for further 
investigation. The school record, the home situation, and 
other personal facts need to be searched out in order to bring 
to light the objective reasons which have influenced the child’s 
school progress. In this group will be found those children 
for whom the school and the visiting teacher can, by codpera- 
tion, do something effective.

In the same way, the 12 children in the fourth grade who 
did sixth grade work on the test must be individually analyzed. 
Some of these children, of the right age for the class but 
brighter than the average, might be given an extra promotion. 
A small number of over-age children will be found who have 
not kept up with the normal age-grade progress, but probably 
can, with assistance, catch up with their year; finally, one or 
two of these children will be of that type well known to every 
teacher, who can do well on a “spurt” but whose general 
level of school performance would not make it advisable to 
place them in a higher grade. 
RETARDATION MAKES FOR MALADJUSTMENTS 
The progress which children make in school is of two kinds: 
(1) actual and (2) specious. One of the methods of meeting 
the retardation problem is a practical disregard of the actual- 
ities. The school makes a tacit ruling that children who have 
failed to accomplish the desired results shall be advanced to 
the next grade in spite of such failure. Observation has 
taught us — and truly — that it is useless and uneconomic to 
retain the failures in their classes more than two terms. Such 
pupils gain nothing by repeating the grade, although the cur- 
rent assumption is that all of them are capable of profiting by 
the standard course of study if they persist long enough. 
The problem of retardation has been met in other ways. Ex- 
tra time is sometimes spent by the teachers, usually after 
school hours, in reaching the laggards. Another method is to 
divide the class into smaller groups and have the teacher 
devote her attention to one group at a time. The outcome 
of all this has been that many children of small native 
ability have reached the middle and upper classes of every 
school, more and more unfitted for taking up the work of 
the next higher class. From the point of view of actually
-P-A-G-E-94
66 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
enforcing academic standards, this process cannot be de- 
scribed as a success. 
The effects of the faulty system of grading and promotion 
are seen in the pupils themselves. This important aspect of 
retardation has been too little regarded. Hitherto teachers 
have been content to teach and have considered this the ful- 
fillment of their duty. The child’s reactions to being taught 
have been ignored; or at best they have been met by vague 
personal impressions or accidental and blundering recognition. 
Making a scientific estimate of the damage to individual char- 
acter, which is incidental to retardation, has not been con- 
sidered a part of the school’s regular duty. 
Many of the retarded children have developed the most un- 
desirable social traits as a result of their efforts to get on. 
Some of them, realizing their own inferiority, have become ex- 
perts in tricks designed to deceive the teacher. Mechanical 
memorizing of work which they could not understand has led 
others to believe that they knew subjects which in reality were 
absolutely strange to them. They wanted to graduate and 
were impelled to use unfair ways when fair ways had failed’ 
them. 
Ideally, a child should proceed through school unself-con- 
sciously. He should not focus his attention on his rate of 
progress, and normally he would not do so. But once the 
shock of being “left back’’ has entered into his system, or 
once the fear of being “left back”? has begun to accompany 
him in his progress through the grades, he is in the position of 
a dyspeptic who is always thinking of his food. His teachers 
and his parents are so worried about him and so anxious about 
his being educated fast enough, that they must forever be 
examining and promoting or demoting him. The child’s atti- 
tude more often than not is that of a veritable hypochondriac 
who is so afraid that he won’t pass and won’t be promoted
-P-A-G-E-95
    THE TEACHER AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST 67 
that even his available powers of attention are seldom at his 
command. All this fear and worry is directly stimulated by 
both home and school influences. We know that we do not 
overestimate its existence in the child because it exists in the 
attitude of the teachers and the atmosphere of the school itself. 
“ THE TRADITION OF “LEAVING BACK” 
One source of failure, in any attempt to relieve retardation, 
deserves special comment. As long as public education has 
been in vogue, it has been considered inevitable that a certain 
percentage of the pupils should be “left back.” This has 
been regarded as a normal phenomenon, and has never been 
seriously questioned until the statisticians began about fifteen 
years ago to point out its expensiveness. Since that time, as 
we know, little improvement has been made. The influences 
which have produced retardation are also effective in main- 
taining it. One of these, and certainly not the weakest, is the 
traditional attitude of the school. 
It seems almost impossible to eradicate permanently this 
-factor in retardation. The teacher seems to feel that if every- 
one succeeds in absorbing the course of study, it means that 
the course of study is too easy to respect. To retain its pres- 
tige it must have its modicum of victims. Also, there exists 
among teachers a certain criticism of each other which oper- 
ates against the promotion of a doubtful child. The teacher 
who intimates that the pupils she receives are not well pre- 
pared, conveys a painful insult to the previous teacher. To 
this kind of criticism each is extremely sensitive. We have ob- 
served repeatedly that the teacher who takes her class with 
her will promote nearly all of them. ‘‘If I had known I was 
going to keep this class,” a teacher was heard to say, ‘‘I would 
not have left Morris back.” The remark was received by her 
colleagues as a natural point of view, no one pointing out the
-P-A-G-E-96
  
  68 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
implications for Morris. The insidious fear of criticism, more 
or less unconsciously, makes each teacher willing rather to 
stay the hopes of six children, and charge the bill to the city, 
than to take a chance on any one of the six who might discredit 
her with the colleague in charge of the grade above. 
The teacher needs an objective test to check herself by. 
Her situation is not so unlike that of the mother of a family, 
who, however intimately she might know her own offspring, 
is not equally well acquainted with the children of all the 
other mothers in the apartment house. The teacher in charge 
of a class judges its members only in relation to each other, 
while the psychological test places the child not only in rela- 
tion to the other children of that age in the building, but to all 
the children of that age the country over. It is as if the 
teacher had, for instance, all the ten-year-old children in the 
country standing in a line and ranged in the order of their in- 
telligence from the dullest to the brightest, and could take 
each of her own ten-year-olds and match him to the child of 
corresponding intelligence in the line. She might then stand 
at a distance and perceive for the first time the relation that 
her bright little Johnnie bears to all the bright little Johnnies 
in the United States and how far from the dullest her dull little 
Willie stands in such an array. 
An experienced teacher who has dealt for several years 
with children of approximately the same age and the same 
grade derives, in time, a rough subjective norm whereby she is 
able to judge the individual child as he comes to her. This 
takes years, and may never happen if the teacher frequently 
changes from one grade to another. Nowadays a young 
teacher has at her command a means of obtaining these norms 
by a less arduous and more accurate method. While it is not 
advisable that the teacher should at the same time be a trained 
psychologist, she should know enough about psychological
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE TEACHER AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST 69 
testing to interpret and incorporate in her work the findings of 
a scientific test. A list of ten children who were not doing 
good work was made by a teacher in our school. When tests 
were made, it turned out that three of these had high IQ’s and 
two were candidates for the class for superior children. The 
teacher renewed her efforts on these three, with a changed 
point of view, and at the end of the year, two were actually 
promoted to the Terman class, where they remained with 
good records. We have seldom had a boy whose ability 
showed that he should be advanced out of the regular order 
who did not pick up in conduct as well as in work when given 
the chance to earn his promotion. Sometimes the teachers 
feel indignant at such a procedure because they think that the 
slow-plodding classmates are unfairly treated. 
Everyone profits by viewing his personal and individual 
problems in the light of a larger whole. No one, more than 
the teacher, needs to clarify her judgment by means of objec- 
tive measures and to rid herself of confusing influences that 
arise from the interplay of personality. The very qualities 
which make a good teacher, namely, a sympathetic response 
to the individual and a patient consideration of his peculiar 
traits, often help to make her a poor judge of his relationship 
to the larger and unknown group. Special pleading is a virtue 
in the teacher but a vice in the psychologist. 
The teacher is not trained and should not be trained to take 
a clinical view of her pupils. But she should understand 
enough of the subject to be able to see the relative position 
of her pupils along an imaginary intelligence curve, and to 
guide her efforts accordingly. The children toward the middle 
of the curve should be her measure of the product of grade 
work; those near the lower end should be leniently handled 
and should not be incessantly prodded to perform the impos- 
sible; those with more than average intelligence should be
-P-A-G-E-98
7o FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
held up to high standards of performance and habits of indus- 
try. The difference between the typical attitude of the psy- 
chologist and the teacher is well illustrated by this episode. 
Together they went out to lunch and each gave an order con- 
sisting of half a dozen items. When the orders arrived, the 
teacher’s was right and the psychologist’s was wrong. The 
psychologist observed, ‘‘ You taught your order to the waiter, 
whereas I told him mine to see if he could remember it. You 
got your order and I only got the waiter’s memory span.” 
ATTACKING RETARDATION BY PSYCHOLOGICAL CLASSIFICATION 
We made our principal attack on retardation through the 
psychological classification. It seemed fairly obvious to us 
that, if enough groups were created within a grade, each mov- 
ing at different rates of speed, every type of child could find 
his own place. Save in cases of prolonged absence or other 
genuine objective difficulty, repetition of the grade by individ- 
ual pupils would not be necessary. We should bear in mind 
here that children who have been out of school because of 
sickness or for other reasons, are not true cases of failure to 
advance. They constitute a small group who need but little 
help, and, provided that help is forthcoming, can easily rein- 
state themselves. The true problem is found in a much larger 
group, who, once an incoming class has been sorted by psycho- 
logical tests, can be identified early in their school life. At 
once the possibility of more flexible promotions becomes appar- 
ent. The pupil who begins to lag behind his group can be 
promoted to a class of slower pupils in the next higher grade. 
In this way, he cannot, as formerly, be entirely out of his 
proper place in school. Or else his failure to advance requires 
immediate and properly directed inquiry into his objective 
difficulties by the visiting teacher, for his native ability is no 
longer an unknown factor to confuse the whole situation. In
-P-A-G-E-99
  THE TEACHER AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST 71 
our psychological classification of groups, therefore, we con- 
sidered that we had a new resource at hand in the struggle 
against retardation. 
One of the most important decisions to be made before any 
school can even experiment with psychological tests is this: 
with whom is the decision concerning the placement of pupils 
finally to rest? Shall the teacher’s judgment, which at best 
is a variable quantity depending upon her length of acquaint- 
ance with the child and her ability to judge human nature, be 
allowed to prevail over the findings of the psychologist? Or 
shall the psychological rating, as discovered on the basis of 
a single interview or on the impersonal record of a sheet of 
paper, be allowed to determine arbitrarily the placement of 
achild? The third possibility, that of leaving the decision to 
the principal or other administrative authority, carries the 
disadvantages of both and the advantages of neither. 
It is in the whirlpool which seethes around these rocks that 
most unsuccessful experiments with psychological classifica- 
tion have been shattered, and others will be in the future until 
some solution is found. Through our many blunders at Pub- 
lic School 64, we feel that we have arrived at a working basis 
which avoids the worst snares of all the courses open. 
In the course of the experiment, we focused on two attempts 
to reduce retardation. The first attempt, made in the lower 
grades, met with practically no success. We found that re- 
tardation had such profound roots in the mind of the teacher 
that it was difficult for her to codperate in a real effort against 
it. She instinctively felt that one hundred per cent promo- 
tions was “‘agin natur’.” When the lowest quota of a grade 
had been removed to an ungraded class, the teachers still in- 
sisted on “leaving back”’ the same proportion of children as 
before, although the unpromotable ones had presumably been 
removed. With the second group of teachers in the upper
-P-A-G-E-100
  72 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
grades, and doubtless a better-advised attempt, a higher per- 
centage of promotions was obtained. On the whole, however, 
the reduction of retardation was the least successful part of 
the experiment. 
At the very beginning of the experiment, the psychologist 
was permitted to make the classification of the first grade on 
the basis of the tests alone. This was prior to the populariza- 
tion of psychological tests by the army, and they were practi- 
cally unheard of by the teachers. It seemed to them as if the 
time-honored methods of grading and promotion had been 
exchanged for the occult practices of palmistry, astrology, or 
phrenology. During the first term, they complained so 
loudly that their brightest pets had been discriminated against 
and their most bothersome dullards unjustly rewarded, that 
the confidence of the administration was shaken. The fact 
that these outrageous blunders were shown to be about three 
per cent of the 275 children of the grade made no impression 
on the strong feeling that prevailed. 
The stories of Izzy and Aby and Mannie that were told in 
the teachers’ lunch-room completely finished off the possi- 
bility of a scientific grading for the time being at least. On 
this wave of reaction, the teachers were permitted, at the 
end of the next term, to recommend for promotion and place- 
ment in the usual way, although the testing still went on. 
They were told that their judgment would be pooled with the 
psychological rating. As a matter of fact, however, while 
their recent protests still echoed painfully in the ears of the 
administrator, nothing of the sort was done. The children 
were promoted and graded in much the old-fashioned way, 
and the psychological ratings became little more than an 
ornament to the teacher’s roll-book. This is the point at 
which the psychologist usually retreats and the principal sends 
a letter to the public prints stating that psychological tests 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
THE TEACHER AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST 73 
have been thoroughly tried out in his school and have proved 
a complete failure. 
During the next term nothing seemed to happen. The 
psychological tests were largely ignored except in connection 
with problem cases. Much time was spent by the psycholo- 
gist and visiting teacher in becoming acquainted with excep- 
tional children who belied their IQ’s, and in discussing them 
with the teachers. The emphasis was shifted from the gen- 
eral mass of children to the small percentage of Izzy’s, Aby’s, 
and Mannie’s who always absorb so large a percentage of the 
teacher’s time and interest. 
Meanwhile, psychological tests were making headway in 
the outside world. Through their use in the army and the 
colleges, they came to be discussed in the newspapers. The 
teachers began to take more interest in the scientific aspect of 
the subject. 
Meanwhile, also, the first group which had been scientifi- 
cally classified was making progress through the grades, and 
was gradually justifying itself. The teachers of the middle 
and upper classes began to discuss a better method of grading 
in their part of the school. They adduced cases of outrageous 
injustice which resulted from the older methods of grading. 
They expressed impatience at waiting for the classified group 
to reach them, and asked that their classes might be similarly 
graded. It was here that we had the first fair opportunity for 
the trial of psychological methods. 
METHOD OF CLASSIFYING A FIFTH GRADE! 
The teachers of the 5B grade were called together. There 
were six of them. They were invited to codperate in an experi-

adopted.
-P-A-G-E-102
74 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
ment in grading by group tests in certain specific ways. Each 
teacher was provided with a booklet containing directions for 
giving and scoring the National Intelligence Test, in order 
that they might familiarize themselves with the method to be 
employed. The tests were given by the psychological staff 
and the teachers were invited to be present in some class not 
their own. It was found to be undesirable to have the teacher 
present in her own classroom because the children, accustomed 
to look to her for leadership, failed to give their whole atten- 
tion to the examiner. The teachers were then asked to help 
score the tests and given school time in which to doit. Again 
they were assigned to the scoring of classes not their own. 
Each set of papers was scored by one teacher and checked by 
another, and every third paper was checked again by a 
member of the psychological staff. In this way it was felt 
that a high degree of accuracy was obtained with a minimum 
of labor. 
During the process of scoring, the teachers became very 
much interested in the tests and altogether enlisted in the 
project. They discovered from the tests of a class in which 
they had only an impersonal interest, what a wide range of 
ability was revealed. They came to realize through familiar- 
ity with the right and wrong answers to the questions, the 
marked diagnostic value of the test. Thus, when we were 
called together for a second meeting, it was not difficult to 
come to an agreement based on an impersonal and unpreju- 
diced judgment. It was agreed that the classes should be 
formed in the beginning absolutely on the basis of the test, 
and at the end of the first six weeks a revision should be made 
according to the teacher’s judgment. 
The third meeting, following the specified six weeks’ period, 
was presided over by the head of the department and attended 
by six teachers, the psychologist, and the visiting teacher.
-P-A-G-E-103
THE TEACHER AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST 75 
The teachers brought to the meeting the records and histories 
of all the children whom they regarded as misfits in their 
group. The teacher in charge of the brightest group was 
called on first to discuss the cases of those who were not keep- 
ing up with the work. She reported in detail on three boys, 
one of whom she thought lazy though he showed signs of abil- 
ity, the second of whom she felt was laboring under adverse 
circumstances at home, and the third of whom she considered a 
misfit in her group. The first two were assigned by the chair- 
man to the visiting teacher, and the third was offered to the 
teacher of the next lower group in exchange for one whom she 
considered able to go ahead with the brighter class. The 
teacher of the second group spoke next. In the name of 
science, she offered up two whom she hated to part with, as 
able to enter the brighter group, and spoke of two whom she 
considered unable to keep up with the class and be promoted. 
One of these she consented to try a month longer if the visiting 
teacher would attend to his bedtime hour and make him wear 
his glasses. The other she thought would have a fairer chance 
by entering the slower group at once. 
This process was continued on down until the sixth group 
was reached. Here the teacher complained not of the children, 
of whom but little was expected since they were the slowest on 
the grade, but of the curriculum. He said that he would like 
to have a swimming period at the Boys’ Club once a week and 
a shop period every day, in order to improve his attendance 
and make the boys willing to incur the boredom of academic 
lessons for the sake of activities in which they could really 
take part. The number of children who seemed so disad- 
vantageously placed that a shift should be made was about 
2 percent; another 2 per cent was given to the visiting teacher 
for another type of adjustment. 
These meetings were repeated throughout the term at inter-
-P-A-G-E-104
76 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
vals of about six weeks. Early in the term the head of the 
department made it clear to the teachers that they were to 
retain in their group only children who were able to make 
their promotion with the class, and that there should be no 
hold-overs at the end of the term except in the lowest group. 
This plan was adhered to and practically 100 per cent promo- 
tions were made, when the proper time came, by six out of 
the seven teachers. The lowest, or opportunity class, con- 
stitutes a separate problem of which more will be said in an- 
other place. The small number of children about whom the 
teacher was doubtful were promoted to the next slower group 
of the grade ahead. The teachers of the 6A grade to whom 
these children went expressed satisfaction at the grading of 
the classes that came to them, and the 5B teachers helped in 
re-grading in the same way the new children who came to 
them. 
Thus, we accomplished successfully in the middle part of 
the school what we had failed to accomplish in the lower part. 
But we still believe that this could be done, and much more ad- 
vantageously, in the lower ‘grades. It was at this stage of the 
experiment, however, that the school was changed into a 
junior high school, with gradually diminishing elementary 
grades, so that the further working out of the experiment in 
the lower grades, where it was really most needed, always 
remained in a less satisfactory stage than in the intermediate 
grades. 
Once the tests have been given, the method of grouping 
into classes depends on a number of things. First the number 
of children in the grade must be divided by the number of 
classes to show the average register. In the given 5B grade 
we had 214 children to be divided into six classes. The 
opportunity class, made up of over-age dullards, was per- 
mitted to have a smaller register of 30. The remaining 184 .
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE TEACHER AND THE PSYCHOLOGIST 77 
children were to be divided into five groups of approximately 
37 each. Here we have the problem before us: 214 papers 
scored and checked with the chronological age attached. 
From the point of view of chronological age alone, the problem 
was an interesting one. According to Figure 10, 10 chil- 
dren were nine years old; 104 were ten years old; 57 were 
eleven years old; 29 were twelve years old; 12 were thirteen 
years old; and 2 were fourteen 
years old. 104 -| Chronological | Number 100 Age of Cases 
The 214 papers were separated % 
into six piles, according to chron- *® 
ological age, and each age-group * 
was arranged from the lowest to 2 “uel 
the highest score. It couldnow % 
be seen at a glance that the %| 
youngest children had the high-  {;-E+ 
est scores and the oldest children 3i5 
the lowest scores, while the mid- 35 
dle groups contained practically 204 
the whole range of scores. This iti 
    fact is clearly shown in Figure 4 I 
r1, which gives the distribution aa ee gi aa be 
of the median scores by ages. age at intervals of 1 year of 214 
Here it is clearly brought out es tans oe 
that the median score falls with Es 
each increasing age-group with the exception of the year 13, 
where a sufficient number of cases were retarded for accidental 
reasons other than intelligence. The interesting thing about 
this curve is that it was fairly typical of any grade in the upper 
or middle part of the school, and was found to repeat itself 
over and over in our experience. 
The normal range of age for grade 5B would be from ten to 
twelve years; that is, the child of ten would not be placed no-

78 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
ticeably high for this age nor the child of twelve noticeably low. 
The xo children who were nine years old and the rq children 
who were thirteen and fourteen years old fall outside the nor- 
mal range for the grade. It is among these two groups that 
one would look first of all for exceptional cases. The 2 
fourteen-year-old children received scores among the lowest 
ten of the whole group. These were obviously candidates 
for individual tests on the supposition that they were mental 
defectives so far undiscovered. 
- Of the 12 thirteen-year-old chil- 
dren, 9 received low scores. This 
indicated that they belonged in 
the regular over-age dull-normal 
opportunity class. The other 3

them in the highest class in the grade, which became the

In addition to the 9 thirteen-year-old children with low 
scores, there were 13 twelve-year-old children and 7 eleven- 
year-old children, making a register of 29 for the oppor- 
tunity class. 
Now that the exceptional children both in regard to age 
and score had been disposed of, the remaining 148 children 
were divided into four classes according to their age and rating 
in the test. 
Referring to Figure 12, we see from the wide range of scores 
made by the 5B grade that even a wider diversity of mental

age existed than of chronological age. That this disadvan- 
tageous arrangement, from the point of view of teaching, 
ought not to be repeated in each class, seems fairly obvious. 
At the time these tests were made we had no reliable norms
-P-A-G-E-108
80 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
for turning the scores into mental ages and had, therefore, to 
work out our classification practically by relating the score to 
the age without obtaining a numerical IQ. In the light of 
our later norms, we now see that the mental age range was 
from seven to sixteen years, while the chronological age range 
was from nine to fourteen years. When one looks on this 
mental age range from the point of view of teaching fractions 
and decimals, the situation appears absurd. The classification 
of these children does not eliminate the children of the lower 
mental ages, but at least groups them together in such a way 
that the absurdity of the pedagogical proposition is shown in 
its true light. The necessity of a changed curriculum for cer- 
tain types of children sticks out like a sore thumb, while those 
to whom the present curriculum is most suited are grouped so 
as to receive it with the least possible resistance. 
To go back to the three thirteen-year-old children whose 
cases were referred to the visiting teacher — one of them was 
found to be a strong, healthy youngster who had lost a year’s 
schooling at the age of eight and was easily able to make up 
one grade the following year, with the probability of making 
up another later. This would remove him finally from the 
over-age group. The second boy was a truant and a trouble- 
some pupil. When it was put up to him that he should skip 
a class because of his record in the test, he responded by mak- 
ing B+’s in a class ahead of the one in which he had formerly 
been bringing home consistent records of failure. This was 
in addition to a perfect attendance which now replaced the 
old tendency to truancy. The third boy made an average 
record in the class to which he was skipped. In the upper 
grades, and especially among boys coming in from other 
schools where no testing had been done, we have found many 
cases similar to these and have also found that they responded 
equally well to similar treatment.

CLASSIFICATION OF A SEVENTH GRADE 
As it was impossible to test all the upper grades of the 
school during the same term, the fifth and seventh years were 
chosen as strategic points. An influx of new pupils occurred 
regularly at these two grades. Several of the neighboring 
schools for girls carried the boys through the fourth grade 
and then sent them to us. The influx in the seventh grade 
was due to the fact that the 
Junior High School course, be- ronaogiea| Nosnbor 
ginning at this point, received FY es 
boys from all the six grades pa venee a ‘i x art 
of the Junior High School dis- §Htt 45 years i 16 years 
trict. Thus, by concentrating Total 
our work in these two places, 
at the end of a year all the 
upper part of the school was 
tested and classified. It was 
necessary of course to repeat the 
testing at these two points con- H 
tinuously.! :

children were required to choose between the academic and 
the pre-vocational courses. The division of the grade into 
two parts simplified rather than complicated the problem. 
Each department was treated as a separate school and was 
classified within itself. Both the academic and the pre-voca-

seventh years, 5B and 7B, because the new children from other schools were 
not there in time to be tested for the first term. Later, however, arrangements 
were made to have the children sent in advance for their tests in order that they 
might be classified at the beginning of each year.

unit for independent grouping. 
Conditions in regard to the range of ages and of scores were 
not dissimilar to those found in the fifth grade. Figure 13

sixteen years. Figures 14 and 15 show the distribution by 
scores of the academic and pre-vocational groups separately. 
In the analysis of age and scores for the seventh grade, the 
younger children having high scores were given individual 
tests, and, if they were found to qualify, were placed in the 
classes for gifted children, called Terman classes. This rep- 
resented usually not more than one per cent of the group.

The children with the next highest IQ’s were placed in a group 
called the “rapid advancement class.’ Such classes are a 
part of the regular Junior High School organization through- 
out the city. They are not peculiar to Public School 64 as are 
the Terman classes, and serve an entirely different end. Their 
sole purpose is, as the name indicates, to save time and to 
handle children in unusually large groups. The only difference

between these classes in our school and in other schools was 
that the children were chosen on the basis of psychological 
tests in Public School 64, while in other schools they are 
selected on the basis of the teacher’s recommendation alone. 
At the other end of the scale, the low-score end, individual 
tests were also given. While a considerable number of the 
children with low scores were found to be mental defectives, 
they were not placed in the ungraded classes. We felt that
-P-A-G-E-112
84 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
it was not fair to children who had been allowed to progress so 
far with the expectation of graduation to place them in a de- 
partment where this was not possible. The result was that in 
our upper grades in the opportunity classes we carried a cer- 
tain per cent of this type of material, as do all the other junior 
high schools. 
Just how this situation can best be handled at so late a 
stage of the child’s school career is one of the questions which 
the junior high school must solve. We only know, in a nega- 
tive way, that any added element of discouragement is no 
help to these children in making social adaptations, so im- 
portant in these adolescent years. A record of their limita- 
tions in the hands of the teacher and vocational counselor is, 
however, a positive and an invaluable help in advising them 
in regard to their choice of vocational training or wage-earn- 
ing career.
-P-A-G-E-113
CHAPTER V 
ORGANIZATION OF THE SCHOOL 
The first experiment in a better method of grouping made 
in Public School 64 was initiated early in the school year of 
1912-1913. It was introduced in the upper grades,’ and 
was based on the differences in physiological development 
manifested by pre-adolescent and adolescent boys. The 
phenomena peculiar to this period are familiar to all teachers 
of upper grade children, and include not merely changes in 
stature and appearance, but differences in mental and emo- 
tional attitude, requiring a different kind of appeal on the 
part of the teacher. So marked were the good results obtained 
from classifying the older boys according to physiological 
maturity, that the grouping was adopted as a regular feature 
of the school organization. The boys were happier when thus 
grouped, and the problem of teaching was simplified. Later 
on, when the psychological test was introduced as an instru- 
ment of more careful differentiation, the grouping according 
to physiological age was still retained among the older boys. 
The two methods were found to codrdinate very well in 
practice. 
Through this experiment, the advantage of a homogene- 
ous grouping among the older children, instead of the old 
promiscuous assignments, was first experienced in the school. 
It naturally led to a search for a practical method of differen-

cation were initiated by W. E. Grady, then Principal of Public School 64.

  86 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
tiation among the younger children. The development of the 
psychological test, which has been discussed in the foregoing 
chapters, was a continuation of the effort to make the school 
organization conform to every type of child at every age. 
TYPES OF CLASSES 
The experiment in psychological classification resulted, in 
the course of four years, in a much more diversified organiza- 
tion. At the end of the experiment, the following types of 
classes were provided by the school: 
1. Terman Classes, for very superior and gifted children. 
A specially enriched curriculum is provided, the skipping of 
grades by bright children is avoided. The eight-year course 
is covered, without skipping, in six years. 
2. Superior Classes, for children of considerably more than 
average intelligence. They have the regular curriculum, and 
usually complete the eight-year course in seven years. 
3. Slightly above the Average Classes, for children able to 
do the same work, but a little more intensively than the aver- 
age, and occasionally to make an extra term. 
4. Average Classes, for children who deviate but little 
from the normal. 
5. Slightly below the Average Classes, for slower children 
who are not definitely backward. These children can com- 
plete the eight years in nine. 
6. Opportunity Classes, for children definitely backward 
but not mental defectives. This group is most in need of a 
special curriculum. A beginning has been made in adapting 
the curriculum to its needs. The registers are smaller than 
in the average classes. 
7. Ungraded Classes, for children much below the average 
in mentality. Here the curriculum has been completely 
made over by those in charge of the Ungraded Department.
-P-A-G-E-115
  ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL 87 
8. Neurotic Classes, for children who are not mental de- 
fectives, but behavior problems, who are temperamentally 
peculiar or in need of a period of study and adjustment. 
9. Classes for the Physically Handicapped, including 
classes for children who are underweight and need special 
physical attention, and cardiac classes, for children of all ages 
who have heart trouble. Health is made the center of the 
curriculum. Home visits and mothers’ classes are used to get 
necessary attention to construct health habits. 
10. Foreign Classes, for children of families newly arrived 
in this country. These classes were instituted in response to 
the need which arose when immigration was renewed after 
the war. 
POTENTIAL MENTAL AGES 
As a result of the intelligence tests, we have recognized, 
for the sake of practical management, seven types of pupils. 
They may be grouped, according to IQ and according to the 
potential mental age of their maturity, as follows:

The potential mental ages of the foregoing list are a theoreti- 
cal representation of the mental ages of the adult population, 
1 Calculated on the basis of 16 years as the mental age of the average adult. 
Terman has suggested that this age should be lowered. In any case, the classi- 
fication is not based on absolute but relative ages.
-P-A-G-E-116
88 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
among whom these children will in time come to take their 
places. It will be seen, as Dr. Hollingworth has pointed out, 
that so far as intellectual endowment is concerned, nearly 
all of us remain permanently somewhere between thirteen 
and twenty. We donot know whether these differences play 
a greater or a lesser part in after life than they do in school. 
The question then arises whether school work should not be 
so adapted to children as they really are that the same differ- 
ences should play a lesser part than they now do in marking 
children out as failures, and in emphasizing this mark by a 
punitive system of non-promotions. 
It should be understood that we do not draw sharp distinc- 
tions between the seven groups. We have tried to realize, 
by a practice described in the previous chapter, a high degree 
of flexibility and interrelation between the groups. The IQ 
was used chiefly as a starting point and a working basis. 
Our experience has shown, however, that revisions proved 
necessary or desirable in less than 5 per cent of the cases. 
The method of grouping children of similar abilities together 
involves the consideration of current criticisms of all attempts 
at segregation. It is frequently objected that the children 
become discouraged and depressed because of the inferiority 
feelings engendered among the duller, and that they make 
less progress without the stimulus of competition. In reply 
to the first objection, it may be noted that nothing so habitu- 
ates a child to the feeling of inferiority as to be constantly faced 
by a task which he is incapable of performing, and to witness 
its successful performance by others. In reply to the second, 
it may be said that the homogeneous group makes compe- 
tition fair, for the first time, for the dull and for the gifted. 
For the former especially, it means a chance to realize from 
day to day the ordinary human feeling of triumph, which be- 
longs to a normal personal experience. For the latter, it
-P-A-G-E-117
ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL 89 
means a much-needed spur towards the realization of his ac- 
tual possibilities. 
THE SCHOOL REGISTER 
The psychological classification which underlies the school 
organization was not carried over into the designation of the 
classes. The official register for September, 1921, reproduced ° 
on pages go-92, shows the regular nomenclature used and pub- 
lished by the school. The opportunity classes include classes 
for the gifted as well as for the dull. The superior children 
are provided for partly by the rapid advancement classes, but 
more largely by the ‘‘2” classes (5Bz2) which occur in both the 
regular and the pre-vocational courses. The classes for the 
very dull are known as Ungraded, the term which was adopted 
by the originator of the department many years ago. It may 
just as appropriately be used to designate classes for bright 
children as those for the very dull. As City Superintendent 
Ettinger has said, ‘‘The development of a finer classification 
of our children implies the extension of the ungraded class 
system far beyond its present limits, and also other groupings 
that the present ungraded system does not include. Children 
of a precocious type are entitled to as much consideration as 
those of a subnormal type.” : 
It is by no means necessary that-any invidious terminology 
should be employed in a school because of the psychological 
classification. On the contrary, this should be systematically 
avoided. So far as descriptive names are used at all, such as 
opportunity and pre-vocational, they should not be used ex- 
clusively for one type so that they come to be identified with 
that type alone. It is usually possible to name the course, 
as is the rule in colleges, instead of the children who take it. 
This helps to prevent self-consciousness on the part of the 
child and focuses his attention where it should be — upon 
his work and not upon himself.

RELIABILITY OF CLASSIFICATION 
With regard to the psychological differentiation, the ques- 
tion is often raised as to whether the physical condition of 
the child at the time of the test does not seriously impair the 
validity of the result. Ruling out an acute illness, which the 
examiner can be reasonably trusted to detect, what are the 
most frequent physical defects among school children which 
might be expected to lower their mental efficiency? All 
health statistics go to show that carious teeth, hypertrophied 
tonsils, adenoids, eye defects, and malnutrition are the most 
usual deterrents to normal physical development.’ In regard

eased Tonsils upon the Growth of Intelligence,” Archives of Psychology, No. 
50, New York, April, 1922. 
This and the following paragraphs are the outcome of experience with 
psychological testing. It is unquestionably true that physical defects have a 
very distinct effect upon the school progress of a child, generally speaking. The 
health aspects of the experiment will be discussed in Chapter XI of this study.

to teeth, probably nothing short of a violent toothache, which 
is usually advertised in our neighborhood by a rag wound 
around the head and tied on top, would interfere with a child’s 
answer toa set of simple questions. In regard to the effect 
of the removal of adenoids and tonsils on the improvement 
of the IQ, several studies have been made by psychologists, 
always with negative results. 
The relation of eye defects and malnutrition was made the 
subject of a special study during one term in our school.

groups of intelligence within a 1B grade. It may be seen that 
the proportion of eye defects is not distributed in any direct 
relation to intelligence. While the dullest children: had the 
largest percentage of eye defects, the brightest had the next 
largest. Nothing is definitely proved by such an array of

facts, yet they would lead us to infer that defective vision is 
irregularly distributed among all the grades of intelligence. 
A similar condition was found in a study of the relation 
of malnutrition to intelligence. The best index that we have 
of malnutrition is the relation of weight to height. The 
children included in Figure 17 were judged as underweight 
or not, according to whether they came within ten per cent

of the standard weight for their age and height. The per- 
centages of underweight shown by the figure do not follow in 
any way the distribution of intelligence. The class of children 
of average intelligence contained the largest percentage of 
underweight, while the dullest and the brightest had the least. 
Again the result is negative, and it seems safe to infer that the 
children are not accounted dull because of the supposed in- 
fluence of malnutrition upon their responses. 
As to other sporadic influences which affect the child 
from day to day, such as headache or insufficient sleep or a 
cold in the head, it seems unlikely that any of these conditions 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL 95 
should seriously affect his ability to respond to a question to 
which he knows the answer. It is a mistaken idea that it is 
easier for a child to give a wrong answer than the right one, 
even though he knows the right one. Even a child with a 
temperature finds it just as easy to say that he has five fingers 
on his right hand instead of four if he happens to know it. 
No amount of buoyant health is going to enable him to give 
this simple information if he is not mature enough to have 
arrived at it. 
Nothing could be a greater error than to suppose that school 
children regard the matter of testing as an inquisition or the 
“third degree.”’ On the contrary, in a school where the chil- 
dren are accustomed to be tested they often “hang around” 
the door asking when their turn is to come. If now and then 
a child is shy and offish, he is simply left until a later time when 
he has become sufficiently socialized to wish to share the ex- 
perience of the others. In a neighborhood such as ours where 
families are large and homes are crowded, it is often a unique 
experience for a youngster to receive the undivided attention 
of a grown-up for half-an-hour at a time. Nor is it surprising 
that he responds to this with lively codperation. The con- 
crete materials of the test, the blocks and pictures, are an aid 
in gaining rapport with a young and self-conscious child. Be- 
sides, it is almost an irresistible temptation to any boy, even 
the shyest, to ask him a question to which he knows the answer. 
Even.a little experience soon teaches a psychologist to know 
when ordinary interest is lacking. If, as occasionally happens, 
a new teacher has used the test in advance as a threat, it is 
impossible to proceed without a whole course of therapeutic 
treatment. In our school we had this great advantage, that 
the psychological test was as much a matter of routine as 
was the health examination. It is not usual for a child to 
dread very much what all his comrades have survived.  
-P-A-G-E-124
  96 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
“Don’t the children learn the tests from each other?” is 
frequently asked. This is a natural inquiry from one not 
familiar with the character of the tests. The questions are 
not, like school examinations, measures of information but of 
maturity. A child who is not mature enough to be orientated 
as to the exact date, — day, month, and year, — will not sud- 
denly become so by knowing that he may be asked. It is a 
matter of ordinary observation that a two- or three-year-old 
baby does not know and cannot learn the same things as his 
four- or five-year-old brother. That this same difference of 
capacity exists between ages all the way along the line up to 
mental maturity is not so commonly understood. It seems in- 
credible that a child at one period of his development should be 
unable to copy a diamond-shaped figure, and at the next period, 
only a little later, should be able to do so quite competently 
without any intervening practice. Such subtle differences are 
not a matter of common knowledge, but have been arrived at 
by scientific observation. In fact, this is the very essence of 
Binet’s discovery on which all modern testing is based. 
Another reason why this matter of communication is of no 
consequence is that the children do not remember the tests, 
accurately enough to pass them on. A number of children 
were questioned at one time to see how much they could tell 
immediately after the test. The best that anyone could do 
was, ‘She gave me blocks to see how heavy they were and 
asked me about a lot of words and how much change I’d have 
from the store.’”’ This was a nine-year-old boy of good in- 
telligence. The other replies were even more vague; most 
of the children referred reminiscently to ‘pictures and blocks.” 
Only among the older and very bright children is there a 
possibility of real coaching, enough to affect the scores in 
any way, and here the spirit of competition is sufficient to 
keep them from telling very much. It was not an unknown
-P-A-G-E-125
  ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL 97 
experience with us to discover that an older boy had heard of 
some particular test from a friend. Yet this is as likely to 
make for failure as success, for it is the peculiar nature of the 
intelligence test that it isnot susceptible to parrot-like learning, 
but must be thoroughly understood to yield a plus rating. 
Another question which has to be taken seriously is that of 
the sources of error in determining the IQ’s. Those who have 
had no experience with the results of the test often think that a 
wide difference may arise between the findings of one examiner 
andanother. Asa matter of fact, few differences can be traced 
to this cause. The tests are devised to eliminate the judg- 
ment of the examiner as much as possible. Every word which 
the child speaks is written on the paper, and no examiner is 
considered competent who fails to record all answers fully and 
accurately. This makes it possible for a second examiner to 
check the first, which is the usual practice. The errors in IQ 
which actually occur, proceed more commonly from mistakes 
in mathematical computation, and most frequently of all 
from inaccurate information concerning the date of birth. 
On the child’s permanent school record appears his official 
date of birth, on which his IQ must be based. The school 
may demand his birth certificate for making this record when he 
first enters school. This is not always done, however, and the 
statement of the parent is accepted. The statement may be 
inaccurate, sometimes from ulterior motives, such as wishing 
to enter a child in school before the legal age, and sometimes 
from a general haziness as to dates in a neighborhood which 
lives and dies very largely by the Jewish calendar. Almost 
no dependence could be placed upon the children’s statements 
concerning their own birthdays. Incredible as it may seem, 
when the National Intelligence Test was given to about 300 
seventh grade boys, practically 75 per cent of them gave the 
wrong age or date of birth. There were children in our school, 
| 
a
-P-A-G-E-126
98 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
some of them of superior intelligence, who went all the way 
through the grades with a question mark after their IQ’s be- 
cause we were never able to ascertain absolutely their date 
of birth. It is this kind of practical detail which must re- 
ceive a due amount of close attention on the part of the psy- 
chologist in order not to undermine a piece of otherwise care- 
ful work. 
STABILITY OF THE IQ 
The question is also raised as to whether the classification 
of a grade on the basis of IQ has sufficient stability to war- 
rant its adoption in a school where every term brings a re- 
placement of the child. We already realize the enormous 
burden to teachers and pupils of examinations given twice a 
year. This is where the psychological test has an advantage ; 
it does not need to be repeated every term. The repetition of 
psychological tests at various intervals has shown that the IQ 
does not fluctuate sufficiently to demand frequent re-testing. 
Table XVI is modeled on a corresponding table in Terman’s 
The Intelligence of School Children. It represents the re- 
sults of a series of re-tests given to 289 children at intervals 
varying from one month to five years. The range of ages of 
the children varied from five to fifteen years. The range 
of IQ’s varied from 50 to 169. Although the groupings in 
regard to interval, age at first test, and IQ are not identical, 
owing to differences in our material, the plan of the table fol- 
lows closely enough that of Terman’s to facilitate comparison. 
In collecting the tests for correlation, we used both the 
long and the abbreviated scales indifferently; that is, 4 tests 
and 6 tests to a year. We felt that this was justified by the 
exceedingly high correlation (.973) between the two. 
Table XVI shows the results of 322 comparisons giving a 
correlation of .98 between first and second tests, with a prob- 
able error of .0038. 
 
-P-A-G-E-127

| ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL 99 
The tests were given by twelve examiners,' and less than 
one-fourth of the resulting comparisons were based on pairs 
of tests which had been given both times by the same examiner. 
Some of the children were tested more than twice, and in such 
cases the second and third tests were each compared with 
the first test and then with each other, making in all 322 com- 
parisons for 289 children. These tests were all given during 
school hours. | 
Table XVII gives in parallel columns the results of Terman’s 
435 comparisons and our 322 comparisons. Since the number 
of cases is not the same, they have both been converted into 
percentages. It will be seen from this table that 6 per cent 
of Terman’s re-tests resulted in no variation of IQ; 37.2 per 
cent gave a variation within three points above or below; 
59.6 per cent a variation of six points above or below; and 
81.8 per cent, within nine points above or below. On the 
basis of the 322 comparisons in our school, the variations 
were as follows: 9.6 per cent gave the same IQ; 48.9 per cent 
varied within three points above or below; 76.5 per cent, 
within six points above or below; and 90.1 per cent, within 
nine points above or below. ’ 
The limited extent of these variations has great signifi- 
cance for our plan of classification. The child who raises his 
score ten points up or down on a second test neither disar- 
ranges the scheme of classification nor materially alters his 
place in the scheme. The groupings themselves are made on 
the basis of ten-point differences and no hair-line divisions 
are drawn. The separation between any one group and the 
1 Elisabeth Irwin, Zena C O’Connor, and Hazel A. Scofield, of the Psycho- 
logical Staff, Public School 64, gave 73 per cent of the tests; Mary Cover, 
Mary Levin, Ellen Mathews, Helen M. Seidman, Dorothy Van Alstyne, students 
in the Department of Psychology, Columbia University, gave 17 per cent of the 
tests; L. Dorothea Albrecht, Martha Barney, Estelle Kenzel, and Julia Mo- 
lander, teachers in Public School 64 who had had training in psychological 
testing, gave 10 per cent of the tests.

  102 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
next group above or below is not so great that the replace- 
ment of a child is impractical. If he works well at the head 
of his own group, he would of course work almost equally 
well among the slower individuals of the group above. What 
we have never found necessary, however, on the basis of a re- 
test, was the advancement of a child two groups ahead or the 
reverse. The popular idea that a child may suddenly, under 
propitious influences, change his pace in school to this extent 
is not borne out by our experience. 
VERTICAL CLASSES 
The intention of our plan was to allow each child to proceed 
at his own rate along one of a series of vertical tow-paths which 
provided for all speeds from hare to tortoise. We assumed, 
.on the basis of the results of the psychological tests, that this 
speed was something stable within the child’s own personality, 
and did not depend to any very great extent on whether he had 
a headache or a cold or was a truant ora “Smart Aleck.” Now 
and then a teacher will tell you that this child or that does 
not deserve to be promoted because he is a truant. If you 
suggest that he will become a worse truant if “left back,’’ she 
will propose the truant school. As the psychological test is 
used more and more in the school, it becomes the child’s best 
defense against being ‘‘left back” or even demoted for ex- 
traneous reasons. The treatment of truancy by this crude 
and irrelevant punishment becomes less possible when the 
child has a psychological test to back up his claim to an 
established place in the group. 
In our school, the practice was to make amendments grad- 
ually as new light was shed on the children’s ability. So long 
as a teacher has three or four very backward children, a 
slightly maladjusted child is not noticed. When, however, 
the cruder differences are removed by homogeneous group-

  104 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
ing, the individual differences in other respects begin to ap- 
pear and teachers report children for such things as ‘looking 
unhappy,” “seeming to be sleepy,” “bright, but little self- 
control.” These minor idiosyncrasies, which, if not followed 
up, may become grave, now come to the visiting teacher while 
they are still incipient tendencies. No child is kept back 
because of his psychological rating, if his work proves him 
able to keep up with a higher group. The test is merely a 
tentative guide by which to find certain actual differences 
early. In fact, it proved distinctly easier to shift children 
from one place to another for a try-out under the new classi- 
fication, than it had been under the former grading method. 
The simple explanation was that all of us knew all the children 
better than we had known them before. 
It will be seen from Table XVII, that the 322 re-tests made in 
our school yielded a slightly lesser degree of variation than the 
435 comparisons made by Terman. The correlation found 
between re-tests in Public School 64 was .98; the correlation 
found by Terman was .933. The only reason we can suggest 
for the slightly higher degree of correspondence may be found 
in the specific absence of neurotic children from our group. 
There was no process of selection in our comparisons other 
than the fact that the thirty children in two neurotic classes 
were not included. As will be seen in a later chapter, the IQ 
of this type of child is less constant than that of other children. 
There is no reason to suppose that such cases had been simi- 
larly removed from Terman’s group of tests. 
ORGANIZATION OF UPPER GRADES 
With the seventh year of the school, the organization is 
divided into the academic and the pre-vocational depart- 
ments. During the last term of the sixth year, the boys are 
1 See Table XXII in Chapter IX, page 190.  
-P-A-G-E-133
  
  ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOL 105 
given information and circulars to take home to their parents 
in order that they may choose intelligently between the 
courses. The work in the academic department needs no 
explanation; it corresponds to regular seventh and eighth 
grade work in all public schools preparing for high school. 
The pre-vocational department also prepares for the regu- 
lar high schools of the city. This is the first fact to be made 
clear to the children choosing between the courses. By 
having a slightly longer school day than the academic depart- 
ment, they are enabled to spend five two-hour periods a week 
in one of the shops and one hour in the trade-drawing shop in 
addition to the regular academic periods. For the first three 
terms, the boy must choose a different shop for each term; 
but in the fourth term he may return to the shop he likes best 
for a second and more advanced course. The nine shops 
among which the pupil may choose are as follows: Joinery, 
Printing, Mechanical Drawing, Plumbing, Garment Design- 
ing, Sheet Metal Work, Machine Shop, Electric Wiring, Sign 
Painting. 
It has been our policy from the first to prevent the pre- 
vocational department from becoming a dumping-ground for 
boys who did not do well in academic work. There has been 
a tendency in many places to recruit such a department from 
those who fail in the scholastic courses. While there is no 
doubt that boys of the dull normal type profit from working 
with concrete material, it is not the function of the pre-voca- 
tional department as such to supply this need. It is rather 
intended to broaden the educational experience of the boy and 
to introduce him to types of occupations for which he might 
wish later to prepare in a trade or technical school. 
Figure 18 shows that the distribution of intelligence among 
185 boys in the academic department and 112 boys in the pre- 
vocational department is not fundamentally different. This

did not happen accidentally in a Jewish neighborhood, where 
manual labor is not highly esteemed, and a professional or 
semi-professional career is exalted above all others. In the 
beginning it was difficult to keep the intelligent boys from 
looking down on the shop courses as inferior, and to keep the 
teachers from persuading all the dull boys into the shops and

make things with their hands asserted itself with the boys 
against the influence of a social pride which was after all but 
superficial. The ability to make a bell ring or a light appear, 
to construct a basket-ball suit, to erect a table upon four legs, 
to set up and print one’s name on a card — is after all more 
deeply thrilling to boy nature than the analysis of complex

experience, it is no less essential for the bright child than for 
the dull one. 
Figure 19 shows the relation of three curves representing 
the distribution of intelligence in the normal surface, the 
distribution among 1225 upper grade boys in Public School 
64 according to the National Intelligence Test (page 47), 
and the organization of the school according to types of 
regular and special classes. 
The curve showing the organization of the school is derived 
from the class-list and register givenon pagesgo-92. All classes 
below the fifth grade were excluded, since but a few of these 
remained by September, 1921, the last term of the experi- 
ment, owing to their removal within the previous year to 
other schools. The typical organization was found above the 
fourth grade only. The health classes were also excluded, as 
they were segregated on a different basis. This left on the 
register of the regular organization above the fourth grade, 
2036 children. Of these, 4.6 per cent were in ungraded classes ; 
8.9 per cent were in opportunity classes; 56.7 per cent were 
in regular classes; 26.5 per cent were in rapid advancement 
classes, and the so-called ‘‘2” Classes (5B2, 6B2, etc.); and 
3-3 per cent were in the Terman classes for very superior 
children. These percentages are compared with the findings 
of the National Intelligence Test given to 1225 boys in the 
same part of the school. The findings of the test as shown in 
Figure 8 (page 46) were as follows: 11.9 per cent, very 
dull; 18 per cent, dull; 55.8 per cent, average, including those 
just above and below; 9.3 per cent, superior; 5 per cent, 
very superior. 
The comparison of the foregoing percentages, as presented 
in Figure 19, is a graphic representation of the relation of 
our school organization to our pupil material. It is evident 
from the figure that the bright children were more than amply

recognized and provided for in the organization. The rather 
generous provision on the right-hand side of the curve for the 
brighter pupils is partly a sign of the optimism bred by our 
special interest in gifted children. It may also be noted that 
classes for these children required no difficult adaptation on 
the part of the academic system; any exceptions to be made 
were in the direction of economy rather than expense, since 
they expedited the passage of the child through school. This 
applies to the so-called ‘‘2” classes, which were not special 
classes as were the Terman, opportunity, and ungraded classes. 
The slump on the left side of the curve of organization 
shows the inadequacy of our provision for the dull normal 
group of children. This was not because these pupils and 
their needs were not recognized, for the classes designated as 
“1” classes and ‘‘5”’ classes were definitely composed of dull 
over-age boys. But the registers were as large as those of 
other classes and the requirements of the course of study were 
identical with those for the average child. These groups 
meant no economy for the school or special benefit for the boy. 
In the opportunity class there were fewer hold-overs and less 
truancy because a more interesting course of study, including © 
shops, swimming, and a general recognition of the interests of 
the boys, was arranged as a concession to their needs. Yet, 
in spite of our deficiency in this line, probably we had more 
opportunity classes than the average publicschool. They 
were constantly on the increase in our school, as they demon- 
strated their effectiveness, and once established they were 
not abandoned. 
Many people have a great repugnance to classifying chil- 
dren in types. They feel that once a child is referred to as of 
this type or that, he loses his flesh-and-blood qualities and 
tends to become merely a “‘case.”” Yet blue eyes are none the 
less beautiful and romantic because of our knowledge of the

Mendelian law; nor does the tiger lily seem stereotyped be- 
cause we know under what genus and species it may be cata- 
logued. The classification of children into types is anessential 
part of the scientific approach to education. The method of 
science is thus described by Bernard Hart: “It consists in: 
(t) The observation and recording of the phenomena; (2) The 
classification of the recorded phenomena into groups or series ; 
(3) The discovery of a formula which will enable us to resume 
these series in the most comprehensive and convenient manner. 
The formula may be altogether conceptual in character. The 
only test which it is required to satisfy is the test of utility, 
it must explain the facts which we actually find and it must 
enable us to predict the occurrence of future facts.” ! If this 
is the method of science which is applied to other departments 
of life, it must also be the one which education must adopt 
instead of the blind trial-and-error method with which we have 
so long been too contented. 
To this extent, the popular “hunch” is right: no two in- 
dividuals are alike; a child may be one type intellectually, 
another type emotionally, another physically, and so on 
throughout the series, discovered and undiscovered. The 
crossing of types and the interplay of tendencies make for 
infinite variety of personality. .The more one knows about 
the types of human beings, the more one knows about a child. 
The more one knows about children, thé more one realizes 
that the number of types in regard to any one trait is finite. 
While placing an individual child in a type does not solve 
his problem, it is one of the greatest aids in thinking about 
him clearly. It helps the teacher to call upon those resources 
which have a particular reference to him. If she realizes that 
he is of the same type as another child on whom she has spent

much time and trouble in the past, she goes to work more con- 
structively. If her earlier experiment was not successful, she 
is less likely to repeat it automatically in dealing with another 
boy whom she knows to be of the same type. She will rather 
undertake some new plan and in a more hopeful spirit. All 
this means new possibilities of initiative for the teacher as 
well as a better outlook for the pupil. It is for lack of such a 
positive and constructive attitude toward the human material 
in their hands that. many teachers fail to find a personal 
stimulus in their profession. A better understanding of the 
mental problems involved would do much to relieve teaching 
of its drudgery and revivify the atmosphere of the classroom.

CHAPTER VI 
THE Course or Stupy 
Before we go further in our description of different types 
of children and the reason why they are misfits in the school, 
we want to make clear that we hold no brief for the curriculum 
as it is, even for the normal child. The following chapters 
will deal with the adaptations that a flexible curriculum should 
make in response to the needs of children who deviate from the 
average in one direction or another. The present chapter 
is concerned almost entirely with the curriculum in relation 
to the middle 75 per cent of the curve of distribution, whose 
individual differences lie within the normal range of variation. 
Let us assume, for present purposes, a group of pupils who are 
not mentally defective, exceptionally bright, dull, neurotic, or 
physically handicapped. Against these average children, we wish 
to measure the public school curriculum, which was supposedly 
made to serve the needs of this so-called normal group. 
We cannot criticize the present method of administering 
the course of study in standardized doses without taking into 
consideration the force of the demand made upon public 
schools for uniformity. About one-seventh of the elementary 
school population of New York City changes from one school 
to another in the course of each school year. This means 
that nearly 100,000 pupils move from a grade in one school 
to the same grade in another school overnight, and are ex- 
pected to find a niche in the new classroom similar enough 
to the one they have left not to feel the jolt. We are not 
able to discover how many children who are transferred from 
school to school during the year actually lose their promotions. 
I12
-P-A-G-E-141
  THE COURSE OF STUDY 113 
It is our impression, however, that this number is not small. 
The child who enters the class during the term runs a special 
risk of being left back. The teacher who gives as excuse for 
a child’s non-promotion that he has come so recently from 
another school that he has not yet caught up with the class, 
is listened to without question. No supervisory staff is deaf 
to the flattery of the implication that the standards of other 
schools are not so high as those of its own. 
If the assumption is true that many of the transferred 
children risk their promotions anyway, why make such a 
fetish of uniformity to prevent something which it can scarcely 
be said to prevent? Any proposition to experiment with 
the curriculum never fails to encounter this objection. Must 
we then everlastingly sacrifice the 85 per cent of the children 
who stay put for the hypothetical benefit of the 15 per cent 
who move? Probably the inflexibility of the goose-step 
curriculum is itself the source of the maladjustment of the 
newcomer, who is totally lost if he is one beat out of step. 
His chances to right himself would be better under a more 
elastic interpretation of the requirements. Possibly the 
substitution of pedagogical tests, with age rather than grade 
norms, will be one means of lessening the hardships of the 
minority of children who change schools during the year. 
Since we are speaking of normal children, the whole question 
seems more or less academic anyway. The school could well 
afford to put more trust in the normality of the normal child, 
who is well able, with a little leeway, to get off and get on 
again educationally in the same way that a healthy infant 
can fall down and get up again. 
Another bogey that confronts the advocates of a more flex- 
ible course of study is the universal goal of getting every child 
ready for high school at a stated time. At present all children 
enter school at the age of six with the general expectation 
   
-P-A-G-E-142
II4 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
that they will enter high school at the age of fourteen. With 
this end in view every effort is blindly bent toward its accom- 
plishment, and little consideration is given to what is happen- 
ing to the child along the way. If the attainment of this goal 
were possible for too per cent of the school population, it 
would still be doubtful whether the destruction it entails 
would be justifiable. As a matter of fact, however, the school 
statisticians furnish figures to show that only 13 per cent of 
the six-year-old aspirants enter high school at fourteen; 
and less than 20 per cent enter high school at any age. Here 
again we are submitting 80 per cent of the elementary school 
children to a rigid lock-step procedure on a theory which ab- 
solutely flies in the face of the facts. 
It would seem as if the very tenacity with which the goal 
is pursued helps to defeat its attainment. Perhaps, if we were 
more interested from the beginning in making the school fit 
the child and permitting him to enjoy life within its walls, 
there would be more children desirous of continuing their 
education beyond the elementary grades. If it were true 
that the 20 per cent who now go to high school coincided with 
the number of individuals along the curve of distribution 
who were endowed with the type of intelligence which could 
successfully meet the present standardized requirements for 
high school entrance, the case would be no better. Does 
it not seem odd that the people of limited intelligence should 
be discouraged from prolonging their period of training by 
such a narrow view of education? Would it not be more 
logical to extend, especially for those who adjust to life with 
difficulty, the protection which a higher school should ideally 
provide for the years of adolescence? The elementary school 
and the secondary school are at present codperating all too 
well in terminating the education of 80 per cent of the school 
children at the earliest legal moment. With a different con- 
 
-P-A-G-E-143
  
THE COURSE OF STUDY IIs 
ception of what education is about, it would be possible to 
establish the same degree of codperation in the direction of 
permitting every child to pursue his education profitably and 
happily from his sixth to his eighteenth year. 
If this attitude of anxiety concerning the goal and the way- 
stations were replaced by a faith in the principle of growth, 
much-needed experimentation with the curriculum would 
then be encouraged. We all know the folly of pulling up a 
bean to see how it is growing, but we have not yet learned to 
trust the human plant to flower without a periodic panic 
about its rate of progress. Under our present educational 
system, every pupil is conscientiously yanked up by the roots 
at least twice a year. With this official inspection always 
impending, neither teacher nor pupil breathes an atmosphere 
of freedom, which is the first condition of unself-conscious 
growth. It is too much to ask the school authorities and 
parents to grant complete exemption from this time-honored 
custom ; but enough uneasiness concerning the old methods ex- 
ists to justify the demand for longer periods between successive 
days of reckoning. Furthermore, psychological tests have pro- 
duced surprising results in showing that normal children of the 
same age arrive at very much the same place by widely varying 
educational paths. There isreassurance in this for those of little 
faith who fear that any departure from the conventional cur- 
riculum will turn their normal children into freaks and oddities. 
AN EXPERIMENT WITH A NORMAL GROUP 
The only experiment * with the curriculum for normal chil- 
dren in our school was undertaken with the understanding 
1 This experiment was carried on under the direction of Mrs. Marietta 
Johnson of the School of Organic Education, Fairhope, Alabama. Mrs. 
Johnson raised a fund sufficient to provide an extra teacher for three terms and 
to equip a room with furniture and supplies. She also gave the experiment her 
personal attention for one year by weekly visits, and trained the teachers for 
this class in her summer school.
-P-A-G-E-144
  116 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
that no rigid academic standards were to be enforced until 
the fourth year. A group of thirty-five boys was selected 
with IQ’s from 1oo to 115. The classroom was equipped 
with movable furniture, benches, tools, and a piano. A 
specially trained teacher was provided in addition to the 
regular one until it was possible for one of the regular staff 
to train herself to take full charge. The group has remained 
practically unchanged throughout the experiment. The 
class was assembled at the beginning of the 1B grade, that is, 
after they had been in school one term; and it has now 
reached the beginning of the fifth year. 
The story of what was done with this class had best begin 
with what was not done. We did not enforce the taboos, 
restraints, and prohibitions of the ordinary classroom. The 
interests of the children were largely allowed to initiate and 
guide the activities within and without the school. One 
group of ten underweight children undertook the study of 
nutrition, which entailed buying, cooking, and eating their 
own lunches in the kitchen of Christodora House. Another 
group became interested in the study of transportation in 
the streets and from the docks near by. A third group was 
chiefly interested in drawing and color work and clay model- 
ing. The whole class was enthusiastic about the dancing, 
singing, story-telling, and excursions into all parts of the 
city. They became interested, one year especially, in study- 
ing the lives and habits of animals, both in the animal room 
of the school and in the zoo. One of their favorite activities 
from the first was in dramatics and impersonations. They 
loved to improvise plays and costumes, and fell into it as 
readily as many children play tag. They learned to know and 
use each other’s talents, and codperated in many enterprises 
that kept them together outside of school hours. 
The group spirit was strong and the many learned from the

few. One of the boys had a strong interest in drawing. When 
the class went to Wanamaker’s store to see the Christmas 
toys, he strayed by accident into the art gallery. The next 
day he was truant, and on the next he was discovered with 
paper and colors copying the ‘‘Holy Family.’’ Instead of 
being rebuked, he was allowed to take part of the class with 
him, each to copy a favorite picture. From this experience, 
they got the idea of painting the fish in the aquarium and 
the animals in the park. They sketched boats from the dock, 
trees from the window, and made portraits of each other. 
Thus they grew away from the neighborhood conception of 
art as literal copying and photographic imitation. 
Although the formal work had always been given a sec- 
ondary place and had been allowed throughout to function 
as means to an end, at the end of the fourth year it was found 
that the class had suffered no academic loss. On the con- 
trary, a series of pedagogical tests showed them to rank above 
their grade as a group and, what was more surprising, there 
were no individual laggards. At the beginning of the fifth 
grade when the experiment was regarded as ended, they fitted 
into the formal organization of the school without any aca- 
demic dislocation. Incidentally, they had done seven terms’ 
work in six. The testimony of the teachers was that they 
were more stable, and socially better adjusted than the aver- 
age fifth grade child. They had read more widely, spoke 
more fluently and correctly, and asked more intelligent ques- 
tions. They were outspoken, inquisitive, and fluent letter 
writers. Their superiority was visible to the naked eye and 
visitors always mistook them for a Terman group. 
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRICULUM 
In watching the progress of this experiment from week to 
week, we have come to see more clearly what is wrong with
-P-A-G-E-146
ee er ee ne te eee 
118 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
the regular curriculum from the point of view of the normal 
child. In the first place, it is too much concerned with giving 
information and too little concerned with affording oppor- 
tunity for experience. In the second place, it deals too little 
with the realities of child life and too much with abstractions 
and symbols. In the third place, it disregards the capacities 
of the child by forcing subjects down his throat before he is 
mature enough to digest them. In short, the stereotyped 
course of study has been built up to follow a logical sequence 
from the point of view of the adult mind rather than to follow 
the development of spontaneous interests in the child. 
Education should not consist of acquiring information but 
of acquiring experience. A youngster may grow up in an 
environment rich with educational possibilities and yet be 
entirely shut off by the attitude of the people around him. 
Just as the child in the home of an ignorant farmer may grow up 
without any acquaintance whatever with the plant and animal 
life about him, so the city child is apt to know nothing of the 
industrial processes and the other occupational features of 
his own environment. As soon as the child enters the school, 
it begins to separate him from reality. Many a six-year-old 
does not know the names of the garments he wears and the 
food he eats. Yet he is crammed with columns of spelling 
words and rows of figures without regard to whether this 
mental food is analogous to milk or pickles. The modern 
science of nutrition has far outrun the science of education. 
It emphasizes not only the quantity of food but its quality 
and kind. 
Furthermore, the unscientific pabulum of the school is ad- 
ministered on an unscientific schedule. Why do we have 
‘to hurry things along so fast? If adding is hard at seven 
years, why not leave it till nine? If reading is hard at six, 
why not teach it at eight or nine? There is enough educa-

tional experience that is wholesome for six- or seven-year-old 
children, without overdrawing their account with life in ad- 
vance. It is like paying a high price for strawberries in 
February when you can have them abundantly in June at 
moderate cost. This hot-house forcing is characteristic not 
only of one subject in the curriculum but practically of all 
of them. 
SHALL READING BE LEARNED AT SIX 
It is almost impossible for a normal child not to learn to 
read before he is ten if he is exposed to books by those who 
value them. On the other hand, it is often torture for an 
imaginative child of six or seven years of age to sit through 
period after period of “was” and “he” and “go” and other 
abstract symbols. The irksome drill of the reading class is 
not really for the good of the child, but serves chiefly to allay 
the fears of parents who are in a panic lest their children may 
turn out at ten to be illiterate. They seem to need reassur- 
ance all along the line by a series of universal signals that 
their children are as well equipped as other children are. 
If Willie can read as well as Johnnie, then Willie’s mother 
can look Johnnie’s mother in the face without shame; and 
it is the exceptional father who does not love to take his nine- 
year-old daughter’s letter from his pocket and exhibit it to 
his business friends. 
For such reasons, the child is subjected for several hours 
every week to stories of Johnnie Jack Rabbit in words of one 
syllable and endless repetitions concerning the adventures 
and misadventures of Gruby-Gruntum and Toby-Trottum, 
until, if he has any mind at all, he learns to close it when the 
reading book is opened. Is not literature a broader founda- 
tion for culture than this parrot-like drill, made necessary 
by trying to teach the child to read two or three years before 
it is easy for him?
-P-A-G-E-148
120 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
Almost no child is too young to begin the study of litera- 
ture. Mother Goose rhymes, folk tales, stories of everyday 
life begin to interest a child during his second year, and from 
then on he will take all that he can get. Because he is not 
taught reading at an early age is no reason to skimp his fund 
of imaginative material. In a public school no reliance can 
be placed on what the child gets at home; the classroom must 
undertake to provide content and culture for him. The 
young child’s mind is avid and curious and responds to the 
appeal of literature before it develops to a point where the 
technique of reading is readily acquired. The more affection 
a child has for the ideas that come out of a book, the less 
resistance he will have to acquiring the symbols which rep- 
resent them. 
The relation of the middle and upper grade pupil to the 
printed page exhibits the failure of the formal reading lesson 
as an educational method. Although he has presumably 
mastered the technique of reading by this time, he is helpless 
in the face of a printed paragraph. If he is put to a test based 
on his comprehension of something he has read, he is likely 
to grow paralyzed or panicky at once. Place in the hands of 
any sixth grade boy or girl a can of soup on which are printed 
the instructions for serving, and observe how far he can carry 
them out without appealing to some adult with questions 
which are answered in the print on the can. The same child 
will read you off the sentences aloud with absolute correctness 
and complete self-satisfaction. His self-confidence begins 
to fail him just at the point where he is asked to evince his 
comprehension of what he has read by putting it into practice. 
The conventional reading course often leads children into a 
kind of glibness which actually prevents them from gaining 
any real rapport with the printed page. For this reason good 
oral readers sometimes fail in a silent reading test.
-P-A-G-E-149
  THE COURSE OF STUDY 12t 
DRAMATICS IN THE SCHOOL 
If young children are genuinely thrilled by word-pictures 
and stories, their first impulse is to act them out. A large 
part of a little child’s imagination is in his muscles and senses: 
his concept of a toad is a hop; his concept of a dog is a wag; 
his concept of a pig is a grunt. As he grows older he elabo- 
rates these simple imitations into more complex acting. One 
of the advantages of story-telling in the classroom instead of 
at home is that the children form a group which can coédperate 
in playing out all the characters of the story. Impromptu 
dramatizations of stories read and original plays, all done 
spontaneously and not rehearsed, are educational experiences. 
If the idea of adult audiences is entirely eliminated, then 
originality and spontaneity, the enemies of self-consciousness, 
take the place of repetitions and rehearsals. The emphasis 
here as in anything the child does should be placed on what 
happens to him in the act of creating, not the quality of the 
finished product from the grown-up point of view. The 
worst enemy of true education is the fetish of perfection. 
TEACHING THE SCHOOL CHILD TO TALK 
In its feverish haste to teach the child to read, the school 
forgets entirely to teach the child to talk. The taboo on 
talking in the classroom is carried to such an extent that even 
when the children are turned loose on the playground, they 
communicate with each other almost entirely by nudges, 
shouts, and monosyllables. With the single exception of 
the kindergarten, no provision is made in the public school 
curriculum for children to introduce topics of interest to them- 
selves and discuss them with their classmates. Is it not 
within the province of the school to teach children to con- 
verse with each other intelligently instead of placing a pre- 
mium on furtive whispering, which is at present their only
-P-A-G-E-150
122 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
outlet for a normal desire to be sociable? If young children 
were given the opportunity to develop fluency on topics which 
are stimulating and thrilling to them, then perhaps the “Oral 
English” periods of the older children would not be so lacking 
in ordinary coherent and vivid presentations. The pitiful 
struggle of a seventh grade teacher to make a boy use a sub- 
ject and a predicate in the same sentence is but the natural 
consequence of the monosyllabic and savage communication 
not only tolerated but encouraged by the methods of the 
lower grades. 
Little children are not supposed to have anything to say. 
They are therefore expected to sit still and have information 
poured into them until about the age of twelve. At this 
point, the process is reversed and the school suddenly begins 
to demand of them that they shall show evidence of the ac- 
cumulated erudition they have passively received. Unfor- 
tunately, the human mind does not work in this way, and 
the result is usually a disappointment to those who have 
devised the scheme. Perhaps if the children were allowed to 
discuss the things they were interested in and to assimilate 
to these the subjects naturally related, they would inevitably 
store up a fund of information about life that would make 
them able to respond, at least more intelligently than they do 
now, to almost any question a seventh grade teacher could ask. 
LEARNING TO WRITE BY ORDEAL 
Nothing so violates the knowledge we have concerning the 
physiological development of the child as the early insistence 
on learning to write. The child struggles and strives and 
spends enormous energy in trying to make good handwriting 
at an age when he ought not to be writing at all. The school 
considers that the push-pull refrain that enlivens the writing 
period in most classrooms is a great concession to the use of
-P-A-G-E-151
    
THE COURSE OF STUDY 123 
the large muscles. Even if the method does away with the 
use of the small finger movements, which is doubtful, it de- 
mands a close codrdination between hand and eye which 
ought not to be exacted. Probably no child under eight 
should be expected to form letters less than three or four 
inches high, and even then no high standard of perfection 
should be imposed. The amount of nervous strain which a 
child endures in trying to learn to write before he is ready is 
more than a growing organism should be subjected to. It is 
one of the most egregious of all our inherited educational errors. 
THE VENERABLE ABSTRACTIONS OF ARITHMETIC 
Dare we question the most sacred of all the three R’s, arith- 
metic? Entrenched behind centuries of tradition the teach- 
ing of arithmetic has grown into a pedagogical bad habit 
almost impossible to break. Why do we have to teach 
children to count to 20 in rA and to roo in 1B? Largely for 
the same reason that a master teaches his dog to sit up and beg 
— because he has heard it can be done and wants to try it and 
see. Would it not be worth while to see if there is not some- 
thing of equal or greater value from the child’s point of view 
than the trick of counting roo or writing it on a blackboard? 
If a child of six is interested in 100 at all, which is doubtful, 
would he not be more interested in seeing 100 buttons on a 
table, or in looking down on 100 houses from the roof, or in 
seeing 100 children when three classes are assembled? He 
would eventually become interested in stepping 100 steps, 
bouncing his ball roo times, and so on indefinitely with his 
hundreds and fifties and twenty-fives and fives until numbers 
really had some meaning. Perhaps as he approached eight 
years or so, it does not matter exactly when, he might be glad 
to write the symbol 100, to score a game or to satisfy some 
other end of his own.  
-P-A-G-E-152
  124 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
With no real concept of the “feel” or use of numbers, the 
only motive that can enliven a class in arithmetic is the rather 
hollow and too self-conscious rivalry that is artificially stimu- 
lated by the teacher. Concrete materials should be pro-

behind ‘the idea that science and mechanical

of a seven-year-old child. He need not comprehend the 
whole complicated idea behind these things, but from ob- 
serving how they work he can get a primitive conception of

cause and effect. The child understands a see-saw. A 
simple latch works like a see-saw; you push down one side 
and the other goes up. A more complicated lever but work- 
ing just the same way is mysteriously concealed between the 
door knobs of any classroom. But who ever thinks of telling 
these things to young children? Simple mechanical and 
scientific facts are really better tools for the child to reason 
with than the multiplication table. Science deals with con- 
crete things appropriate to young children; it gives informa- 
tion of a type that interests them. Yet the subject is usually 
reserved until adolescence has awakened a desire for more 
idealistic and romantic interests. 
THE BOOKISHNESS OF GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY 
The teaching of geography and history is blighted by a 
bookishness that often shuts the child out from the world 
he lives in, instead of opening it up to him. He learns the 
points of the compass from a conventional map before he 
learns them from the movements of the sun, and perhaps 
the north always remains strange to him because his desk 
was screwed to the floor in such a way that the lines of longi- 
tude ran east and west. He is crowded by symbols even 
when the facts of nature are within his reach. Still less 
does the school attempt to make up for the facts of nature 
beyond his reach. The city child knows nothing of the rail- 
road, the movements of the tides, the formation of hill land 
and swamp land. The curriculum should provide excursions 
to the country as well as to other parts of the city. Every 
school should own a bus large enough to carry a whole class. 
The children could then be taken into the country for nature 
study, for gardening, for out-of-door cooking. These ex- 
cursions are now sometimes made once or twice a year as re- 
wards for good behavior, the teacher bearing the expense.

material or the adult point of view leads the child to dislike 
the subject all the rest of his life. From simple dislike it is a 
short step to the feeling that one has no aptitude. We are 
constantly meeting adults who say that they have no appre- 
ciation for music or that they always hated mathematics. 
Such attitudes are often traceable to wrong methods of teach- 
ing and to associations formed in childhood and now grown 
to such proportion that they form a real adult disability. 
The child should learn in school the art of sociability. 
The faults of an educational system based on the three R’s are 
so manifest that intelligent parents sometimes raise the ques- 
tion, why send the child to school anyway? Cannot the 
well-educated parent, though an amateur, do better by his 
child than the professional teacher? But the school is not 
merely a place where lessons are learned and recited; it is 
preéminently the place where the young individual learns 
to make social adjustments to other individuals of his own 
generation. Since the family has grown smaller, the social 
contacts of the schoolroom have become more important 
than ever. The school provides this opportunity and is in 
this respect unique. There is no substitute. It is possible 
to educate a child ideally from the intellectual point of view, 
and yet to educate him in such a way that he is wholly set 
apart from his fellows. The parents of gifted children es- 
pecially have this danger to consider. While genius has 
existed in isolation and has made historic contributions to 
civilization, there are few parents who would deliberately 
choose to educate a child for solitude. A person’s adjustment 
to other people depends to a large extent on sharing with them 
a common mental background. Even the public school 
curriculum, with all its faults, has at least this social value. 
It supplements the more specific social value of the human 
contacts made in school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  128 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
THE CLASSROOM 
As the child needs other children around him, he also needs 
concrete materials to handle. The emptiness and colorless- 
ness of the typical classroom from the child’s point of view 
represents extreme poverty of experience. The ideal class- 
room will have plenty of wall space and small blackboards. 
A screen or a bulletin board for the class to use for posting 
is necessary. A property box, no matter how simply stocked, 
is essential. A glass case or cabinet for collections forms the 
foundation for the class museum. A piano and at least one 
work bench and a box of tools, regardless of the shop, should 
form a part of the regular schoolroom equipment. A closet 
for materials should contain paper, paste, clay, wood, etc. If 
possible each child should have a locker in which to store 
unfinished pieces of work. Rooms for younger children 
should have a rug for each child and one large rug, so that 
the children may sit on the floor for stories and reading. Fur- 
niture that can be moved and chairs to fit the tables and also 
to fit the children are desirable for the sake of free atmosphere 
as well as for physiological reasons. 
HOW LARGE SHOULD CLASSES BE 
Equipment of this kind presupposes classes of not more 
than 25 children. Good education, like everything else, can- 
not be cheaply obtained. Classes of 40 and 50 children can 
never be made really educational by means of any thinkable 
reform. Even homogeneity of intelligence does not justify 
these unwieldy groups, for, as we have said over and over, 
the child does not come to school merely to be efficiently 
instructed. Since the day of Jean Baptiste de la Salle, who 
founded the Order of the Christian Brothers and invented 
group teaching, the school has followed this ideal of instruc- 
tion and no other. The Herbartian movement of the nine-
-P-A-G-E-157
  uv THE COURSE OF STUDY 129 
teenth century tended to center all educational endeavor in 
the problem of standardized instruction and the adoption of 
stereotyped forms. 
Under the influence of these pedagogical traditions and the 
stress of congested city populations, the schools have, with 
but slight apology, permitted 4o and 50 children to be as- 
signed to one teacher. Public education has come to be a 
highly specialized technique for mass teaching. This is so 
true that most teachers, when placed in charge of groups of 
20 to 25 pupils, use the very same methods of teaching and 
class management that they used in teaching classes with 
registers of 45 and 50. This is probably the reason why 
Rice, in his investigations some twenty years ago, found 
that the results of instruction bore no relation to the size 
of the class taught. So far has this process now been car- 
ried, and so intrenched has it become by the methods in 
normal colleges and training schools, that teaching the in- 
dividual child has become one of the lost arts. What educa- 
tion needs most of all is the rediscovery of the individual 
child by the individual teacher. In the foregoing chapters 
we have described certain scientific aids to this discovery. 
But until we have smaller classes, no educational reform of 
any character will avail very much. Classes should be not 
more than half their present size and no system of classifica- 
tion will ever make a larger class unit into a really teachable 
group of children. 
THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE SCHOOL 
In regard to matters of discipline and conduct, the school 
has adopted formal standards similar to its scholastic re- 
quirements. This leads to mere negativism and repression, 
since the more positive virtues of human character are difficult 
to standardize. No martinet can help children to be really 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
130 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
“good,” for conduct which deserves this name is never the 
same as routinized behavior. To anyone who jis sensitive 
to such things, it is possible to detect almost immediately 
upon entering a building the temper of its leading spirit. We 
tried in our school to be rid of that oppressive something 
which strikes you with an almost palpable force when you 
open the door of a large, over-regimented school. Children 
should not burst forth at noon like the cork out of a bottle; 
some of the freedom of the playground should come in with 
them and some of the dignity of the schoolhouse should go 
out with them. 
THE EMOTIONAL EDUCATION OF THE CHILD 
The school should above all things be a place for children 
to get the habit of being happy. Has anyone ever yet read 
the record of a crime which was committed by a contented 
and happy person? We have been forced to the conclusion 
that many of the so-called problem cases of every school 
would be no longer problems if we realized the effect of our 
school curriculum upon the pupils. The children often de- 
velop antagonisms to teacher, subject, and school because 
they are bored. How many healthy, normal, grown-up 
people would patiently stand the daily grind of a so-called 
education which they did not understand or which did not 
give some play to their natural and instinctive desire for self- 
expression ? 
It is true that Rousseau stressed the value of natural in- 
stincts, that Pestalozzi attempted to put his theories into 
practice, that Herbart spoke of character as the desideratum 
of education, and that Froebel was dominated by the idea 
of free development; yet while we speak and think in terms 
of these great reformers, the schools in practice have never 
yet succeeded in catching up with the spirit of these leaders.
-P-A-G-E-159
  THE COURSE OF STUDY 131 
One of our high schools has taken for its motto, ‘‘more happi- 
ness in education.” It is not enough, however, that such 
well-intentioned slogans should be adopted by the school. 
They may prove as sterile of results as the inspired teachings 
of our educational geniuses. This is sure to be the case, 
as long as they remain, from the teacher’s point of view, in 
the domain of pure theory and sentiment. 
The school has this to gain from an alliance with mental 
hygiene: that happiness in education need not remain merely 
a pious hope but may be translated into a technique of living. 
The educator can no longer evade his responsibility for the 
emotional development of the child on the ground that a 
science and technique are lacking. Already the beginnings 
of such a science and technique are in existence and are widely 
applied in the cases of people with pathological tendencies. 
The improvement as well as the utilization of this technique 
rests largely with the schools where the emotional education 
of the normal child is more neglected than that of his erratic 
brother. The school has assumed that the emotional de- 
velopment of the normal child could be taken for granted, 
but that his intellectual development should be subjected 
to ceaseless prodding and surveillance. What education 
chiefly needs is that we shall take more for granted in regard 
to the child’s intellectual development, and take more thought 
about teaching him the art of happy and productive living.  
-P-A-G-E-160
  CHAPTER VII 
THE UNGRADED CLASSES 
The first and most popular use of psychological tests was 
in the scientific detection of feeble-mindedness. The implica- 
tions of this use are numerous and far-reaching. The imagina- 
tion of the biologist, the sociologist, the criminologist has 
seized upon it as a method of negative control; the biologist 
sees it as a means of eugenic selection; the criminologist, as 
a method of protecting society by segregation ; the sociologist, 
among other things as a new way of controlling immigration. 
In one fashion or another the intelligence test has been chiefly 
viewed as a scientific method of improving the race and society 
by the elimination of the unfit. ‘Let us have the finger- 
prints (of every person in the nation),’” writes a biologist, 
“but before everything else let us have a mental classification 
of all children of school age. When once this has: been done 
perhaps the least intelligent group can ultimately be denied the 
suffrage as are imbeciles, insane, and criminals at present.” ? 
These negative functions may be logical deductions from 
the social and evolutionary point of view, but for the educator 
they are not relevant. It is the factor of individual educa- 
bility that interests the teacher. For him the only legitimate 
point of view is to educate the child for himself, which is ulti- 
mately for society. The first consideration with every child 
is this: what kind of school experience is going to contribute 
most to his own personal and social fulfillment ?

  THE UNGRADED CLASSES 133 
People are too apt to form the habit of thinking of all men- 
tal defectives as imbeciles or idiots. Before the introduction 
of psychological tests, the diagnosis of defectives was largely 
dependent on physical stigmata, such as a misshapen head, 
lagging gait, drooling at the mouth, or a foolish grin. Only 
the lowest grades of feeble-mindedness can be thus distin- 
guished. Such children exist in limited numbers in every 
community and should receive the same consideration which 
is given to physical cripples. They should not be barred out 
of school but should be given a nurse’s care, if necessary, as it 
is given to cripples and cardiac cases. Unless their parents 
are able and willing to place them in institutions, the school 
should provide for them. When properly taken care of, they 
are not a menace to other children, and the public school offers 
their only opportunity for training and education. All chil- 
dren above the grade of idiot are to some degree educable ; 
“should they not therefore have the right to some kind of 
schooling? There is no law compelling parents to put these 
children in institutions. If parents do not voluntarily prefer 
custodial care for them, there is no place other than the school 
where they may receive the limited amount of training which 
they are able to profit by. 
THE UNGRADED CHILD 
In the ungraded department of our school there were scarcely 
half-a-dozen children who could be recognized as mentally 
deficient by their appearance. The few low-grade children 
who came to us were exchanged with other schools for high- 
grade problem cases. Our group of 150 ungraded children did 
not include any low-grade imbeciles; the IQ’s ranged from 
41 to 75, the mental ages from 4 to 11 years (see Tables XVIII 
and XIX), with the greater proportion in the upper ranges. 
These children represent a more important educational task 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  134 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
than the low-grade group, both because they form a larger 
group within the population, and because they must be fitted 
to take some part in the work of the world, while the low- 
grade children eventually find their way into institutions or 
come under some form of custodial care.

The ungraded department was originally started for the 
more obvious types of mental defectives. As the knowledge 
of types increased, the department was gradually extended to 
meet the needs of high-grade defectives also, The originator
-P-A-G-E-163
THE UNGRADED CLASSES 135 
of the ungraded department, Miss Elizabeth Farrell, dis- 
covered about twenty years ago that there were children in 
the school who could never meet its inflexible standards and 
rigid demands, and that the school itself must bend if these 
children were to be educated. The spirit in which the de- 
partment was conceived was that of trying to make it up to 
such deprived children for what had been omitted from their 
native endowment. The department was not created prima- 
tily as a method of segregation nor as a means of getting rid of 
an inferior group of individuals. It was planned from the 
beginning as a place where the mentally defective child could 
receive the kind of training that he needed. For his sake, the 
most unquestioned school conventions were set aside and an 
entirely new type of education was invented. This educa- 
tional aim has been consistently pursued. 
Throughout its history, the ungraded department has never 
lost sight of the fact that it existed for the child as a sufficiently 
important end in himself. The discovery of this type of 
child-mind, retarded and yet educable, and the invention of a 
special kind of education for its needs, is a notable chapter in 
the history of the science of education. It is one of the anom- 
alies of the public school system that the best education is 
given to the children who are intellectually the least endowed. 
This is one of the few departments of public education into 
which imagination has gone in the last hundred years. The 
truly creative pedagogy of this era has been concentrated on 
making a curriculum for children of limited intelligence. 
THE UNGRADED DEPARTMENT 
Freed from the pressure of the conventional public school 
demands, the ungraded department has been able to dupli- 
cate in many respects the conditions of the best and most 
enlightened private schools in the country. The classes are 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
136 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
small, between fifteen and twenty children forming the regis- 
ter. The ungraded rooms have no fixed furniture — the 
prison furniture of our public schools is one of the many evils 
of overcrowded classes. Once the registers are cut in half, 
as is already done in the ungraded department, it becomes 
practical to humanize the atmosphere of the schoolroom. 
Not a desk nor a table nor a seat is screwed to the floor through- 
out the ungraded department. Each child has individual 
treatment; he is not fubbed off with one-fortieth or one-fifti- 
eth of the teacher’s attention. 
Not only in size and equipment do these classes set a high 
standard, but everything has been done to make the ungraded 
teacher the best representative of her profession. With the 
adoption of a special curriculum, it was soon found that 
specially trained teachers were necessary. Not only prepara- 
tory training but continued training has been the require- 
ment for this work. Along with the courses in classroom — 
technique, the teachers are required to study psychology and 
social science as related to their special problems. An in- 
creased salary schedule has made it possible for the depart- 
ment to keep up these standards. All this has served to 
bring about a professional attitude toward their work which 
is characteristic of the entire corps of ungraded teachers. 
The children are assigned to the classes by the clinical staff 
of the department. Clinics are held at headquarters and also 
in different schools. The child is given a physical, psychologi- 
cal, pedagogical, and sociological examination before being 
placed in the special class. When the ungraded department 
was first originated, the available methods of examination and 
diagnosis were more or less crude and tentative, so that only 
the most indubitable types could be distinguished. But the 
department itself has done a great deal towards the develop- 
ment of clinical methods which increase the accuracy of diag-
-P-A-G-E-165
  
THE UNGRADED CLASSES 137 
nosis and make it possible to distinguish the higher types. 
The arrangement whereby a central responsible staff was put 
in charge of assignments to the ungraded classes has prevented 
them from becoming the dumping ground of all sorts of prob- 
lem cases and has preserved them for their original purpose. 
The most radical innovation of the department is found in 
the curriculum. The fundamental novelty is that it takes 
account of the child’s capacity and experience instead of merely 
carrying on the accumulated traditions of the intelligentsia 
of bygone ages. The department has the supervision of its 
own course of study, which has been developed by a process 
of actual experimentation. One of the characteristics of the 
subnormal child is that his sense-organs are under-developed 
as well as his intellectual grasp. Just as in the normal child 
an ear for music may be cultivated, so in the subnormal child 
the five senses are amenable to training. Periodic tests 
throughout the year have shown that the keenness of his 
senses increases under cultivation. Not that it isn’t equally 
true that any normal child would do better to learn to hear, 
taste, and smell, than to read at the age of six; only the schools 
have not yet discovered this. ‘ 
Another characteristic of the subnormal child is his help- 
lessness. By working with concrete materials and producing 
tangible evidence of control over his environment, he vindi- 
cates his existence. The child who takes home a yellow box 
of his own making is able for the first time to put himself 
across with his family. Incredible as it may seem, many of 
these children button their own coats and lace their own 
shoes for the first time in the classroom. A feeling of budding 
power over his environment in an individual is perhaps the 
most educational experience he can have. This comes to the 
normal child seldom enough but to the subnormal child 
scarcely at all unless it is especially developed in him. He
-P-A-G-E-166
    138 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
becomes accustomed early in life to being pushed aside from 
almost every undertaking by someone who can do it better, 
until his originally feeble stock of initiative is entirely sapped. 
It is an important job, but not always an easy one, to nurse it 
back to life. Without such fundamental experiences as 
these, there is no such thing as growth. 
It seems unfortunate that such an intelligent way of con- 
structing a course of study should benefit so small a group of 
children. There is no type of child who would not profit by 
some modification of this humanized curriculum. Parents 
of normal children might well covet for them the superior 
advantages of the ungraded course. It is at least a hopeful 
sign that such a department exists with official sanction. It 
is bound to have an influence far beyond its own boundaries 
for the better education of all children. 
HISTORY OF DEPARTMENT IN PUBLIC SCHOOL 64 
The ungraded department of Public School 641 started 
with two classes in 1913. They were made up of high-grade, 
middle-grade, and institutional cases. The pupils were 
selected in the regular way, the teachers reporting trouble- 
some boys or boys who could not keep up with the class work. 
The good boy who merely sat quiet often escaped the notice 
of the teacher and was not singled out for the ungraded class, 
while the boy who could not control himself in this way but 
had to do something to attract the attention of his fellows, was 
recommended. There was always a long waiting list because 
of the large school population and the limited equipment and 
room space. A new admission took place, not when a boy 
was found who should be in an ungraded class, but when an 
1 The development and organization of this department in Public School 64, 
described in the following pages, was very largely due to the work of Martha 
A. Barney, teacher of the first Ungraded Class in Public School 64, who has 
supplied for this chapter a detailed history of the department.
-P-A-G-E-167
THE UNGRADED CLASSES 139 
ungraded pupil became sixteen and left school or when one 
moved out of the district. 
The two original classes occupied one room, the instruction 
being given by a regular ungraded teacher, and a substitute 
teacher who acted as a helper. The thirty-two pupils ranged 
from institutional cases to children who were but three years 
backward, and ranged in chronological age from eight to six- 
teen years. The work resembled a three-ring circus, with 
“Fat” using the cloak closet as a street car, with his constant 
“Whoa,” “Fare,” and ‘“Ding-a-ling”’; with Pasquale dem- 
onstrating the method of procedure in taking an apple from a 
push cart; and with Stanislaus constantly cutting the other 
children’s hair when he could snatch a pair of scissors from a 
child who was doing paper cutting for busy work. The 
teacher, in the meantime, might be trying to teach an arith- 
metic or reading lesson in front of the room to the accompani- 
ment of the hammers and saws of boys who were finishing 
their shop work. 
The first thing done to alleviate these conditions was to 
separate the classes, the substitute teacher taking one group 
at a time to the yard for physical training, number games, etc. 
The classroom was used for scholastic and manual work. 
With the departure of Isaac, at least half an hour formerly 
devoted to his daily “fit” was saved for class instruction. 
The next step was to arrange with neighboring schools for 
the transfer of our mentally low-grade children to their schools, 
and the transfer of their mentally high-grade children to ours. 
Now the pupils made a better social group, and were better 
graded in their school work. 
With the formation of a third ungraded class, another 
room was set aside so that three classes now used two rooms. 
One room was fitted as a shop, so that the hammering and 
sawing no longer interrupted the reading and arithmetic. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  140 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
departmental schedule was put into effect with one group in 
the shop, another having school work, and the third in the 
yard for physical training and games. In this way it was 
possible to place a boy who had a special disability in reading, 
in a lower class for that subject and in a higher one for arith- 
metic. 
With the organization of more ungraded classes, the great 
problem was where to put them, as the school was already 
overcrowded, many classes being on part time. This diffi- 
culty was obviated by the adoption of a departmental sched- 
ule and through the codperation of the Boys’ Club near by. 
On pages 141-2 appear the program of school activities 
carried on under this five-class organization, and a supplemen- 
tary program for a single class organization. 
The objection sometimes made to the departmental scheme 
is that it is hard for the children to adjust to three or more 
teachers during the day; but this is offset by the fact that. 
each teacher, instead of being a “‘ Jack of all trades and master 
of none,” can perfect herself in her chosen subject by taking 
courses in allied branches. For example, while teaching the 
scholastic subjects, she can take college work in the teaching 
of reading, arithmetic, etc. The teacher of physical training 
can take work in games, corrective gymnastics, or folk danc- 
ing. The shop teacher can be taking work in caning, cobbling, 
basketry, and toy-making. This scheme makes each teacher 
more proficient in her own subject and more resourceful in 
understanding and building upon the interest of the children. 
* To be a good ungraded teacher is not the work of a day nor a 
year, for there are many different subjects to be taught, and 
each child is a special problem in himself. 
In a departmental schedule, where the teacher has the class 
but one and one-half hours during the day, both teacher and 
pupil feel that they must work at top speed to accomplish

there is a decided advantage, for one well-equipped shop is 
better than a bench or two in each room, together with a few

Friday afternoon for a general ‘“‘get together” meeting, at 
which each school stood ready with something for the program. 
This gave the teachers and pupils an opportunity to see the 
work of the other classes and promoted a desirable rivalry 
among them. The visits to the Club revealed the remarkable 
facilities such as the swimming pool, gymnasium, auditorium, 
and game rooms, which were used in the afternoon and eve- 
ning by the members of the Club. A plan of codperation was 
evolved by which the ungraded boys of Public School 64 were 
allowed to have their physical work in the Boys’ Club instead 
of in the school yard, which was overcrowded and unequipped. 
Two classes were accommodated at the Club in the morning 
and two in the afternoon. In time, about half the ungraded 
work came to be carried on in the Boys’ Club, the teachers and 
the boys spending about half the day there. The class had the 
use of the shower-baths daily, the swimming pool once a week, 
and access to one of the best equipped gymnasiums in the city, 
a library, and auditorium entertainments. 
An evening club was formed, which met every Saturday 
night. The qualification for entrance was membership in an 
ungraded class. These boys were well known to the workers 
at the Club, and every advantage was given them for after- 
noon and evening work, such as being monitor in the games 
and check room. This not only helped the boys toward be- 
coming self-supporting, but also kept them off the streets. 
Most of them were cared for at the Boys’ Club Camp for a 
part of the summer, and many remained for the entire season. 
The connection has been a continued resource for the ungraded 
boys after they have left school and gone to work at the age 
of sixteen. The Boys’ Club remains a refuge where a welcome 
awaits them, backed up by an intelligent appreciation of their 
peculiar problems.
-P-A-G-E-172
  144 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
ATTENDANCE INSTEAD OF TRUANCY 
In the original ungraded class, with its thirty-two boys in 
a room equipped for sixteen, there were some advantages in 
a poor attendance, for when many were absent, two boys did 
not have to occupy one chair and the problem did not seem 
quite so hopeless. On the other hand, the boys who stayed 
away were being encouraged in habits of truancy, in lack of 
respect for law, and in spending their time on the street. The 
result was a truancy problem of no small proportions. As 
the ungraded department handles its own truancy cases, it 
was necessary to develop an effective home-made technique. 
The method adopted was to appoint from the class assist- 
ant truant officers to help the teacher at noon-time to investi- 
gate the causes of absence in the morning; and to help in the 
afternoon or evening in the investigation of absences occurring 
in the afternoon session. This gave the boys a sense of respon- 
sibility toward the school, and at the same time encouraged 
their own attendance, for no one could be an assistant truant 
officer who was himself a truant. It was found that the former 
truants made the best officers, for they knew all the places 
where the truants “hung out.” The work was so diligently 
pursued that one class had 100 per cent attendance during 
an entire term. It was of course an exceptional record; but, 
with improved conditions, truancy has become on the whole 
one of the minor problems of the ungraded department. 
The history of Guiseppe Cifuni was not unlike that of many 
boys. He was eight years old and was on the roll of a regular 
class which he seldom attended. The truant officer always 
found the apartment where he lived closed, as both parents 
worked and Guiseppe roamed about the docks all day. Dur- 
ing one of his sporadic and enforced visits to the school under 
the chaperonage of the truant officer, he was given a psycho- 
logical test and recommended for the ungraded class. The
-P-A-G-E-173
  
THE UNGRADED CLASSES 145 
struggle began all over again. Coéperation from the home 
was out of the question; the boy himself had to be habituated 
to coming to school. Sometimes the visiting teacher brought 
him in, violently protesting. More often he was brought by 
another ungraded boy who lived near him. Finally he began 
to turn up of his own accord, at almost any hour of the day. 
Yet he settled down at last and had an almost perfect attend- 
ance record for two successive years. There is nothing im- 
personal or formal in the ungraded department’s way of 
handling absences. Once the boy is in the class he becomes 
interested, and this is where this department has resources 
which the regular grades lack. It is not obliged to try to win 
a boy without any regard for boy nature; it may and does try 
to arrange a program suitable to the mental capacity and 
actual interests of the pupils. 
A MODIFIED CURRICULUM 
To make the school more attractive than the streets is not 
extremely difficult, once the school can bend its pride to accept 
the task. One of the chief daily attractions of our ungraded 
department was an orchestra. The boys were allowed the 
use of the kindergarten room for music and rhythm. The 
problem of instruments was solved by making drum-sticks of 
dowel, eighteen inches long, pointed at one end, which were 
used upon drum-heads made by stretching cloth over a frame 
and shellacking it to make a smooth, stiff surface. Pieces of 
sandpaper tacked to blocks of wood, three inches by five 
inches, were rubbed together in time to the music. ‘‘Clap- 
pers” bought for five cents each took the place of ‘bones.’ 
Two tambourines, bells, zonophones, and a triangle, together 
with the piano, made enough noise to satisfy almost any boy. 
The appeal was made on a low plane, but in teaching chil- 
dren we must take them from the place where we find them
-P-A-G-E-174
  
  146 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
and lead them gradually to the place where they should and 
can go. Although the “orchestra” at first was merely noise 
which satisfied the boys, they gradually grew able to soften 
the tone and keep time to the music in various ways. The 
practice in rhythm gave every boy, no matter how low-grade 
mentally, an opportunity to do something, for a boy can 
ring the bells or use the sandpaper at almost any time and not 
spoil the performance, provided the time is kept by the drum- 
mers. The work improved each year so that the younger 
boys became capable of using the drums on the first beat 
while others used bells on the second, third, and fourth. The 
performers were promoted from one instrument to the next 
as they gained in proficiency, until they had mastered all. 
The present of a real drum enhanced the performance greatly, 
and when two brothers who played the violin and the cornet 
were admitted to the ungraded class, the boys felt that they 
were a real band. They added stunts that they had seen at 
the local vaudeville houses, such as ball-bouncing, hand-clap- 
ping, rope-jumping, and roller-skating in time to the music. 
It is not difficult to see that in these stunts, done separately 
and in couples, there was the opportunity for real training in 
physical coérdination and sense development. In time, the 
teachers gradually substituted for the popular airs with which 
the children were familiar the simple melodies of classic com- 
positions. Once they had become familiar with airs by Mac- 
Dowell and Beethoven, they were able to render them with 
the same enjoyment they had previously derived from street 
tunes and monotonous jazz. The success of this experiment 
was a surprise to the teachers. 
In arithmetic, teams were organized for number games 
which furnished drill in fundamentals, and graphs were drawn 
showing the progress of the teams. These graphs were posted 
on the bulletin board. Achievement tests were used to show
-P-A-G-E-175
  THE UNGRADED CLASSES 147 
the progress of individual pupils. The model store served 
for all phases of scholastic work, from “playing store” for the 
lower grades to taking inventories and making bills in the 
higher grades. Matches in arithmetic were arranged with 
regular classes of the school, for, although the ungraded boys 
were not able to compete in problem work, they were capable 
in memory and drill work. Usually, five were selected from 
each class, an ungraded and a regular class, the principal and 
assistant attending, thereby lending dignity to the occasion. 
You can readily picture how happy these boys were when they 
tied a 7B grade class, three of whose team were to be skipped 
to the 8B grade at the end of the term. 
Although most of these ungraded boys were more than 
twelve years old, they could not read a third year book. As 
they strenuously objected to reading from a ‘“‘baby book,” 
they made their own readers from newspapers, which pro- 
vided material more vital to them than ‘“Bo-Peep and her 
Sheep.” They made phonic and reading charts for the use 
of the first, second, and third grades, but no boy was allowed 
to print the charts unless he knew the letters and could read 
what he was printing. In this way, the most elementary 
reading lessons were given them without offense to their self- 
respect. For this consideration must always be remem- 
bered when dealing with these larger boys with backward 
minds. 
Material was selected from the shop for reading, spelling, 
composition, and arithmetic. In this way the names of the 
tools were learned, descriptions for making models were 
written, and spelling became vital, for a boy had to know the 
name of a tool and how to spell it before he was allowed to use 
it. Fractions were not merely a page in the arithmetic book 
but something to use in shop work, the misuse of which caused 
serious difficulty in the work.
-P-A-G-E-176
  
  148 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
The well-equipped shops and the efficient shop teachers are 
an added attraction for these boys. In the ungraded classes, 
because of the small numbers and the fact that the boys might 
supply their own material, they are allowed to choose their 
own models. The choice was usually something that could be 
used at home. Five or six models were finished in a term. 
During the war, wool was supplied by the Red Cross for knit- 
ting sweaters, and the class enjoyed knitting as much as any 
girls’ class. Their knitting needles were made from dowels. 
Toy-making also proved successful, the materials for this 
work being secured through the Junior Red Cross. Once a 
year a bazaar was held at the Boys’ Club and with the money 
thus raised, new material not on the supply list was bought. 
Two looms for rug-weaving were purchased from the school 
fund. Chair caning was also popular, many orders for stools 
being secured each year. In appreciation of the kindness of 
workers at the Boys’ Club, the chairs of the Club were caned, 
the Club furnishing the material. Brush-making was another 
activity in which the boys became proficient. The material 
was furnished by the Board of Education and the finished 
products went to the supply department for use in the public 
schools. 
The Boys’ Club afforded a place where dramatics were en- 
couraged. The large stage — the floor of the gymnasium — 
gave an opportunity which the over-used auditorium of the 
school could not. The first work done was a Thanksgiving 
pageant in which every boy in the department had a part, 
even if it was no more than dressing up as an Indian. The 
next attempt was a minstrel show. Under the guidance 
of the teacher the boys wrote the play themselves, which 
served to motivate the work in reading and speech improve- 
ment. The jokes were culled from the newspaper and cen- 
sored by the class with the help of the teacher. Popular
-P-A-G-E-177
  
THE UNGRADED CLASSES 149 
songs were selected and some two-part singing was taught. 
Acrobatic stunts were included and the boys suddenly found 
the physical training class less irksome. The minstrel show 
was such a success that it was used as the basis of the gradua- 
tion exercises of the school the following June. No doubt 
many people would consider the introduction of such trivial 
material into the serious atmosphere of the schoolroom as an 
unwarranted departure from the sacred purposes of education. 
As a matter of fact, the minstrel show stimulated more direct 
initiative and sustained effort on the part of the boys than we 
had thought them capable of. 
One of the most profitable terms of the school centered 
around the circus which followed the minstrel show. It pro- 
vided material for the entire term ; all subjects were correlated 
with it. The drills and acrobatic stunts were prepared in the 
gymnasium periods. The songs and music for the band were 
studied in the music period. The stage properties were made 
in the shop during the shop period. The signs were made in 
the sign painting shop, and the costumes were loaned by the 
Boys’ Club and others were made by the garment design 
shop. 
A description of the circus may be of interest. It was in- 
troduced by a prologue, after which appeared two clowns 
carrying the big bass drum and followed by another clown 
carrying a sign announcing the show. Then came the ring 
master in his full dress suit. The brass band played as the 
freaks and performers marched across the stage in parade. 
The parade consisted of a giant, a dwarf, a headless wonder, 
the strong man, the wild man, the Japanese magician, the 
bearded lady, animal trainers from India, a stuffed bear, a 
trick elephant, tramps, clowns, and Jewish and negro come- 
dians. Each of these appeared in a special stunt. The ring 
master gave a comical introduction for each one. Financially
-P-A-G-E-178
150 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
the circus was a great success. It provided funds to treat the 
nine ungraded classes to seats at Barnum and Bailey’s Circus, 
it provided new instruments for the orchestra, and it gave 
money to the school fund. 
The circus had a remarkable effect on the morale of the 
ungraded department. It had met with well-merited success. 
Certainly no one who sat in the audience would have suspected 
that the actors were boys with IQ’s of only 50 to 70. The 
ring master was gifted with unusual good looks and a charm- 
ing personality, traits which received the tribute that was 
their due on such an occasion. The ability of the boys to 
“get the laugh” in the right place showed an integrity of 
purpose and a coérdination of effort which might easily have 
been lacking in a more pretentious piece of work. This was 
but one of a series of entertainments which led us to wonder 
whether the mimetic faculty which plays so large a part in 
every dramatic performance is not compatible with a much 
wider range of intelligence than is commonly supposed. Is 
the sympathetic personality which can get itself across the 
footlights conditioned on intelligence? From the Court 
Jester to Sir Henry Irving, the profession of the entertainer 
is not generally undervalued. In all of its forms, it can be 
reasonably sure of an economic reward. It is characteristic 
of the experimental spirit of the ungraded teachers that what- 
ever ability a boy may possess, manual or histrionic, it is 
usually found out by some means, and receives encouragement 
and appreciation. 
COOPERATION WITH THE HOME 
Much of the success of an ungraded class depends on co- 
operation with the home. Here the tact and skill of the visit- 
ing teacher are very much in demand. With these children 
more often than with others there are physical defects to be  
-P-A-G-E-179
THE UNGRADED CLASSES I51 
remedied. There is a natural resistance on the part of a 
family, especially if the other children have gone through school 
in the regular way, to having a boy in a special class. But 
when a hitherto difficult child settles into school for the first 
time in his life, and ceases to harass his parents with bad re- 
ports and frequent summons from the school, the family is 
usually reconciled. Sometimes this is not accomplished with- 
out many visits on the part of the visiting teacher, who must 
interpret this new kind of progress which the boy is making. 
A legitimate concession was made to the feelings of these 
boys and their parents by changing the name of the ungraded 
classes for current use, although the official name was re- 
tained on the school register. The name “ungraded” was 
removed from the classroom doors and “Junior Shops” was 
substituted. It is by no means necessary, even in a complex 
public school organization, that concessions made to dull 
boys should be compensated for by stigmas and labels. So 
far as such things still persist, they are a survival of the old 
dunce-cap atrocity. A scientific attitude towards children 
will do much to eliminate all forms of mental torture from the 
schoolroom. For the teacher needs not only charity but sci- 
ence to perceive the futility of penalizing a child for failing in 
that which he absolutely cannot do. The teacher of a regu- 
lar class who is really trained in psychology will be unlikely 
to threaten a lazy child with the “ungraded class,’”’ and 
thereby bring into disrepute the children of these classes. It 
is by learning the actual natures of dull children that we come 
to have the most charitable attitude toward them. 
But the threat of the dunce-cap as a form of discipline dies 
harder than the threat of the birch-rod. In spite of the well- 
known attitude of the school toward the ungraded children, 
new teachers were prone to offend. The pride which the un- 
graded teachers took in their own classes has done more than 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  152 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
anything else to counteract this depreciation of the status of 
their department. A zealous but inexperienced teacher came 
to the door of an ungraded classroom one morning escorting 
a young culprit who had been late for the fifth time. ‘This 
boy,” she said in righteous indignation, “has been late four 
times. I told him if he came late again, I would put him in 
this class.” And she waved him in. “Indeed,” said the un- 
graded teacher with equal indignation, ‘‘you have brought 
him to the wrong place. Every boy in this room comes on 
time every day.” And she pointed to a roo per cent record 
on the blackboard. While the rebuff was hard on the young 
teacher, it was an absolute necessity from the point of view of 
protecting the self-respect of the sixteen boys in the classroom. 
At Public School 64, we endeavored, in general, to adhere to 
the spirit and ideals of the ungraded department of the city. 
Our experiment had the codperation and the confidence of the 
department. The distinctive features of the local work were 
limited to these: the codperation with the Boys’ Club, al- 
ready described, which brought increased facilities and re- 
sources; the tendency to include a higher type of boy in the 
classes than in most schools; the establishment of observa- 
tion ungraded classes for the younger children; and the initia- 
tion of classes for neurotic children, to be discussed in a later 
chapter. 
THE BORDER LINE BOY 
In many schools there is a tendency to regard the ungraded 
department as a place of punishment and to feel that it is an 
injustice to a well-behaved child to recommend him for ad- 
mission. In fact, before psychological tests were introduced, 
boys were recommended on the basis of behavior rather than 
intelligence. For this reason, it was difficult to make these 
classes serve the type of boy who needed the work most. The 
attitude of the teacher towards a dull but good boy was to give  
-P-A-G-E-181
  THE UNGRADED CLASSES 153 
him the benefit of the doubt by keeping him in a regular class. 
We, on the other hand, considered that giving a boy the bene- 
fit of the doubt often meant giving him the opportunity of 
getting a good education, The choice which we were some- 
times obliged to make in border line cases usually fortified 
this point of view. 
Peter Lutz had an IQ of 75, and so had a great many other 
boys. Peter’s outstanding characteristic was that he felt com- 
pelled to act the fool on every occasion. He was an expert at 
making faces and giving silly answers. In short, he was a 
“cut-up” and a clown of the most annoying brand. With it 
all he had a streak of common sense that made the teachers 
hesitate to banish him. Finally, rather against the judgment 
of the teachers, the principal and psychologist decided to ask 
to have him put into the ungraded class. Without demon- 
strating any miraculous conversion, Peter gradually learned to 
exert himself seriously at tasks which he was able to accom- 
plish. He was no longer obliged to compensate for his dullness 
by his outrageous capers. He had the kind of pride which 
would have obliged a brighter boy to stand at the head of his 
class; but since he had not the capacity for this, he had used 
whatever resources he had to command attention. Finding 
his milieu in a class of boys who were duller than he, this trait 
led him to be in time the brightest, most industrious, and most 
dependable member of his group. When too much was de- 
manded of him, as occasionally happened, he fell back tempo- 
rarily into his former mode of behavior. On leaving school, 
he was given a recommendation for a job by his teacher, who 
could conscientiously consent to do so. Many instances could 
be given of similar cases of boys who had formerly just scraped 
along at the bottom of their classes and who seemed to dis- 
cover new and astonishing abilities in the atmosphere of the 
Junior Shops.
-P-A-G-E-182
    154 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
While it is true that education does not change the mental 
status of this type of boy, it is also true that the kind of edu- 
cation he receives may materially affect his social and eco- 
nomic status in after life. While his IQ is not improved by 
training, the place he finally comes to occupy in the world 
may be greatly altered thereby. Of two persons with an equal 
IQ, the one may make a far better place for himself in society 
than the other if his training has been based on his actual 
equipment and not on some hypothetical average. It should 
not, therefore, be necessary to guarantee that a child will not 
“be able to manage his affairs with ordinary prudence” (a 
frequent definition of mental deficiency) before placing him in 
a class where he may learn to do so. He is amenable to the 
formation of good habits while he is under its care, and if he 
is started out with well-established practices in regard to 
health, work, and play, there is a strong likelihood that they 
will last. 
This is perhaps even more true of a child with a low IQ 
than with a high one. The former learns his moral lessons in 
a routine way and applies them literally. A more intelligent 
and imaginative youth has to work things out for himself, 
and if this gets him into difficulties, he can extricate himself 
by the use of his intelligence. The dull child accepts moral 
precepts without criticism and, therefore, the school should 
concentrate its efforts towards teaching him social habits 
which conform to the existing code. He is not qualified to 
become a pioneer in higher ethics; he has a better chance 
for a happy and serviceable life if he is well drilled in the 
simplest and most commonly needed ethical conventions. 
The more diversified his school experiences are, the more 
opportunities he has to build habits of social conformity which 
are to be the guide of his later life. An ingenious teacher, 
during the child’s school course, can manufacture for him 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
  THE UNGRADED CLASSES 155 
many typical situations which he is likely to meet in his wage- 
earning career, and prepare him to meet them in such a way 
that they do not arise as emergencies. For a limited intel- 
ligence is more apt to show itself in the failure to meet a novel 
situation than in any other way. 
FINDING THE SLOW CHILD EARLY 
When the entire school was classified by intelligence tests, 
the need for more ungraded classes for the younger’ children 
was strongly felt. No such classes had formerly existed. 
Under the old method of selection by recommendation of the 
teachers, it had been the rule that no child should be assigned 
to this department until he had spent at least three years in 
the regular grades. Frequently he had reached the age of 12 
to.14 before he was sent, and the teacher was confronted by 
the task of reconstructing in two years the bad habits which 
were based on long years of continuous failure. The great 
majority of boys came to the ungraded class after they had 
spent five or six years in the grades acquiring habits of truancy, 
laziness, furtiveness, and devious compensation. Almost 
every boy entered the department under a cloud. 
When it became possible to select the children on a scientific 
basis, it was no longer necessary to wait for the accumulated 
results of retardation to determine what theyneeded. The low-. 
est group of first grade children by the psychological classifica- 
tion was taken over by the ungraded department as an obser- 
vation ungraded class. In the same way, a corresponding 
group was organized for each succeeding grade. These chil- 
dren were not diagnosed as defective or anything else. They 
were merely classified as the least promising from the point 
of view of adjustment to school life and curriculum as it is. 
There is a certain number of children in every entering class 
of six-year-olds who strongly suggest, by personal traits and
-P-A-G-E-184
    156 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
behavior, and by their family histories as well as by their 
psychological tests, that they are going to need extra time 
and extra help to fit into school life. The children who would 
under ordinary circumstances later be admitted to the un- 
graded class, will undoubtedly be included in this group. 
How many of the others will later be returned to the grade 
above is a question which depends very largely for its answer 
on the further question of whether the grade will develop a 
curriculum which will come half-way to meet them. It oc- 
casionally happened that a child responded so well to the sense- 
training and individual care given in the ungraded class that 
it seemed best to try him in a regular class. But as a matter 
of fact, very few of these children profit by being returned to 
the present academic grades. Unless some compromise can 
be worked out which will give the benefits of both the present 
academic curriculum and the present ungraded curriculum, 
they are likely to thrive best and make more actual progress 
in the more humanized environment of the ungraded class. 
With the establishment of the observation ungraded classes, 
the department in Public School 64 became subdivided into 
two groups: four classes of older boys and five classes of 
younger ones. The make-up of the ungraded department 
according to the chronological ages of the children is shown in 
Table XX. 
The shop equipment for the younger boys was a problem. 
The department had no equipment for children of this size. 
Only the regulation academic sittings of the old-fashioned 
prison type were available for six- and eight- and nine-year-olds. 
Fortunately the school shops were able to make the requisite 
equipment in smaller sizes according to the ungraded plan. 
Tables, benches, and chairs were constructed in the joinery 
department, and small stools, on which the children stood 
while they worked, enabled them to use the regular benches
-P-A-G-E-185
  THE UNGRADED CLASSES 157_ 
and do genuine work from the first with regulation tools. 
The making of this equipment by the older boys illustrates 
the kind of service which they commonly gave to the school 
in the way of repairs and upkeep. The idea of useful work was 
not imparted merely as a theory but as a practical, daily habit.

There are many advantages in placing the children in ob- 
servation ungraded classes at six or seven years of age. In 
the first place, they are saved from wasting time, and time 
most precious to the slow learner. In the second place, they 
enlist the sympathy and affection of the teachers of the de- 
partment more readily as little children than as older ones. 
The deficiency of a six-year-old appears in the form of a baby- 
ish demeanor. This is in itself an appealing trait which 
naturally arouses the parental tenderness of a teacher. Later 
on, when the child’s backwardness becomes more outstanding, 
there exists already a history of affection between them which 
helps to mitigate the teacher’s impatience and displeasure. 
This applies, of course, only in a school where the ungraded
-P-A-G-E-186
  158 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
teachers know the boys throughout their school career, as is 
the case in Public School 64, where the department is a school 
within a school, with an intimate and informal atmosphere of 
its own. 4 
After all, the principal advantage of early assignment to 
ungraded classes is the protection of the child’s disposition. 
At home, his backwardness has usually been tolerated and 
shielded, but as soon as he encounters the requirements and 
the competition of the first grade, his disposition begins to 
break. With every added failure, his feeling of inferiority is 
enhanced. How can he keep up courage or develop cheerful 
industry? His gradual loss of confidence and incentive 
renders him at last unable to do the work even up to his limited 
capacity. It is important to remember in this connection 
that self-confidence is not necessarily associated with high 
mental ability nor inferiority feelings with feeble-mindedness. 
These personal attitudes are founded less on actual ability 
than on the child’s experience with his family and his school. 
The boy with a 75 IQ who is treated by his parent or teacher 
as if he were somebody is not so likely to suffer from morbid 
diffidence and discouragement as a boy of 125 IQ who is 
habitually snubbed by his elders. The boy with a low IQ who 
goes all the way through school and leaves it with a socialized 
friendly attitude towards others, carries within himself the 
greatest possible protection against danger. He has estab- 
lished habits of frictionless relationships which are the best 
social safeguard that can be given him. 
Students of delinquency estimate that from 30 per cent to 
50 per cent of the population of the prisons are mental defec- 
tives. This is enormously high by comparison with the pro- 
portion of mental defectives in the population at large. It 
has led many people to believe that mental defectiveness is in 
itself a cause of crime. But if this were the case, what light     
  
  
 
-P-A-G-E-187
  THE UNGRADED CLASSES 159 
wouldit throw on the other two-thirds of the prison population ? 
It is not the lack of intelligence which gets people into prison ; 
it is their dispositions. The fact that so large a proportion 
of the mentally defective go to prison is evidence of how far 
the schools have failed in their task. The subnormal person 
is often malleable and educable. The constant nagging and 
punishment which are meted out to the stupid boy in the aver- 
age school give him a kind of special training in resentment 
and antagonism. Later on, these unlovely qualities, the prod- 
uct of his education, wreck his industrial career. They lead 
him to hate the boss, quarrel with his fellows, and lose one 
job after another. If he reaches prison at twenty-four and 
is there diagnosed as mentally defective and emotionally 
unstable, the emphasis should be placed on the second fea- 
ture of the diagnosis as the significant factor of his tragedy. 
After the history of conflict through which he has passed, it 
is legitimate to wonder whether mental defectiveness alone 
would ever have brought him to this pass. 
The unrecognized defective is around us everywhere. 
There are numberless occupations on which civilization de- 
pends which may readily be performed by a person with a 
50 to 751Q. The boy or girl who goes out into the world with 
an unspoiled disposition and a mental age of only 8 to12 
years may present a very good front before his neighbors and 
fellow-workers, who do not inquire whether he left off at 
school with long division or analytical geometry. He can do 
many things along with the cleverest. Anybody who is trying 
to learn to run a motor car may encourage himself with the re- 
flection that a moron can do the same. There are brilliant 
women who are proud that they can knit, and would prob- 
ably be surprised to know that this is a normal accomplish- 
ment for a seven-year-old mentality. 
It is true that the low-grade intelligence which is engaged
-P-A-G-E-188
  160 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
in running a motor car or knitting or any of their numerous 
equivalents does not make the same general impression as the 
high-grade intelligence similarly employed. There is an un- 
conscious recognition in the mind of the public of the arrested 
ability of the moron worker. ‘I have sucha nice little grocer’s 
boy,” says a lady, expatiating on his faithfulness and regu- 
larity, which she rewards with occasional presents. ‘‘A nice 
little seamstress” is very popular with a certain family, who 
do not stop to reflect that the quality of dependence which 
makes them all fond of her is not a truly adult quality. The 
use of such phrases indicates a certain awareness of the 
diminutive development of these people. But so long as the 
friendly feeling prevails, the person so referred to does not 
lose his job and become dependent, although his IQ may 
be below the median IQ of the population of Sing Sing. 
This is what the ungraded teachers have come to realize 
and why they answer ‘‘no’’ when people ask them whether 
they do not find their work depressing. After all, the educa- 
tion of dispositions is perhaps a more subtle and interesting 
cccupation than giving information to bright or average 
children who would probably get it anyway.

  CHAPTER VIII 
Tue Dutt Normat Boy 
The classification of children by psychological tests does 
not, as many people seem to think, take away from them 
their infinite variety and stamp them with a tiresome uni- 
formity. When the government tests the army and publishes 
the results, it does no injustice to the individual. The Federal 
Census reports tell us certain facts about every person in the 
country — age, sex, occupation, marital status, and so forth 
— but we do not assume that this is all that could be told 
about him. In the same way, the psychological test ascer- 
tains the intelligence rating of a group of individuals without 
assuming that this is all that might be told about the members 
of the group. - 
It is not the function of the psychological classification, any 
more than of the census classification, to reduce human beings 
to the dull facsimile of a swarm of bees, a flock of sheep, a 
shoal of fish. If anyone hears of classifying school children 
by intelligence tests, he should not envisage them therefore as 
a crowd of orphans in blue-checked gingham, forlorn imita- 
tions of each other. On the contrary, if a group of school 
children are said to have a common IQ of 8s, it should be 
remembered that this is really the only trait in which they 
are even approximately alike. It happens that in the busi- 
ness of education, this kind of homogeneity has primary im- 
portance because it so largely determines the child’s reaction 
to being taught. But the experienced psychologist who dis- 
161
-P-A-G-E-190
  162 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
covers that a child has an IQ of 90 does not believe that he 
has exhausted the subject. Indeed, he is more aware of the 
uncharted and untested influences which remain after the 
IQ has been estimated than the well-meaning but unscientific 
person who believes that academic education of the kind now 
current is a remedy for every human limitation. 
As soon as you begin to put things together by reason of a 
certain similarity between them, their dissimilarities begin to 
stand out. A button here and a button there are just buttons ; 
gathered together in a button box, their various differences 
are instantly noted, large and small, blue and brown, round 
and flat. If you take a box full of buttons and begin to sort 
them by sizes, the varieties of color begin to appear; sorted 
by color, they refuse to look alike in regard to shape. The 
discovery of a similarity is always an aid in the process of 
differentiation. The person who is not impressed with the 
dissimilarities of similar things is the person who is at a dis- 
tance and has no intimate contact with them, who sees them 
only through the newspaper column, the printed page, or 
common talk. To people remote from the material, the one 
effect of classification seems to be uniformity, because it 
offers a single trait whereby the imagination, working at a 
distance, may hold the whole group in mind. But the teacher 
who stands before a class of children with similar IQ’s, or the 
psychologist who is in daily contact with them, is less con- 
scious of their common traits than of their individual differ- 
ences. The individualizing of the child in the teacher’s 
mind is facilitated by this grouping. Once she perceives the 
quality they share, she may treat them differently according 
to the qualities they do not share. Formal academic educa- 
tion builds on what people have in common; real education 
should take account of the individual’s possible contribution 
through personal tendencies and endowments, and should
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE DULL NORMAL BOY 163 
seek to make this potential contribution a real one for every 
individual. 
While the mental capacity of a person does more or less to 
determine his place in school or sphere in life, it does not de- 
termine his success within that sphere. But this is the kind 
of success on which personal happiness chiefly depends and 
which practically every grade of intelligence may hopefully 
pursue. Psychological classification does not encourage the 
idea that only the best intelligence is worth while and the 
rest nowhere; on the contrary, it leads us to value all kinds 
and grades of intelligence and to try to understand how to 
develop them towards a life of personal effectiveness and 
social usefulness. 
SIZE OF DULL NORMAL GROUP 
The group of children whose IQ’s are between 75 and 85 
and whose potential mental ages between 12 and 14 represents 
for several reasons the most exigent problem in the public 
schools. Wherever psychological surveys have been made, 
the size of this group has shown a tendency to disturb the 
normal curve of intelligence. In the army, it assumed sur- 
prising proportions. “It appears,’ says the report, “that 
the intelligence of the principal sample of the white draft, 
when transmitted from Alpha and Beta examinations in terms 
of mental age, is about 13 years (13.08). Here we have a 
measure of the average intelligence of nearly 100,000 white 
recruits.” Commenting further on this group, the army re- 
port says, “We know now, approximately, from clinical ex- 
perience, the capacity and mental ability of a man of 13 years. 
We have never heretofore supposed that the mental ability of 
this man was the average of the country or anywhere near 
it.”! In other words, we have never been willing to admit the 
1 Psychological Examining in the United States Army. Page 789.
-P-A-G-E-192
  164 ’ FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
prevalence of this grade of intelligence among the general 
population. We have preferred to believe that Socratic and 
Jeffersonian intellects were at least embryonic in everybody. 
It would seem as if the time had come to cease exclaiming 
with surprise over the outstanding proportion of this group 
and searching for special reasons for the bulging of the intelli- 
gence curve just where the dull normal folk come in. 
A more practical alternative would be to admit that there 
are a great number of these people and that they form no negli- 
gible problem from the social and educational point of view. 
In our school, about one-fifth of the children were classified 
within the dull normal group. For practical purposes, how- 
ever, the number should be considered a much larger one, 
perhaps one-fourth. The psychological line of demarcation 
is not absolute; you do not keep a boy out of high school be- 
cause he has an IQ of 89, nor refuse to classify another as dull 
normal because his IQ is 86 instead of 85. Such literal dis- 
tinctions would be absurd. There were overlapping IQ’s 
in all our groups in Public School 64. A child is not saved 
by intelligence alone; all his attributes of character have an 
influence on the issue. Yet it is a doubtful kindness to push 
boys upward into academic classes where they are destined 
to be always at the tail-end. Children with IQ’s between 
85 and go seldom do well in the high school courses which pre- 
pare for college, and many of them should be included in any 
public school program which is adapted to the 75 to 85 IQ 
group. This does not mean that they should have no second- 
ary education, but that the present high school fails to pro- 
vide a congenial program for them. 
Such a program does not exist even in the elementary school. 
What actually happens in all public schools, as every educator 
conversant with the situation knows, is that about one-third 
of the children sit around while the other two-thirds are being  
-P-A-G-E-193
  
THE DULL NORMAL BOY 165 
taught. This recognition is not limited to the educator; it 
js a matter of common knowledge, a subject to be treated 
with tolerant mirth. A recent cartoon in the New York 
World showed two little boys engaged in a gutter conversation 
about the approach of school days. ‘‘Ain’t you goin’ to school 
this year?” said one. “No,”’ said the other, “I didn’t learn 
anything last year.” The joke has its serious implications 
for the educator. 
The number of little boys who might say this with literal 
truth is startlingly large. They are generally children whose 
IQ’s are anywhere between 75 and 90. If we were to analyze 
tooo school children who are social and educational misfits, 
the great majority would certainly be found to belong to this 
group. The truants, the hold-overs, the disciplinary cases 
are preponderantly of the dull normal type. They are a 
symptom of protest against our inadequate school organiza- 
tion. Under our present arrangements, the dull normal 
child misses out all along the line. He is denied the oppor- 
tunities which are provided for the ungraded child and he 
cannot profit by those which directly prepare for the high 
school course. Even the trade school becomes practically in- 
accessible for him, owing to his belated graduation from the 
grammar grades and the selective policy of the trade school, 
which can always choose boys with good marks who cannot 
afford a high school course. The dull normal boy is qualified 
to do good work and a great variety of useful and dignified 
occupations are open to him; but the school insists on pre- 
paring him to be a lawyer, or doctor, or banker, or pedagogue. 
He sits on in classes conducted on this theory as a child sits 
through a dreary sermon. If he suffers from boredom, says 
the school authority, it is his “fault.”” The schools are made 
for children who can “take an education” and the standards 
must be kept up, etc., etc.
-P-A-G-E-194
166 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
During the years of the experiment in our school, an effort 
was made to come to the rescue of these children in various 
empirical ways. No other group seemed to be so much in 
need of imaginative and constructive guidance. The existence 
of the opportunity classes within the system was seen to be 
an entering wedge on their behalf. These classes were specif- 
ically organized to enable over-age boys to overcome their 
retardation. The usual plan had been to group the slow 
normal together during their last years in school. By analogy 
with the observation-ungraded classes, we established oppor- 
tunity classes for the younger boys and continued this process 
until one opportunity class was formed for each grade all the 
way up and down. 
These were permitted to have a smaller register than the reg- 
ular classes, but the further adaptation of the opportunity 
classes remained behindhand. There was no special equip- 
ment for them and there were no specially trained teachers. 
An organized constructive plan was impossible. Experiments 
with the curriculum had to be left with the individual teacher, 
with the result that here and there some progress was made 
with certain classes. The animal-room, the window-gardens, 
and the shops were at least available, and functioned well in the 
hands of creative teachers who could exploit their possibilities. 
AN EXPERIMENT WITH ATTENDANCE 
With one class of 5B grade boys, a more intensive attempt 
was made. The class was comparatively small with only 
twenty-five on the register (later increased to thirty), because 
it was known to contain so many difficult boys and so many 
stubborn cases of truancy, over-age, and other disciplinary 
problems. The boys ranged in age from thirteen to fifteen 
years. The older members remained in school until sixteen, 
because the compulsory school law would not permit them to 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  
THE DULL NORMAL BOY 167 
go to work before that age unless they had completed at least 
the 6B grade. The teacher who was placed in charge was a 
young man of good personality and adequate technique with 
a regular class. While he was liked by the boys and did very 
well considering the group under his care, truancy continued 
to be rife among them, and there were constant complaints 
against his pupils for infractions of school discipline. The 
parents of these big boys could give little or no assistance. 
We determined to see if it was possible to interest this 
blasé group in school. It should be noted that the course of 
study did not provide shop work for fifth year classes. Re- 
gardless of the curriculum, we asked the shop teacher to pro- 
vide an hour each day for the instruction of this experimental 
class. At first the boys were not interested because they had 
had no training to do the jobs they would have liked to do. 
By degrees they acquired skill in the use of material and tools 
and learned the magic feel of success. By the middle of the 
term, all of them were intensely interested in the shop work and 
had developed a more active spirit of work in every direction. 
They attacked the formal subjects of the curriculum. At the 
end of the term, the tables, chairs, and willow-work they had 
produced were among the best in the shop’s exhibit. The 
manual training department no longer condescended to accept 
these boys, but looked forward with assured success to their 
second term of work. 
The other innovation was the introduction of a swimming 
period once a week. Here again the Boys’ Club came to the 
rescue with the provision of a swimming pool and a skillful 
teacher. Because the pupils were interested in learning to 
swim, they did not take less interest, but more, in the arith- 
metic period. Too often the guardians of children think that 
this or that interest ‘‘takes the child’s mind off his lessons.” 
It is important to discriminate in this respect and to encourage
-P-A-G-E-196
    168 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
every normal boyish interest which leads to the acquisition 
of skill. When a child eats the butter off his bread, he is not 
deprived of the butter, which he needs, but is taught to “‘bite 
through” and eat the bread also. But too many of our edu- 
cational processes insist on the child’s learning to like dry 
bread, and too often the school goes about its work in a spirit 
of foolish pride, which refuses to compromise with childish 
interests and spirits. It then puts all the responsibility for 
failure where it least belongs — on the unsuccessful child. 
The change which came over the spirit of this group of boys 
was little short of remarkable, and it was all due to the fact 
that they were given something to do which they liked and 
that they had found something that they could do well. The 
problems of attendance and discipline grew fewer and fewer 
until, before the year was over, these no longer existed. Table 
XXI shows the record of attendance of the members of the class 
for four successive terms. The same teacher was in charge 
during the four terms, but it was not until the end of the 
second term that the adjustment of curriculum was made. 
The marked improvement in attendance is shown by the re- 
duction of total absences from 573% daysin the second term, 
to 3204 in the third term, and 1824 in the fourth term. 
Everywhere the dull normal boy is the despair of the teach- 
ers, supervisors, and parents. Only today we read in the 
newspapers of the alarming conditions in New York City, and 
the inadequate facilities for dealing with the truant and other 
delinquency cases. This state of affairs. must continue to 
exist so long as we fail to recognize the true cause. In the 
best parental and disciplinary schools the boys are given a 
kind of curriculum which approximates an adjustment to 
their abilities. If the same modification of curriculum had 
been provided for the same boys while they were still in the 
middle grades of the school — or preferably, even earlier —

the necessity for the punitive school might never have arisen. 
When the schools decide to provide, as they very well can, 
the conditions and activities which will hold these boys, it 
will not be necessary in so many instances to take them from 
their homes and confine them in institutional environments, 
which we then strive in vain to render educational and 
home-like. 
The class experiment just described was but a demonstra- 
tion of what might be done for boys of this type. It was but a 
scanty handful who benefited by the plan when compared 
with the group of boys in the school who needed similar treat- 
ment and more of it. So cognizant were we, however, of the 
specific social dangers which confront all ill-adjusted school- 
boys, that we made every possible effort to treat each one as 
an individual case. The visiting teacher is the most valuable 
aid which the school has developed for handling these difficult 
children, and there is a tendency in the school which is not 
psychologically orientated about its material to concentrate 
her effort too exclusively on this type of problem. | 
Billie Jackson was a “question mark” pupil from the first 
grade. In his home the visiting teacher learned that Billie’s 
father “had not had much schooling and did not like school. 
He never could learn anything there and neither could Billie.” 
It was true; Billie was intensely bored by school books and 
much preferred to spend his time lying on the iron grating 
above the subway and watching the trains pass below, and in 
similar pursuits. The complacent ignorance of his parents 
did not help his school attendance. He became an incorri- 
gible truant. One day he casually appropriated a watch which 
did not belong to him. Against this accumulation of syTHD- 
* toms, what was to be done? 
Unfortunately, by no acceptable standard test, could Billie 
be called a mental defective. His IQ was 88. If he could
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE DULL NORMAL BOY 17r 
have been put in the ungraded department, his problem would 
have been helped. It was indeed a case for desperate remedies, 
if we could think of any. Billie developed a fondness for one 
particular teacher who had the faculty of keeping up his at- 
tendance whenever he was in her room. The teacher hap- 
pened to be promoted with her grade from time to time, so 
that Billie could be returned to her keeping now and then, 
without entirely disregarding his grade-progress through 
school. Whenever his truancy grew worse, he was re-consigned 
to Miss X and the habit would be abated. This treatment 
may have been empirical and unorthodox, but is not anything 
better than a fanatical law enforcement which makes this type 
of boy into a social outcast before he has reached his teens? 
We thought that it was. 
Bennie Eichenbaum, IQ 88, was by no means a neglected 
boy. His first appearance in the school was at the age of 
eleven and in the fifth grade. His father had just made a 
second marriage and brought Bennie home from the Hebrew 
Orphan Asylum. A well-intentioned stepmother shared in the 
ambitious plans which Bennie’s father had laid out for him. 
The boy always came to the school extremely well dressed 
in brown corduroy suits and with longish hair; for Bennie’s 
father had determined that he was to be a violinist and in- 
sisted that he should dress the part. The boy objected to the 
clothes, since they caused the other boys to tease him; and 
he disliked the idea of being a violinist. When his father 
insisted on his going to the public library to take out a book, 
Bennie lost the book and his father had to pay for it. Mr. 
Eichenbaum came to school frequently to make anxious in- 
quiries about Bennie’s progress, but Bennie showed no in- 
terest in his lessons. His father consoled himself by con- 
stantly singing the praises of Bennie’s brother, who was board- 
ing with a family in New Jersey and was making such a fine
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  172 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD | 
record for himself in every way that his father forbore to bring 
him home. The legend of the other boy’s superiority was 
constantly kept going in the family circle, in the hope that it 
might stimulate greater effort on Bennie’s part. Naturally, 
it increased the boy’s discouragement. 
His reaction to all this was to take refuge in a stupid pas- 
sivity in the presence of his elders. He had two absorbing 
interests: the wish to possess a bicycle (instead of a violin!) 
and going to the movies. His father refused to allow him to 
have a bicycle for fear he might be run over in the street. He 
reveled in the movies, however, for which an aunt secretly 
gave him money. This aunt, to whom Bennie always re- 
ferred dramatically as his ‘‘dead mother’s sister,” fancied that 
the boy was ill-used by his stepmother and spoiled him with 
misplaced sympathy. He began to indulge in romantic ad- 
ventures which led to truancy and vagabondage. With an- 
other boy, he undertook to enact a hanging scene in a cellar; 
but he became frightened and ran away without cutting down 
the victim. The boy was rescued just in time, and Bennie’s 
reputation as a desperado was greatly enhanced. He had 
taken to staying out overnight and, from this beginning, 
he continued to wander farther and farther afield. One 
morning his distracted stepmother rushed into the school 
bearing the evidence of his latest crime wrapped up in a 
Yiddish newspaper. It was a small bank which Bennie had 
forced open. He had taken his savings, amounting to seven 
or eight dollars, and disappeared. 
Fortunately Bennie’s parents, who had started out with 
the idea of curing him by invoking the law and the courts, 
had formed the habit of bringing his offenses to the school 
instead. The visiting teacher was repeatedly appealed pes 
“You helped me with that boy before. Mow, tell me, what 
shall I do?” When suggestions were made to the nae
-P-A-G-E-201
THE DULL NORMAL BOY 173 
that some of his methods only made bad matters worse, he 
tried conscientiously to change them. The boy, who admired 
and feared his father extravagantly, would have liked to please 
him; but the standard of the ambitious parents had been 
placed too high for him. The school requirements were al- 
ways just beyond his reach. His failure to graduate from the 
8B class was a disaster which sent the visiting teacher post- 
haste to the boy’s father to break the news to him and per- 
suade him not to “kill” the culprit. 
There was no special disability in Bennie’s case. But 
academic subjects had no attraction for him; all that the 
school and a well-meaning home could do to arouse his in- 
terest in lessons left him apathetic and furtively recalcitrant. 
If he had been given bicycle and shop and swimming lessons 
instead of violin and grammar lessons and library books, he 
might have become a wide-awake schoolboy. Instead, he 
hovered constantly on the edge of juvenile delinquency, and 
it was only the work of the visiting teacher which kept him 
from becoming a court case in early childhood. 
WHAT SHALL BE DONE FOR THE DULL NORMAL BOY 
The distressing problem presented by children who cannot 
cope successfully with the regular academic requirements 
and who are, nevertheless, not mental defectives, is a daily 
experience in every school. Evidence of this came to us in 
the form of frequent requests to receive big boys of thirteen 
or fourteen who were still obliged to go to school, although 
they had been eliminated from one school after another. A 
number of such boys were enrolled and allowed to do shop 
work, which they considered manly and which reconciled them 
to the rest of the curriculum. Any school which will make 
an active effort to help these boys will find no dearth of them 
knocking at its doors. Some of those who came to our school  
-P-A-G-E-202
  174 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
lived in the farthest parts of the city, and traveled long aie 
tances daily on the subway. One of the boys became very 
able in electric-wiring and supervised the younger boys in 
work which was done in the school offices. Another built a 
gasoline engine from the foundation up —a piece of work of 
which the school was rightfully proud and which was a more 
than creditable achievement for any fifteen-year-old boy. | 
This boy was excused from all other school work and allowed 
to work in the machine shop exclusively. He came to be an 
assistant to the teacher, and his engine was an object of ad- 
miration to hundreds of boys who passed through this shop 
each week. This last year of school meant everything to a 
boy who had hated it always. We had had to compromis 
with the requirements, but wé felt that the boy had sata 
rescued. 
Not children only have heredity ; education also has here 
ity. The persistence of characteristics is extraordinary in 
both cases. For the last century at least, a single uniform 
academic course of study has been uncritically accepted as 
suitable for all children of the elementary grades. Nothing 
has hindered the progress of education more than this erro- 
neous view. The aristocratic education once developed in 
the palestra and the monastery and the English public school 
for the upper layers of intelligence, has been regarded as the 
one possible basis of school work. Compulsory education 
was never thought to be inconsistent with this idea. The 
public school could think of no other way than to dilute the 
scholastic system more and more and filter the ever-thinning 
mixture on down through the elementary grades. As there 
was no scientific knowledge of the development of children be- 
fore and during their teens, our educators took the philosophy 
of Aristotle for an ideal and thinned it down until they pro- 
duced a dose that the average six-year-old could bear. It still
-P-A-G-E-203
THE DULL NORMAL BOY 175 
remains to be proved that even the normal child of this age 
profits more by the mild dose than he would by real food with 
cell-building properties. 
The plight of the pupil below the average in intelligence 
is cumulative. He can tolerate a great deal, like the young 
child who sits still in church with his elders while the sermon 
goes on over his head. But the endurance which goes on in 
the schoolroom day by day involves a far greater strain, al- 
though the material is not quite so remote from perception. 
By the time he reaches the middle and upper grades he is in 
revolt, or apathetic, or mentally ill. The grammar grades can 
do nothing for him; the school can only go on with its program 
of feeding sugar to diabetics. In most occupations, people 
take account of the material with which they are working, 
and modify their methods to suit its conditions. The house- 
wife boils her jam a longer or shorter period of time, according 
to whether the berries are wet or dry. If the jam turns out 
badly once, no trouble is too much to take to avoid the same 
mistake again. Only in school do we insist on running chil- 
dren through on the same theoretical schedule and by the same 
traditional method. Then when they turn out badly, we start 
all over again with the next batch with the procedure abso- 
lutely unchanged. 
We are not forgetful of the matter of social approval, to 
which the child is and should be sensitive. While he is en- 
titled to receive the traditional course of study, he also has a 
right to be trained according to his personal endowment. 
After all, we cannot develop and build without regard to the 
native capacities and abilities of children. This general prin- 
ciple has always been accepted, but not until recently have 
we come to realize the wide range of individual differences — 
mental, physical, and emotional — which exist among chil- 
dren. To adjust to these conditions does not require the  
-P-A-G-E-204
  176 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
complete abandonment of all the traditional values of the 
schoolroom. 
The boy wants to have history, and civics, and science be- 
cause all the other boys in his street have these studies. 
“What, don’t you have history in your class? We’ve had 
history three years.” This is not the sort of thing that one 
boy likes to hear from another, and against which the school 
should seek to protect him. As a matter of fact, the dull 
normal child can be taught much of the conventional subjects 
if he is taught in the untraditional, or ungraded way. Science 
includes much practical matter extremely attractive to him. 
It is one thing to teach him by demonstrating the inside 
workings of a Ford engine but quite another to teach him the 
inside workings of the solar system. Yet both lessons may be 
justifiably listed as science, and the public school is confronted 
by the necessity of regarding them as equally important. 
Usually the school is far more willing to buy a uranosphere 
to show the movement of the heavenly bodies than to pur- 
chase a Ford engine to interest the boys, although all grada- 
tions of IQ’s are fascinated by the latter. 
While the dull normal child does not generalize easily, this 
does not mean that he cannot generalize at all. It has been 
fairly well established by psychological science that the ability 
to understand abstract principles begins with the twelve-year- 
old intelligence. The dull normal child goes beyond this 
point in his development, but reaches it later. He has not 
the same facility to learn through symbols and from the 
printed page. Once the school has condescended to teach 
him by experience, he can be given a genuine understanding 
of all that he is supposed to learn. A project, like that, for 
instance, of running a lunch-room, can be made to motivate 
the work of the standard curriculum throughout the year. 
Geography, arithmetic, and English composition take on a
-P-A-G-E-205
    THE DULL NORMAL BOY eh 
new aspect for the 7A grade boy when they are a part of run- 
ning a little business or some other boyish project equally 
concrete. If, however, the school has no equipment and no 
imagination to provide these concrete projects, there will 
surely be truants, delinquents, and social problems of all sorts 
to be adjusted outside the school. This is why it may besaid 
with perfect truth that our schools make children bad. 
The ancient reasons for truancy were the swimming-hole and 
the fishing-pond. The modern city has but slightly altered 
these attractions; pigeon-flying becomes the competitor of 
arithmetic for the boys’ interest. It is the wise school which 
takes stock of the errant pupils’ habits and diversions. At 
Public School 64, we instituted a pigeon-fly in the animal- 
room. The breeding of: carrier-pigeons was an enterprise 
which outranked the ordinary pigeon brood of the tenement 
housetops. There even came a day when the school pigeons 
were carried in a patriotic parade and released in front of the 
public library to find their way back to their home. The 
thrill of the event was not felt alone by the boys’ class, which 
welcomed them back in the. animal-room the next morning, 
but by the whole school as well. 
If it comes about that the boys are playing truant to go 
a-fishing, then the school might do worse than to set up a 
fishpond alongside of the unabridged dictionary. As we have 
already said, truancy was not a desperate problem in our 
school. But whenever we found a truant on our hands, and 
these appeared most frequently among the dull normal group, 
we attacked the problem individually and pragmatically. 
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TEACHER 
The dull over-age boy is so frequently a center of disciplin- 
ary problems, that there is a tendency to place him under a 
man teacher, The common assumption is that these boys  
-P-A-G-E-206
178 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
need a strong arm, an iron fist. In this connection, it should 
be remembered that the overgrown, unsuccessful schoolboy 
is almost invariably on extremely bad terms with his father. 
This probably means that coercive discipline is not new to 
him. The school has doubtless increased his familiarity with 
firm methods, and strengthened his resistance and defenses, 
whatever these may be. Much of this coercion may have 
been exerted by parent and school in an attempt to force the 
boy to do things actually beyond his capacity. In such 
cases, a continuance of the method is obviously worse than 
futile. A severe man as teacher may mean, to the rebellious 
boy, just another father to be resisted. 
The dull normal boy is very likely to linger in the elementary 
school until his beard has begun to grow. In a short time, 
he will go forth to work. He has before him, probably, a 
lifetime of adjustment to one “‘boss” or another, for his abili- 
ties are not commensurate with a career of independent and 
self-directing endeavor. It is highly important that during 
his last years in school he should not build up quarrelsome 
and recalcitrant habits of relationship with his teacher, for 
later he is likely to carry over this attitude to his job. A 
man teacher whom he can admire for his athletic prowess 
or skill in shop work has the best influences on him both then 
and later. Sheer authority is a poor thing to invoke; tact 
and Salvation Army methods are usually worth more than 
regimental discipline. 
The boy who is at odds with his father, on the other hand, 
often has his mother on his side. There were women teachers 
in our school, middle-aged and maternal, who had excellent 
success in keeping these boys busy and interested. Children 
should have, of course, both men and women teachers, and 
should be prevented by every possible means from forming 
habits of enmity towards their school teachers of both sexes.
-P-A-G-E-207
THE DULL NORMAL BOY 179 
For all that we have said about the dull normal boy shows 
that this is his greatest danger — that he shall learn, in the 
words of a well-known prison expert, ‘‘to fear and hate his 
teacher because she does not have the same smile for him as 
for the boy who knows his lesson.” * i 
Much of this kind of boyish unhappiness, which leads to 
lawlessness, can be prevented if the teacher knows more about 
the actual capacities of the boy, and in addition realizes that 
no child can turn out to be a moral success if he is made to feel 
himself a mental failure at every stage of his school career.

  CHAPTER IX 
Tue Neurotic CHILD 
Perhaps the most distinctive aspect of the school experi- 
ment was the formation of special classes for neurotic children. 
Had we been deterred by the difficulty of the questions which 
challenged us in regard to these elusive and baffling individuals, 
we should not even yet have reached the point of making a 
beginning. Such questions as, What are neurotic children ? 
How do you detect them? and, What can you do for them? can 
so far only be answered on an empirical basis. 
We had, to encourage us, the precedent of the feeble-minded, 
who had been recognized, segregated, and educated for many 
years before any adequate objective method of diagnosis was 
invented. We knew that the neurotic adult did not become 
so overnight, but as the result of a warped development be- 
ginning during childhood. We also knew that neurotic adults 
are unhappy themselves and a source of unhappiness to others ; 
that they have a tendency to become dependents if not de- 
linquents; and that they are a source of emotional as well as 
economic waste. It scarcely seems necessary to apologize 
for an honest effort to prevent them, nor yet for methods 
used, so far as they were vindicated by results. 
We do not minimize the value of the ambulance and fire- 
engine because they serve only a small percentage of the 
population. In the same way, the seriousness of the plight 
of these children must not be underestimated because their 
proportion is small. The exigency of the problem faced by 
the educator in connection with these children is such that 
180
-P-A-G-E-209
  THE NEUROTIC CHILD 181 
he cannot afford to take a neutral attitude while waiting for 
scientific research to produce adequate objective tests for the 
neurotic person. Our own attempts to help them we consider 
belated rather than premature. 
WHAT IS A NEUROTIC CHILD 
Although we have not undertaken to formulate an academic 
definition of the neurotic child, the school was acutely con- 
scious of his presence. For practical purposes we have 
described these as children who, for some reason other than 
intelligence, do not get on in the group to which they belong 
by reason of their intellectual endowment. Gradually, it 
became apparent that there was something common in the 
behavior of these very dissimilar individuals, which caused 
us to regard them asa group. Every school teacher is puzzled 
by the occasional child who is always out of focus in his class, 
who is persistently too far in the foreground or too far in the 
background. The background or ‘“‘mousie” type of child is 
frequently overlooked in schools because, while he is young 
and often later in life, he alone is the sufferer. Yet this quiet, 
withdrawing youngster, who connects very little with his 
more boisterous playfellows, may be especially in need of 
understanding treatment. The foreground child who is a 
“pest” is frequently allowed to strengthen his undesirable 
habits during his first years in school because the teacher is 
too proud to complain of a seven- or eight-year-old pupil. 
She feels that, unmanageable as he is, she must somehow 
manage him; but any first-aid method that she may happen 
to devise to keep the peace is not always either therapeutic 
or educational. 
There is a growing recognition in the schools of the fact 
that a child who is constantly in conflict with his teachers is 
in need of treatment rather than of punishment. Dr. Con-
-P-A-G-E-210
    182 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
stance Long, medical officer of the London County Council 
Schools, says, ‘The child whose hand is persistently against 
his teacher’s is so as a result of neurosis, or fear, or misunder- 
standing. . .. Teachers will have to become wise enough 
to realize that there is a psychic conflict at the back of per- 
sistent naughtiness.” + Likewise, teachers will have to realize 
that the child who fails to be troublesome because he is per- 
sistently silent and inaccessible is probably also the victim 
of a psychic conflict. The child who is only ‘seen and not 
heard,” who only “speaks when he is spoken to”’ and often not 
even then, is not in a healthy mental condition. His malady 
needs to be recognized and ameliorated, for such extreme 
docility, however it may be idealized by the proverbs, is no 
more desirable from an educational point of view than the 
incorrigible naughtiness of his brother. | 
Neurotic children, then, may manifest very different pro- 
pensities, having almost opposite habits of behavior, perhaps, 
but having this in common — they overdo their dispositional 
tendencies. The children in the neurotic class were described 
by their teacher as predominantly loquacious, pugnacious, 
super-sensitive, self-conscious, excitable, taciturn, stubborn, 
suspicious. All these traits are found in other children of 
school age, but in the highly emotional type they are much 
exaggerated. The children in this class show a great lack of 
confidence in the performance of their work. It is very 
difficult for them to adjust themselves to any new situation 
no matter how slight the change may be. Their powers of 
concentration are limited, which is probably due to their 
high-strung emotional state. The neurotic child is constantly 
and unconsciously pleading for love and attention, very often 
1 Long, Constance, M.D. “Fear and Fantasy in the Child and the Au- 
thority Complex,” from Proceedings of the International Conference of Women 
Physicians. Volume III, page 138.
-P-A-G-E-211
  
THE NEUROTIC CHILD 183 
using illegitimate means to obtain his ends. He is retarded 
in his emotional development as the feeble-minded child is 
retarded in his intellectual development. The child who goes 
wrong, according to H. H. Goddard, is likely to belong to one 
of these types: he does so either because he does not know 
any better or because he cannot help it. The child whom we 
call neurotic is the child who cannot help it. 
A satisfactory definition of neurosis, as well as objective 
tests for the condition, still remains to be achieved. What- 
ever the origin may be, the neurotic tendencies of a child 
usually appear in his family relationships, and are continued 
onward through school and later life in a progressive series 
of inadequate social adjustments. To help the child who has 
trouble with his social relationships is surely as necessary as 
to aid him with his multiplication tables. 
We did not try to distinguish between the neurotic child 
and the psychopathic child in making up the class. Both 
of them are given to similar excesses of behavior, and from 
the school point of view, present similar problems. The 
psychopathic child can be helped and protected, the neurotic 
child should be able to be cured. To distinguish between 
them is extremely difficult if not impossible by any clinical 
method. The facts of heredity are elusive. Families do not 
easily recognize eccentric traits among themselves; they 
get used to peculiarities of behavior and are not aware how 
unusual or extreme such oddities may be. The psychiatrist 
often finds vague and undependable the facts of heredity 
which he is able to secure. For this reason, and because they 
need similar individual treatment in small classes, we made no 
effort to draw a line between the psychopathic and neurotic 
child at the beginning. Given the right treatment, the 
neurotic child naturally in time shows greater improvement 
and is more amenable to the lessons of experience.
-P-A-G-E-212
184 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
At the end of the second year we felt that the teachers’ 
records and continued knowledge of the child’s progress, not 
merely in lessons but also in behavior, gave us material 
which we could offer to a'psychiatrist as an aid to differ- 
entiation between the two types. In addition to the 
school history, the continued interest of a visiting teacher 
trained in taking notes on family histories provided a much 
fuller knowledge not only of hereditary trends but of actual 
character tendencies in members of the patient’s present 
household. 
We were fortunate in having the services of a psychiatrist! 
two mornings every week. The child who stood out as a 
stubborn misfit in his group was examined by the psychiatrist, 
who made the final judgment as to whether he should enter 
the neurotic class and whether he was ready to leave it. The 
psychiatrist also made suggestions about the curriculum and 
out-of-school activities. His conferences with the parents 
were invaluable, for the suggestions of a physician ordinarily 
carry great weight within the home. In every case the child 
who entered the neurotic class henceforth received individual 
treatment. 
Once a school has been classified by intelligence tests, it 
becomes easily possible to single out the children whose diffi- 
culties arise from some other cause than intellectual back- 
wardness. There still remain a few, possibly one child in 
every three or four classes, who seem to defy the psychological 
group in which they have been placed. Those who definitely 
fail to keep up with the rest of the class in the usual school 
subjects or who are still outstandingly antisocial, immediately 
come to the fore and demand attention. 
1 Dr. George M. Parker has worked for three years in Public School 64 on 
the problem of the neurotic child and the light this problem sheds on similar 
trends in normal children.  
-P-A-G-E-213
  
THE NEUROTIC CHILD 185 
We have spoken of the way in which the dull normal child 
becomes antisocial through long-continued academic failure. 
Regarded superficially, the neurotic child often makes the 
same impression as the dull normal or the mental defective. 
But when he is sent to the ungraded clinic, he is returned to 
the school with a diagnosis of normal intelligence. The 
teacher still remains unconvinced. “If ever there was a 
mental defective, it’s that boy. He can’t sit still; he twitches 
all the time; he never attends.’’ This child can only be dif- 
ferentiated from the others whose obstacles are of an intellec- 
tual nature when the psychological classification has been 
uniformly carried out. This also answers the query some- 
times put by visitors: Why doesn’t the neurotic child occur 
in other schools? We assume that he does and in about the 
same proportion as in ours. When so many children of so 
many varying degrees of intelligence are present in the same 
class, however, so many of them react in the wrong way that 
the causes are confused and undistinguishable. One of the 
great advantages of the psychological classification is that it 
throws into relief other deviations less clearly understood, 
and compels the educator to strive for a better under- 
standing of the difficulties which arise from handicaps of 
personality as well as those which result from deficiencies 
of intelligence. 
NORMAL INTELLIGENCE OF THE NEUROTIC CLASS 
In selecting the children for the neurotic class, we included 
only those who were at least of average intelligence. Still, 
they were social misfits or academic laggards. This is, at 
best, only a rough method of testing, for the background type 
of child may temporarily maintain a fair academic record and 
still suffer from a degree of emotional disturbance which 
silently and poignantly appeals for relief. The child who, 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  186 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
instead of merely making himself uncomfortable, makes the 
school uncomfortable by his failure in lessons or conduct, 
will naturally receive the first’ attention of the rescue squad. 
In a large school especially, this will inevitably be the 
case. But once the problem of the neurotic child has been 
specifically recognized by the school, the necessity of meeting 
it in all its different and more subtle aspects will also be 
eventually appreciated. The ultimate benefit should accrue 
to the far greater number of normal children who are now 
brought up on a school curriculum which is addressed to 
disembodied intellects regardless of their emotional or in- 
stinctive life. 
The important thing is that a beginning should be made to 
meet a condition which was aptly described by one of the 
speakers at the International Conference of Women Physi- 
cians in 1919. “There is one last agency for the salvation of 
the neurotic girl (and boy), still to be considered. It is the 
most important and the most unprepared for the task of any, 
except the home. The school reaches practically every child, 
and does its part in deepening or lessening the neurotic tend- 
encies. At present we are safe in assuming that for the most 
part it deepens these tendencies. It drives the neurotic 
child into truancy, vagrancy, anarchy, invalidism, and every 
form of delinquency, or hardens its emotional reactions into 
permanent moods, and it does all of this without in the least 
being aware of it.... If our public schools really educated, 
if they understood that education involves a training of the 
instinctive and emotional life as well as of the intellect, if 
they saw that they could not even develop intellect as long 
as they ignore desire, we should have an agency for adjusting 
the neurotic girl and boy second only to the home in its power. 
There is proof for this statement. Enlightenment is coming 
into education in spots. There are visiting teachers who
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE NEUROTIC CHILD 187 
work on the problem children in a school and get wonderful 
results. There are experimental schools whose methods are 
based on an understanding of the new psychology as it applies 
to educational theory. These schools are able to deal with 
the able but neurotic child who cannot get along in the public 
school.... They are not set like adults, and a little under- 
standing, a little insight and patience, a mere approach to 
real educational methods gives immediate results that are 
almost like magic.” ? 
In forming the neurotic class, we wished to differentiate 
between the distinctly neurotic type and the mental defective. 
This was all the more essential because the children were 
chosen for the class partially on the basis of poor school prog- 
ress. Little is known as yet about the frequency of occurrence 
of neuroses along the curve of distribution of intelligence. 
But it seemed desirable to limit the class to children of normal 
intelligence in order to escape confusion of the problem and 
also to secure that homogeneity of ability which had come to 
be the accepted policy of the school. Children with IQ’s of 
go or above were selected, the actual range extending up to 
120. A few exceptions were made in the case of children 
whose IQ’s fell below 90, on the supposition that their rating 
might improve on a second test, since there seems reason to 
believe that there is more variability in the IQ of the neurotic 
child than in that of others. 
INDICATIONS OF THE NEUROTIC TYPE 
An indication though not a test of this type of child is seen 
in his peculiar reaction to the intelligence test. His temper- 
amental instability comes through in two ways: he is likely 
(1) to make a scattering test, and (2) to change his total 
rating on a re-test. 
1 Taft, Jessie. ‘‘The Neurotic Child,” from Proceedings of the International 
Conference of Women Physicians. Volume III, page 161.  
-P-A-G-E-216
  188 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
By a scattering test is meant that his accurate perform- 
ances, instead of grouping themselves around the norm for 
his age, are distributed through a series of years. If a child 
has an IQ of 100, it ordinarily means that he can do most 
of the tests for the year in which he actually is, probably all 
of those for the year before, and some of those for the year 
after. The neurotic child who has the same IQ may, never- 
theless, make a very different picture on his test paper. He 
is more apt than not to fail on tests for an age several years 
below his own, and pass on others above his years, giving him 
in the total estimate the same IQ as the other child, but show- 
ing a lack of reliability and self-confidence in his intellectual 
performances which is characteristic of his unstable and ir- 
resolute behavior in the classroom and outside. 
When this tendency is sufficiently pronounced, it becomes 
a fairly valid mark of the neurotic individual. A test, which 
is an extreme example of this, gave the following capricious 
record of responses. The boy was 9 years and 6 months old 
at the time of the test but it was necessary to go all the way 
back to the fourth year before he could answer all questions. 
In the fifth year, he failed on one test; in the sixth, on two 
tests (one of them made up of common sense questions) ; in 
the seventh, on three tests; in the eighth, on three again; 
in the ninth year, on two tests; in the tenth and eleventh 
years, on most of them; in the twelfth year, he could repeat 
the digits backward and could do the same in the average 
adult test and the superior adult test. Owing to this special 
ability, his IQ came up to 86, while his failure on all the com- 
mon sense questions above the fourth year left him open to 
the suspicion of being a mental defective. On the basis of 
the test alone, we do not know whether he is a mental defec- 
tive with a special ability, or whether he is an extremely 
neurotic individual. Let us point out that a test paper which
-P-A-G-E-217
   THE NEUROTIC CHILD 189 
scatters to this extent indicates unfailingly the presence of a 
problem in the child. Those who are not familiar with psy- 
chological testing will scarcely appreciate how rare is this 
erratic type of response and how indicative it therefore comes 
to be. 
Another manifestation of instability is found in the way 
the neurotic child inclines to deviation in a second test. In 
a former chapter, the correlation between first and second 
tests has been discussed, showing the high degree of corre- 
spondence which ordinarily exists. It was there suggested 
(Chapter V, page 104) that the high correlation found, that is, 
.98, may have been partly influenced by the absence of the 
neurotic classes from the group re-tested. The re-testing 
of the neurotic classes was subsequently carried out in order 
to make a special study of their tendencies in this respect. 
Table XXII shows the variation between first and second tests 
in a group of thirty neurotic children. 
By referring to Chapter V, pages 100-101, we find the varia- 
tions in 322 comparisons to be as follows: 9.6 per cent gave 
the same IQ; 48.9 per cent varied within three points above 
or below; 76.5 per cent within six points above or below; 
and go. per cent within nine points above or below. Al- 
though the group of neurotic children re-tested is small, the 
variations have been measured in percentages in order to 
compare them with the larger group. In the neurotic group, 
3-3 per cent gave the same IQ as against 9.6 per cent in the 
normal group; 26.6 per cent varied within three points above 
or below as against 48.9 per cent in the normal group; 46.6 
per cent varied within six points above or below as against 
76.5 per cent in the normals; and 53.3 per cent within nine 
points above or below as against 90.1 per cent in the normal 
group. 
In the larger and normal group, almost half of the children

did not change their IQ more than three points; in the smaller 
and definitely neurotic group, almost as large a proportion, 
that is, almost half, changed their IQ’s as much as 10 points 
or more. In other words, the child who changes his intelli- 
gence rating more than ten points when re-tested is an unusual 
child, as has been said before, and this inequality of perform- 
ance may be due to an instability in the subject which is not 
momentary but habitual and will respond only to prolonged 
educational treatment. 
An attempt was made to formulate a psycho-neurotic ques- 
tionnaire for school children based on the questionnaire ar- 
ranged by Prof. Robert C. Woodworth for use in the army. 
A group of psychologists working with this problem among 
school children made the adaptation here reproduced.

  194 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
While this questionnaire has not proved successful for group 
use, as was the one devised for adults, it has, however, formed 
a practical basis for individual interviews. It is as suggestive 
as anything we have at the present time for this purpose.! 
SPECIAL DISABILITIES AND TALENTS 
Closely related to the neurotic child from the point of view 
of school organization, is the child with a special disability. 
His failure in some special study, such as arithmetic or reading, 
does not accord with his standard of performance in all other 
kinds of work. Thus far no clarifying theory for the special 
disability case has been advanced. We only know that it is 
rare and that it defies the psychological principle set forth in a 
previous chapter, i.c., that the great majority of children tend 
to maintain a fairly even level of school achievement in ac- 
cordance with their intelligence quotient. Whatever may be 
the cause of this special handicap, it is invariably associated 
with a loss of self-confidence and weighted by a burden of 
sensitiveness, which distorts the character of the child and 
assimilates him to the neurotic type as a school problem. 
Only individual methods will avail, and even with these, it 
is extremely difficult to ameliorate the handicap of a special 
disability. 
One of the first children to be placed in the neurotic class 
was Peter Jawork, a boy with a special disability in reading. 
He was then nearly twelve years old and had attracted at- 
tention for several years as a peculiar ‘“‘scholarship” case. 
Far from being a problem in social adjustment, he was quite 
the reverse, showing a good sense of responsibility and con- 
siderable ability in carrying out the practical affairs of life. 
1 The standardization of this questionnaire and the formulation of norms 
was made the subject of a dissertation by Ellen Mathews, Columbia University, 
entitled, A Study of Emotional Instability in Children by Means of a Question- 
naire.
-P-A-G-E-223
ar a oe ee ne eS ee ne 
THE NEUROTIC CHILD 195 
His rating according to the psychological test was 90; yet 
he had never been able to learn to read. He had been tutored 
in reading by two teachers who were experts in teaching the 
subject to beginners; he had been tried in the ungraded de- 
partment in order to benefit by smaller classes and better 
methods; and he had received the attention for a time of 
specialists in Teachers College, who had tried to discover his 
academic stumblingblock. In the fall of 1919, Peter was placed 
in the neurotic class, where he could receive individual in- 
struction, without contact with defective associates, and where 
he could be under the observation of the psychiatrist. 
At the age of eleven, Peter had worked up a strong sense 
of inferiority over his lack of academic attainment and was 
beset by fear of failure regarding any new endeavor that 
might prove difficult. He also suffered from physical fears. 
When his class was attending a dental clinic, Peter could 
not bring himself to sit in the chair, although he was acutely 
humiliated by his own inability to brave what the younger 
boys could. At another time, when several of the children 
were taking some medicine tablets, Peter could not force him- 
self to swallow one of them. When urged, he would grow 
pale, cover his face with his hands, and quake. After two 
years in the neurotic class, he had made but little progress in 
reading, but his general state of mind showed decided improve- 
ment. The depression in which we first found him was no 
longer characteristic, a very important fact, for the moods 
which had grown up around his failure in reading threatened 
his future more sternly than did his academic deficiency alone. 
To a teacher who was directing him with unnecessary detail 
how to do some simple errand, he replied with dignity and 
absolute truth, “I’m not stupid, though I can’t read.” 
Like the special disability of one child, the special talent of 
another proceeds from we know not what cause. The belief
-P-A-G-E-224
  196 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
has been advanced that the development of a special talent 
is due to heightened interest and is a matter of the affective 
life rather than intellectual ability alone. If this is the case, 
the origin of the special disability would logically be found 
in the same region of the personality. The emotional trends 
may depress or accentuate some particular activity until the 
individual seems stupid to the point of feeble-mindedness or 
else gifted to the point of genius in that one direction. 
In Aaron Steinfeld the problem of a special ability was ex- 
emplified. Even before this child came to school, at the age 
of six, he had achieved considerable notoriety as a prodigy. 
He was able to perform remarkable feats in mental addition 
with the accuracy of an adding machine. When a series 
of eight or nine numbers with five or six digits each was read 
to him, he replied after a moment’s reflection with the correct 
total. The one concession required by his immaturity was 
that the numbers should be concrete numbers; he preferred 
adding nuts or apples or marbles to adding pure abstractions. 
His performances would have been extraordinary at any age; 
at the age of six they had brought him far more publicity 
than was good for him. While he had been stage-managed 
by a proud father before audiences of neighbors, reporters, 
and teachers, he was morbidly shy and solitary in his school 
class. : 
When he was tested, at the age of six, he showed normal 
ability up to his age and above that very scattering ability 
up to twice his age. His computed IQ was 120, but this 
designated a very irregular superiority. He was placed in 
a Terman group of bright children. Here his class work was 
scarcely up to average and his social adjustments were ex- 
cessively poor, as was to be expected of a child who had been 
treated at home partly as a baby and partly asa prodigy. His 
mother was dead and his home-training, conducted by a
-P-A-G-E-225
  THE NEUROTIC CHILD 197 
father and three much older. brothers, had consisted of early 
neglect, which, after the discovery of his special ability, had 
turned to over-valuation. As the child had evidently a neu- 
rotic bent, the school refused to allow his special gift to be ex- 
ploited further for the entertainment of grown-ups. The 
father, however, interpreted this as a failure of appreciation, 
and after two years withdrew the boy from the school. 
Aaron’s failure in school was especially in relation to his 
classmates; his teacher had little complaint to make of him. 
His reaction to this failure was to withdraw himself still fur- 
ther from the group. Had he been the opposite type of child, 
he might even have found pleasure in the exhibition of his 
special gift. The desire to be conspicuous, however, resided 
in his father and not in him. In such a combination of cir- 
cumstances appears a typical neurosis-forming situation. The 
attempt on the part of a parent to force a child to realize his 
own unfulfilled ambitions is a far from infrequent cause of 
neurotic conflict. The boy’s remoteness from his classmates 
was complacently accepted by his father as a.mark of supe- 
riority rather than as a danger signal of possible shipwreck. 
FORMATION OF THE FIRST NEUROTIC CLASSES 
Knowing that the ungraded department was open to ex- 
perimental methods and that it also offered the advantages of 
small classes and good teachers, we asked for sanction to try 
the first neurotic class under its protection. At first one class 
was formed and later two, with about fifteen children in each. 
All were under twelve years of age and below the sixth grade. 
In two respects, the first neurotic classes differed from the 
early experimental classes for mental defectives: they were 
younger in age and less extreme in type. 
The first class consisted of children from 1A to 3B. In 
spite of a normal intellectual equipment, they did not seem 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
    198 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
able to gain skill in number work or reading, or else they were 
so restless and difficult that they interfered with the work of 
the regular class. Several of them were “disciplinary” cases 
for whom the teacher made excuses, saying that the child 
was not malicious or willfully disobedient, but that there was 
something wrong with him which he could not control. 
Through the work of the visiting teacher and the consulta- 
tions of the psychiatrist, codperation with the home was 
maintained. Since the children were problems at home as 
well as at school, the parents were usually ready to welcome 
the assistance which was offered them. After the class had 
been in existence two years, the second class was formed in 
order that the class could be grouped according to age. 
The first neurotic class has been in operation for three 
years. Twenty-two children have received instruction at 
different times since its organization. All pupils remained 
in the group for at least one year, and some have remained 
for the entire three years. The following is a statement of 
the length of time spent by these twenty-two boys in the 
class :

The twelve boys who returned to the regular grades were 
replaced just where they would have been if they had never 
left the regular class. Of the five who still remained after 
three years, four gave little promise of ever adjusting them- 
selves to the conditions that must exist in the average class- 
room. This presumably psychopathic group is a burden 
which every school and community is obliged to carry in one 
way or another. .
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE NEUROTIC CHILD 199 
A good test of whether the boy is prepared to return to 
the regular class is whether he wishes to go back. And then, 
when he feels prepared to brave the rougher elements of the 
normal group, some care should be taken in the selection of a 
teacher. An over-strict or over-critical teacher may drive 
him to resort to his infantile and maladjusted habits. The 
sensitivity of which he is a victim cannot be overcome at a 
single bound; the school must use whatever means it may 
have at hand to arrange that his progress shall be made by 
steps. It is easy for a conventional and over-conscientious 
teacher to lay too much stress on word-of-honor methods and 
moral heroics, thus helping the child toward failure when he 
should be tactfully helped toward success. 
The neurotic classes were given rooms to themselves with 
special equipment, consisting of the free furniture now stand- 
ardized in the ungraded department. The teacher was 
allowed the greatest freedom in the course of study, methods 
of teaching, and program. The physical care of the children 
was emphasized. Rest chairs, which were made especially 
for these classes in the school shops, stood in the back of the 
room and the children were allowed to retire to them at any 
time. They were carefully examined for physical defects, 
and, through the codperation of the hospitals, and.with the 
consent of the parents, medical and surgical treatment was 
procured for them. 
While it did not appear that physical ill-health was the 
source of their neurotic condition, a certain lack of physical 
tone seemed to be associated with it. Health periods were 
definitely provided for in the curriculum, and the children 
acquired considerable knowledge of the subject and wrote 
their own health readers. While it seemed profitable to 
direct their attention in general to hygienic living and matters 
of health, in a number of cases it was equally necessary to
-P-A-G-E-228
  200 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
direct the child’s attention away from the subject, because, as 
was to be expected, symptoms of hypochondria were not lack- 
ing in the group. 
COURSE OF STUDY 
In constructing the curriculum for these children, there 
was no precedent to be followed. This, if not a helpful fact, 
was at least not a hampering one. The program which had 
been evolved at the end of two years represents a practical 
combination of what we thought the children needed and what 
we were able to get for them. The following was the daily 
schedule of the class:

Every morning the class had a shower bath, and once a 
week a swimming period. The purpose was not so much the 
development of the habit of cleanliness, although this was a 
desirable by-product, as the general toning-up effect on the 
nervous system and the daily mood of the child. 
The psychological benefits derived from the freedom of 
this kind of exercise cannot be too greatly emphasized. One 
of the things that seemed important from the beginning was 
to restore to these children some part of their lost inheritance, 
their primitive contact with reality. Under the artificial 
conditions of East Side life, the most ordinary yet stimulating 
experiences of the country schoolboy, such as running against 
the wind, wading through a snow-drift, getting soaked through
-P-A-G-E-229
  THE NEUROTIC CHILD 201 
in a thunder storm, are practically unknown. The problem 
seemed to be how to replace for the over-phantastic person- 
ality of the neurotic child the simple and primitive experi- 
ences which make for healthy physical and mental integra- 
tion. The swimming pool seemed to be the only resource 
at hand to furnish this kind of tonic experience. Even the 
most hopeless day-dreamer must come back from the realm 
of phantasy while he keeps his head above water in the cold 
bath of the swimming pool. 
When children are feeble-minded, we have to adjust their 
lessons to the limitations of their mental abilities. Similarly, 
the teacher of the neurotic child must provide for him activi- 
ties which satisfy his instincts in some non-destructive way. 
The boy who walks along the palings and performs an ear- 
splitting rattle with a stick can be satisfied with rattling with 
a drum-stick, in time with other instruments. The boy who 
pushes others’ on the stairs can be given boxing gloves and 
sent to the mat with his equal. In the organized games and 
in the orchestra, the boys found a legitimate outlet for pro- 
pensities which might have taken a more destructive course in 
the regular scholastic classroom. Games took the place of for- 
mal gymnastic work, as it was felt that too much regimentation 
would defeat the purpose for which the class was formed. 
The neurotic adult has a tendency to be helpless with his 
hands, to be impotent in the face of any practical emergency. 
For this reason, handicrafts are often introduced in the treat- 
ment of neurosis as a stabilizing influence. While handwork 
has not the stinging exigency of a primitive experience, it is 
a good conductor of energy from the inside ego to the outside 
world. The lax posture and untoned muscles of many of 
these children indicate their unfamiliarity with the feeling of 
rugged physical fatigue. 
The class had two periods of Mandivonk a day. One hour
-P-A-G-E-230
  202 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
was devoted to bench work, and half an hour to drawing and 
free cutting. In the shop, the handling of tools and coping 
with accurate measurements gave a much-needed objectivity 
to thoughts and plans. The drawing and free cutting gave 
an opportunity for more creative flights. The use of colors 
was made a prominent part of the work. The gay paints 
.and crayons were materials for producing effects in an im- 
personal world. The exhibitionist child found here a new 
mode of making an impression which satisfied his insistent 
craving to be always in the limelight, while the retiring child 
was often lured out of himself through the congenial medium 
of color. You cannot force the phantastic child into purely 
realistic interests all at once. He must have half-way stations 
such as are provided by color, music, and dramatics. 
In the beginning it was a problem how to reconcile these 
children to even two hours of academic work. The scholastic 
subjects were associated with their former conflicts and an- 
tagonisms. They were the battlefield where their disposi- 
tions had been lost. Reading seemed to be the subject most 
dreaded by the class. The teacher soon discovered, however, 
that it was not the subject but its symbol, the book, at which 
the children shied. She therefore determined to teach read- 
ing without books. During walks in the neighborhood the 
children learned to read the signs on the windows and on 
passing wagons. In fact, anything outside of a book, such 
as notices in the school yard or the Boys’ Club, supplied the 
reading lesson of the day. Gradually they were re-introduced 
to books in small groups around the teacher’s knee, where 
they were not reminded of their former humiliations in reading 
before large groups of classmates. A class library, which at 
first had been utterly neglected, finally became quite popular, 
until at last they were able to read from the grade reader 
without self-consciousness.
-P-A-G-E-231
  
THE NEUROTIC CHILD 203 
Number-work was not the general stumblingblock that 
reading was, but it also had to be taught for the most part in 
an individual way. Mathematical games were invented in 
which the whole class could take part, and which furnished 
drill for them all in the fundamental processes. In the few 
cases where arithmetic happened to be the pons asinorum of 
the child, patient tutoring was carried on daily while the other 
children did practice work. 
Milton Sternberg was a boy who was gifted in the use of 
words and who, unlike most of his classmates, found easy 
rapport with the printed page, but his ennui in the arithmetic 
class was little less than morbid. In the Thorndike Visual 
Vocabulary Test he stood first in a class of forty bright boys. 
His general intelligence was indicated by an IQ of 110. He 
was a soft, downhearted looking child, docile, obedient, with- 
drawing. The only complaint which came from home and 
school was that Milton liked to play too well, and usually 
with younger children. It was hard to get teachers to pro- 
mote him in spite of his general excellence, because arithmetic 
is considered such an important subject. It was finally de- 
clared impossible, and Milton was placed in the second neu- 
rotic class. Here he was immediately recognized as the type 
of child that is “too good.” While he was carefully shielded 
in the matter of arithmetic and expertly tutored, he was 
pushed into the general rough current of competition with 
boys of his own age and encouraged to develop a little aggres- 
sion. A year of this combination brought him to the point 
where he was able to take his place in the regular grade. 
THE TEACHER OF NEUROTIC CHILDREN 
The selection of the teacher for the neurotic class is of pri- 
mary importance. No teacher who is chiefly interested in 
subject-matter or believes in rigid discipline will be contented 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
    204. FITTING.THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
or successful in handling a group of neurotic children. She 
must have a scientific attitude towards, or an intuitive ap- 
preciation of, the emotional necessities of human beings, 
neurotic or otherwise. The ailment of the neurotic child is 
directly connected with his affective life and only indirectly 
with his intellectual life. The teacher must understand that 
her task is to change suspicion into confidence, feeling into 
judgment, resentment into forgiveness — in other words, to 
accustom the child to flexible adjustments towards the or- 
dinary human relationships of life. She cannot herself be 
too proud to go more than half-way to win the trust of chil- 
dren in whom sensitivity and suspicion have grown to be a 
pathological habit. If she tends too much toward exclusive- 
ness in her own affections and is inclined to play favorites in 
any way, she is not adapted to the leadership of this kind of 
class. She must be willing to stoop to conquer and must be 
able to address her liking and her sympathy to many rather 
than few children at a time. 
These qualifications are not difficult to find. They are 
associated with a type of character which is fortunately not 
rare and hidden away, but frequent and wholly visible. Those 
who have the responsibility for the selection of teachers often 
speak of the personality of candidates, but the expression is 
usually applied in a vague and indefinite way. A more scien- 
tific appreciation of personality should make it possible to 
reduce the number of misfits in the teachers’ ranks as well as 
the number of misfits among the pupils. The important 
fact to be established is not so much that a teacher “has per- 
sonality” as that a teacher has a personality of one type or 
another and should be placed in the particular position where 
her particular type will exert a socializing influence on those 
about her. 
It is clear that the disciplinary problems in a neurotic 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  
THE NEUROTIC CHILD 205 
class cannot be handled in a conventional way. In fact, all 
stubborn cases of discipline in school should be looked upon 
as problems of mental hygiene. The boy who is sent to the 
principal’s office once or twice may be passed over in silence ; 
but the boy who is always in the principal’s office, always 
accused of some infraction of the rules, should be scrutinized 
and scientifically dealt with. No boy should be permitted 
to become a continuous disciplinary problem. One of the 
results of a neurotic class such as was undertaken in our school 
was that no boy was allowed to develop into a permanent 
case of discipline. If he showed a tendency in that. direction, 
he was gathered into the neurotic class, where life assumed 
at once a totally different aspect for him. The usual way of 
treating a child who misbehaves in school is to fence with 
him continually to prevent him from getting what he wants, 
without either the adult’s or the child’s knowing just what 
it is that he does want. Another kind of treatment in such 
a case is to try to find out what the child wants and give it 
to him for a time at least, to the end that he and all concerned 
may work together in the light and not at cross-purposes in 
the dark. The usual reason that he craves something inor- 
dinately and incessantly is that he has had too much of it 
or has had it too long, and then been suddenly deprived. 
Most children are able to adjust themselves to the successive 
weanings which life requires of them as they grow up; but 
with some children it is necessary to ameliorate the hard con- 
ditions of their sacrifices. 
The teacher of the neurotic class must be willing to aban- 
don a great many time-honored classroom methods. It is 
worse than useless to moralize with these children; they 
need to be led into wholesome activity and guided into health- 
ful behavior by friendly suggestions and with as little ethical 
theorizing as possible. Sheer authority meets the situation
-P-A-G-E-234
  206 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
only superficially. To shake a boy by the collar and tell him 
he has simply got to behave is folly. To mete out justice to 
him is frequently almost as useless. It is possible to punish 
a child justly but unwisely. The neurotic child does not 
present for the teacher the simple alternative of justice or 
mercy, but poses for her the much more difficult problem of 
what kind of treatment will improve his condition from the 
point of view of society. 
It is never an educational experience for a child to be hu- 
miliated. Adults hate it, and will go out of their way to any 
extent to prevent such a catastrophe. Yet children are often 
deliberately humiliated by conscientious teachers as a pun- 
ishment. Fear, like shame, paralyzes action, increases self- 
consciousness, and spreads itself over all sorts of unrelated 
things. These emotions lead to apathy, not to activity; 
they are destructive, not constructive; they are the source 
of morbid inferiority feelings which are in turn the source of 
antisocial conduct. ‘ 
SAVING THE NEUROTIC FROM DELINQUENCY 
Most of the people who commit crimes are children: some 
of them are intellectually immature and are called feeble- 
minded; still others come to grief through a backwardness 
of emotional development which is evidenced by childish and 
destructive behavior. Wherever life studies are made of the 
inmates of prisons, it appears over and over again that they 
did not get along well in school. They were insubordinate, 
idle, truant, etc. Few people make a career in life which is 
totally different from the careers they left behind them during 
their childhood progress through the elementary school. It 
would seem as if the school had the power, if it had the wisdom, 
largely to prevent the development of crime and criminals. 
The boy who has acquired the habit of adjustment in school
-P-A-G-E-235
  THE NEUROTIC. CHILD 207 
will not so easily exchange it for the habit of maladjustment 
in the outside world. Although this does not follow as the 
night the day, the logic is sufficiently established to form a 
hopeful basis for the prevention of delinquency. The school 
already knows too well the possible future of the boy who 
grows restless in the third grade, steals in the fourth grade, 
plays truant in the fifth grade, and becomes a general nui- 
sance in the sixth grade. It is naive to suppose that all that 
this boy needs is punishment and stringent discipline. He 
needs help, and help of the kind which springs not only from 
good will and kind intentions, although these too are neces- 
sary, but from scientific knowledge of human motives and 
behavior. 
One of the principal benefits of the neurotic class is the 
amount of light it sheds on the education of normal children. 
Just as we have been able to learn from the education of the 
mentally defective child how the intelligence of normal chil- 
dren develops, so we may hope to learn from neurotic children 
something about the emotional development of normal ones. 
The influences which make for elasticity and balance in this 
delicately adjusted department of life can no longer be min- 
imized. We have learned from the neurotic child to what 
a startling degree the emotional status of an individual con- 
ditions his intellectual functioning. Yet the school, through- 
out its history, has ignored the feeling life of the individual 
as something outside its province. The educator has always 
assumed that the child leaves his feelings at home with his 
comb and his toothbrush, and only brings to the classroom 
his brains and his books. The possibilities of educational 
effort in the field of the affective life are still unexplored. We 
know that the intelligence, however inaccurately it may at 
present be measured, is more or less limited and can be edu- 
cated only within these limits. Perhaps the great hope of
-P-A-G-E-236
  
  208 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
the future of education lies in the fact that, so far as we know, 
the emotional life of the individual may be infinitely educable. 
When the school at last admits the whole child to its keeping, 
education will on that day seriously begin. 
The following case studies will give the reader a picture of 
types of problems considered in the neurotic groups of Public 
School 64: 
CASE STUDIES! 
Isidor Eisen. Age 7 years, 2 months; IQ 98. 
Isidor was reported as seemingly below the mental level of 
his class and frequently absent from school with headache. 
He was in 2B, the proper grade for his age, and his rating by 
the Terman scale was normal. During his test the examiner 
had noticed his expression of heavy depression, and it was her 
questioning in regard to this that had elicited the teacher’s 
complaint. 
The visiting teacher then had a talk with Isidor, but very 
little could be got out of him. He was uncommunicative, 
though his face told much. He wore a depressed, care-worn 
expression which one does not connect with childhood. His 
face was oddly long and pasty pale, with mouth drawn down, 
big eyes that looked old with submission to fear or sadness, 
and forehead marked with deep horizontal lines. 
The home from which he came was far from cheery, but 
hardly wretched enough to produce such an effect. The 
father was a tailor in a small way and the mother spent most 
of her time helping her husband in the shop, which occupied 
the front room on the ground floor of their building, the 
family occupying the rear rooms. 
In this dark apartment lived the parents and four children, 
Mrs. Eisen was a comely woman, though very busy and tired.

THE NEUROTIC CHILD 209 
She said Isidor had always been a sensitive child, but had 
showed no marked symptoms of fear until after he went to 
school. He was very much disturbed by the noise and con- 
fusion of school life. Each day’s venture across the street 
to the schoolhouse was an effort. If he had been like some 
boys he would have taken matters into his own hands and 
“gone on the hook,” but she was thankful Izzie was a good 
boy and always did as he was told. But the fear to which he 
could not react in a natural manner in the daytime carried 
over into his nights, and he was constantly beset by dreams 
of bandits; even when awake he would hear mysterious noises 
which he interpreted as robbers coming down from the roof 
in pursuit of him. He used to run to his parents’ room; 
but later he grew ashamed of his cowardice and would slip 
quietly out of bed and crawl under it, careful not to awaken 
his brother, who would have been sure to laugh at him. 
This particular year he had a teacher who was a tense, high- 
strung person, and although Isidor himself was a quiet child 
and was never scolded, he identified himself with all the other 
little victims of her sharp scolding voice. At this time his 
night terrors were greatly augmented. Nearly every night 
he woke screaming with fright. 
After such nights, he came to school in a poor condition 
to concentrate upon his class work, and there was little wonder 
that he was reported as falling behind the class. He was 
entered in the neurotic class and his new teacher, understand- 
ing the conditions, expended more effort on making him 
happy than upon reading, writing, and arithmetic. Mean- 
time, through the doctor’s advice, the family had been 
induced to move into lighter, more airy quarters; and sun- 
shine at all the windows could hardly fail to make its con- 
tribution to the work the new teacher was doing. 
After two years in the neurotic class she felt that Isidor 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
    210 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
was fairly out of the woods; his work was normal and he was 
beginning to lose his expression of abiding gloom. He was 
therefore placed in a regular class, under the continued ob- 
servation of the visiting teacher and the psychologist. After 
a few weeks, he began to show signs of a return to his old 
condition, and it was found that the teacher, though able and 
well adapted to her work in general, had not grasped this 
boy’s particular problem. Her classroom manner, with its 
crisp exactness and sharp precision, recalled his old trouble. 
He was slipping back again rapidly, so the head of the depart- 
ment advised trying him with another teacher of the same 
grade before giving up hope of success. This time very care- 
ful selection was made with regard to temperament. He was 
placed with a young teacher whose habitual gentleness of 
manner and soft voice at once relieved the tension. A term 
with her reassured him and helped to stabilize his earlier im- 
provement. At the next promotion time it was thought 
best again to select Isidor’s teacher with special care. This 
time he was put in the charge of a young woman with more 
drive but with a big, easy humor which neutralized what might 
have been to him the more terrifying character of her class 
discipline. She was able to set him little by little upon less 
dependent feet. This, however, would have been difficult 
of accomplishment without the previous careful course of 
treatment. 
Today Isidor has no more fearful dreams of robbers and 
takes his place in school and class in a normal manner. Not 
long ago his teacher asked the visiting teacher to read some 
compositions her boys had written describing their Christmas 
vacations. Out of Izzie’s paper jumped the phrase, “and my 
heart was full of laughter.” It was a jolly little description 
of a holiday with his father, with technical errors, but freely 
expressed and full of buoyant spirits.
-P-A-G-E-239
  
THE NEUROTIC CHILD 2Ir 
Hyman Fox. Age 6 years, 4 months; IQ 104. 
Hyman was in the second grade when the visiting teacher 
first made his acquaintance. His teacher complained that 
he could not read as well as many of the 1A grade children, 
and seemed to make no progress in spite of the special effort 
she had expended upon him. The same complaints had come 
from previous teachers. He had no outstanding physical 
defects, and his vision was normal. These facts were as- 
certained through the school medical work. Then home 
visits were made. 
The standards of the home compared more than favorably 
with those of the neighborhood. The family occupied an 
old-fashioned “railroad” apartment in one of the important 
business streets, but the rooms were fairly large and were 
kept well aired. The housekeeping was immaculate. The 
father had been a liquor dealer, but foreseeing prohibition, 
had gone into the candy business recently. Apparently a 
well-adjusted individual in his environment, he was inclined 
to take Hyman’s school difficulties lightly, claiming that he 
had had a “hard time in school” himself till he was about 
twelve years old. The mother called herself a “weak woman” 
and very ‘“‘nervous,” and indeed, with her high narrow fore- 
head and much-lined delicate face, she did not present a pic- 
ture of stolidity. She evidently accepted semi-illness as the 
lot of woman, and perhaps the distinguishing mark of refine- 
ment. The eldest daughter, aged nineteen, was in good 
health and had made normal progress in school. She was 
now a stenographer making good wages. Another sister, 
sixteen years old, had a serious spinal curvature, which had 
caused her a great deal of pain and had made her attendance 
at school irregular and difficult. She was unusually bright 
and quick to learn, and had been able, in spite of her handicap, 
to maintain herself as a stenographer. The third sister, 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
    212 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
fourteen years old, had left school in 6B, after an illness with 
brain fever, which had left her unable to apply her attention 
to her school work. She confided to the visiting teacher that 
she felt she had never been a strong student, mathematics 
being her weak point; and, as her older sisters had done so 
well, she had felt discouraged and was glad to be released 
from the competition. She had been at home with her mother 
ever since, on the ground of ill health, though she appeared 
robust enough to the casual observer. 
Hyman was the baby, the only child, really, in a family of 
adult people, for even the fourteen-year-old sister was very 
mature and womanly. Further, he was the only boy, and 
added to that, the only blond, which in many Jewish families 
constitutes almost worshipful beauty. In addition to his 
own immediate family, already rather top-heavy with fem- 
inine adults, he was the object of special devotion of numer- 
ous aunts, all of whom had hung upon his first baby words 
and admired his growing ability, and all of whom had pre- 
dicted a brilliant school career. As a matter of fact, he was 
a very normally equipped child, with a good comprehension 
and an excellent memory. He was self-conscious and eager 
to receive at school the admiration to which he had been 
accustomed. He doubtless surprised even himself by the 
ease with which he began to read, and he had been reading 
with but few mistakes, for some little time, before his teacher 
discovered that it was pure memory work, a method which 
he had adopted in his eagerness to grasp the thing quickly 
and show up well. 
When she had made him understand the mistake, he was 
plunged into a very real despair. He had to attack anew this 
puzzling technique which he had supposed he had mastered 
so quickly, and he felt that he was hopelessly far behind the 
rest of the class. But he never admitted at home’ that he was
-P-A-G-E-241
  THE NEUROTIC CHILD 213 
having any difficulty. The family asked him often of his 
progress. Indeed he had the question hurled at him from 
all sides, from mother, sisters, aunts. He began to avoid 
the family. He was cozened and kissed and quizzed about 
how much he knew and how well he could read. But when- 
ever they got him at bay, of an evening when he could not 
wriggle away, and demanded his showing off his supposed 
prowess, he resorted to his old trick — memory reading. At 
last the sisters began to suspect that something was wrong, 
but he stoutly defended himself by asserting “that is the 
way the teacher says.” He came to hate the family atten- 
tions, because, instead of contributing to his self-esteem, it 
always emphasized his own sense of deficiency. He began to 
play much outside and to delight in picking up the explosive 
words and insulting epithets of the street. He was making 
a huge effort at self-assertion. He learned to fight, and fight 
violently, and came home from conquest with a swagger. 
He was given to using expressions whose meaning his mother 
did not know, but of which she recognized the import, and 
she chided him for “talking dirty” in the presence of his 
sisters. This only set him more aloof from the family. He 
felt that his success lay outside their standard and ken, and 
he became something of a bully with other children. 
In the classroom his life was even more difficult. His 
technique with the adult was an attitude of respect coupled 
with every sort of devious attempt to get his own way. The 
necessity of keeping up a front before the other boys created 
the conflict. He adopted habits of showing off, little tricks 
of lawlessness, while his fear of disapproval and censure was 
manifested in silly grins and a certain tendency to be sly. 
All the while, he never admitted his failure at school. He 
avoided the subject when he could, would never allow his 
sisters to help him with his lessons. If questioned, he stoutly 
 
-P-A-G-E-242
    214 FITTING THE SCHOOL a THE CHILD 
maintained that he was getting on all right. But his mother 
told the visiting teacher that during this period, she once 
heard him muttering in his sleep, “It ain’t so hard. It can’t 
be so hard. I ought to doit. Why can’t I do it?” 
Hyman was placed in the new class and his teacher was 
advised that at all hazards his confidence must be built up. 
He was assigned no reading for a time, and allowed to stress 
number work where he had a reasonable skill, and where he 
could rightly earn his normal share of approbation. Mean- 
time, as the class program included a maximum of gymnasium 
work and swimming, and also stressed the use of tools in the 
carpentry shop, he had plenty of opportunity to exhibit 
before the other boys his excellence in the more robust pur- 
suits of life. Little by little, he was tried out with reading, 
never long enough at a time for him to sense definite failure. 
By a one-step-at-a-time method the teacher was finally able 
to give him the technique without coming into direct combat 
with his resistances and fears. The visiting teacher, mean- 
time, kept up relations with the family and was successful 
to the extent of persuading them not to prod him on the sub- 
ject of his school work. After three years in the neurotic 
class, he did learn to read, not unshakably perhaps, but at 
least it was reading, not repeating by memory. 
Thinking to encourage Hyman, and also to make room for 
another needy applicant, his teacher then put him into a 
regular class. But some of the habits he had built upin self- 
defense had not been fully outgrown, and he did not get on 
well in the larger group. His tendency to “play smart” came 
to the fore; he annoyed the other boys and was unable to 
maintain any degree of concentration upon his work. It 
was finally decided that he had not attained sufficient balance 
to fit in with the larger group, and he was returned to the 
neurotic class, where he has again assumed a relatively nor-
-P-A-G-E-243
THE NEUROTIC CHILD 215 
mal, unaggressive réle. We look forward to a time, in this 
case, when the more normal outlook upon life, which he seems 
able to assume under the specially made environment of this 
class, may become more habitual with him. 
Joseph Schwarzkopf. Age 7 years, 3 month ; IQ 96. 
If Joseph was exasperating on account of his restlessness 
and his persistent truancy, he was also lovable. A draggled, 
unkempt little creature, whose face and hands were always 
dirty, whose shirt was never whole, whose stockings were al- 
ways down or coming down; still he had a certain manliness 
in the stubborn set of his shoulders and a pathos in the deli- 
cately featured face that made a strong appeal. The appeal 
was rather enhanced than otherwise by the fact that he had 
only one eye. 
Joseph had experienced a great nervous shock when, as a 
child of two, his mother had accidentally spilled boiling water 
on him, resulting in the loss of his eye. Perhaps it was too 
great a shock for his nerves to forget. At any rate he had a 
constant slight body tremor, much aggravated when under 
excitement. 
When Joseph was first brought to our attention as a prob- 
lem child, he was six years old and in the first grade. 
With his mental grading, he should have been able to keep 
up without losing a class so early in the school course. His 
truancy was, of course, partly responsible, but we felt that 
such persistent truancy in the lower primary grades was in 
itself unusual enough to bear investigation. It was found 
that vision in his one eye was normal, and his health good. 
Attention was then turned to the home. 
His father was a garment worker who received good wages 
when employed. His mother had died of tuberculosis a 
little over two years before, leaving six children, one older   
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  216 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
and four younger than the six-year-old Joseph. The help- 
less father had put them all in an orphanage until he could 
find them a new mother. When the new mother was es- 
tablished in the home, the family was reassembled. It was 
doubtless a hard transition, this return from institution life 
to a relatively much more complicated world, with a dominant 
new personality in the home instead of their own mother, 
' whom they were quite old enough to remember. 
Joseph was clumsy and blundering, with a clownish humor 
that endeared him to his contemporaries but made him trying 
to grown-ups. His stepmother found him so. 
She did not like him. She admitted it quite frankly to 
the visiting teacher, though she said she had made an honest 
effort to do so. Her standards on the material side of living 
were of a high type. She wanted a well-kept home and a 
group of nice-looking children of whom she could be proud 
when her friends called. It was hard enough to make Joseph 
look presentable with his one eye, even if he had shown any 
pride in his appearance ; but as it was, there was no use doing 
anything for him. He was a black sheep among the step- 
children. 
Was it any wonder, too, that Joseph was unhappy? Could 
he be a black sheep without feeling it? He was much away 
from home, often out all night, and of course absent from 
school at such times. He was living in a world of adventure, 
‘in which he was a bandit, an outlaw. Well, so he was, an 
outlaw in the family circle, and he was merely carrying the 
thing out a bit more completely in phantasy. 
The visiting teacher explained to the parents that Joseph 
could be better helped just now by a considerable show of 
affection than by threats and beatings, and made some con- 
crete suggestions in application of the theory. He was to 
have a new glass eye, the old one had grown too small. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-245
THE NEUROTIC CHILD 227 
was hard to make them realize that they ought to spend 
money for a glass eye every few months, when they had so 
many uses for money, and Joseph was such a bad child any- 
way. However, if they did not get the full force of the argu- 
ment, they began to regard Joseph’s misdemeanors somewhat 
in the light of a question to be met and studied. 
Meanwhile the visiting teacher had him enrolled in the 
neurotic class, passing on her information and recommenda- © 
tions to the teacher, who was asked to make Joseph feel use- 
ful, and cherished, and depended upon. 
In carrying out her part of the program the teacher dis- 
covered that he had a bent toward leadership which she 
turned to account, but it all took time, and Joseph had sev- 
eral falls from grace. There was one occasion, long after the 
teacher had begun to think of him as fairly on the safe road, 
when he took a younger boy with him on a wild adventure 
“out West,” and did not turn up all night or all the next day. 
When the culprits were found and returned home from Jersey 
City, which seemed like West of the setting sun to them, no 
very great stir was made. They settled down again in good 
spirits and did not repeat their travels. 
The summer after this adventure the visiting teacher asked 
Christodora House, the neighboring settlement, to take Joseph 
to their vacation camp. When he came back to school in 
the fall he looked brown and sturdy and bore himself with 
more assurance. His stepmother said the camp had done 
him good, and that he was better tempered and easier to live 
with at home. 
In time, naturally enough, the good effects of his outing 
wore off and the first bright feathers molted from his wings. 
His home relations, however, continued somewhat happier, 
and he attended school more regularly. His greatest difficulty 
came from his lack of self-confidence and his easy discourage-
-P-A-G-E-246
  
218 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
ment. Often he refused to try a difficult passage in reading 
or arithmetic, throwing his pencil on the floor in despair and 
disgust; but, after a chance to wrestle it out with himself, 
he would return to his work and be faithful for a time. 
Even now after more than three years in the special class, 
Joseph needs a personal, friendly contact with the teacher. 
His IQ has been gradually slipping down below the techni- 
cal horizon of normality. If this downward trend persists, 
he may finally be permitted to enjoy the advantages of an 
ungraded class. 
He is one of the two children in the neurotic group who, 
after fluctuations of the IQ, have definitely settled down 
toward an ungraded rating. A number of these children 
have, after several years of observation, turned out to be 
definitely psychopathic. Instances like these show the 
need of this type of class as a place of slow and careful diag- 
nosis.

CHAPTER X 
THE GIFTED CHILD 
The gifted child is usually the last one to be reached by any 
special aid that education may devise. He, at least, is re- 
garded as preéminently able to take care of himself. In any 
case, he can be trusted to surpass the average, and, while 
this may still denote personal and social waste, the loss is 
difficult to measure and therefore scarcely recognized. His 
accomplishment is compared, not with what it might have 
been, but with that of the average. Thus he is allowed to 
make a plus record for himself at the same time that he may 
possibly be more or less of a slacker. In fact, his superiority 
is sometimes looked upon by himself and others as a license 
to be lazy. 
It has been vaguely assumed that all the gifted people 
needed by society would somehow be born from time to time. 
But it is a comparatively recent idea that they exist in a meas- 
urable proportion and that their superiority is a measurable 
quantity. The curve of distribution which we owe to the 
researches of Quetelet, Galton, and Gauss, shows that the 
production of superior people is not a matter of accident, but 
follows a comprehensible law. If one or two per cent of the 
population are mentally subnormal, an equivalent per cent 
are correspondingly superior. According to the curve, the 
very bright children balance the stupid in number. 
The relative numbers of the feeble-minded in the popula- 
tion and the varying degrees of mental deficiency among them, 
219
-P-A-G-E-248
  220 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
have been scientifically studied by Seguin and his successors 
for more than half a century. A high degree of accuracy has 
been attained in the diagnosis of these lesser children who are 
destined never to outgrow the mentality of childhood. A 
similar degree of accuracy has been more recently developed 
in the means of measuring the superiority of precocious chil- 
dren who are destined to evolve the rare and over-topping 
intellects of their generation. The logic of the situation de- 
mands that the school shall take as much account of the gifted 
child as of the mental defective. The small superior minority 
is also entitled to special consideration in order that a rare 
endowment may be developed to its full maturity. While 
the imbecile must fulfill his destiny, it appears that the genius 
may fail to realize himself. The public school owes a special 
duty to both — protection to the defective and nurture to 
the gifted. 
We mean by the gifted child one who is highly endowed 
with what is called intelligence and who may be assumed to 
have the capacity for developing a high degree of skill or talent 
along any line in which his interest lies. Beyond this we do 
not assume that he has any specialized gift or genius. Among 
the children of superior intelligence, however, we may expect 
to find the geniuses of the world. The quality of intelligence 
is a prerequisite; yet intelligence alone does not make the 
genius. The creative spirit derives from regions of the per- 
sonality about which as yet we have only the beginnings of 
a scientific knowledge — the instinctive and affective life of 
the individual. We are not at all sure, in studying the gen- 
iuses of the world, that poise is essential to genius, although 
it is essential to happiness. At the same time we know that 
unhappiness leads to unproductiveness, that the lack of poise 
leads to sterility. The education of the gifted child should 
strive before all else to develop his many-sided abilities; to
-P-A-G-E-249
THE GIFTED CHILD 221 
preserve in him the quality of balance which is a part of his 
original endowment and which is all too often sacrificed to a 
purely intellectual training. 
THE FIRST CLASS OF GIFTED CHILDREN 
When the psychological test, which had at first been used 
in the selection of mental defectives for institutional treat- 
ment, was taken over into the public schools, the practical 
possibility of applying the test also in the selection of superior 
children began to be appreciated. The original Binet Scale, 
which gave no adequate measure for a mental age above 
eleven or twelve years, was invaluable for clinical use but 
had distinct limitations for the school psychologist who was 
interested in the whole range of intelligence among children 
of all ages. It was not until the publication of the Stanford 
Revision in 1916 that it became feasible to measure the in- 
telligence of very superior children. 
Between 1914 and 1916, we had collected information con- 
cerning a number of children whose intelligence was indicated, 
though undefined, by the old scale, as much surpassing the 
average. With the new scale as a tool, we set out in. Septem- 
ber, 1916, to measure these children definitely and to discover 
others of like superiority, to form an experimental class for 
gifted children. It soon became evident that to collect a large 
enough group for such an undertaking it was necessary to 
go even beyond the limits of our own school of three thousand 
pupils. As the result of an exploration which occupied several 
months, it was decided to form a class of twenty-five children 
whose ages ranged from nine to eleven, who were found in or 
near the fifth grade, and whose IQ’s reached 120 or above. 
The children thus assembled from three different schools 
were started as a class in the term beginning February, 1917. 
The make-up of this first class is shown in Table XXIII. It  
-P-A-G-E-250
  222 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
was unofficially called a Terman class although officially 
listed in the register as an opportunity class.

COEDUCATION OF SUPERIOR CHILDREN 
This first class of superior children, as well as all the later     ones, included both boys and girls. Although the experi- 
ment was initiated in a boys’ school, the innovation seemed 
justified from several points of view. In the first place, since 
the class was designed not merely to make book education 
more efficient but to further the social ad‘ustments of the 
children, we considered that coeducation was an essential 
part of a normal classroom atmosphere. In the second place, 
it is obvious that the inclusion of both sexes doubled the 
chances of finding superior children of like age without lower- 
ing the standard of excellence.
-P-A-G-E-251
  THE GIFTED CHILD : 223 
Had the class been limited to one sex or the other, we 
should have been obliged to make serious compromises. 
Either we should have had to draw the children from a wider 
geographical area covering more schools and requiring the 
children to travel long distances, which was not at all feasible ; 
or we should have been obliged to take children of differing 
ages and grades in order to find enough pupils of the required 
rating, which would have been ill-advised from the point of 
view of the unity of the group and presentation of subject- 
matter; or we should have had to lower definitely the stand- 
ard of superiority, making the requis te IQ perhaps as low 
as 110, which would have weakened the whole foundation of 
the experiment. Between the IQ’s of 110 and 120, there ex- 
ists a large group of excellent students, from whom, however, 
distinguished scholarship and achievement in higher education 
is not to be confidently expected. If any of these compro- 
mises had been unwittingly made at the beginning of the ex- 
periment, we know from experience that the integrity of the 
undertaking would have been greatly weakened. 
Finally, we felt that a class which purposed to offer better 
advantages than the usual public school class, should provide, 
from the beginning, to extend its benefits to both boys and 
girls. It has repeatedly happened in history, especially in 
the field of education, that opportunities open to men as a 
matter of course had to be fought for later by women as special 
privileges. We did not wish to be responsible for adding 
another such absurd discrimination to the pages of educa- 
tional history. 
Although the boys and girls who were placed in the Terman 
classes had not been accustomed to being associated together 
previously in the classroom, there was no evidence of self- 
consciousness among them in their adjustment to a new situa- 
tion. No attempt has ever been made to arouse a spirit of
-P-A-G-E-252
  224 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
tivalry between the boys and girls, but every effort has been di- 
rected toward the encouragement of coéperation between them. 
An easy social atmosphere has been naturally maintained. 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT 
As soon as the first Terman class was launched and under 
way, we became aware that unexpectedly soon we were going 
to lose it to the high school. During the first term of this 
class, the work of assembling a second one was begun with 
younger children. In September, 1917, a second Terman class 
was started. After this, with each succeeding September, a 
new class has been assembled from the first and second grades 
of our own and neighboring schools. The later classes were 
all formed on the model of the first one, consisting of twenty- 
five boys and girls about evenly divided. 
The department when completed included five different 
classes doing work from the second to the eighth grade. The 
school has graduated about a hundred Terman children into 
the high schools, and has a hundred and twenty-five children 
in the classes. The distribution of IQ’s of these children is 
shown in Table XXIV. 
The difficulties encountered in collecting these children 
from other schools were little short of ludicrous. While in 
the beginning principals were proud to produce their brightest 
stars to be tested, they soon became aware that they were 
losing from their schools children who would later do them 
credit. From this time on, no form of sabotage was too much 
trouble to keep us from finding the candidates for the Terman 
classes. In one instance, when it was announced that chil- 
dren were wanted from the third grade, the principal had the 
pupils whom she wished to hide transferred to another grade 
between the morning and the afternoon sessions. In other 
cases, after the candidates were tested and selected, the
-P-A-G-E-253
  THE GIFTED CHILD 225 
parents were dissuaded from allowing their children to be 
transferred. While these are extreme instances, many ex- 
cuses were invented to prevent bright children from leaving 
a school where already they were making a good record. 
Since we were officially authorized to find these children 
and the Terman classes were designed to give them special 
opportunities, it was possible, though with much effort, to fill 
the yearly quota.

* This total includes, besides the children in high school and in the five grades, 
21 children who have been in the classes and out again for various reasons. 
Any similar attempt to establish special classes for gifted 
children is likely to encounter similar obstructions to the 
progress of the plan. Until our supervisory officials, including 
principals and superintendents, develop a true professional 
attitude which prevents them from putting their own personal 
feelings ahead of the rights of children and parents, we cannot 
hope for any true educational regeneration. In a city school
-P-A-G-E-254
226 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
system it is especially difficult to carry out this method of 
grouping unless there is codperation among all the neighboring 
principals and superintendents. This does not mean that in 
some cases intelligent coéperation for the welfare of the child 
was not given. The adventitious difficulties, however, can- 
not be discounted, and must be practically reckoned with in 
planning such an experiment. 
The selection of children of superior intelligence in a school 
which has not yet been thoroughly classified must be based 
on probabilities, in order to avoid useless work. In the forma- 
tion of the Terman classes, the nucleus of each was derived 
from the topmost group of the classified grades. The other 
children were drawn from unclassified schools. The psy- 
chologist who goes into such a school to select candidates for 
testing, will save time by following the most significant in- 
dications. Among the older children, the task is simplified 
by the aid of the record card, which shows by a series of ex- 
cellent marks a continuously high level of performance. An- 
other indication to be taken seriously is any exhibition of 
special talent. Two of the boys chosen for the first Terman 
class were looked up because they had received prizes in large 
drawing competitions, and proved to have the IQ required 
for entrance. Among the young children, the eligible one 
is more elusive. When the teacher is asked for the brightest 
child in the class, it not infrequently happens that she replies 
by naming the oldest and the largest. This child is more 
mature in conduct, writes better perhaps, and does not fidget 
so much; consequently he makes an impression of superior 
ability by comparison with children whose mental age is the 
same as his but whose accompanying traits aré a year or so 
behind. The psychologist was surprised to find that the 
estimate of the other children was not an unreliable guide in 
the matter. ‘Who is the brightest girl in your class?” was  
-P-A-G-E-255
THE GIFTED CHILD 227 
a question which always received a prompt answer and one 
on which, as the work progressed, the psychologist came more 
and more to rely. In all, one hundred and fifty children were 
tested to form the first Terman class of twenty-five. With 
more experience, it was later possible to reduce considerably 
the number of actual tests necessary for the selection of 
the twenty-five. 
THE FAULTS OF RAPID ADVANCEMENT 
Recently, the city schools had established classes in the 
seventh year for bright pupils who were thought capable of 
doing three years’ work in two years. These children are 
expected to, and usually do, complete the seventh, eighth, 
and ninth years of the junior high school in two years. 
That is, there is an actual saving of one year during their 
swift transit through the junior high school. The other 
alternative and the time-honored one has been to ‘‘skip” 
the bright pupils. But this method, like that of the rapid 
advancement class, was usually introduced late in the child’s 
school career. It should be noted that the underlying 
principle of both was merely that of saving time and gain- 
ing speed. 
Such rapid transit schemes, although definite and spectacu- 
lar, are often detrimental to the children. They do not seem 
to take into account that some of the profit in traveling con- 
sists in viewing the scenery. The gain should be distributed 
throughout the child’s school life, with most of the rapid 
advancement occurring before the fifth grade. In the upper 
grades the content and subject-matter of the course are more 
important, for this is where the child’s' cultural equipment for 
the future is acquired. We believe also that there is a danger 
in rushing the children through the grades, be they ever so 
bright, so that they reach the high school prematurely, from 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  228 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
the point of view of their capacity to form social relationships. 
Parents and teachers are still too much concerned with in- 
tellect alone. They are still too apt to judge the success of 
child prodigies by the early age at which they reach any 
given point in their progress through school. Experience 
has abundantly shown that many of these “wonder children” 
have failed to become the leaders in creative achievement 
which their early records seemed to promise. 
PLAN OF THE TERMAN CLASS 
The plan of the Terman class was to avoid superficial de- 
vices and to deal as much as possible with the fundamental 
educational problem. It included the completion of eight 
years in six, but with the proviso that the child should make 
haste slowly from the second or third grades onward. The 
principal effort was directed toward the enrichment of the 
curriculum to the end that the pupils might acquire a broader 
appreciation of life’s values instead of scholastic skill alone. 
We feel that the all-round physical, mental, and character 
development of such children is the real criterion of success. 
We are firmly convinced that it is only defensible to expedite 
their progress through the grades, if such expedition is com- 
patible with the development of an all-round, well-balanced 
human being. There is a grave danger of allowing these 
children to become over-intellectualized by fixing attention 
on their academic progress alone. 
A small register was an essential feature of the experiment. 
Here again the rapid advancement class proceeded on quite 
another theory. As one enthusiastic supporter of the latter 
said, “You can put fifty or sixty on the register of those classes. 
_ They can sit anywhere — on the radiators if need be — and 
still go through eight years’ work in six. You can’t hold them 
back.” This is probably not an over-statement of the possi-
-P-A-G-E-257
  
THE GIFTED CHILD 229 
bilities, but it is open to the most serious objections from the 
educator’s point of view. 
These children are the hope of democracy and deserve the 
best and rarest that public education can offer. Large classes 
mean mass teaching, and mass teaching means stereotyped 
instruction. With large groups of children information may 
be given, but real teaching cannot be carried on; subject 
matter may be presented in dogmatic fashion, but this is 
just the attitude that genuine education most seeks to avoid. 
In a crowded classroom there is no chance for the development 
of initiative on the part of the children, a loss to which society 
cannot afford to remain indifferent. To the gifted ones of 
each generation we must look for leadership, but a congested 
school with a regimented atmosphere provides the wrong kind 
of character training and fails to stimulate a superior intel- 
lectual endowment toward aggressive and creative activity. 
On the whole, special classes for bright children should 
not progress much more rapidly than other classes. A more 
varied intellectual ration is needed rather than a speeding up 
process; organic and orderly development is just as necessary 
for the rare and superior child as it is for the teeming average. 
Needless to say, the enrichment of the curriculum was the 
most difficult aspect of the problem. A start was made in 
this direction by bringing in outside teachers of special sub- 
jects. Through the codperation of outside agencies, some ex- 
cellent work in drawing, modeling, and music was done. The 
nature study and geography work were considerably broad- 
ened out. Projects leading to excursions into the neighbor- 
hood and beyond helped to enlarge the cultural equipment 
of the children. A much needed variety was secured by the 
introduction of athletics— swimming, basket-ball, other games 
and sports— and camping experience. Besides this there — 
was time for a foreign language taken up by the conversation   
     
-P-A-G-E-258
  230 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
method. While the curriculum for these children has not 
been satisfactorily worked out for lack of continuous instruc- 
tion and systematic resources, we felt that we had gained im- 
measurably in coérdinating for the children a great variety 
of activities which had never before been made available 
through the agency of a public school. 
A GEOGRAPHY PROJECT 
The improvement of the course of study for the superior 
children did not consist alone in the addition of new subjects. 
An effort was made to vitalize the method of teaching. The 
geography work in the 5A-5B grade class for gifted children 
was made vital by the use of neighborhood material. The 
children of this community are all familiar with the outdoor 
markets, and some of their parents are engaged in vending 
fruits and vegetables in this way. The investigation of the 
food supply was chosen as the entering wedge for the study of 
the products and industries of the United States. In order 
to make the subject matter of geography a part of the child’s 
experience, it is necessary for the teacher to translate the 
material of the text book into life terms and to induce personal 
experiencing on the part of the child. It was furthermore 
planned that the geography work and the English work should 
supplement each other. 
The children constructed a general outline of their project 
and criticized each other’s reports. They decided that their 
information about certain sections of the United States would 
be greatly increased if they could communicate with school 
children in those places. The class made a definite list of the 
main points which they wished to hear about, and then com- 
. posed the letters to be sent to children in Los Angeles, Mis- 
soula, and other cities. These connections had been made 
through personal acquaintances of the teacher. Much useful
-P-A-G-E-259
THE GIFTED CHILD 231 
material was also obtained by writing to the chambers of 
‘commerce of cities in which they were interested. From the 
district, the class worked through the study of foods to the 
study of other lands. The small size of the class facilitated 
the taking of trips, which furthermore provided a social train- 
ing for the child, who had to learn to regulate his conduct 
for the good of his group. 
ACHIEVEMENTS IN ACADEMIC WORK 
We assumed that, given a five-hour school day, these chil- 
dren could do all the academic work required in half the time. 
The other two and a half hours could be used for other educa- 
tional occupations. So far as the regulation academic sub- 
jects were concerned, we did not feel that it was necessary 
to prove that bright children would make a better record in 
less time than average ones. In the absence of any anxiety 
on this score, it did not seem desirable to overwhelm them 
with pedagogical tests. However, when such tests were oc- 
casionally given, the results have more than vindicated our 
assumption. Several surveys were made by psychologists 
and students from outside the school who were interested in 
this aspect of the experiment. Stenquist’s study showed 
this very clearly; also a group of students from Teachers 
College gave three subject-matter tests in addition to the 
National Intelligence Test. From the detailed statistical 
results concerning each child, a simple table of averages for 
each class has been compiled. 
Although all the children had had Terman Tests with accu- 
rate mental ages, for the sake of uniformity the mental ages 
in Table XXV were made from the scores of the National In- 
telligence Test given at the same time as the subject-matter 
tests. The Educational Age is made from the average of the 
results of the three pedagogical tests used ; namely, Thorndike-  
-P-A-G-E-260

McCall Reading Test; Woody-McCall Arithmetic Test;

It will be seen from Table XXV, that in the third, fourth, 
and fifth grades, the average educational age is in advance of 
the mental age. This would indicate, in a general way, that 
these children were working up to their capacity along ortho- 
dox academic lines. The more detailed tables of the survey 
showed that this was not only true of the average, but almost 
without exception of each individual child. In the sixth and 
seventh school years the average educational age is pro- 
gressively higher than that in the three lower grades. It 
does not show up so well in relation to the average mental age 
in these groups, probably because of the acknowledged fact 
that the National Intelligence Test is too easy for bright chil- 
dren of the upper grades and therefore gives an exaggerated 
estimate of their mental ages. As a whole, the survey proved 
conclusively, as similar surveys have proved, that bright 
children do better work and do it in less time than dull ones. 
Although this fact was an assumption of the experiment 
rather than something which it started out to prove, it was, 
nevertheless, a source of satisfaction to our parental pride to 
have disinterested judges present us with a favorable statisti- 
cal report.

ENRICHMENT OF CURRICULUM 
With the time saved by doing the academic work in half 
the usual school-day, manual work in a number of forms was 
introduced. Wood work, paper cutting and folding, clay 
modeling, drawing, and coloring found a place in the cur- 
riculum. Shop work and cooking were taught to boys and 
girls alike, and it was apparent that the boys liked to use the 
gas-stove and knitting needles and the girls liked to use the 
hammer and saw. We found that this was one of the simplest 
ways of enriching the curriculum and one often neglected by 
schools, — that of giving boys and girls alike access to all the 
tools and materials available. One group of young children 
constructed a doll’s house and furnished it throughout with 
striking completeness and ingenuity. Another group com- 
bined manual work with geography by making in the sand 
box a plan of the school district. Each child located his own 
house in relation to the school and also placed settlement 
houses, docks, playgrounds, and libraries. As the school 
had unusual facilities for manual work, it was possible to 
increase the range of opportunity on this side of the child’s 
school-life. 
Here, however, we soon encountered the prejudices of par- 
ents who were accustomed to judge the child’s school progress 
entirely by his success in the stereotyped formal studies. 
Parents too often interfere with the true education of their 
children by emphasizing and exaggerating the value of formal 
academic display. Children need genuine experience with 
life situations so that they can put some content into the words 
and expressions which are used. In reading, for instance, how 
often do children and even adults read the printed page with- 
out really penetrating the meaning of the printed matter ! 
The principal who encourages manual activities soon gets 
the complaint from a particularly solicitous parent that she 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  234 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
does not want Henry to go to the shop or Bessie to learn cook- 
ing — she did not send Henry to school to become a carpenter, 
nor Bessie to become a cook. It is not parents alone who fail to 
see the educational value of manual activities; among boards 
of education and superintendents of schools the same view 
is current. The prestige of the three R’s is so great that every 
other form of activity is consistently underrated. We found 
that the classes for bright children did their formal work much 
better when the curriculum included dancing, swimming, 
modeling, drawing, etc., than when it did not. It is the city 
child, especially from the congested neighborhoods, who 
lacks this form of expression outside of school and needs to 
have it supplied. Yet so slight is the appreciation among 
parents and school authorities of the value of physical and 
manual training, that the work of the school in this direction 
is regarded with suspicion and distrust. 
All this rests on a fundamentally false conception of human 
worth. There is a common but erroneous belief that mentally 
gifted persons incline to be innately deficient in physical 
skills. Parents often regard complacently the manual de- 
ficiency of a bright child, believing that such climsiness or 
ineffectuality is a sign of mental superiority. This attitude, 
expressed or unexpressed, is a direct encouragement to the 
bright child to be helpless with his hands and other physical 
instruments. 
As a matter of fact, the psychologists are finding that the 
children who possess the highest grade of intelligence tend to 
be well-developed in body as well as in mind. This accords 
with the principle stated in a former chapter — that the 
correlation between all kinds of mental capacity is high, and 
that special abilities and disabilities are comparatively rare. 
The logical extension of this principle is that the correlation 
between mental and physical superiority is high. This is
-P-A-G-E-263
     
THE GIFTED CHILD 235 
borne out by the physical examination of groups of bright 
children who were shown to be peculiarly free from physical 
deficiencies, just as the feeble-minded are peculiarly weighted 
down by a variety of physical defects and stigmata. 
These scientific observations should be emphasized in order 
to counteract the belief, amounting almost to a superstition, 
that Nature does not usually endow a child with all-round 
superiority, but matches excellence with feebleness in the pro- 
duction of the talented individual. If a person is unusually 
clever, we expect him to be physically under-developed or 
morally eccentric. That this is often too true is not to be 
regarded as the logical result of a single talent bestowed at 
the expense of every other trait, but as the fruit of a false 
ideal of education and human worth. Gifted children do not 
have to be one-sided and ‘queer if they are brought up in 
a favorable educational environment and are taught to value 
their muscles and instincts along with their purely intellec- 
tual gifts. 
Poise, we are becoming more and more aware as the science 
of psychiatry moves from the laboratory out into life, is not so 
much a matter of control and restraint as it is a matter of 
freedom and fullness of expression. If we are to give these 
children of superior gifts a better education than the average, 
it must include a wider opportunity for each one to express 
freely all the many sides of his richly endowed self. 
We associate the fine arts with high school and college 
years. Yet if the appreciation of beauty is not encouraged 
in the child, he will always be lacking in this phase of his de- 
velopment. The study of music and poetry was approached 
with the idea of developing the responsiveness of the child, 
not with the idea of discovering geniuses and prodigies. The 
aim was to encourage free and naive expression in as many 
ways as possible. The children wrote verses and couplets
-P-A-G-E-264
  
236 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
and set them to music. They learned to interpret rhythms 
through the use of their muscles, to sing, and to play short 
melodies on the piano. The occasional child who was a 
monotone was soon singing along with the rest of the group. 
The experiment was fortunate in having a teacher whose 
musical education had been along these lines. She was able 
to conduct a program with several Terman classes for a period 
of four years, developing a method which had not been pre- 
viously tried in any public school. Her statement of results 
is therefore significant.!. ‘‘ Music lessons with children should 
not be taken seriously. The teacher as well as the pupils 
should derive pleasure from the lessons and feel that they are 
singing for fun. An air of freedom and unrestraint will de- 
velop surprising results in individual ability. The children I 
have worked with this year are second and third grade pupils, 
between seven and eight years of age. In the beginning they 
were awkward and self-conscious when asked for individual 
contributions, and generally lacking in muscular coérdination. 
We immediately began the work in rhythm. The rhythmic 
work consists of skipping, hopping, jumping, swaying, clap- 
ping, etc., in time to the music, and accenting the first beat of 
each measure. After a short time the children were able to 
distinguish the rhythm of a selection as soon as it was played. 
The next step is ear training. Encourage listening! The 
children learned to write melodies on the staff after being told 
the starting note and position on the staff. I can honestly 
say that every child of the group can compose a short melody 
in rhythm at very short notice, write it on the staff, and play 
it on the piano. I have followed this plan of work with the 
aid of a bright class of children, but I am firmly convinced that 
the same program, with slight modifications, could be carried 
out with any class of normal children.” 
1 The work in music composition was conducted by Miss Sadie R. Kalman.

  THE GIFTED CHILD 237 
ADVANTAGES OF THE SPECIAL CLASS 
When it is proposed that school children of extraordinary 
mental gifts should be handled with special care in special 
classes, the objection is sometimes raised that segregation 
would make these children conceited and priggish. The 
alternative is to allow them to remain in a class where habits 
of ennui, of under-effort, of day-dreaming fasten upon them ; 
thus character fails to evolve in harmony with intelligence. 
“The danger with exceptionally bright children,” says Ter- 
man, “is not over-pressure but under-pressure.” On the 
other hand, if the child is placed with a group of others whose 
intelligence is equal to his own, he is no longer such an out- 
standing figure among his associates. It is unnecessary, as 
has been already pointed out, to distinguish these groups by 
a label of superiority. The class should not be regarded as a 
badge of honor, but as a place of work and sociability. Itis 
not an infant hall of fame nor a national academy of prodigies 
which is needed, but a milieu and an opportunity which call 
for all the child has of ability and skill. The child who has a 
high intelligence quotient has, in that possession, the best 
antidote against conceit and priggishness. He has Nature’s 
own remedy. A wise and tactful teacher will understand 
how to keep him in contact with problems which are hard 
enough to stretch his powers —a discipline which would be 
lacking in a class where the great majority of the children were 
far less gifted than himself. 
Those in intimate contact with bright children soon learn 
that conceit is not the prevailing malady among them. The 
following comment from a teacher of a Terman class is an 
interesting report from actual experience. ‘‘One might expect 
that the gifted child would feel confident of his knowledge. 
But in my group of twenty-three children who are between the 
ages of eight and a half and ten and a half years, there are 
 
-P-A-G-E-266
eae ae TET ep pe 
238 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
about ten who are far from self-assertive. This part of the 
class is shy, reluctant to recite before strangers, and slow to 
become companionable with the teacher. These people would 
perhaps never show up for what they really are where the 
teacher did not impress them as being human and sympa- 
thetic. It is incumbent upon the teacher to see, as the chil- 
dren grow older, that they are helped to lose this self-con- 
sciousness so that it shall not remain a continuous handicap 
to them as they go through life.” 
It might be expected that a gifted child would do better 
school work in a class of his peers than in a class of children 
less able than himself. According to the investigation re- 
ferred to previously in this chapter, and made by a group of 
Columbia students under the direction of Professor William 
A. McCall, this appears to be actually the case. This survey 
showed that the academic achievements of the gifted children 
in our school were greater than those of children of equal 
ability in other schools, where they were scattered among the 
various classes. 
The question is sometimes raised whether the classes 
from which the bright children have been removed do not pay 
too heavily for the loss. It is asked whether they do not be- 
come dull and uninteresting to the teacher and the other 
children. Quite aside from the consideration whether it is 
altogether fair to sacrifice the gifted child to make life stimu- 
lating and exciting for the rest of the class and the teacher, 
it is also doubtful whether the presence of the bright child has 
this happy effect. Is it really stimulating to the other chil- 
dren to have one or two members of the class answer all the 
questions and receive all the kudos? The superior child is 
forced into the position of ‘‘teacher’s pet,’ an ancient in- 
stitution which is invariably bad for the morale of the school- 
room. As for the teacher, everything depends on her profes-
-P-A-G-E-267
THE GIFTED CHILD 239 
sional attitude. The real teacher is more concerned to have 
around her the feel of growing things than to have at hand a 
star pupil who will show off for her before the supervisor and 
the chance visitor. Asa matter of experience, we found that the 
teachers were more generous in regard to giving up their gifted 
pupils than were the heads and administrators. They were 
more willing to part from a bright child in order that he might 
have superior advantages, and they were also more faithful in 
the interest which they showed in following, sympathetically 
and proudly, the subsequent careers of these children, all the 
way up through the grades and through the high school later. 
THE SUPERIOR CHILD WHO DOES INADEQUATE SCHOOL WORK 
A far more serious problem for the teacher of bright children 
than the prevention of crude conceit is to understand and 
stimulate the superior child whose school progress is not com- 
mensurate with his intelligence rating. After the Terman 
classes had been assembled and put to work on a schedule 
adapted to their abilities, certain disappointing children be- 
gan to be singled out here and there. In ordinary classes, 
they would not have disappointed anybody; probably they 
would have escaped all criticism as being better than the 
average. In the Terman class they became for the first time 
laggards. The value of the psychological test in connection 
with these children is apparent; when teachers and parents 
know that a child is the opposite of stupid, his comparative 
failure in school work presents a claim for intelligent analysis. 
Neither is it sufficient to call him lazy. Children are not 
lazy by preference and election, although parents and teachers 
often seem to think they are. The condition has a cause, 
and is amenable to influence and treatment up to the point 
where it becomes a neurotic symptom, and even after that. 
The bright child who does not work and play up to his capac- 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  
240 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
ity, needs to be located as early as possible, that the habit 
of ineffectiveness may not become fixed in him to his own 
ultimate loss and so that of society. 
A special study! was made of ten children of superior 
mentality whose school marks were comparatively poor. 
The group was selected from the one hundred and twenty-five 
children in the Terman classes on the following bases : 
(1) They had an IQ of 120 or more; (2) they had been 
reported by at least two teachers for their poor school work 
in comparison with their fellows; (3) all physical causes 
had supposedly been removed. In one respect these children 
were alike: they seemed to lack effort more than anything 
else. Their indifference was accompanied by symptoms of 
laziness, shyness, day-dreaming, sensitiveness to criticism, 
and hypochondriacal fears resulting in irregular school at- 
tendance. The children were given a series of intelligence 
tests, including learning tests and eight performance tests, 
and the psycho-neurotic questionnaire. The entire school 
history and the visiting teacher’s study of home conditions 
were taken into consideration. The value of the study lay 
in the continuation of the analysis beyond the teacher’s marks 
and the psychologist’s tests, and in the elimination at the out- 
set of possible confusing factors of average or less than aver- 
age intellectual endowment. The visiting teacher’s analysis 
of home conditions and influences was indispensable in such 
an inquiry, which was in large part concerned with mental 
habits originating in the home atmosphere. The outcome of 
each case was to reinforce very definitely the visiting teacher’s 
knowledge of the child, and thus to give compass and chart 
for her farther guidance.

THE GIFTED CHILD 241 
Homer Beaverback, eleven years old, was a typical case of 
this group. He was a small, dark child with brown eyes, 
which had a trick of glancing off to one side in an odd way 
when in conversation — usually a one-sided one. He was 
the youngest of a family of much older brothers and sisters, 
all of whom were bright and successful. Much was expected 
of him by his family. It was, therefore, disappointing to 
them when he showed signs of dreamy inactivity, indifference 
to lessons and even to reading. 
His IQ was one of the highest in the class. He measured 
150 on three successive tests. Although he was rather a 
sensitive child, and perhaps subject to moods, the neurotic 
index did not indicate a large number of neurotic symptoms. 
His teacher reported him as lazy and working only in spurts. 
In the regular class he had made A’s but in the Terman class 
he received only B’s. Theoretically, children in the Terman 
classes should have A, but Homer was no more ambitious to 
live up to this theory than to gratify the hopes of his family. 
He did not easily express himself in symbols. His only show 
of interest was in a toy ‘‘erector” with which he tirelessly 
built and experimented. The limitations of mere intelligence 
unsupported by interest and emotional drive were strikingly 
exemplified in his case. 
On the whole, the educational tests indicated that his learn- 
ing ability in concrete things was up to what might be expected 
of him, but in abstract things he fell below the mark. He 
distinctly did not need to be prodded into learning; he had 
already had too much of this. As a result, his distrust in his 
own abilities was a constant drag on his efforts. He lacked 
initiative and aggressiveness; the impulse to do and not to 
do were always pitted one against the other. He needed to 
take his own steps in advance in order that his self-confidence 
might be built up and his social.relations with his teacher and

never necessary or effective in the affairs of home. 
tack from outside and inside on the habit of apathy. 
  SOME GIFTED CHILDREN classmates normalized. Owing to the fact that he had been 
the youngest of the family and practically the only child among 
adults, he had never known the taste of independence or leader- 
ship. He was not the babyish type often produced by such 
a situation; he was rather apathetic than infantile. Action 
was paralyzed in him by the constant realization that he was 
The effort which the school made, through the psychiatrist 
and the visiting teacher, to help this boy with his difficulties 
in the pre-adolescent age, met with definite success in that 
his school work improved up to the standard expected of a 
Terman child. This gave grounds for hoping that his high 
school course might later be pursued with equal success, owing 
to the early amelioration of emotional strain by a serious at- 
It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the problem type 
of boy represented by Homer Beaverback was not prominent 
in the Terman classes. On the contrary, these children were 
far from maladjusted, and matters of conduct had a way of 
taking care of themselves. The esprit de corps which existed 
among them was a great conserver of social relationships. 
Their social situation was peculiar in the school owing to 
segregation, the result of which was that the integrity of the 
group was preserved from year to year. The children came 
to know each other, their individual strengths and weaknesses, 
their talents and shortcomings. Because Sam was class 
president one year did not mean that he would be president 
the following year. He might be superseded by Arthur, whose 
popularity had increased in the meantime. Figure-head 
honors and scapegoat blame were not common, because the 
children knew each other too well. 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  THE GIFTED CHILD 243 
The following comment made by one of the Terman teachers 
describes a characteristic of all these special classes: ‘The 
group as a unit is highly sociable. There is always something 
important to be said to a neighbor or else a question that 
must be answered. The class club must operate; club meet- 
ings must be held. The monthly party with cake and candy 
cannot be dispensed with. A little play and entertainment 
can be gotten up so easily without the teacher’s aid. Having 
taught each of the psychologically graded groups of children, 
ranging from the dull backward pupils to those of the su- 
perior type, I appreciate this propensity as being the most 
highly developed here.” 
The histories, necessarily brief, of four superior children, 
are given below: 
Max Fulleman was described by a teacher as “‘that boy who 
looks like Shelley.’ With his high forehead and curls, open 
collar and idealistic expression, his appearance suggested the 
poet. Max’s taste, however, was practical rather than poetic. 
Max was eleven years and five months of age at the time 
of his first test, and his IQ was 150. His age when retested 
was twelve years and ten months and his IQ 152. On the 
second examination he answered correctly all the questions 
on the scale. He graduated from the eighth grade at thir- 
teen and from the high school at seventeen, his school record 
being uniformly good. 
There was nothing in Max’s family or environment to sug- 
gest that intelligence of an unusually high order was to be 
expected of him. His father and mother were born in Russia 
and neither had ever gone to school. The father was a gar- 
ment worker, and the mother kept house for a large family. 
It was obvious that an unceasing struggle with poverty went 
onin the home. Two older sisters had graduated from public 
schools, attended commercial schools, and were employed in
-P-A-G-E-272
  244 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
offices. A little sister of five was Max’s especial pet. Her 
IQ was 100. There was also a baby in the family, too young 
to test. 
The atmosphere of the home was coéperative and amiable, 
but not outstandingly ambitious. Neither father nor mother 
spoke English, although they had lived in New York six years ; 
in the neighborhood they had no necessity and little opportu- 
nity to learn it. A symptomatic story was told by the boy. 
A popular Yiddish ‘‘colyumist’’ dropped in every evening to 
see Max’s father, who helped him make jokes for the morrow. 
Perhaps a mute, inglorious humorist was hidden in Max’s 
ancestry. 
On leaving high school, the boy was obliged to find em- 
ployment. He enrolled at Cooper Union to study engineer- 
ing in the evening and looked for a position in one of the largest 
electrical works of the city. Here he was turned away, as the 
firm did not employ Jews. Max was obliged to hawk his 
150 IQ around until he found a second-rate electrical estab- 
lishment which was willing to employ him. By working dur- 
ing the day and studying in the evening, he is preparing him- 
self under great difficulties for the career of an engineer. 
Leah Landauer was the oldest of a family of four brothers 
and sisters, all of whom received ratings of superior intelli- 
gence on their psychological tests. 
' Leah’s IQ was 149 on her first test, and 152 on her second. 
On the latter she passed every test except the eighteenth 
year vocabulary test. She graduated from the eighth grade 
at twelve years of age and from the high school at fifteen. 
At sixteen she is in her first year in college. Herbrother, one 
year younger than herself, has made a similar record. 
Leah’s record as a student shows all-round success and she 
has considerable musical ability, reflected in her choice of a 
career. While still in the elementary school she wished to be
-P-A-G-E-273
  
THE GIFTED CHILD 245 
either a lawyer or a violinist. If a lawyer, she intended to 
be one day a judge. In the high school she developed a great 
enthusiasm for mathematics and began to prepare herself to 
be a teacher of mathematics. She was first honor student 
on graduation from high school. In addition to all this 
achievement, she has marked gifts of leadership. As presi- 
dent of the student government organization of the high 
school, her precocious talents in this direction came to light. 
Leah’s father and mother came from Austria. The mother, 
a widow, has never attended school, but learned to read and 
write after coming to America at the age of seventeen. Her 
resourcefulness in maintaining her home and children on a 
small income is evidence of no small amount of ingenuity. 
The father died while the children were quite small, leaving 
the mother with no income whatsoever. He had been natu- 
ralized and the widow received a pension from the Child Wel- 
fare Board. This pension continues until the children are 
sixteen and, owing to the precocity of the two oldest, will see 
them through the first year of college. The scholarships 
given by the Junior Employment Service have enabled Leah 
and her brother to go on thus far. The stipends must soon 
cease, limiting the further education of these gifted children. 
This is doubtless why Leah, who has not a phantastic disposi- 
tion, has decided to be a teacher of mathematics instead of 
studying law, ultimately to become a judge. 
Aaron Lerner is a dark little fellow with such a solemn 
countenance that his teachers say he looks like a rabbi. His 
IQ is 158. At the age of six and a half, he was placed in a 
1B Terman class, and two years later, aged eight and a half, 
he has reached the 5B Terman class. 
Aaron reads books from the library continuously, and goes 
without fail to the Sunday afternoon children’s hour at the 
Metropolitan Museum. His teacher describes him as crea-
-P-A-G-E-274
246 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
tive and inventive but lacking in finish. On the artistic side, 
his work does not stand out. He has a mechanical bent, a 
strong sense of justice and great interest in the subject, and 
keen powers of observation. ‘‘He takes everything in,’’ is 
’ very commonly said of him. 
Aaron’s father and mother were born and married in Russia. 
The father, having begun work at eleven, is eager that his 
children shall have the educational opportunity that he lacked. 
He is a carpenter, showing himself in conversation to be an 
unusually well-informed man. Both parents read and write 
Yiddish. The children all show precocious intelligence. 
The eldest, a boy, had graduated from high school and en- 
tered City College at the age of fifteen. The second, a girl, 
graduated with a Terman class at twelve and is now in high 
school. She has an IQ of 164. Aaron is the third child, 
and there is a still younger one, as yet untested. 
Aaron has just been given a scholarship in an excellent 
private school where he has found his place easily in a group 
of children of an average age of nine and a half and an average 
IQ of 130, he being eight and a half with an IQ of 158. His 
prospects for higher education are unusually bright owing to 
the thrift and ambition of his father and the probable aid 
from the children older than himself. 
Valerie Malakoff is a little blonde Russian girl eight years 
of age with an IQ of 146. She belongs to the small minority 
of non-Jewish Russians in the school. Soon after her sixth 
birthday she was tested for the youngest Terman class and 
entered our school. 
Valerie has more than the usual amount of versatility which 
belongs to the high IQ type. Though shy and silent with 
grown-ups, she attracts their attention and interest almost 
too much for her own good. Her abilities are so striking that 
they tempt people to help her develop them. Her parents 
 
-P-A-G-E-275
  
THE GIFTED CHILD 247 
sent her to a Russian school from six to eight in the evening, 
so that she might learn the language thoroughly. Having 
acquired a repertoire of folk dances, she was enlisted for par- 
ties by grown-up friends. At the same time, the school took 
a hand by placing her in a class where her best was always 
expected. At the suggestion of the visiting teacher, the 
father undertook to curtail some of her activities. 
This little girl has marked esthetic aptitudes, combined 
with great intellectual accuracy. Her response to the music 
was similar to that in dancing, showing a rare quality of feel- 
ing for tone and rhythm. Asked to describe an ocean liner 
which her class had visited with the teacher, she was ready 
with the actual dimensions, in feet, of the great vessel. In 
contact with older people she appears unduly reserved, but 
she plays gayly enough with children of her own age. 
Valerie’s father and mother follow humble occupations. 
The father works in a laundry and the mother sews on coats. 
The father speaks English but the mother only Russian. 
There are but two children, Valerie and a sister two years 
older. The sister has not had a psychological test, but her 
school marks up through the 6B class are uniformly good. 
There is strong reason to suppose that the parents of these 
two little girls have more than common ability in spite of the 
unskilled employments they follow. But there appears to be 
little certainty that they will be able to provide the leisurely 
and prolonged period of training and education which a child 
of Valerie’s equipment and temperament requires. 
THE TEACHER OF GIFTED CHILDREN 
The selection of a teacher for gifted children raises at once 
the question of qualifications. Quite obviously, her intelli- 
gence must be of the same superior grade as that of her pupils, 
although intellect is not the only consideration in her case.
-P-A-G-E-276
  
    
248 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
Little as the fact is appreciated, the good teacher is an artist, 
and an artist is a worker whose performance can be accounted 
for but partially by intellect. 
At first the teachers were eager to be put in charge of these 
classes as the impression prevailed that they would be easy 
to teach. In the ordinary class, these children absorb so 
little of the teacher’s time and attention that they seem to 
carry themselves through the grades, as it were. The teacher 
has never the sense of putting her shoulder to the wheel where 
they are concerned. Unfortunately the child also has no 
sense of putting his shoulder to the wheel. However, when 
the children are grouped and the standard of performance is 
raised for them, the teacher’s responsibility and effort are 
correspondingly enhanced. As this fact began to be under- 
stood, the applicants among the teachers for Terman classes 
fell off in number. So long as special qualifications were re- 
quired, special inducements were looked for. The salaries 
offered should be at least as high as those paid to teachers of 
subnormal children and teachers of the blind, for whom a 
special license is required. This would be one way of attract- 
ing superior teachers for the work of teaching gifted children, 
although the more intangible evidences of appreciation are 
always needed. These are not the children on whom the 
school can afford to save money. If small classes and ex- 
cellent teachers cost money, it would be hard to find a more 
legitimate use of public funds. Among the gifted children 
are the creative spirits of tomorrow to whom will fall the 
task of guiding the trend of civilization. 
Since the dawn of the evolutionary theory, people have 
cherished the ideal of improving the race by breeding. But 
so far, the science of eugenics has been able to demonstrate 
the principles of heredity only through the medium of plants 
and the lower animals. Francis Galton suggested the possi-
-P-A-G-E-277
  THE GIFTED CHILD 249 
bility of producing more men of genius and few feeble-minded 
folk, by the deliberate application of the Darwinian theory 
to individual human life. This hope remains unfulfilled. 
The function of reproduction among human beings is compli- 
cated by psychological factors from which the other animals 
are free, and which represent a side of human nature as yet 
but dimly understood. We do know, however, that it is the 
most irrational aspect of human behavior, and least subject 
to utilitarian considerations of any kind. 
A healthy emotional life does not necessarily accompany a 
good intellect; it is primarily attained through the daily and 
hourly adjustments of personal relationships. Adult conduct 
is the result of the child’s emotional history, and a large part 
of the child’s emotional history is made within the school, 
which must therefore shoulder its own share of responsibility 
for the outcome. It is a well-known fact that people who are 
happy, well-adjusted, and economically productive are more 
apt to marry and reproduce their kind than are the unhappy, 
ill-adjusted, and neurotic. Both types of temperament ‘are 
possible with the same intellectual equipment. Although 
intelligence is the best instrument of social adjustment and 
emotional balance, the child is not often taught to use his 
brains in that way. It is a lesson which the gifted child should 
learn in order that he may not rest content with intellectual 
triumphs alone, at the same time that he habitually fails where 
the ordinary successes of social adaptability are concerned. 
To develop children gifted with high intelligence into male 
or female blue-stockings is a biological waste. While it may 
not be possible to produce men and women of genius by breed- 
ing them, it is possible to conserve those already born for a 
productive adult life and to educate them for the social adapt- 
ability which makes for eventual marriage. In this direction 
lies the possibility of a practical contribution to eugenics.

  CHAPTER XI 
VocationaL CouNsELING ! 
The importance of carrying out the psychological classifi- 
cation in the first year of school has been repeatedly empha- 
sized in this study. Nowhere is the need more apparent than 
in connection with vocational guidance. At present the prob- 
lem is not sufficiently met by the eleventh-hour testing which 
usually takes place. Too often the psychological test is ap- 
plied at the point where vocational counseling begins and in 
such haste that only group tests are possible. This common 
incidence is far from ideal and is altogether unnecessary in 
the school, however unavoidable it may be in the employment 
bureau. 
If the children have been classified at the age of six, their 
subsequent school careers then furnish a significant basis for 
vocational advice. If, however, the psychological test has 
merely been superimposed upon six to eight years of a curric- 
ulum whose suitability or unsuitability has remained through- 
out all this time undetermined, the counselor is confronted 
by a topsy-turvy arrangement of school marks and psycho- 
logical ratings which have no clarifying relation to each other. 
A child’s ratings in ‘“‘conduct,” “proficiency,” and “effort” 
mean practically nothing unless the teacher giving them has 
had some approximate measure of his ability. A series of 
B or D marks based on his relation to the other children in

the same class, and not on any estimate of his individual capac- 
ity, are misleading by their seeming definiteness. We cannot 
depend altogether on such unrelated data to say whether 
this or that particular child should be advised to go to high 
school or not. 
Yet, as the high school courses are now planned, there are 
children whom one cannot conscientiously advise to try them, 
since failure is practically sure to be the outcome. There 
are also children who, following the example of an industrial 
environment, are planning to go to work, but shouldbe strongly 
urged, and assisted if necessary, to enter high school. 
Between these two groups, comparatively easy to single 
out, are the great majority of school children for whom ac- 
curate and accumulated psychological data are needed, along 
with a series of achievement tests showing the true school 
progress of the child. In schools which have no thorough- 
going records of this kind, the last-minute psychological test 
is a great aid to the counselor. To disregard it is to neglect 
the best objective aid in understanding the individual. As 
long as classes are crowded, teachers’ reports on lessons and 
character are less dependable for objective accuracy than 
the group tests previously described in this study. With 
all their limitations, these tests have demonstrated their prac- 
tical value. As in the other uses to which they were experi- 
mentally put in our school, once we had tried them they be- 
came immediately indispensable in vocational guidance. But 
we strongly recommend that they be introduced at the very 
beginning of the child’s school life and not just before he gets 
his working papers or proceeds to high school. 
THE ADOLESCENT PROBLEM 
The fact that such a small proportion of the adolescent 
population goes to school is a standing reproach to democracy.  
-P-A-G-E-280
252 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
The high school takes on a quality of exclusiveness which ill 
fits its services as an instrument of public education. Of 
all the pupils who enter high school courses, more than half 
leave within the first year.!. This period of exodus follows 
immediately upon a similar period including the last two years 
of the elementary school course. After the 6B grade is passed, 
the registration drops heavily term by term. During the 
seventh and eighth years, the school loses nearly one-third 
of the children.? As we have pointed out in Chapter I, the 
proportion of eighth grade graduates who do not enter high 
school at all is about one-third of the total. This makes all 
together a period of three years during which fractions of the 
school registration varying from a fourth to a half of the total 
are successively broken off, leaving a still decreasing minority 
to continue onward in the secondary schools. It is the period 
in which the public school specializes in elimination. 
The accusing statistics are familiar; the school collects 
them again and again and publishes them as statistics of chil- 
dren who have failed. They should rather be interpreted as 
statistical evidence that the school has failed, and culpably. 
Unfortunately, the eliminated child accepts the réle of failure 
without much question, and enters his vocational life through 
this inauspicious commencement experience. His one com- 
fort is that school and work have nothing in common; and, 
like an emigrant from Earth to Mars, he is able to take heart 
in a wholly new environment. 
To stem the swift current of elimination, legislative measures 
have been adopted and correlated. Under the child labor 
law and the compulsory education law, the child’s compulsory

VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 253 
school life has been progressively though not greatly length- 
ened. The continuation school law prescribes a period dur- 
ing which he must continue his education after his working 
life has begun. At the present time, all graduates of ele- 
mentary schools who are not yet fifteen, and children over 
fifteen who are not graduates, must attend continuation school 
up to the age of seventeen. The new continuation school 
law, to become effective in September, 1925, requires four to 
eight hours a week of day school up to the age of eighteen for 
all children not attending high school. 
THE JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
The junior high school attempts to span the two unstable 
years with which the elementary school closes and the ten- 
tative year with which the high school opens by organizing 
into a unit the seventh, eighth, and ninth school years. This 
period is spoiled for all concerned, including the surviv- 
ors, by the host of departing guests who leave with a glad 
alacrity, not flattering to any school. The atmosphere of a 
class in which several big boys are sulking or actively kicking 
at the traces while they wait for the law to release their work- 
ing papers, is certainly not one hundred per cent educational. 
Yet this is the prevailing atmosphere of many a classroom 
during these intermediate years. 
The result is that the children frequently make less progress 
at this time than either before or after. The interlude is 
marked by an inferior quality of school success which is only 
comparable to that of the first school year. . It is a well-known 
fact that about one-fourth of the first grade children fail to 
make their promotions. If there were any demand for six- 
year-old labor and it were legally possible, there is no doubt 
that most of these failures would willingly retire forever from 
the lists at this point. They have had enough of school life
-P-A-G-E-282
254 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
already. Since the traditional educational process with the 
first graders is admittedly so unsuccessful, we have suggested 
that the better plan would be to study the child as the first | 
step towards teaching him. 
A similar situation appears to arise again during the prob- 
lematical years which form the junior high school period. 
Here again the school success of the children is at its lowest 
ebb. This would seem to indicate that the teaching process 
might here again be subordinated to the study of the individ- 
ual. What actually happens now is that the teaching pro- 
cess virtually pauses throughout the eighth year, because 
this year is practically given over to review. But prognosis 
is what the child needs at this point rather than review. The 
school is concerned with his future just as it was concerned 
with the future of the six-year-old. The utmost flexibility 
of attitude and treatment is needed for the adolescent as it 
was for the young child. The curriculum itself should, in 
adolescent and pre-adolescent years, function as a test or trial 
and not as a technique or preparatory training. 
“The ideal junior high school,” says Van Denburg, “‘is, 
therefore, a finding and a sorting school where pupils may, 
through actual experience, be led to make a more rational 
selection of their senior high school work, or their occupation 
in the world of industry, than would be otherwise possible.” + 
The fact is that every child should continue his education 
in all-day schools until the age of eighteen, no matter what 
his IQ is. The practice of the public school to disinherit 
the dull child and repudiate responsibility for him as non- 
educational material is difficult to live down. As the techni- 
cal high schools have sprung into existence, they have imi- 
tated the exclusive attitude of the original academic institu- 
1Van Denburg, Joseph K. The Junior High School Idea. Henry Holt, 
New York, 1922. Page 16.
-P-A-G-E-283
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 255 
tion. ‘We want bright boys,” says the principal of the tech- 
nical school, jealous for his institution, “because this too is 
a high school.” Notwithstanding the more diversified curric- 
ulum and vocational courses of the newer secondary schools, 
the child of less than average intelligence is still begrudged 
admittance at all their doors. The principal of a certain tech- 
nical high school in New York City accepts as pupils boys 
with IQ ratings ranging anywhere up and down the scale. 
He claims, and justifies his claim, that he can provide suitable 
and interesting occupations for the dullest boys who come to 
him. Among his fellow schoolmen, the comment runs, “That 
man Weaver is a funny principal. Why, he’d let monkeys 
come to school.” Such comment indicates how far in prac- 
tice public education still lingers behind its theoretical respon- 
sibilities as an agent of free compulsory universal education. 
From the data given in the first chapter of this study, it 
appears that our experimental school was filled with children 
whose parents were in industrial occupations. While a ma- 
jority of our eighth grade graduates went to high school, they 
were pioneering in paths unfamiliar to their foreign-born 
parents. Just what proportion of them succumbed to the 
heavy mortality of the first high school year, we have no way 
of knowing. But doubtless the 16 per cent who went imme- 
diately to work from the eighth grade was considerably 
augmented one year later by those who left high school. Vo- 
cational advice was, therefore, greatly needed, and the voca- 
tional counselor was a valuable addition to the staff. Our 
school became one of the first in the city to employ a voca- 
tional counselor. 
VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE 
With the permission of the Department of Education, the 
Vocational Service for Juniors initiated its work in nine public 
schools. This again exemplifies the method of codperation 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  256 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
between social work and public education, out of which a new 
function of the public school has gradually come into existence. 
The aim of the experiment is defined in a recent report as 
follows : 
Briefly stated, the aim of vocational guidance is to arouse and stimu- 
late the interest of boys and girls in the vocation they hope ultimately 
to choose; to give them a picture of the world’s work, the conditions 
under which it is done and the qualifications needed to do it; and to help 
them make an intelligent choice of their next step in education or train- 
ing, or, if necessary, of work, based on this glimpse into the world’s 
work and on a careful analysis of their own interests, powers, and limi- 
tations. . . . As far as the students and their parents are concerned, 
the guidance is an integral part of the schools, the group talks, indi- 
vidual interviews, etc., being carried on during the school day.t 
The Vocational Service for Juniors includes several activ- 
ities which supplement each other. The counselor becomes 
a part of the regular staff of the school and gives individual 
advice as well as class instruction. The scholarship depart- 
ment of the Vocational Service provides for the expenses in 
day school of children who would otherwise be forced to go to 
work. Unfortunately, this valuable service is limited by the 
resources of the organization, and many promising children 
remain unprovided for. To aid further the process of voca- 
tional adjustment, the society has employment bureaus which 
place workers under eighteen years of age in investigated 
positions. The Vocational Service, in short, approaches the 
child with assistance at the great divide between school and 
work, and helps him to seek out the narrow pass best adapted 
for his individual use. As schools now are, and work now is, 
the integration between the two is not easy. 
Let it be noted that the Vocational Service did not invent 
vocational counseling; it only undertook to organize such a

VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 257 
service on a responsible basis. In response to the needs of 
bewildered children, advice was being dispensed on every 
hand and much well-intentioned confusion was being spread 
around. Teachers who knew little about the specific courses 
in the high school and less about the occupations in the eco- 
nomic world, were the only counselors to whom the children 
could turn. Principals were forced to advise inquiring chil- 
dren either for or against trying the high school, and this on 
insufficient data concerning their individual abilities. The 
consequence was that boys who wanted to be bookkeepers 
were arriving in the classical high schools, and others who had 
professional ambitions were entering high school unaware 
that college lay beyond, and beyond that still the necessary 
technical training. Tragedies of ambition as poignant as 
that of Jude the Obscure were probably enacted over and over 
as the result of stereotyped advice which had no relation to 
the actual abilities of the individual. 
The vocational counselor had to find her way in the begin- 
ning through a maze. The important thing was to work 
always constructively, positively, and for the conservation 
of the individual. In no case was any child advised negatively 
or told he could not do well in this course or that sort of work. 
He was told that it might be hard for him, and that, if he found 
this later to be so, he was to return for further advice regard- 
ing a change of course. When a disagreement arose between 
the counselor and the parent or between the child’s choice 
and the counselor’s opinion, the argument stressed by the 
counselor was the probability of greater success in some other 
direction rather than the likelihood of failure in what the 
child wanted to attempt. Although the advice was based 
on all the scientific data obtainable, and the aim of the ad- 
viser was to adopt an impersonal attitude, the child was not 
allowed to feel any lack of interest in his progress. 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
    258 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
Starting from these considerations, the pupils were inter- 
viewed individually and advised regarding further education 
or opportunities to work. The counselor strove to observe 
faithfully the following general principles : 
To keep children in school as long as possible. 
To keep them in the most difficult grade of school work 
of which they are capable. 
To keep them in the general course as long as possible and 
thus delay choice of training for specific occupations until 
as late a date as possible. 
To give advice on the basis of interest and intelligence and 
school history. When the training sought is commercial or 
technical, the child’s marks in related special subjects are also 
taken into consideration. 
TEACHING OCCUPATIONAL MATERIAL 
When it came to teaching the children about the occupa- 
tional world which surrounds the school world, it was found 
practical to teach them in groups. Our school children were 
economically precocious, so far as interest was concerned. 
They came from homes in which talk of work and wages was 
familiar every-day talk. Economic subjects enlisted their 
attention and lessons on this theme were always lively. And 
as they realized the meaning of work, these boys also realized 
the meaning of money; both work and money entered into 
their experience in a far more vital way than if they had grown 
up under more sheltered economic conditions. What they 
did not have, however, was concrete information about the 
educational and vocational possibilities from their own stand- 
point. It was decided to inject occupational material directly 
into the curriculum. 
We began with the 7A class, although vocational guidance 
proper was scheduled to begin in 7B. It seemed wise to have
-P-A-G-E-287
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 259 
the teachers cover some preliminary ground in order to assist 
the vocational counseling which, like most experimental work, 
was sadly understaffed. However, one counselor for 300 
children was good fortune by comparison with most schools, 
which had none. Moreover, volunteer workers in this field 
were not available as in the work of psychological testing, 
where the technical assistance of university students was 
readily obtainable. We had to find a way, within the school 
organization, to supplement and support the vocational coun- 
selor’s work in order to increase its efficiency. 
The life-career classes became a regular feature of the 7A 
curriculum. A place was discovered where the children went 
over the geography of the United States for the third time. 
Here was the chance to put in some economic teaching, it 
was agreed. The chairman of the geography department 
worked up the course by the simple method of classifying 
occupations under the fourfold division of food, clothing, 
shelter, and leisure. Material was gathered from industrial 
geographies, newspaper almanacs, and surveys made by the 
Vocational Service. About half the time of the course was 
given to the occupations of the country, and the other half to 
the occupations of New York City. The ten leading occupa- 
tions of the city were especially discussed and some conception 
of wages, hours, and prospects was worked out with the class. 
In selecting the library books for the seventh and eighth 
years, the vocational interests of the children were borne in 
mind. Among the biographies included were those of 
Trudeau, Grenfell, Roosevelt, and John Muir. Several books 
about occupations were recommended which proved attrac- 
tive to the boys. Pick, Shovel, and Pluck; Careers of Danger 
and Daring; and Occupations gave them some definite notions 
about work on which the more specific teaching of the voca- 
tional counselor was later to build.  
-P-A-G-E-288
  260 FITTING THE SCHOOL: TO THE CHILD 
In the 7B grade class, the teaching of occupational material 
was taken over by the vocational counselor. One hour a 
week was assigned from the English schedule for the purpose, 
and the subject was now correlated with English as it had 
formerly been with geography. The difficulty, in general, 
of introducing such lessons into the schools, is to find people 
who have the technique of teaching and who combine with 
it the necessary background of industrial facts regarding the 
history and the existing requirements of the occupational 
field. But the material is intensely interesting to the pupils ; 
and, even though the counselor is not an experienced teacher, 
the subject does not call for any unusual resources of peda- 
gogical technique in order to keep the class awake. All 
the children were eager to relate the industrial experiences of 
their families and friends and to ask questions of their own. 
CONTENT AND METHOD OF VOCATIONAL COURSES 
The content of the courses given to the 7B grade is indi- 
cated by the following outline: The first four lessons were 
general in character; they attempted to show: (1) The change 
which has taken place in industry from the primitive and 
household type of work to the factory system, through the 
introduction of machinery and mass-production; the high 
specialization in industry; and the great number of possible 
occupations in the world. (2) The danger of drifting into 
blind alley jobs unless one has a specific objective; a dis- 
cussion of the blind alley job, its monotony, danger of un- 
employment, low pay, lack of advancement or opportunity 
to acquire skill. (3) The elements that enter into an intelli- 
gent choice of work: the actual task to be considered ; next 
its economic conditions, hours, wages, and opportunity for 
advancement. Is it a growing or a contracting field? Is 
it seasonal or steady? What are the qualifications necessary
-P-A-G-E-289
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 261 
for success? The analysis of oneself to ascertain whether one 
is possessed of the necessary qualities, physical and mental. 
(4) The necessary preparation for the work; and, finally, 
the question, Is it work which is of service to the com- 
munity ? 
The next lessons described in some detail the broad divi- 
sions of the working world: (1) Professional work, general 
considerations, qualifications, and the type of temperament 
that succeeds; the amount of intelligence and hard study 
necessary, the length and kind of preparation required. 
(2) Commercial work, which is treated in a similar way. 
(3) Technical work, which is divided into the discussions of 
technical professions and skilled trade work, and the neces- 
sary considerations of these types of work. These lessons were 
illustrated by specific studies of actual occupations: the pro- 
fessional lesson by the doctor and the teacher; the commer- 
cial lesson by the bookkeeper, salesman, and department 
store worker ; the technical lesson by the engineer ; the skilled 
trade work. by the electrician and the printer. Some time 
was spent on unskilled work and its dangers. The final les- 
sons were a discussion of the various educational opportuni- 
ties of New York City and what they lead to. 
The method used in the presentation of the material was 
that of question and answer; the experience of the children 
was tapped and they were encouraged to take the initiative 
in discussion. The outlines were not rigidly adhered to but 
were modified as the lessons progressed according to the bent 
of the classes, although in the main the important practical 
points were covered. The children were intensely interested 
in the lessons about how work was once done and how it is 
now done. It was surprising to see how well they grasped the 
difference, as it was pictured to them, between the days of the 
Pilgrim Fathers when each household made for itself all that
-P-A-G-E-290
  262 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
it needed, and the present time when it takes four thousand 
different kinds of workers to supply us with food, clothes, 
shelter, education, and recreation. Against this background 
of differences it was possible to develop with them the idea 
of work that is socially serviceable and that which is wasteful ; 
the difference, for instance, between learning a process like 
electric wiring and being a door lackey in a Fifth Avenue shop. 
The second talk on blind alley jobs seemed to bring out 
all the romantic and phantastic longings that the three R’s 
suppress. It is hard to convince children that opportunities 
in such jobs are few when they firmly believe that a newsboy 
is likely at any moment to pick up a diamond ring, and by 
honestly returning it to its owner, obtain a position for life 
with a large salary and little work. As long as youth is given 
to such fairy-tale views of life, the counselor must bring to 
them a sympathetic comprehension and a tactful substitution 
of the facts of reality. There is a tendency in each young 
human being to believe that something unique and wonderful 
is waiting especially for him, something different from the 
humdrum fate awaiting all the others, which makes all real- 
istic planning an uncongenial task. The fairy godmother 
will certainly drop in at the last instant with unexpected gifts, 
or father Wotan will place in one’s hands at the crucial moment 
the sword invincible. Why plan for the same every-day fate 
as all the rest of the ordinary unfavored mortals? 
These adolescent dreams are not an absolute hindrance to 
the counselor who knows how to use them tactfully. They 
are, after all, the symptoms of an adventurous spirit in which 
every career, however humdrum and matter-of-fact it may 
seem to others, should be viewed by the person whose career 
it is going to be. 
When the plan of giving the group talks was first adopted, 
the difficulty of presenting the material to unclassified chil-
-P-A-G-E-291
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 263 
dren was experienced. At that time, the distribution of the 
pupils throughout the grade on the basis of intelligence tests, 
had not reached the seventh and eighth years. The necessity 
of such a classification as a basis for vocational discussions, 
was immediately discovered. There is probably little differ- 
ence of opinion in regard to the tendency of children of simi- 
lar intelligence to select similar occupations. In the graded 
classes all the types of occupations were presented to all the 
types of children, but the emphasis was laid upon the occu- 
pations which most interested each particular group. It 
was very natural that the little bright-eyed high IQ should 
stage a mock trial and enact the part of the lawyer with 
more avidity than the big over-age boy whose thoughts were 
centered on becoming a printer’s apprentice next month. 
Even the vocational counselor must guard against too rosy 
a view, which would see every child destined for distinction 
in a professional career. Through experience with a number 
of classes, the counselor becomes accustomed to the fact that 
the interests of a group very soon find their level in the course 
of a free discussion. The tendency of the new and inexperi- 
enced adviser is to urge children into occupations too difficult 
for success. It is necessary, as time goes on, not to swing too 
much to the other extreme, but to continue to present experi- 
mentally to all the group, all the occupations on the calendar 
and to allow them to work out, on the basis of their own in- 
terests, those which tie up with their ideals, abilities, and 
necessities. 
The effect of the classification on the group work was sug- 
gestive in several ways. So good was the response of the 
bright classes that, from the point of view of giving definite 
information, leading to.choice, it was possible to dispense 
with the individual interview altogether. 
One of the rapid advancement classes made an experiment
-P-A-G-E-292
    264 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
in method. The class was divided into committees of four 
pupils. Each committee selected the occupation they wanted 
particularly to study. An outline was given them and books 
were provided, after which the committee went ahead without 
further directions. A report was made to the class on the 
occupation in the form of a socialized recitation. All ques- 
tions of dispute were referred to the counselor as referee; and 
when any statement made by a member of the committee 
was criticized by the class, the committee was requested to 
consult their books of reference and settle the question then 
and there. 
This material was most stimulating to the pupils, and there- 
fore capable of extended use, in a variety of ways. Its in- 
fluence in modifying the curriculum may be far-reaching, 
so closely is it connected with many school subjects, with 
economics, and the whole social environment. It may be 
used as material for debates, essays, and dramatic presenta- 
tions. It cannot fail to appeal to children who are faced with 
the necessity of choosing for or against wage-earning and who 
hear the subject of work, its conditions, its hardships, and 
its rewards, constantly under discussion in their homes. 
VOCATIONAL PROBLEM OF THE DULL CHILD 
The greatest problem of the counselor is the dull normal 
child. Usually these pupils have lost two or three grades of 
work by failing to pass, because the academic type of work 
offers them no interest or stimulus. If the school is psycho- 
logically graded as it should be, they are in groups, and pre- 
sumably have progressed at the same rate as their classmates. 
But after we have urged them to stay in school until gradua- 
tion, what can we offer them? Only one of the three main 
junior high school courses, — general, technical, or commer- 
cial, whose content is the same as that which failed to interest
-P-A-G-E-293
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 265 
them in the elementary school, and which have in addition 
more exacting requirements from the point of view of accom- 
plishment. We have pointed out that the trade schools re- 
ject all pupils who do not graduate from the elementary school. 
Furthermore, many of these dull normal children have little 
manual dexterity and little mechanical skill. 
The technique for giving occupational material to dull 
normal children has yet to be developed. The ordinary aca- 
demic, theoretical method of presentation, used with success 
in the bright classes, has been no more successful with the 
dull normal children than was the presentation of the three 
R’s by the same method. The counselor must, therefore, 
call upon the skillful teacher for help in organizing occupational 
material for presentation to slow children. Since we have no 
high school or trade school courses that appeal to or will ac- 
cept this type of pupil, it is difficult to know how to focus the 
subject to any practical end. How to use the lessons for 
the stimulation of these pupils in their ordinary academic 
work must be the task of some ingenious pedagogue. It is 
noticeable that dull normal pupils are frequently able to con- 
tribute specific facts about wages, hours, and conditions of 
labor more readily than the younger bright pupil, possibly 
because many of them have been at work during vacations 
and after school, and the subject has more reality for them. 
The junior high school fails, as did the elementary school, 
to provide for these pupils. They should be offered the op- 
portunity to leave the academic type of education in 7A, the 
grade in which drop-outs are most frequent. At this point, 
alternative courses should be introduced. For instance, the 
school should offer a simple commercial course which would 
prepare them for routine clerical work of the kind so exten- 
sively demanded in offices, or a course in selling which would 
help them in the keeping of a small shop, a career to which  
-P-A-G-E-294
    266 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
many of them are destined. For the dull normal child with 
manual skill, whom the trade school now rejects because he 
cannot complete the elementary academic school, the school 
ought to provide a modified trade course, which would serve 
the purpose of finding out what work in the skilled or semi- 
skilled trades he can do, and which would prepare him for such 
work. Thus he might be saved the year and a half, or two 
years, which he loses while stumbling along in the ordinary 
curriculum and accumulating an unhealthy sense of failure. 
If the course of study were sufficiently differentiated in 
the early grades, the chances of his surviving and enrolling 
in such special courses as have here been suggested would be 
all the better. A modified curriculum and some variety in 
hand work should be provided for the child from the moment 
he enters the first grade. The school should honestly confess 
that it does not know as yet what a six-year-old child can do 
and likes to do, and should devote a year or two to the task of 
finding out. The work of the young children in the shop was 
a revelation to the teachers as well as to everyone who saw it. 
They were given regular tools, somewhat smaller in size, real 
work benches of suitable height, and small handlooms, and 
they learned with surprising rapidity what to do with them. 
On the whole they seemed to be better adapted to, and much 
happier in, the shop work than they had been previously in 
“the classroom. We assume that the psychological classifi- 
cation has been carried out and that the children then progress 
through school without the annual human sacrifice known as 
non-promotion. The brightest children are given the same 
amount of shop work as the others; and the dull normal chil- 
dren are given a curriculum which makes successful school 
achievement a possible experience for them. When they 
reach the years of the junior high school, the work of voca- 
tional guidance can be taken up on the basis of real educational
-P-A-G-E-295
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 267 
guidance and carried through with an appreciation of individ- 
ual differences to which we are still, in spite of our best ef- 
forts, more or less blind. 
The relation of the vocational counselor to the disciplinary 
case may, and often is, extremely helpful, but it is not funda- 
mental. The school which allows a child to become the ob- 
ject of a reformatory technique by the time he reaches the 7A 
grade is primarily responsible. The child who wants to go to 
work at his earliest opportunity is obviously in most cases 
not interested in school. It means nothing to him and is 
merely an obstacle between him and his goal, which is to get 
a job andearnsome money. The determination of his parents 
to send him to work is often not so much for economic reasons 
as a recognition of the fact that he is not succeeding in school, 
that he is over-age, that he does not want to go to the high 
school, and that — most decisive factor of all — he is too big 
to stay in school. The ranks of the truants and disciplinary 
cases of all kinds are recruited from the dull normal children. 
We have already noted the lack of provision for these pupils 
and suggested tentative changes in the curriculum for them. 
If such changes were made we might hope to see a diminution 
of truancy and delinquency. 
To justify this belief there are records of the cases of several 
boys who had been pushed over the edge in the academic 
struggle and who came back again by way of individual treat- 
ment and adapted work. One of these boys was transferred 
from a traditional academic school from which he could bring 
not a solitary good recommendation. He not only became a 
good mechanical draftsman, but finished the work of the 9B 
grade before leaving. Naturally he had no trouble in finding 
a job, which he supplemented by teaching mechanical drawing 
in the evening. Another boy came directly from a disciplinary 
school and found his place in the machine shop. He finished 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
  268 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 2 
the elementary school course and incidently drew plans and 
built a gasoline engine which functioned perfectly. The 
opportunity to be considered as an individual and to do crea- 
tive work on any plane at all rarely fails to bring a wholesome 
response. 
CONTACTS WITH PARENTS 
Dealing as we were forced to do, with grades whose register 
ran from 275 to 300 pupils, the counselor had not the time to 
establish contacts with the parents. The final decision often 
rests with the parent, yet it was possible to talk with only 
a small number where the cases were most urgent. Most of 
the erroneous impressions which the children had in regard to 
vocations either came from the parents or were shared by them. 
In a neighborhood of foreign-born people, speaking little or 
no English, an adequate acquaintance with modern industry 
was not to be expected. Hence, the school must reach out 
to inform these parents in regard to economic possibilities 
for their children. Under ideal circumstances, the principal 
and teachers would see and know them all; the atmosphere 
of the school would encourage them to come frequently and 
talk with teachers and counselors about their plans for their 
children. But neither school nor parents have the time nec- 
essary for this. It was customary for the parents to meet with 
the principal once during the term to discuss various matters 
regarding school work, graduation, etc. This meeting was 
largely taken up with a discussion of the place of vocational 
guidance in the school, a description of the different high school 
and trade school courses, and an explanation of the reasons 
for keeping children in school as long as possible. 
Several small pamphlets addressed to parents and telling 
of the requirements of business and industrial occupations 
were prepared. They emphasized the necessity of education 
for work, if success is to follow, and stressed the advantage
-P-A-G-E-297
  VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 269 
of skill and training which must often be acquired at a low 
wage over a high initial wage in a job where no skill is gained. 
They urged upon parents the necessity of getting information 
about modern occupations on the one hand, and finding out 
about the individual abilities of their children on the other 
hand. These leaflets also gave, in a condensed form, infor- 
mation about the different courses available in the senior high 
schools and the trade schools. They brought to the attention 
of the parents the fact that there was a vocational counselor 
in the school who would give them information and advice. 
While the material in these pamphlets might need to be 
changed in many ways from time to time, they were cer- 
tainly a step in the right direction. The series of four was 
translated into Yiddish and Italian for the convenience of 
the two largest groups of our non-English-speaking parents. 
COUNSELING THE INDIVIDUAL 
In the long run, the test of the vocational counselor’s work 
is its value to the individual. The boy of fourteen, faced 
with a choice of an academic, commercial, or technical course 
—a salesmanship, textile, or trade school course — may well 
blunder and make mistakes, costly in loss of time and ambi- 
tion. The boy who must go to work is often in need of ad- 
vice as to his choice of possible jobs and in need of help in his 
selection of evening school courses. Still another boy who 
has not intended to continue in day school may be persuaded 
to do so when certain courses are brought to his attention of 
which he has never heard but which, nevertheless, may help 
to fit him for what he intends to do. Each boy presents a 
special problem, no matter how many elements it may have 
in common with those of other boys in the same situation. 
This fact must be reflected in the professional attitude and 
method of the counselor, which is fundamentally different from 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  270 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
that of the class teacher. Anyone who deals with individuals 
has a different technique from one who deals with groups. 
This does not mean that the counselor did not need all the 
accurate objective facts about the individual that were ob- 
tainable. Her resources of this nature were as follows : 
1. The questionnaire. — This paper, filled out by each 
pupil, recorded his family background and home conditions, 
his ambitions and interests, and his reactions to school life. 
For instance, the mere fact of whether he was the oldest or the 
youngest child in the family had an important bearing on his 
prospects for continuing in school. 
2. His past school record. — This record showed his at- 
tendance, conduct, and scholarship marks; from it could be 
determined any special proficiency or deficiency in subjects, 
the number of grades skipped or repeated, and the amount 
and the quality of his shop work. 
3. The teacher’s estimate.— The class teacher was con- 
sulted regarding the pupil’s ability and possible success in 
his choice of future work. Except with outstanding children, 
the overburdened teacher of the departmental system cannot 
make the careful observation which would give her judgment 
any decisive weight. She prefers, indeed, to leave this re- 
sponsibility to the counselor. Teachers of special subjects 
were often able to throw light on a child’s special ability, and 
coéperation from outside teachers of music and drawing and 
modeling was enlisted on behalf of a few pupils who were 
planning to become musicians, artists, or sculptors. 
4. The visiting teacher’s report. —In cases where the visit- 
ing teacher had dealt with a child, an intimate picture of his 
deficiencies or maladjustments was obtainable. Her report 
on the home and family conditions was of great help. This 
was also the principal source from which reliable character 
data could be obtained.
-P-A-G-E-299
  
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 271 
5. The psychological tests. — Every child was given a group 
test for general intelligence. The results of the group test 
were supplemented in many instances, and always in the case 
of problematical children, by the results of an individual test. 
6. The counselor's impressions. — These impressions were 
noted in writing during the interview. 
INTELLIGENCE OF HIGH SCHOOL CHILDREN 
The method of using the psychological data needs some 
special explanation here since it represents the newest and 
least familiar resource on the list. Recommendations for 
educational guidance were based on a survey made upon groups 
of students in typical high school courses in New York City. 
The results of this survey are recapitulated in Table XXVI1

ured by the Otis Test,” Journal of Applied Psychology, June, 1922. Page 185. 
The Otis Group Intelligence Test, on which Table XXVI is based, has given 
satisfactory results with high school and eighth grade pupils. The National 
Intelligence Group Test, to which extensive reference was made in previous 
chapters, is very good between grades 4 and 7. Below grade 4, individual 
Terman Tests should always be given.  
-P-A-G-E-300
272 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
that is, the academic and technical groups were eighth 
term students, and the commercial, industrial arts, and 
dressmaking groups were sixth term students. They there- 
fore represented the survivors and presumably those best 
adapted to the course in which they had persisted to its 
scheduled end. 
A comparison of the intelligence ratings of these different 
groups indicates the following conclusions: The high school 
academic course adapts itself to students with intelligence 
above the average for those of their age. The special courses, 
such as the commercial, the technical, the industrial arts, 
and the dressmaking require general intelligence of an average 
and high average degree. None of these courses, including 
those which have vocational training for their purpose, are 
adapting their work to students of a general intelligence below 
the average. Such a student would have but one chance in 
150 to graduate from an academic course, but three times 
as many chances to graduate from a technical course, and 
five times as many chances to graduate from a commercial 
course. It is evident that the low average and the dull 
normal child have slender prospects for survival. Indeed, 
their chances of merely entering such courses are little better, 
as is shown by the survey of first term students reported 
in the same study. Among the first term students the range 
of intelligence was average or high average for all the special 
courses. 
This picture of the mental status of the high school student 
has its definite implications for the vocational adviser. But 
since she is always dealing with the individual, she has always 
_to bear in mind that any particular child may be able, by virtue 
of his personality traits, to become one of that small fraction 
of persons who accomplish something in spite of the fact that 
they have no statistical right to do so.
-P-A-G-E-301
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 273 
The goal in advising the individual is to find the most diffi- 
cult thing that he can undertake without becoming discour- 
aged, and therefore futile, in his undertaking. There are 
humane but mistaken critics of the psychological tests who 
fear that the vocational counselor may be induced by their 
results to direct too many children into inferior occupations. 
So far as our observation is concerned, there is no ground for 
such a bogey. It is only natural that the counselor should 
stimulate the individual child to want to do more rather than 
to do less. The aim is to set him at work in a course or at 
an occupational task where his possibilities of success are 
sufficient to give reasonable ground for hoping that he may 
fully realize them. 
As we have pointed out in an earlier chapter, it is not in- 
ferior intelligence which makes people feel inferior. On the 
contrary, careers which are often wrecked by inferiority feel- 
ings are those of individuals who have a high degree of intelli- 
gence. The blacksmith is not necessarily unhappy because 
he is not a judge; the gas man is not necessarily downhearted 
because he is not a doctor. It is the inward sense of failure 
and ineffectiveness which wrecks human lives and which can 
be avoided by any and every degree of intelligence if family 
and school influences are shaped to that end. The dull normal 
boy can be just as serene about his inability to do bank dis- 
count, and should be, as you can be about your inability to 
write as good a play as Hamlet. But if someone were at your 
elbow day by day urging you to write a masterpiece and mark- 
ing you down as a failure every week and month in which you 
did not perform the task, it would inevitably and completely 
break down your personal morale. The state of demorali- 
zation which is produced in the dull child by the goad of the 
curriculum is of this gratuitous nature. The psychological 
test introduces, for the first time, an authoritative element
-P-A-G-E-302
  
  274 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
in the school situation which tends to do away with the mis: 
chievous prodding which enfeebles the character of a child 
without improving his scholarship. 
THE PLACE OF THE VOCATIONAL TEST 
The question is sometimes raised, whether the general in- 
telligence test which gives a basis for educational guidance is 
equally suitable as a basis for vocational guidance. In our 
school, only a limited use was made of special ability tests, 
The only experiments attempted in this direction were the 
application of the Stenquist Mechanical Test and the Thurston 
Clerical Test. These were both given to the junior high school 
pupils. 
The Stenquist Mechanical Test aims to test mechanical 
ability as a special ability without regard to general intelli- 
gence; but as it comes out, the pupils of high IQ passed it 
better than any of the others, and so on throughout the range 
of IQ’s. This bore out the idea set forth in an earlier chapter 
of this study, that the mechanical and intellectual abilities 
of children tend to have a high degree of correlation. It is 
not practical to classify a child as of a mechanical or an 
intellectual type, although it is possible that his interest may 
be more decidedly placed on the one type of activity than on 
the other. The Stenquist Mechanical Test is not so much a 
measure of interest as a measure of ability. It may profitably 
be added to the general intelligence test in the junior high 
schéol, but not with any over-confident expectation that it 
will differentiate reliably between the future engineer and the 
future professor of philosophy. 
The Thurstone Clerical Test aims to test speed and accu- 
racy in handling clerical work and includes some common sense 
questions. It requires an hour for giving, and it is rather 
hard even for high school pupils. In fact, it is almost an adult
-P-A-G-E-303
  
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 275 
test. Its advantages for the employer are clear, since any 
number of persons may take it at the same time and it re- 
quires little supervision. In the junior high school, it does 
not give its best results, as the pupils are still too immature 
to possess the special skill involved. 
In this connection it may be noted that tests for special 
ability in business and industry have little value for the edu- 
cator and scarcely more for the vocational counselor, because 
they aim to test training in addition to aptitude for training. 
For this reason, the development and application of such 
tests are the affair of business and industry rather than of 
education. Research along these lines should be financed 
by business and industrial enterprise. As a matter of fact, 
such research is being actively carried on by a series of well- 
staffed institutes. Successful vocational tests enable the 
employer to save money and have, from this point of view, 
a great economic value. The school, however, has no interest 
in specializing the child; its real business is to protect him 
against the premature specialization which modern economic 
life threatens more and more to force upon him. The de- 
velopment of trade tests is a special department of psychology 
which finds its most legitimate and effective application in the 
problem of the adult worker. Special trade tests have little 
relation to the school child of any age. 
In the history of psychological testing, the vocational test 
preceded the general intelligence test by a number of years. 
In the laboratories of the experimental psychologists, a series 
of psycho-physical reactions were studied and standardized, 
with the aim that special abilities for certain occupations 
might by this means be detected. But these efforts found 
no legitimate application in the field of education. The first 
psychological norms of which education could make any use 
were based on the age-level as first standardized by Binet. 
 
-P-A-G-E-304
  
276 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
From this time on, the development of tests for general in- 
telligence has made far greater progress than that of special 
vocational tests, of which, up to that time, such high hopes 
had been entertained. It is noteworthy that the army, when 
confronted by the necessity of employing 100,000 men effi- 
ciently, fell back primarily on intelligence tests for guidance. 
By comparison, very little work was done with the vocational 
tests. Adults though they were, and coming as they did from 
every variety of occupation, the men were directed in their 
tasks chiefly according to the broad classifications of a general 
intelligence scale. 
The problem of testing for special aptitudes remains a prob- 
lem we have scarcely begun to conquer. The influence of 
emotional interest on the development of special ability is 
something for which, as yet, no adequate measure has been 
devised. Within the school this influence is sufficiently ap- 
parent in the child’s success or lack of success in school sub- 
jects. This suggests that it may be an equally important 
element in the vocational career of the adult. In any case, 
the emotional trend should always receive consideration as 
a possible factor in superior skill or talent of any kind. 
THE CURRICULUM AS A VOCATIONAL TEST 
In the present stage of educational developments, perhaps 
the best kind of vocational testing lies in the use of the junior 
high school curriculum for that purpose. The differentiation 
in courses should serve that end. In the 7B grade, the pupil 
must choose one of the following courses: the academic, the 
technical, the commercial, or sometimes the industrial course. 
The original purpose and ideal of the junior high school was 
that the seventh, eighth, and ninth years were to be a try-out 
period, offering a variety of courses with which the child might 
experiment in an effort to find himself. The actual result
-P-A-G-E-305
  
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING 277 
in practice has been to force his decision at the end of the 
seventh year and to make it difficult, even in a liberal school, 
because of administrative routine, for the pupil to shift from 
one course to another. ® 
Means should be found to break up this rigidity; the or- 
ganization should be elastic enough to permit the necessary 
transfers to be made with the principal’s consent. In other 
words, the child of twelve to fourteen should not choose any 
particular course, but should be allowed to experiment with 
all of them. If no other way can be devised to make this 
practical, it should be arranged that all the children should 
take all the courses somewhere between 6A and 9B. This 
would help to do away with the temptation to regard the 
junior high school as a place where trade training may prop- 
erly be given. It is essential that general education should 
continue up through the 9B grade and on through the contin- . 
uation classes, and that even the concrete occupational ma- 
terial introduced during these years should have an educational 
emphasis. 
To require the mass of children to make a vocational choice 
and stick to it is to force an adult attitude prematurely upon 
the adolescent. It is the familiar error into which all edu- 
cation seems so prone to fall: the effort to hasten the process 
of growth, to short-cut the individual’s development in order 
to serve some theoretical and uncertain end of his maturity. 
From the educational point of view, nothing is more important 
than that the child should acquire, not this or that particular 
technique in his adolescent years, but should strengthen in 
himself the attitude of adjustability and the habits on which 
his learning capacity depends. Experiment is the normal 
mood of adolescence. The mere fact of changing from one 
occupation to another gives him one kind of training that he 
needs. We must face the fact that the occupational world
-P-A-G-E-306
  278 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
is rapidly changing and making new demands upon the worker. 
The old-fashioned craft in which a man spent his lifetime no 
longer exists. Whatever our children may look forward to 
today as a chosen occupation may at any moment suddenly 
be altered beyond recognition by strange new inventions and 
fresh engineering developments. It is well to educate the 
adolescent for stability in the sense of teaching him the neces- 
sity of not becoming a casual worker. But the youth who 
learns to do several things well has not only a better-balanced 
education, but better chances for survival in the fluctuating 
economic world created by the machine age in which we live. 
There should never be any arrangement in school whereby 
a boy can, by early injudicious choice, cut himself off from 
school at any point. As the junior high school courses are 
now planned, this is all too easily accomplished. By choosing 
certain schedules at the age of eleven or twelve, he can cut 
himself off from going to high school. This is all the more un- 
desirable in a neighborhood like that in which our experi- 
mental school was located, where the economic conditions 
of the family are so variable. The boy who looks forward 
to high school as an impossible expense one year may be able 
to afford it the following year. This is only another of the 
many reasons why the effects of a hard-and-fast choice should 
not be prepared for children by the established organization 
of the junior high school. In the further interest of flexi- 
bility, the work should be programmed by subjects and not 
by classes, as this would make it easier for children to go ahead 
at differing rates of speed. The utmost elasticity of detail 
needs to be achieved in order to prevent the heavy adolescent 
mortality of which the junior high school is at present the 
melancholy scene. 
In a story which is beautifully told by the Swiss novelist, 
Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, there appears in the rdle of hero
-P-A-G-E-307
VOCATIONAL COUNSELING ~ 279 
an unusual figure, that of a slow-witted but high-minded 
youth. Le bel idiot, as the story is entitled, relates the 
tragedy of a dull boy’s life, which is consistently and con- 
scientiously devastated in the name of education. He had 
a well-developed body and great personal beauty, was an 
excellent wrestler and fencer, and possessed both physical 
and moral courage of a high order. But lessons were too 
hard for. him and at sixteen he was stuck among the little 
boys. The youth longed to enter the campaign with his 
father, who was a marshal under Louis XIV; but the father, 
who prided himself on his stern discipline and parental con- 
science, insisted that the boy should finish his schooling. The 
true pathos of this situation and the tragedy of its end are 
given with a psychological insight and a vividness of detail 
which make the story not only a work of art but a real con- 
tribution to the problem of education. 
It might well be read by all educators and social workers 
who enter so enthusiastically into the stay-in-school cam- 
paigns and strive to prolong the period of compulsory school 
attendance. We cannot afford to neglect the supplementary 
and equally obligatory effort which seeks to make the school 
a place where the adolescent may be happy. The best evi- 
dence that the junior high school is fulfilling its function is 
the measure in which it succeeds in becoming such a place.  
-P-A-G-E-308
CHAPTER XII 
HeattH EDUCATION 
Although we have dwelt at such length on the mental and 
emotional aspects of the child’s education, this does not mean 
that his physical needs were forgotten in our experiment in 
Public School 64. So far as our facilities extended, and these 
were increased, as in all the other branches of the experiment, 
by codperation with outside agencies, the health problem was 
attacked from a number of different angles. A group of 
special classes in the school was set apart for corrective and 
preventive work in health education. 
In one respect, these classes and health considerations gener- 
ally took first place in the school. If a child was found to have 
physical defects, the first thing done for him was to try to 
remedy these. The health classification took precedence over 
any other. The anemic or cardiac child, no matter what his 
IQ, went into the special class where his physical handicap 
received primary attention. If a Terman child was seriously 
underweight, he was sent to the country regardless of whether 
he made eight terms in six or not. The removal of physical 
defects and the improvement of physical health were a regu- 
lar part of the school program, and school time was systemat- 
ically devoted to this essential feature of the child’s education. 
Within recent years, various facts have been brought to 
light which show the urgent need of health education in the 
public schools. In the selective draft, a million young men, 
more than one-third of the entire draft, were rejected because 
280
-P-A-G-E-309
  
  HEALTH EDUCATION 281 
of physical defects. In the public schools, it has been es- 
timated by various authorities that three-fourths of the chil- 
dren are physically defective. A current report by the Chil- 
dren’s Bureau on the physical status of pre-school children in 
Gary, Indiana, states that the exact proportion of young chil- 
dren with physical defects was found to be 95 per cent of 
those examined. We need not raise the question why the 
proportion of undefective individuals fell from two-thirds in 
the draft to one-fourth in the school, and declined from this to 
one-twentieth among young children in the home. Probably 
a difference in standards had a great deal to do with the differ- 
ing results. The draft examined about three million young 
men, while the Gary survey examined three thousand children ; 
doubtless the latter followed a more thorough and intensive 
schedule. We can hardly hope, as much as we should like to 
do so, that school life has such a favorable influence on the 
health of the child, and that economic life enhances this favor- 
able influence to the extent indicated by the foregoing per- 
centages. In any case, the fact that three-quarters of the 
school children have physical defects which are largely remedi- 
able and preventable, points to.the need of positive health 
work in the schools. 
The ordinary provision made for medical inspection is far 
from sufficient. In New York City, a Board of Health physi- 
cian is assigned approximately to 10,000 children. The nurse 
has the same number in her care. In actual practice, the 
doctor visits each school about three times a month and on 
these occasions gives about three hours to the school. In the 
circumstances, the physician hopes at best to reach every 
child once in three years for an examination. Even then, haste 
is so necessary that only superficial or highly specialized re- 
sults can be achieved. What the medical examiner and the 
school nurse have done has been chiefly in the field of epidemic
-P-A-G-E-310
282 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
control. Nowadays the public school has little cause to fear 
the spread of infectious or contagious disease; the child is 
well insured against a great variety of plagues which threat- 
ened his ancestors. 
Health education in the schools, like any other kind of 
education, does not get very far unless the teacher takes part. 
Even if the doctor saw the child much oftener than once in 
three years, his supervision would need to be supplemented by 
the continuous observation of the teacher. The more obvious 
physical defects of children should be her immediate concern. 
The Department of Physical Education of the Board of Educa- 
tion has made it a matter of routine that every teacher shall 
be trained to recognize such matters as eye defects, adenoids, 
faulty hearing, carious teeth, and malnutrition. Once a year, 
in the fall, a health week is set apart, during which these in- 
formal and non-technical health surveys take the most prom- 
inent place in the school program. ‘The teacher prepares for 
the school physician a list of children needing immediate 
attention. In this way, many of them are brought in con- 
tact with the health authorities earlier than the routine exam- 
ination would have brought them. 
Diagnosis is, of course, not the teacher’s job. But she is 
furnished with a few objective standards and is trained to feel 
a responsibility for applying them. More and more the de- 
velopment of health education is coming to depend on the 
interest and codperation of non-technical people — teachers, 
social workers, parents — all those in habitual contact with the 
child have a special responsibility for training in those health 
habits on which, in the last analysis, health chiefly depends. 
The regular curriculum of our school required that five 
hours a week should be devoted to corrective gymnastics and 
to games and athletics. A two-minute drill was carried out 
with open windows at the end of each hour in the classroom.
-P-A-G-E-311
HEALTH EDUCATION 283 
The regular gymnasium in the basement was far from ade- 
quate; fortunately the lack was met by the Boys’ Club, 
Christodora House, and the Tompkins Square playground, 
with all of which our school codperated. The school baths, 
however, were able to take care of a large proportion of the 
3000 children every week. There was a certain amount of 
opposition to the bathing from foreign-born parents. At 
first mothers appeared in the principal’s office to protest, ‘““My 
son is too delicate”; or ‘‘We have a bath-tub at home.” But 
it was not difficult, especially with the aid of the boys’ own 
enthusiasm, to remove these objections. Thanks to the pub- 
lic school bath, the sewed-up child, who was so popular in 
East Side fiction a few years ago, has entirely vanished from 
the scene. 
Swimming was also a regular part of the physical training 
of the school. The Boys’ Club provided an excellent swim- 
ming pool and the Board of Education furnished a teacher. 
Two entire week days at the Club were given up to our school, 
allowing swimming periods for five or six classes a day. Some 
of the special classes, as we have mentioned in a former chap- 
ter, had a swimming period every day. With the dull normal 
class and the neurotic class, the value of the swimming pool 
as an educational influence was especially appreciated. In 
general, the plan was that no boy should graduate from the 
eighth grade without having learned to swim. 
THE DENTAL CLINIC 
The dental clinic maintained by the Red Cross was one of 
the most valuable contributions towards the physical care of 
the children. As our school was crowded, we asked Christo- 
dora House to give space for this clinic. A dental hygienist 
was constantly in charge and the dentist was there for half 
time. We began with the kindergarten children and system- 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
  
  284 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
atically followed through all the classes up through the third 
year. The dental hygienist would take the children from the 
classroom, put them in the chair, clean their teeth, and mark 
cavities for filling. The Terman classes and the nutrition 
group were looked after by a neighborhood dentist 1 who gave 
several mornings a week to them. There is great need for a 
permanently established dental clinic in the school, and this 
experiment showed how much could be accomplished in a 
short time by systematic work. It is one of the most strategic 
measures in conserving children’s health. 
THE EYE CLINIC 
The eye clinic, fortunately located in the school, was one 
of seven maintained by the Bureau of Child Hygiene of the 
Board of Health. This type of work is not usually done in the 
public schools until the third year. The value of a thorough 
examination at the very beginning of school life, however, was 
shown by the fact that about 27 per cent of the six-year-old 
children were found by this clinic to need to have immedi- 
ate attention given to their eyes. The teachers were trained 
in the use of the Snellen eye-charts and were thus able to 
make a first rough selection of the cases needing clinical care. 
METHODS OF HEALTH TEACHING 
Experiments in methods of teaching health material were 
necessarily incomplete, though a few satisfactory demonstra- 
tions were made. Various devices to interest the children in 
proper food were used successfully, such as stories, rhymes, 
and posters. The health clown made occasional visits and 
his popularity showed that it was possible to give health 
talks in a palatable form to children of all ages. It also 
pointed to the need of a regular health worker in the school, 
1 Dr. L. A. Leichter.
-P-A-G-E-313
HEALTH EDUCATION 285 
who would organize the work in such a way that the stimulus 
given by a popular health ‘“‘stunt” or a health week should be 
carried over into a regular scheme of health teaching in the 
school. 
Concerning the physical defects of young children gener- 
ally, there is a tendency among adults to fall back on the easy- 
going theory that the child will outgrow them. This philos- 
ophy has obvious advantages but can easily be carried too far. 
The school needs a non-technical health worker who will in- 
terpret to parents the technical examination and its recom- 
mendations, and help them to discriminate between what may 
be left to the unaided outgrowing process and what should be 
scientifically corrected. 
As with the vocational material, the health material was 
correlated in some cases with other subjects. A class of young 
children became a cooking class and a nutrition class at the 
same time, the children preparing lunches for themselves and 
using in this connection what they had learned about food in 
the nutrition class. It was in the nutrition work that the 
class method was especially developed, this method being one 
of the principal contributions of that experiment. 
In the organization of the school, three types of special 
classes were provided for children with physical handicaps: 
the anemic or open-air classes, the nutrition classes, and the 
cardiac classes. 
THE OPEN-AIR CLASS 
The open-air classes, like the other special classes in the 
school, were limited to twenty-five members. Their organi- 
zation and work were similar to those of other open-air classes 
in the public schools. The children were selected from the 
regular classes and included those from families in which 
some member had died of tuberculosis or was afflicted 
with it, cases of extreme malnutrition, and cases of chorea. 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
  286 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
The children were taught the elements of health education in 
respect to food, study, play, and sleep. Each child was the 
possessor of a health chart, on which were recorded his weekly 
gains or losses in weight, hours of going to bed, amount of 
coffee or tea drinking, and physical defects needing to be 
remedied or having been remedied. The scales were used to 
teach the children, through actual demonstration, that giving 
up tea and coffee caused them to gain in weight. At first it 
was hard to persuade the children to enter these classes; but 
parents soon came to realize their value and would often ask 
to have their other children admitted, even though these were 
not anemic. 
THE NUTRITION EXPERIMENT 
The nutrition experiment, like the excellent work of the 
dental hygienist, was of all too brief duration. It was carried 
on for two and a half years by the Bureau of Educational 
Experiments, which has published a complete account of the 
undertaking and its results. The experiment was adapted 
from the nutrition work developed in the Massachusetts 
General Hospital under Dr. Wm. R. P. Emerson, who was 
also associated with the first year of its innovation in Public 
School 64. The purpose was to introduce the methods of the 
hospital nutrition clinic within the educational procedure of 
the public school. This was a very thorough piece of re- 
search work, although it did not progress to the point of 
becoming a general health program. The ‘“‘class method,” 
which was demonstrated, formed a contribution to the more 
definitely educational problem of the school experiment. 
The following statement occurs in the report :! 
The health program of the school, if it is to be developed in accord- 
ance with educational conceptions of the present day, must conform to 
the general thesis that the child’s environment shall afford the conditions

HEALTH EDUCATION 287 
for certain necessary experiences, and that his intelligent codperation 
with regard to these experiences must be secured; it must give to the 
school and to the individual child within the school a creative attitude 
toward the problem of health; it must function appreciably in better 
habits of health and in better individual well-being. 
In its practical methods, the nutrition class conformed to 
this theory. It added another illustration to that already 
furnished by the ungraded department: that the special class 
may develop a really scientific pedagogical technique as soon 
as the three R’s cease to be its sole excuse for being. In these 
special classes it was found possible to give the child experi- 
ences, to teach him on the basis of these experiences, and to 
observe the results of such teaching in his personal develop- 
ment. It may be noted that-all such special classes were 
limited to not more than twenty-five children. This was an 
important element in their successful achievements ; but even 
more important was the release which came from teaching 
subject-matter still unhampered by traditional methods and 
formalistic values. 
As with most of the experiments in the school, the nutrition 
class was first tried out with the older children. On the theory 
that these children could codperate more intelligently, the 
first classes were organized from the fifth grade up. ‘The 
Terman classes were included in this group. Later on two 
entire open-air classes were converted into nutrition classes, 
an arrangement which greatly facilitated the work with both 
types. At the beginning of the second year it was decided to 
experiment with the first grade children. All the children in 
the September entering class were weighed and measured in 
their first week of school. Those who were more than 7 per 
cent underweight were placed in a special class and health 
was made the center of their curriculum. 
The procedure of the experiment was simple. It employed 
a laboratory method and taught the child to make experiments
-P-A-G-E-316
  288 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
on himself. The children were selected by the height-weight- 
age tables 1 which have grown increasingly familiar within the 
past few years and which should be in the hands of all teachers 
and parents. The children were given a careful stripped ex- 
amination by a physician, and special defects, such as adenoids, 
bad tonsils, and carious teeth were first of all taken care of. 
The children were taught to understand calories and a diet 
of 2000 calories was recommended. ‘To insure this average 
amount a midmorning lunch was supplied by Christodora 
House, as the school had no lunch-room of its own. The 
midday meal was also supplied here for certain groups of 
children and the gymnasium was used for the daily rest 
period prescribed for every underweight child. 
Each child was supplied with a booklet containing a list 
of common foods in roo-calorie portions. In this book he 
kept a record of his own food habits, which were discussed 
with the nutrition worker at the end of each week and re- 
vised during the following week. He was also given an in- 
dividual chart on which his physical status was recorded from 
week to week, so that any gain was at once visualized. These 
charts were also helpful in enlisting the interest and codpera- 
tion of the children’s mothers. With the six-year-old children, 
much of this responsibility was of necessity taken over by the 
mothers, although the young children were also led by the use 
of scales and charts to feel themselves a factor in their own 
' progress. An effort was made to have the mothers attend the 
weekly class meetings, which was successful to some extent. 
But the codperation of the home was chiefly sought and ob- 
tained by home visiting. Since the scheme was primarily 
educational in its purpose, it would have been consistent with 
the plan if all the food had been supplied by the home. But 
1 The Burk-Boas Tables were used in this experiment. Similar scales may 
be obtained from The American Child Health Association, Washington, D. C.
-P-A-G-E-317
HEALTH EDUCATION 289 
some school feeding was undertaken in order to insure the 
amount and kind of food that was recommended. This was 
understood, however, by the children and their parents, to be 
a necessity of the experiment and not a charity. 
The full results of the nutrition experiment need not be 
given here, as they may be read in detail in the report to which 
reference has been made. However, two of its outstanding 
features may be mentioned. 
A comparison of the gains made by the several different 
groups showed that the greatest gain of all was made by the 
Terman groups and the next greatest by the six-year-old chil- 
dren. The data were analyzed by the staff and the following 
reasons were suggested : 
The distinguishing feature of the Terman group is its intelligence 
(measured by a special standard), and this may be supposed to have 
made the instruction given it more effective. An intelligent over-con- 
trol of the environment by adults is one of the goals set by our at- 
tempted program. To such an over-control the intelligent self-control 
of the Terman group might be said to approximate. The eager-minded 
and participatory attitude of these children toward all their school ac- 
tivities ensured better codperation on their part than could be obtained 
from children of the regular grades. Thus, intelligence-in the group, 
or in direct application to the control of the group, is suggested as one 
explanation of the satisfactory results they achieved... . 
Second only to the gain made by the Terman class is the record of 
the first-grade children, yet their program included only the provisions 
for physical care and instruction and was considered by members of the 
staff the least satisfactory of any afforded. Because the program of 
instruction was ill-adapted to their age period, increased necessity for 
codperation from the home was felt by the staff, and therefore much 
greater effort was made to interest the mothers and secure their attend- 
ance at the class sessions. Our efforts were reinforced by the greater 
readiness of parents to maintain intelligent control and lend codperation 
to special efforts on behalf of young children.. Thus better environ- 
mental control was secured for this group than we were able to secure for 
the others, and the special factor of intelligence in the Terman group was 
paralleled, in the case of the first grade, by the factor of adult super- 
vision.

Nutrition Class. Pages 53-55. Dutton, New York, 1921.

290 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
A special feature of the nutrition experiment was the study 
of comparative mental ability among under-nourished and 
well-nourished children. The individual physical examina- 
tion of the underweight children was supplemented by an in- 
dividual psychological examination, in which a series of special 
tests were given in addition to the usual tests given in the 
school. The same physical examinations and mental tests 
were given to a control group of normal children, and the 
results compared. They indicated the equality, if not the 
superiority, of the under-nourished children. The groups 
were so small and the average scores showed so little difference 
that positive conclusions cannot be drawn from the tests. 
The study of the under-nourished children may be said to have 
yielded negative results, so far as any causal relationship be- 
tween malnutrition and mental inefficiency is concerned. 
In this connection, the report states : 
Aside from extreme cases of malnutrition, of prolonged hurger or 
starvation, which like other pathological states, would cause disintegra- 
tion, we cannot say that malnutrition irrespective of other factors 
produces or runs hand in hand with mental defectiveness. In many 
types of mental processes the reactions of the under-nourished child 
are equal or superior to the average of his age group. The traits in 
which he may prove less capable seem to be resistance to fatigue under 
response to uninterrupted or complex stimuli, and exaggerated emotional 
responses under normal stimulation. A problem worthy of study both 
for the under-nourished and for the hearty child is fatigue, with special 
reference to the period of recovery.! 
THE CARDIAC CLASS 
The special classes for cardiac children were established in 
1919. Public interest in the problem of heart disease had 
been greatly stimulated during the preceding years by reports 
from the army and surveys from the public schools. It was 
found that thirty in every thousand men examined by the 
1 Hunt, J. L., Johnson, B. J., and Lincoln, E.M. Health Education and the 
Nutrition Class. Pages 212-213. Dutton, New York, 1921.

HEALTH EDUCATION 291 
draft had heart defects and that probably 150,000 deaths in 
the country every year were due to cardiac disease. This is 
a larger number than is now attributed to tuberculosis. It 
was estimated that 20,000 children in the New York public 
schools had heart trouble and were, nevertheless, obliged to 
climb fifteen to twenty flights of stairs daily. The idea grew 
up among physicians, educators, and social workers that the 
facts about heart disease should be ascertained and that 
methods of prevention and improvement should be scientif- 
ically worked out. It was assumed, from the beginning, that 
the problem needed the coéperation of medical experts and 
non-technical health workers. From the campaign against 
tuberculosis this valuable lesson of experience was adopted. 
The Association for the Prevention and Relief of Heart 
Disease was organized in 1915, but, owing to the interruption 
caused by the war, did not begin active work until 1919. In 
the same year, the Cardiac Committee of the Public Educa- 
tion Association enlisted the codperation of the Board of Edu- 
cation, which appropriated funds for an experiment with 
special classes for cardiac children. It was decided to con- 
duct the experiment within the organization of Public School 
64. The Children’s Aid Society supplied five sunny ground- 
floor rooms in its near-by building and contributed in many 
ways to making a favorable environment for the children. 
Dr. Robert H. Halsey of the Post Graduate Hospital held 
weekly clinics at the school, and kept the entire experiment 
under his supervision. As with the attempts in physical care 
already mentioned in this chapter, the classes were designed 
to aid research in education as well as to serve in the elucida- 
tion of a medical problem. 
1 This experiment owed much to coéperation. The organization and plan 
were primarily due to the efforts of Dr. Robert H. Halsey of the Post Graduate 
Hospital. The account of the work which is given here is taken from reports
-P-A-G-E-320
  292 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
The work done with the cardiac classes was altogether of a 
pathfinding character. The purpose of the experiment was 
to discover the following : 
The actual number of children having damaged hearts and their 
actual rate of occurrence. 
Whether segregation of children suffering from cardiac disease is of 
benefit. 
The types of cardiac children now attending the public schools that 
require this segregation. 
The kind of program that is best suited to the improvement of the 
cardiac child in school. 
To what extent a standardized program and procedure can be estab- 
lished throughout the public school system. 
The principal causes of cardiac disease in school children. 
What can be learned from the study of a group of cardiac children that 
may lead to the prevention or reduction of cardiac disease in all children. 
Since the classes have been in operation, a great deal of 
scientific material has been carefully gathered and studied 
with a view to discovering to what extent and by what means 
cardiac disease may be prevented. The past history of 125 
children was carefully inquired into and the incidence of the 
various diseases compared with the histories of 300 normals, 
or children from the same district, of the same age group, 
and considered well and healthy. In the children with chronic 
heart disease, tonsillitis, rheumatism, and chorea had a dis- 
tinctly higher incidence than in the normal group. The ex- 
perience at the Mineola Cardiac Home confirmed the opinion 
that in most cases children with definitely decayed teeth and 
infected tonsils do not make the same progress as those whose 
mouths and throats have been cared for. As the work has 
and material written by Dr. Halsey. Colleagues of Dr. Halsey who assisted 
in holding clinics were Dr. Blake F. Donaldson, Dr. Berton Lattin, Dr. Frank 
MacLaury, and Dr. Walden E. Muns. Generous encouragement and financial 
aid were given by Mrs. Irma B. Levy and the other members of the Cardiac 
Committee of the Public Education Association. The New York Philanthropic 
League and the Child Welfare League contributed food and recreation. A 
splendid spirit of coéperation was present among all who had any relation to 
these handicapped children.

progressed, the problem has become more and more clear, 
until there is real hope that definite and fundamental results 
will be ultimately contributed to the reduction of heart dis- 
ease as, in the past, to the reduction of tuberculosis. 
Already, great practical benefit has come from the classifi- 
cation of patients adopted in 1921 by the New York Associa- 
tion of Cardiac Clinics. This is not an exact system of divi- 
sion. It was worked out by the process of trying out what the 
child could tolerate in the way of exercise. For an exercise 
test, the standard of ordinary exertion of children of a rise of 
thirty feet in twenty seconds has been accepted for the purposes 
of the experiment.’ The classification used is the following : 
CLASSIFICATION OF CARDIAC PATIENTS 
Class 1. Patients with organic heart disease who are able to carry on 
their habitual physical activity. 
Class 2. Patients with organic heart disease who are able to carry on 
diminished physical activity. 
A. Slightly diminished. 
B. Greatly diminished. 
Class 3. Patients with organic heart disease who are unable to carry 
on any physical activity. 
Class 4. Patients with possible heart disease. Patients who have 
abnormal physical signs in the heart, but in whom the general picture 
or the character of the physical signs leads us to believe that they 
do not originate from cardiac disease. 
Class 5. Patients with potential heart disease. Patients who do not 
have any suggestion of heart disease, but who are suffering from an 
infectious condition which may be accompanied by such disease; e.g. 
rheumatic fever, tonsillitis, chorea, or syphilis. 
There were three classes of about twenty-five children each 
in the cardiac department. They were drawn from seven- 
teen schools in the district, all within a radius of a few blocks 
from Public School 64. An extension of the work was made 
in the second year by the establishment of the Mineola Home

204 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
for Cardiac Children. Most of the children sent here were too 
ill to attend regular school, but after a short time were able 
to take part in some of the class activities. The country home 
has proved a valuable annex to the school work, since it sup- 
plied a place where children could be sent for short periods 
under continued supervision, and provided an environment 
which encouraged initiative and proper activity on the child’s 
part. 
The method of selecting children for the cardiac class was 
this: The principals and teachers of the neighboring schools 
referred to the clinic all children having indications of heart 
defect. The Bureau of Child Hygiene of the Board of Health 
coéperated by examining children and recommending the 
cardiac classes to parents. It was found on the basis of this 
survey that less than one per cent of the school children in the 
district came within the classification adopted by the clinics, 
and that only slightly more than one-half of one per cent had 
organic heart disease. This reduces the probable number of 
cardiac children in the New York schools from 20,000 to 
10,000. Up to the present time, however, only rooo out of 
these 10,000 children have been cared for in special cardiac 
classes. 
It appeared also that for every three children with abnor- 
mal physical signs, only one had signs which indicated actual 
organic damage; the signs in the other two could be explained 
by accidental conditions. 
The small proportion of severe heart cases, so far as num- 
bers were concerned, was noteworthy. Of all the children 
falling within the clinical classification, about 90 per cent 
came within Class 1 and Class 2 A. In forming the special 
groups, preference was given to Class 2 A although representa- 
tives of all the other classes were included. It was possible 
to demonstrate amenability to treatment in all these classes.
-P-A-G-E-323
HEALTH EDUCATION 295 
Children in Class 3 wete advanced into Class 2 B and from 
Class 2 A to Class r. In the course of three terms, thirty-six 
children showed such marked improvement as to be fit to re- 
turn to the regular school — that is, they became Class 1 
cases. Other general evidences of a favorable reaction to the 
special environment were the improved average attendance 
of the children and the increase in their average weight. 
The school day began between 8.30 and 9.30 o’clock and 
the cardiac children each received a cup of hot water contain- 
ing half a bouillon cube on arrival. They stayed all day, a hot 
luncheon being supplied at noon for a small fee. A rest period 
of one hour followed the luncheon, after which school work was 
resumed until 3 o’clock. Half an hour was then devoted to 
graduated physical exercises. Another hour was occupied 
with quiet games, cooking classes, carpentry, basket weaving, 
singing, and dancing. At 4.30 crackers and a glass of milk 
were served to each child and the class was dismissed. 
The setting up of a definite program of exercise was a real 
innovation in the treatment of heart cases.!_ Hitherto, the 
physician’s practice has been to issue a blanket prohibition 
against physical effort of any kind and parents and teachers 
have enforced the prohibition in a spirit of constant fearful- 
ness. The moment in which a child is diagnosed as a heart 
case, he is put on a constant régime of ‘‘don’ts”’; but he is not 
told anything that he may do. The doctor has been primarily 
responsible for these overdone restrictions, because he has not 
thoroughly studied the patient and his limitations, but has 
treated all cardiacs as hopeless cases with the implication of 
imminent death. That mothers have been so terrified by this 
implication that they have strait-jacketed a child’s whole life 
is not to be wondered at. There were children in our cardiac 
classes who had never been allowed even to feed themselves. 
1 See Appendix B.
-P-A-G-E-324
  
  296 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
The mothers had to be convinced by actual demonstration 
that the child could eat unaided. 
It requires careful study under expert supervision to find 
out what amount and kind of exercise the cardiac muscle can 
tolerate and improve by. The treatment must be adjusted 
to the individual; the valvular defect gives no true idea of 
the duration or degree of vigor of the exercise permissible. 
The special class where children can be kept under trained 
observation is a necessary supplement to clinical examination. 
The codperation of the teacher and health-worker are indis- 
pensable in prescribing a beneficial régime for the individual. 
Some of these children can exercise for only a few minutes, 
while others can exercise for half an hour. The type of move- 
ment is selected so as to require a larger group of muscles and 
a greater degree of exertion as the time elapses. The heart 
beats more slowly, and the breathing is not accelerated to 
such a degree as in the ordinary exertion of walking. As 
improvement in the general condition is accompanied by in- 
creased tolerance of exercise, the children are allowed greater 
freedom. 
Heretofore the cardiac child in the public schools has felt 
the result of either of two conditions. He was either 
eliminated because the school feared to take responsibility 
for his educational welfare, or else he was neglected. He was 
not allowed to exercise with the other children, and in places 
where he received careful consideration, was kept apart from 
the other children at entrance and dismissal from school. In 
this way, he came to feel his handicap keenly and to succumb 
to hopelessness and feelings of inferiority which lowered his 
actual chances of improvement. The atmosphere of the car- 
diac class has served to build up his morale. 
The question is often asked whether the grouping together 
of patients with heart disease is not depressing to them and,
-P-A-G-E-325

therefore, undesirable from the therapeutic standpoint. This 
has not proved to be the case, but the very opposite. The 
children in the special class became mentally more alert, they 
entered into their undertakings with more enthusiasm, and 
their outlook on life grew more hopeful. Parents and teachers 
occupied themselves with thinking of the things they could 
teach the children to do instead of denying them all enjoy- 
ments. The philosophy is one of teaching them to do within 
their capacity rather than of prohibition from all action. 
One of the most important features in the successful care 
of heart cases is the emotional factor. In commenting on the 
psychology of the cardiac child, Dr. Halsey says: 
These children frequently showed a certain diffidence and lack of 
initiative, a disinclination to associate with others; often, too, a moderate 
lower grade of school knowledge and a certain eager readiness to attribute 
their backwardness and inefficiency to the possession of heart disease, 
the statement often accompanied by a significant gesture of the hand 
toward the left breast. It seemed to me these general deviations in 
behavior were derived from three sources: the family, friends, and 
teachers; others with heart disease; and the family physician. . . . 
Unfortunately, popular tradition makes and knows no distinction 
in degrees or forms of the disease. Knowing the importance of the 
organ to the life of the individual and having heard of some persons who 
died suddenly, they are often so impressed, that their constant fear is 
that some slight infraction of a physician’s directions against physical 
exercise will be penalized by sudden death. So all-pervading is this fear, 
that relatives and friends converse concerning the child with heart 
impairment in whispered voice accompanied by significant shrugs of the 
shoulders, raising of the eyebrows, and noddings of the head. . . . The 
observation of the cardiacs of the management accorded them in school 
by the teachers and scholars, often depresses by emphasizing their 
physical shortcomings or intellectual backwardness, which are repeatedly 
ascribed to the heart disease, until the patient becomes discouraged and 
hopeless, or, in desperation, attempts to do physical work in excess of his 
cardiac reserve power. .. . 
During the war, many cases of so-called shell shock were made serious 
and severe by the ill-timed sympathy of a soft-headed physician or med- 
icalboard. The same type of psychic damage can be produced in children 
by the expressions of pity for them by their family, and sympathy for 
the family by the friends who inquire as to how soon before the child 
is expected to die... .
-P-A-G-E-326
298 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
It has seemed to me that the more one sees of heart disease in 
children the more hopeful he may become; for the cardiac condition of 
most children under proper supervision improves very rapidly, much 
more rapidly than one would anticipate. While the cases coming to the 
hospital ward are usually in the final stages, yet numerically they are a 
small minority of the large number of hearts which are damaged. The 
greater number of damaged hearts are of a milder degree and live for the 
most part a natural physical, active life. 
The mental ability of the cardiac children was studied by 
means of psychological tests. The results are given in Table 
XXVII, which is based on individual Stanford-Binet tests.

No positive conclusions can be drawn from the small number 
of cases included in Table XXVII. The median, 87.5, is 
noticeably lower than the median obtained by the same tests 
for the entire groups of entering children, 93.46 (page 42). 
The reason for this difference is not known. The small group 
of cases reported here will need to be supplemented by a wider 
survey of cardiac children before any definite hypothesis con- 
cerning their mental status can be reached. 
Our experience has shown that there is a place for the car- 
diac class in the school and that codperation between medical
-P-A-G-E-327
    HEALTH EDUCATION : 299 
and educational effort is practical. In a densely populated 
city like New York, the problem is a district problem. Like 
every form of special class, the best results will be obtained by 
limiting the age-range of the children under one teacher’s care. 
The three classes in our cardiac department made a compara- 
tive, if not an exact, grading possible, which aided the teacher’s 
pedagogical task. It would have been a great advantage if 
transportation could have been furnished and a larger area 
could have been included in the district assigned to the school. 
In this way, we could have established five or six classes in- 
stead of three, with resulting advantages in grading, grouping, 
and equipment. 
MENTAL HEALTH 
One of the most characteristic of the experiments in health 
education made by the school was the effort to deal with men- 
tal health in a constructive way. Just as preventive medi- 
cine has made great strides in relation to physical health, in 
the same way the preventive aspect of mental hygiene is 
coming to be acknowledged as a necessity in education. A 
school whose atmosphere is one of hospitality, flexibility, and 
good will is one in which the fewest number of mental cases 
are likely to develop. The child may, however, bring with 
him from the home the results of emotional strain. Teachers 
often fail to realize how much the school may do to increase or 
decrease the tension in the home. The center of many a 
crisis in the child’s family situation is a poor report, a note 
from the teacher, a visit from the truant officer, a summons 
for the parent to appear at school. Any one of these unex- 
pected communications may throw the family into a panic 
out of all proportion to the seriousness of the occasion. 
Between the time when the mother receives the note and 
calls next day to discover that Abie has taken another boy’s 
hat by mistake, the chances are that Abie has received some
-P-A-G-E-328
  300 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
drastic punishment, that Father has pictured him in the Chil- 
dren’s Court, and that Mother has spent a sleepless night. 
The visiting teacher acts as a shock absorber in freeing ordi- 
nary adjustments from over-emotional significance. By her 
method of producing an explanation at the same time that 
some school difficulty is announced to the family, the peremp- 
tory note is eliminated and the element of suspense removed. 
A conscious appreciation of this was shown among the chil- 
dren by their asking the visiting teacher to call and explain 
some complication to their mothers when they would do any- 
thing to avoid taking home a note. By building up a more 
reasonable attitude in the school toward the home and a 
reciprocal attitude of confidence in the family, many unneces- 
sary crises are avoided. Thus the visiting teacher becomes a 
real agent of mental hygiene in the school. 
While extreme cases of maladjustment were taken care of 
in the neurotic class, there were numerous children, who, as 
sporadic or temporary problems of behavior, came under the 
observation of the psychiatrist. Often simple adjustments 
were sufficient to settle apparently difficult problems when 
approached from the psychiatrist’s angle. There are cases 
of discipline in every class which spring from a strained rela- 
tionship between teacher and pupil, which may be partially, 
if not entirely, relieved by a patient study of the emotional 
sources of the conflict. Too often the teacher takes the 
child’s misconduct as a personal affront. But once the 
teacher comes to see that even human conduct follows the 
law of cause and effect, she is able to take a more impersonal 
view of the eccentric child than heretofore and to make a more 
scientific approach to his problem. 
The presence of the psychiatric clinic in the school has a 
subtle but unmistakable influence on the teacher’s attitude 
toward discipline. It is not merely that it gives her some- 
 
-P-A-G-E-329
HEALTH EDUCATION 301 
where else to send a difficult child for a reprimand besides the 
principal’s office, but also that it gives her a certain feeling of 
support in trying out experimental methods with these cases. 
For instance, it is contrary to the nature of many a teacher to 
manage every child merely by dominating him. Such a 
teacher, if she has any backing at all, is only too glad to find 
another method of approaching human relationships in the 
classroom, and often does so very successfully. Teachers who 
are jaded with the routine of imparting the same subject- 
matter term after term, find a revivified interest in their pro- 
fession when the working out of human relations is allowed to 
become a dignified and valid aspect of teaching. 
One thing above all others that the psychology of the emo- 
tions has taught us is that there is no abnormality character- 
istic of the insane which cannot be seen in milder form in the 
general run of human beings. The personality make-up of 
all kinds of abnormal types is easily discernible in perfectly 
normal people, and familiarity with these makes it possible 
to detect the same trends in children. The presence in the 
school of a physician who is familiar with the magnified form 
of character trends, helps the teacher to see many opportu- 
nities to counterbalance in education individual eccentricities 
which, if enhanced, might lead later to inefficiency and un- 
happiness. There are certain types of children who should 
never be allowed to remain for any length of time under the 
control of certain types of teachers. When such matters are 
handled impersonally and science is substituted for blind dis- 
cipline, much of the unhealthy tension of school life is re- 
lieved for teachers and pupils alike. Just as “dirt, darkness, and 
dampness ”’ breed tuberculosis, so tension, suspicion, and fear 
nourish the germs of emotional ill-health and mental disease. 
There is probably no greater enemy to a healthy and well- 
adjusted life than the insidious fears of childhood. The value 
 
-P-A-G-E-330
  302 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
of fear in preserving a child from harm is greatly over-esti- 
mated ; it probably ruins more lives than it saves. Few people 
know how easy it is to get rid of fear if they have a scientific 
technique. With children this is especially true, because the 
longer a fear remains the more strongly fortified it becomes. 
Most pathological phobias have their origin in a childish fear 
which might have been curable in its early stages. 
Perhaps nothing is more universally feared than the snake. 
Among adults the emotion sometimes grows into an irrational 
terror. Yet, even this can be dissipated in children by proper 
handling. It was demonstrated with our neurotic class, which 
contained, by reason of their neurotic tendencies, the most 
timid and fearful children in the school. The teacher of nature 
study 1 took into the classroom a king snake — which is of a 
harmless species — about three feet long. The reptile was 
hidden in an ordinary embroidery bag and the children were 
asked to guess what was in the bag. A series of wild guesses 
followed, at the end of which the children were told in a casual 
tone, ‘‘It’s a snake.” 
They exclaimed loudly and shrank away from the teacher, 
who continued placidly, ‘“‘Does anybody want to see it?” 
There was a chorus of protests. ‘‘Well, those who are afraid 
may go away off there in the corner, because you'll scare my 
snake if you come close.” The teacher then seated herself 
on a chair surrounded by a small group of the more valiant 
spirits. First she took out the snake’s head from the em- 
broidery bag on her lap. The children gazed awe-struck at 
first, those in the far-off corner gazing of course with the great- 
est fascination. Then the rest of the snake’s body slowly 
came out. ‘Don’t you want to touch it?” was the next ques- 
1 Miss Laura B. Garrett had charge of this work. Miss Garrett describes 
her methods in a pamphlet entitled “A Study of Animal Families in Schools,” 
published by the Bureau of Educational Experiments, 144 West 13th Street, 
New York City.
-P-A-G-E-331
HEALTH EDUCATION ‘ 303 
tion. One or two pioneered and reported how it felt. ‘It 
feels smooth and cold like a brass candlestick,” said one little 
boy. Curiosity led the others on, and before the hour was over 
every child in the neurotic class had handled the snake. They 
had not only handled it but had learned to handle it carefully 
and gently, for the teacher had explained to them that the 
snake was a delicate and sensitive animal and could be easily 
hurt. It is clear that any child of eight or nine who had really 
grasped this idea would never again have the same undiscrim- 
inating terror of the snake species. 
Animals of all kinds are interesting to children. They oc- 
cupy a prominent place in the phantasies and literature of 
childhood. It is one of the greatest deprivations of the city 
child that he grows up unfamiliar with the common barnyard 
animals. That he should come upon these first through 
stories rather than experience is like reading about thunder- 
storms and swimming holes instead of meeting them. Just 
as we felt that the swimming pool supplied a primitive need 
of the healthy child’s nature, in the same way we realized that 
his contact with animals should be something more than an 
annual visit to the zoo. 
To meet this need in part, an animal room was instituted 
in the school. A south room with a tile floor was selected and 
different kinds of animal families were installed. The shop 
classes built the necessary equipment, such as hutches, coops, 
aquaria, and so on. We collected from various sources as 
many kinds of animals as were practical, including chickens, 
ducks, geese, rabbits, pigeons, mice, guinea pigs, squirrels, 
fish, turtles, frogs, and bees. All these animals were in fam- 
ilies. Building homes and reproducing their kind added to 
the children’s interest in the study of their life and habits. 
Instead of talking about the robin and the vireo, the life of 
the animal was observed from babyhood up. Committees
-P-A-G-E-332
  304 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
of pupils were appointed to assist the science teacher in feed- 
ing the animals and keeping their homes clean. The children 
were taught to handle their charges with care and respect. 
They soon learned that the animals were more easily fright- 
ened than they were, and even high-strung nervous children 
learned to control themselves unusually well for the sake of 
the great privilege of being allowed to hold the baby rabbit. 
Many lessons in sex hygiene were indirectly learned from this 
familiarity with the family life of animals. Children’s ques- 
tions were frankly answered ; but so great was the interest in 
the many phases of life in this fascinating room that the 
phenomenon of reproduction did not assume a disproportion- 
ate prominence. 
We felt that in a school of three thousand children from six 
to sixteen the problem of sex hygiene and sex instruction could 
not entirely be ignored. The children were misinformed 
rather than uninformed regarding this side of life. We did 
not feel sure enough of our methods, however, to undertake 
to deal directly with this problem in the classroom. It seemed 
that the safest method of approach was to give a thorough 
course of instruction to the teachers. The course was given 
by a trained biologist, whose approach to the subject was en- 
tirely wholesome and unemotional. The talks took place 
after school hours and attendance was optional. They 
were so much appreciated that they were repeated later by 
request for the benefit of new teachers and those who had 
previously not been able to attend. This seemed to us the 
best way to build up in the school a normal attitude toward this 
rather difficult subject and the individual problems connected 
with it which arise in every school. 
The limitations of the health program are evident. While 
an attempt was made to deal with this fundamental part of
-P-A-G-E-333
HEALTH EDUCATION 305 
education in an all-round and constructive way, the lack of a 
full-time health worker in the school caused unavoidable gaps 
in the program. Many of the efforts described were not be- 
gun until late in the experiment and others were curtailed for 
lack of funds. To have made the health program really effec- 
tive, it should have been co-extensive with the psychological 
work. As the experiment developed, many of the health prob- 
lems were uncovered as a by-product of the grading process. 
Had we known as much at the beginning of the experiment as 
at the end, we should have had the material to make an effec- 
tive demand for the kind of support that would have given 
the school an integrated and continuous program of health 
education. 
The tendency of the different pieces of health research 
carried out was to emphasize the necessity of an early attack 
on the problem. Just as most of the mental handicaps of 
children do not suddenly arise in the fifth and sixth grades 
where they are too frequently discovered for the first time, 
in the same way many of the remediable physical defects of 
children come to school with them in the first grade. Every 
successive year in which a child is handicapped by infected 
tonsils or malnutrition or obsessive fears is an added obstacle 
to his development into a healthy, normal adult. It has been 
proposed as a means of raising health standards, that children 
should have their diplomas withheld at graduation until all 
physical defects had been remedied. This is obviously at- 
tacking the problem at the wrong end. Would it not be 
more logical and equally feasible to give each six-year-old 
child a physical examination and require that his physical 
defects be taken care of before he is officially entered in school ? 
The definite health work of the school should then concen- 
trate on putting each child in prime physical condition before 
he reaches the third year of his school life.
-P-A-G-E-334
  306 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
From this point on, health education should concern itself 
chiefly with the building of constructive health habits in nor- 
mal children. This should be an integral part of the curricu- 
lum for every grade. As the children grow older they are in- 
creasingly capable of taking an intelligent and self-directing 
attitude towards their own’health. The school should hold 
itself responsible for giving them the information and materials 
with which to make a positive attack on this fundamentally 
important side of life.
-P-A-G-E-335
CHAPTER XIII 
CONCLUSION 
The spirit of experimentation is absent, as a rule, from even 
our best public schools. Through his responsibilities as a 
pedagogue, the schoolman has developed a peculiar pride 
which makes him unwilling to run the risk of failure and the 
necessity of confessing it. Between teacher and pupil there 
exists a polite fiction that the teacher is always in the right. 
It is a convention which the school has borrowed from the 
home, where the parents must also sustain a reputation for 
infallibility. But the experimental spirit requires the educa- 
tor to be willing to admit that he has failed — an attitude to 
which his life in school has made him unaccustomed. He 
is aware that faults exist, but he is waiting for the one best 
and final method to come along before he consents to make 
any change whatever.! 
This emphasis on finality discourages all experiments. It 
accounts for the slow progress of public education and the 
startling anachronisms of the school of today. The spirit 
of the investigator, realizing the necessity of venturing along 
1 Since this study was written, the Superintendent of Schools of New York 
City has designated twenty-five elementary schools as experimental centers. 
The Superintendent’s instructions to the committee in charge are in part as 
follows : 
“The immediate problem of the committee will be to select at least one school 
in each district and after careful study, to recast as far as may be needed, the 
class organization, the course of study, the mode of promotion and related 
matters, so that by the close of the school year there will be in each district at 
least one school which may serve as a pattern worthy of visitation and study.” 
307

  308 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
new paths, must not be too suspicious of every experiment 
which does not promise to furnish the final perfect method. 
Mistakes in education, as in everything else that is vital, are 
inevitable. The greatest mistake of all is in thinking that 
the traditional way is the one and only way of doing things. 
It needs careful planning to try new paths, but, having duly 
weighed the possible difficulties, it is well to strike out def- 
initely in that direction which promises the most favorable 
results. To abandon false pride and cultivate a receptive 
mind requires a special effort on the part of the educator who 
is regarded by society as the custodian of ancient and in- 
herited values and who, therefore, finds easy success in follow- 
ing the trodden ways. The teacher who is little more than 
an animated moth-ball, preserving sanction and tradition 
from overdue decay, may still escape all criticism within 
the little world of academic values. 
As a result of our six years’ experiment, we do not claim 
that marvels were achieved. Nothing that has been de- 
scribed in the foregoing chapters is offered as a model of a 
perfected method. All that was attempted needs further 
experiment and continued study. But this much is certain: 
we would not, for any consideration, go back to the old way. 
In retrospect it seems not six years backward in the past but 
fifty. To carry on a public school without the aid of the 
psychologist, the visiting teacher, the special class, the co- 
operation of social agencies, now seems to us unthinkable. 
The instrument used by the psychologist, the technique 
employed by the visiting teacher and social worker, will un- 
doubtedly be improved; but in the meantime the school 
cannot afford to neglect existing methods which are known 
to be accurate and helpful. Otherwise our school super- 
visors and school teachers will soon find themselves in the 
ironical position of knowing less about human nature in the

making than the workers in any other institution, including 
the prison and the reformatory. The complacent formalism 
of the public school, the uncritical and therefore uncreative 
spirit of public education, must be replaced by an honest 
hospitality to experiment. 
There have been experiments in education carried on in 
private schools or public schools in small towns, with note-. 
worthy results. Most of these have no real value for public 
education. The pupils are a selected group, selected at the 
time of their admission and re-selected with every promotion 
day of their subsequent school careers. The child survives 
and thrives because he fits the school, and not because the 
school fits him. This is the reason why most men of long ex- 
perience in large public school systems are not very enthusi- 
astic over reports on experimental education. There are 
many so-called model schools which are visited by thousands 
of observers and which, nevertheless, throw no light whatever 
on the complex problems of public education. 
The publc school cannot select its clientele. It must 
take all comers, rich and poor, alien and native, genius, aver- 
age, defective —the socially valuable and those of opposite 
tendencies. Compulsory education requires an entire re- 
construction of our school organization, methods, and aims. 
The public school must have a place or every kind of child 
above the grade of idiot. And this means much more than 
merely providing a hardwood seat with a cast-iron base. It 
means a place for the personality of the child, whatever his 
characteristics may be. It means an inclusive attitude in- 
stead of an exclusive attitude. It means a spirit of hospi- 
tality which is as broad and all-embracing as universal com- 
pulsory education itself. 
As a matter of fact, many public schools live up to their 
reputation for inclusiveness in theory only. The processes
-P-A-G-E-338
  310 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
of selection and elimination, which are openly and legitimately 
employed by private schools, are used by the public school as 
a last resort and disingenuously practiced. The child who 
is persistently troublesome is passed on by transfer to another 
school, accompanied by an innocent-looking record which, 
oddly enough, gives no hint of his previous career as a trouble- 
maker. The big overgrown boy, whom the teachers describe 
as a “dumb-bell,” is urged to take his working papers. He 
might just as well, they say, for all the good he is getting out 
of school. Another way of getting rid of an impossible boy 
is ‘‘to make an example of him,” by sending him to the truant 
school, the disciplinary school, or the juvenile court. During 
the six years of this experiment no child was eliminated from 
the school under any of these pretexts. While we by no 
means solved all our problems, at least we worried along with 
them. We never felt that the exclusion of a child, however 
masked, was any solution for his difficulties. And this atti- 
tude, we maintain, does not represent a sentimental but a 
realistic view of childhood. That it was practical for half a 
dozen years in a public school enrolling about three thousand 
boys, demonstrates its workability. The first law of the 
public school is, The child belongs. Once this principle is 
unreservedly accepted as the foundation of public education, 
its implications must also be acknowledged and carried out 
through a more flexible kind of education than has ever been 
dreamed of by public school curriculum-makers. 
We are tending in the direction of individual training of 
pupils, away from mass education. But the attainment of 
this ideal is hampered by a general vagueness and uncertainty 
as to methods of realization. The experiment described in 
the foregoing chapters has suggested at least these definite 
ways of going forward. The psychological tests have helped 
to uncover facts which must ultimately be faced if we are

CONCLUSION 311 
ever to understand successfully the individual child. Science 
has produced for educational use standards of growth which, 
though subject to further revision, are already of great help 
in analyzing the personality. The chronological age, in- 
tellectual age, academic age, physiological age, and emotional 
age — all these may be estimated in relation to each other 
to the end that the child may be rescued from as much guess- 
work as possible. Special classes with small registers are 
decidedly worth while in dealing with the less usual type of 
pupil. As a step toward smaller classes for all children, they 
are invaluable. Once we begin to study the individual in- 
tensively by physical and mental standards, the number of 
those who deviate in some way from the so-called average 
begins to increase; they form a growing minority. The 
next point of attack is the course of study, which needs noth- 
ing less than entire reconstruction. Is it not time that we 
reversed the requirement that every child, no matter what 
his characteristics, should make good with the one and only, 
the sacred and inviolable, elementary public school curricu- 
lum? Now that we know more about the mental growth 
of the young human being than we once did, it seems reason- 
able to require that the curriculum shall also make good with 
the child. The present public school curriculum is related 
to the young child very much as those quaint and stiff adult 
costumes which infants wore in portraits by Velasquez and 
other court painters. These uncongenial habiliments, as 
Rousseau has pointed out, give the impression of a human 
dwarf rather than of a real child. So it is with the public 
school curriculum. Originally built and patterned for the 
adult, it has been cut down and reduced in size to approximate 
the proportions of a six-year-old child, who is then jammed 
into its inflexible shape and left to grow there with what com- 
fort he can.
-P-A-G-E-340
  312 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
Grades mean nothing at present, and yet they are regarded 
as something sacred. A child in the fifth grade is considered 
more advanced than one in the fourth grade, and yet we know 
from experience that this is not always true. In actual prac- 
tice we have found that a pupil in the fourth grade may show 
a fifth or a sixth grade achievement in one or more school 
subjects, while a fifth grade pupil may, similarly, show a third 
or even a first or second grade achievement. Our grading 
must be acknowledged to be highly artificial. But even if 
we had an ideal method of grouping pupils according to their 
academic ability, we should still find in each class too much 
disparity in ages. In a given group, pupils of eight years 
of age would be associated with some of fifteen or sixteen 
years. It may be said that such conditions do exist at the 
present time under the usual grading system; but from the 
point of view of social adjustments, these extreme differences 
in age are to be avoided. It seems possible to do this only 
by introducing a psychological classification early in the 
child’s school life and conceding him in consequence a pro- 
motion every year. Eventually the non-promotion penalty 
should be entirely done away with. 
Although all problems are not settled when children are 
properly graded, the psychological test is an instrument of 
great diagnostic value from the point of view of teaching 
school subjects. It furnishes the teacher with a vastly better 
chance of dealing with the problems of instruction and edu- 
cation in an enlightened way. It helps her to analyze and 
simplify a very complex and much beclouded situation. It 
compels individual attention to the child and respect and re- 
gard for differences. Carried through early, the psychological 
classification has the value of a preventive measure. It makes 
it possible to keep the bright pupils from marking time and to 
save the dull ones from useless failure and discouragement.
-P-A-G-E-341
  
CONCLUSION 313 
It is often asked by school people whether the individual 
psychological tests should be administered by a trained psy- 
chologist. An emphatic affirmative in reply is met by looks 
of surprise. Innumerable examples could be given to prove 
the value of this injunction. In the hands of unskilled school 
teachers, the test is not likely to give reliable results. The 
ordinary teacher is prone to be misled, by the seeming sim- 
plicity of the questions, into thinking that she can administer 
them without any special preparation. The training schools 
and universities offer courses in giving tests, so that it is 
possible for the teacher to prepare herself. But without real 
study and ample special training, any confidence in the ‘re- 
sults of psychological tests is out of the question. It seems 
to us from observation and experience that Terman himself 
takes too optimistic a view of the use of his tests by slightly 
trained teachers. 
In spite of the manifest advantages, we do not wish to claim 
too much for the scientific and academic standards we have 
here advocated. All that these measuring devices can tell 
us is whether any individual is below, equal to, or above the 
statistical norm for his age or class. The scientific classifica- 
tion cannot pretend to do more than this; but if it does no 
more, this is a big step in advance of the chaotic methods of 
classification still commonly in use. It contributes to the 
solution of educational problems only as the introduction of 
a standard system of income measurements contributes to 
the solution of the problem of economic justice. Or again it 
is comparable to the discovery of scientific instruments for 
recording weather conditions, the barometer and the ane- 
mometer, which have not solved agricultural problems. It 
may still further be compared to the standard height and 
weight table in its relation to actual improvement of individ- 
ual health. In many of our schools, teachers and supervisors 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
  314 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
are living in a pre-scientific age. We are still at a stage where 
physicians were a hundred years ago, in the blood-letting 
stage of our educational history; and as long as the public 
school continues to pride itself on its devotion to the old and 
its suspicion of the new, it is likely to remain an outstanding 
laggard in the march of civilization. 
The mental classification is only the beginning of educa- 
tional experimentations. The psychological test is not an 
excuse not to educate, but a useful indication of how to edu- 
cate. The right of a child to an education should not depend 
on how much intelligence he has; this may determine the kind 
of education he needs, but not how much should be given him. 
The criticism is sometimes made that the IQ may be fatal- 
istically interpreted by the school as a license to shirk its 
job. As a matter of fact, the differentiation between the 
abilities of children really demands harder work on the part 
of the teacher than the old treadmill system. While pre- 
viously the teacher suffered from not being permitted even 
to suspect the possibility of limited development in connec- 
tion with a problematical child, for this was heresy not to be 
breathed to a supervisor, she is now compelled to confront 
such a possibility and do something constructive about it. 
The true faith used to be that all children, given the right 
educational environment, could be infinitely developed along 
the same intellectual lines. There was nothing in the sacred 
seventh grade curriculum which the teacher who worked hard 
enough could not be expected to teach to any child who worked 
hard enough. The idea that all of us have our intellectual 
limitations and ‘that all children are not uniformly equipped 
has distinctly stiffened the job of the school and offers a def- 
inite challenge to the imagination of the modern teacher. 
The psychological classification holds the school up to its 
responsibilities. Formerly the school received, for its results,
-P-A-G-E-343
  CONCLUSION 315 
credit that it did not deserve; likewise it was blamed for 
matters of which it was entirely innocent. The psychological 
test can help in many instances to reveal where the excellence 
or deficiency really lies. It creates, for the first time, an 
honest situation between the teacher and the school admin- 
istration. The school knows the quality of its material and 
is able to judge the quality of the teacher’s work; she is not 
asked to do the impossible. If the psychological test has 
been expertly and properly used, she knows approximately 
the child’s mental status. This means, however, that she 
is only just ready to search out the causes of his difficulties 
in order to deal with them intelligently and efficiently. Her 
knowledge of what the tests reveal, permits her to take a pro- 
fessional attitude toward her work; it gives her technique 
some meaning. The best teachers are often developed 
through being placed in charge of dull or defective children. 
There they are relieved of the academic requirements and 
conventional methods and are put upon their mettle to find 
new paths. Such a teacher adopts an experimental and cre- 
ative attitude towards her work, because she is deprived of 
the conventional supports and props which crowd the teacher 
of the regular class on every hand. 
Those who have undertaken to guide the schools have been 
wandering in the dark because of an educational system which 
has so fixed its attention on intelligence only that nothing 
else has counted. The limitation of the psychological test 
at its best, is that it classifies children by intelligence only; 
but this is the declared limitation of the instrument. The 
school, on the other hand, values intellect alone without ever 
acknowledging the fact. Education has created an unreal 
being in the School Child, who has played the same part in 
pedagogical science that the Economic Man and the Political 
Man have played in economic and political science. The
-P-A-G-E-344
316 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
economic and political dummies have long since been swept 
off the stage by progressive thinkers in those particular fields ; 
but that curious, intellectualized manikin, the School Child, 
still dominates our current educational practice although 
lip-service is paid to a more human ideal. No true education 
is possible until the whole child takes the place of the aca- 
demic cross-section we now call a pupil. The school has yet 
to learn to look upon the child’s intelligence as only one, if 
the first and most important, instrument of his adjustment to 
life. Hitherto it has been regarded as an end in itself and the 
sole focus of all educational effort. 
The making of surveys by means of scientific and stand- 
ardized tests is a growing practice in public education. These 
surveys usually come too late and are too purely statistical 
to be of much help to the individual. The education which 
a child receives during the first ten years of his life is the 
foundation of his future success or failure. Most of our actual 
teaching consists of re-education for’ the purpose of correcting 
wrong habits and attitudes established during earlier years. 
If the first year of school were devoted to the individual study 
of the child instead of to academic instruction for which he 
is not yet ready, his education might then proceed by pro- 
gressive rather than corrective methods. This would be 
the exact reverse of our present scheme, which provides only 
blind mass teaching for the six-year-old child, while only 
later, if at all, is account taken of individual differences. 
The accumulated retardation shown by aftermath sur- 
veys is accepted with far too much philosophy within the 
school itself. The teachers think it “natural” that some 
children in every class should repeat the grade. They rep- 
resent the defeated minority, without whose existence the 
victory of the promoted ones would be lacking in savor. The 
spirit of competition does not belong to the educational pro-
-P-A-G-E-345
CONCLUSION 317 
cess any more than it does to the family life of children. Yet 
so ingrained is the practice in the public school that even the 
teachers of Terman groups wished to hold back the pupils 
who stood relatively lowest in the class. Repeating of grades 
is the greatest crime against the educational development of 
the child that the school can commit. We think too much of 
retardation in statistical terms, striving, if we strive at all, for 
an irreducible minimum. What it means to the individual 
child to be a failure in school is overlooked. But it is from 
this point of view that the whole subject should be taken up 
and reconsidered. 
There must be more elasticity and flexibility in courses of 
study as well as in methods of promotion if we are to attain 
any real measure of success in elementary education. We are 
not here pleading merely for more self-expression on the part 
of pupils, nor are we asking merely that the work shall be 
made more interesting to pupils according to their age and 
equipment. What we should like to stress most emphatically 
of all is the great need of reform in the curriculum itself. 
The present idea of grade must be supplemented by a new 
grouping of years, in which the year-by-year idea of growth 
and progress is replaced by larger and more generous units 
of experience. The periods from six to nine, from nine to 
twelve, from twelve to fourteen years might well be used to 
reduce the number of anticipated goals and crucial moments. 
But while all these desirable improvements will aid the teacher 
by introducing more reasonable standards in formal subjects, 
there will still remain the fundamental problem of education 
— the personality of the child. There will always remain 
for the teacher the question of dealing adequately with the 
individual — with his purposes, attitudes, emotional stability, 
and all those most important traits that enter into the char- 
acter and the spiritual life of the future adult.
-P-A-G-E-346
318 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
The pressure for uniformity and conformity which is char- 
acteristic of public education is transmitted from above on 
downward in uninterrupted sequence. From the governing 
boards, down through the superintendents, the principals, 
teachers, it is finally passed on to the child with undiminished 
force. No experiment can go far unless the principal is willing 
to take the impact of this bureaucratic spirit and break the 
current before it reaches the atmosphere of the schoolroom. 
The teacher cannot be expected to do this; she has no feeling 
of power. But the principal occupies a strategic position 
between the school and all external powers, and he can either 
intensify the pressure or keep the system outside. It may 
be inevitable that all the overhead authorities of public edu- 
cation shall take an impersonal and businesslike attitude 
toward school matters; but for education to thrive there 
must be some place along the line where the system is held 
back from the growing child. The most liberal plan of teach- 
ing that has ever been devised must depend for its effective- 
ness on the individual teachers and principals who are in 
immediate contact with the children. 
Usually there is, within the school itself, a business ad- 
ministration whose claims cannot be discounted. The clerical 
and office department in a large school is so important and 
so prominent that it has a tendency to dominate the educa- 
tional function of the school. There is no escaping the fact 
that methods of classification and experiments with the 
curriculum such as we have proposed, entail an increased 
amount of clerical work. Every shifting of a child from a 
class where he doesn’t belong to a class where he is better 
fitted means a definite mechanical process, which has to be 
carried on through the central office of the school. As soon 
as we attempt to introduce a more flexible method of grading, 
the clerical department is affected. If this office is not ad-
-P-A-G-E-347
CONCLUSION 319 
justable and codperative, or if it is inadequately staffed, the 
educational part of the experiment begins to tremble in the 
balance. 
Unless provision is made for this end of the work and unless 
the sympathetic codperation of the office personnel is enlisted, 
a perfectly explicable failure may wait upon the experiment. 
In fact, everyone inside the school in whatsoever capacity 
employed must be included in the plan. One of the chief vir- 
tues of an experimental school is that it induces all those 
connected with it to lay aside automatic attitudes and sub- 
stitute real ones. The typical civil-service functionary has 
no place in a genuine educational program. 
The need of experimental schools not merely outside, but 
within the system of public education, grows constantly more 
pressing. And the answer is not to be found in the multipli- 
cation of experiments in private schools. The methods 
described in the foregoing chapters are adaptable to much 
smaller organizations, down to the one-room schoolhouse. 
Adaptation to a larger school need not be discussed, for prob- 
ably few larger ones exist. Certainly, they should not. The 
next step to be taken after reducing the size of classes is to 
reduce the size of schools. F 
An improvement over the method of classifying a single 
school would be the use of a whole district as a unit. In the 
large cities there are excellent opportunities for such a classifi- 
cation. The average school district of New York comprises 
about 1000 teachers, and 40,000 children. Many of the dis- 
tricts are not very large, in area, so that children would not 
be required to walk unreasonable distances. The advan- 
tages of classifying the fourth or fifth grade when there are 
two or three thousand children in a single grade are clear. 
It would then become possible to specialize the different school 
buildings in certain directions. The public school is destined 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  320 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
to develop much wider variety of activities than are now 
considered possible. Not all of these activities need to be 
located in one building, but different buildings would take on 
character according to their respective functions. The ab- 
sence of color and variety in the typical school building is a 
part of the general educational tradition which estimates 
uniformity as the supreme virtue of public education. Any 
individualizing of the schools in the direction of specialization 
would be a visible symptom of regeneration. 
One of the objections often raised by opponents to the use 
of standardized tests as the basis of classification and grouping 
of children is that the method is undemocratic. It is some- 
times asserted that scientific measurements lead to educa- 
tional determinism, in which pupils will be treated as belong- 
ing to definite strata of society and a caste system based upon 
intellectual stratification will result. If children are classified 
by psychological tests in school, they argue, it will ultimately 
be hopeless for anyone to rise out of his or her particular level 
in the social structure. So far as the children in our school 
were concerned, the effect was just the opposite of anything 
which might be called educational determinism. The ap- 
preciation by the teachers of individual differences was 
stimulated by the method of classification used. Evidence of 
this is seen in the number of special classes which were formed 
in response to the recognition of the special needs of small 
groups of children. 
It was long ago pointed out by Mr. Sidney Webb, the 
English economist, that the ideal of a single undifferentiated 
school is no longer the democratic ideal. The common school 
was established as a means of getting rid of purely artificial 
class distinctions in education. Says Mr. Webb: 
We do not today, in any highly organized community, provide or 
expect to have provided, any monotonous array of such common schools.
-P-A-G-E-349
  
CONCLUSION 321 
We recognize now that children have infinitely varied needs and capaci- 
ties in education. Where many thousands of children are together in 
the same locality, we have learnt how to avoid the more atrocious of the 
misfits that were involved in the common school... . The “schools 
for all,” for which Bentham, and James Mill, and Francis Place strove a 
century ago, have become differentiated into dozens of different kinds of 
schools for differently situated groups of children. What was originally 
a common universal provision has become a highly specialized meeting 
of the needs of a series of minorities —many of them quite small 
minorities. And the end is not yet. We don’t yet know how to pro- 
vide each individual child with exactly the kind and grade and amount 
of education that its individuality requires. This, however, and not ‘‘com- 
mon schools” has already become, in education, the democratic ideal. 
Further remarks of Sidney Webb on the subject of govern- 
ment we quote here, as they are equally applicable to public 
education. 
a As it is coming more and more to be the business of government to 
deal with minorities, to provide what is required for minorities, to legis- 
late for minorities, because minorities are what the people as a whole is 
composed of, so we are discovering in one department of life after another, 
that it is upon the specialized scientific treatment of minorities — often 
of quite small minorities — that social well-being depends. ... My 
first proposition is, therefore, the paradoxical one that, whilst it may 
have been the most pressing business of nineteenth century governments 
to deal with the whole people, or, at any rate, with majorities, by far the 
most important business of twentieth century governments must be to 
provide not only for minorities, but even for quite small minorities and 
actually for individuals. . .. Class legislation, in short, is not only 
not bad, or wicked, or undemocratic, but actually the only good, the only 
useful, and the only really effective legislation. Of course it is not neces- 
sary to confine legislative advantages to one minority any more than to 
one individual. Every minority — every citizen, in fact, has to be 
supplied, under the one system as under the other, just as every soldier in 
the regiment has to have his suit of clothing and his pair of marching 
boots. Only, on the one method, the fit is so bad that the soldier is galled, 
and his marching and fighting capacity falls far short of what can be 
attained. On the other hand, an improved fit so much increases freedom 
of action that both comfort and efficiency are greatly increased. 
It is but a superficial view of democracy in education which 
insists on a single rigid academic curriculum for thousands 
1 Webb, Sidney. ‘The Necessary Basis of Society.” The Contemporary 
Review, June, 1908.
-P-A-G-E-350
322 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
upon thousands of individual children. To correct this view, 
not only in theory but in practice, was the first aim of our 
experiment. It begins to yield at once to the influence of the 
psychological classification. If in addition, the school is 
fortunate enough to have a psychiatrist, the psychological 
light upon the individual is greatly heightened. The visiting 
teacher brings with her also an individual view, for the tech- 
nique of the new profession of social work is still an individual 
technique. The social worker has at her command the 
method called case-work, which presupposes an intensive 
study of the particular human being concerned. 
Now this is just the attitude which the teacher has been 
consistently trained not to assume. She has been fortified 
with impersonal methods of teaching the subject-matter of 
the course. If a conflict then arises between the child and 
his arithmetic, she has been prepared by every tradition of 
her profession to take the side of the arithmetic. In short, 
she has been primarily trained to handle a class, while the 
social worker has been primarily trained to handle a case. 
The rapprochement needed here is obvious. If the school 
could assimilate the technique of social work sufficiently to 
handle children as individuals before they put themselves in 
the situation where they are regarded as suitable objects of 
case-work by the social worker, it would be a great step 
towards educational progress. 
And progress is not an optional affair in public education; 
it is imperatively demanded. The changes in the back- 
ground, economic and social, of school children, the advance- 
ments of science in other fields of life, have caused our present 
methods of school teaching and school organization to be an 
anachronism. Additional obligations have been successively 
laid upon the school itself, which is now confronted by the 
responsibility of keeping all children in school until their six-

teenth year. Responsive to its new duty, the public school 
comes before the public with stay-in-school campaigns and 
grapples daily with the sheer problem of numbers which, with 
every temporary solution, springs up again with greater de- 
mands. 
But all these public efforts, energetic as they are, are 
far from sufficient. The greatest effort of all must be made 
in school and behind the scenes. The process of adaptation 
which is needed in order to make the school a congenial place 
for all these children is not a thing to be postponed. Symp- 
toms of our mismanagement of childhood confront us on every 
hand. The brightest children are the most retarded of all 
the pupils. The dull pupils are the most accelerated. There 
is such a thing as education beyond the abilities of pupils, 
resulting in the most pernicious antisocial habits. Our 
schools are the greatest agencies for increasing juvenile de- 
linquency, adult criminality, and unemployment, that we 
have yet devised. It may be reasonably assumed that very 
few pupils are congenitally antisocial or perverse. There are 
doubtless some who have within them the seeds of hope- 
less insanities, but they are rare exceptions. Of those who 
issue from the public school stamped as “bad”’ or “wicked” 
individuals, a goodly proportion may be considered as having 
been educationally mishandled and mistrained. We are 
willing to go to the extreme of holding that the schools are 
really responsible for every unfavorable outcome of the child’s 
education. His shortcomings in school and outside should 
be charged up to the school. Unless we believe this and act 
upon its implications, there is no way of advancing through 
public education the best interests of society. 
It will naturally be objected that the schools cannot shoul- 
der the entire responsibility for existing conditions. It will 
be said that society itself, its economic, ethical, and physical 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
  324 FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
conditions, are fundamental causes over which the school has 
no control. Then again the home and the parent are power- 
ful factors in the child’s development. While all these objec- 
tions are true, it is obvious that the only hope, or at least the 
most fundamental ground for hope, lies in the schools. Their 
influence is so far-reaching that there is no practical use in 
defining boundaries. To shape the thoughts and ken of   
the next generation of adults is to build a long, unbroken road 
into the future. Looking a little further into that future than 
we have hitherto done, let us picture a new education for our 
guidance — an education in which school conditions, sub- 
jects and methods, are all rearranged in their true relations. 
We shall not then judge the success of the child’s education 
by his acquisition of facts in geography, history, and arith- 
metic, and his skill in penmanship and spelling. While these 
may continue to be necessary instruments in modern civiliza- 
tion, we shall recognize them as mere instruments and judge 
the real value of an educated people by the uses to which 
these instruments are put. After all, motives, purposes, and 
ideals must ever be the real signs of a successful life. Ability 
to meet new conditions intelligently and effectively, to fashion 
new tools when the old ones no longer do the work, is the one 
sufficient evidence of genuine education.

APPENDIX A 
CoMPARISON OF SCHOOL AND ARMy RESULTS 
The question arises, How far does the intelligence of the 
pupils in our experimental school deviate from that of the 
population in general? Judging from the results obtained 
by Terman in measuring the intelligence of 905 American- 
born children in California, our group does not measure up.! 
If, however, we compare our results with the results of the 
psychological testing in the army, our school has the higher 
level of intelligence. The median mental age of the army 
was but little over 13 years, according to the Stanford- 
Binet tests made on 653 men and according to the group 
tests made on nearly 100,000 men. If, as the figures show, 
13.25 years is the median mental age of the army, the median 
IQ of the army (using 16 as the chronological age of the 
average adult) would be 82.5. In Public School 64, the 
median IQ of the six-year-old children was 93.46, according 
to Stanford-Binet tests; and in the upper grades, according 
to the group tests, it was 94.29. If we continue to hold to 16 
years as the standard for the average adult, the level of intelli- 
gence among the children in our school was considerably 
higher than in the army, the difference in IQ amounting to 
ten points. 
It is a question, however, whether this comparison of IQ’s 
is legitimate. Terman has himself been obliged to reconsider

FITTING THE SCHOOL TO THE CHILD 
the point at which the mental age of the average adult should 
be placed. He says: 
It 
the army, that “average adult has become evident, from the results of psychological work in 
” intelligence is considerably lower than 
the score of 16 on the Stanford revision. Because of the numerous fac- 
tors of selection operative, I hesitate to venture an estimate as to what 
the real average adult score is.- I do not think it is below 14, but I doubt 
whether it is much above this figure. Even if the true “average adult” 
score 
point were known, this, of course, would not tell us exactly at what 
mental growth ceases, because there is still the question of deter- 
mining the true average score for unselected children just below the age 
of maturity. I believe that the peculiar and unsatisfactory conditions 
under which the army tests have been made tend to make the average 
score of the recruit lower than it would be under normal testing con- 
ditions. 
If the median IQ of the army is computed with 14 years as 
the chronological age of the average adult, it falls somewhere 
between 93 and 94, which would correspond to the median 
for our group of public school children. We offer this com- 
parison for whatever light it may throw on the following state- 
ment of the army psychologists : 
Undoubtedly the intelligence of the draft is somewhat lower than that 
of the country at large, although it is quite unlikely that the difference 
should be so great (3 years, or the difference between 13 and 16)... . 
In general then we are forced to reply to the question, ‘“‘How intelligent 
is the Army?” by stating arbitrary figures that refer to the d   raft itself, 
and by arguing further that the draft is approximately a representative 
group which is presumably, however, a little lower in intelligence than 
is the country at large.” |

These Educational and Hygienic Exercises, as the terms 
are applied in public school systems, are examples of the type 
of exercise to be used in alternation, so as to change the groups 
of muscles employed. : 
The number of times and the vigor with which the exercise 
is done will increase the effort required of the heart. The 
teacher must use judgment with regard to the effect on in- 
dividual cases. The children must be taught to discontinue 
exercising at any moment subjective symptoms become 
marked. The exercises and other physical activities should 
be directed and supervised by a trained instructor. No child 
should be permitted to take the exercise when he shows ab- 
normal circulatory or physical reactions as a result.

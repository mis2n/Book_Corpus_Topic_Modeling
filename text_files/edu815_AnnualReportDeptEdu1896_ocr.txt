An increase of 107 in the number of ‘school districts, 
and a corresponding increase in the number of district 
directors is noted. It is again urged that school and 
civil districts ‘be made co-extensive. A gain of 105 in 
the number of! secondary schools speaks well for the 
growth of our school system. Five hundred and forty- 
five more teachers were employed than in 1895, dis- 
tributed as follows: White male, 85; white female, 
360; colored male, 41; colored female, 59.

‘represented 268 more days work. 
Two thousand one hundred and eleven more secondary . 
certificates were issued than in 1895, while the number 
of primary certificates were 1,175 less than the pre-

Pickett, Scott, Van Buren and Wayne; while partial 
reports were received from Clay, Cocke oe Dickson

Attention has been called by my predecessors to the 
loose methods employed by County Trustees in the col- 
lection and disbursement of the school fund, and the 
resulting loss to the school children of thousands of 
dollars each year, but, up to this time, the Legislature 
has taken no action looking to the protection of school 
revenues. 
With the exception of the interest on the pubiic 
school fund, the State authorities have no account of 
the school funds collected, as such are reported by 
Trustees who oftentimes are wholly ignorant of the 
financial condition of the schools in their respective 
counties. © Trustees very often depend upon County 
Superintendents to patch up a report for them, and not 
unfrequently refuse to submit any report at all. The 
~ entire matter is left with the Trustees, and to enable 
them to cOllect a’surplus to meet the taxes due the State 
they make low apportionments of school money, and 
‘thus use the funds for other purposes than directed by 
law. That such a condition of affairs should be per- 
mitted to so long continue, is a sad commentary on the 
interest shown by our Legislatures in the cause of public 
schools... Each succeeding Legislature has had its at- 
tention called to this constant loss, but no business-like 
legisiation has resulted, and, because of their inaction, 
hundreds of thousands dollars have been lost. It is 
earnestly urged that the General Assembly of 1897 ap- 
point a cominittee to look into this matter, and that laws 
looking to thé protection of school funds be placed 
upon our statute books. ~ 
At my request, Hon. John I. Cox, State Revenue 
pee submits the following report of his work in four
-P-A-G-E-14

counties, with wise recommendations as to needed leg- 
islation : 
Hon. S. G. Gilbreath, State Super entendent Public 
Instruction, Nashville, Tenn. :

All these defaulting Trustees have settled in full with 
the State, except Hayes, of Anderson County, who 
owes the State less than three hundred dollars. 
I would recommend that the apportionment of the 
school fund in each county be submitted to the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction for his approval, 
with power to correct. ‘ 
When a Trustee gets short in his accounts, he usually 
seeks to get a low apportionment of school, fund> per 
scholar, which creates a surplus to that fund, which he
-P-A-G-E-15
_ ioe 
uses to pay demands which, if not paid, would expose 
him. In the end the school fund suffers. 
I would further recommend that the examiner, upen 
entering a Trustee’s office, have the authority to de- 
mand his cash or bank account. If his balance is in 
bank, the examiner should have full power to examine 
the records of said bank, so far as connected with pub- 
lic funds. If the account were in a national bank, 1 
believe the Comptroller of the Currency would give 
the State authority to examine fully the accounts of 
public funds. 
Trustees, when short in their accounts, often go to 
their bank of deposit, make note, have same, dis- 
counted, place proceeds to their credit, take statement 
of balance in bank, exhibit same to County Revenue 
Commissioners, and all is well; but the note soon falls 
due, and is charged to the Trustee’s account. The 
shortage is not discovered until the trustee’s term of 
office expires. All trustees herein reported as defaulters 
went out of office on the first of September, 1896. 
All of which is most respectfully submitted, 
Joun I. Cox, Revenue Agent. 
Something must be doné, and to refuse the expendi- 
ture of a few thousand dollars to save hundreds of 
thousands is ‘* penny wise and pound foolish.”’ 
Reports from County Superintendents and Institute 
conductors show that the attendance was better during 
the Institute season of 1896 than ever before. Not only 
was the attendance largely increased, but better work 
was done and more good was accomplished. A pro- 
fessional sf7rit was in evidence, which promises much 
for the public schools of the State. 
These summer normals are becoming, more and more, 
training schools for teachers, and are, year by year, 
losing their ‘* popular entertainment’’ features. Their 
growth has been steady and along right lines. Hereto- 
fore.the State Superintendents have tried to make the
-P-A-G-E-16
— ice 
Ws 
work more uniform, but until this year it was not found 
practicable to follow strictly the programs marked out 
for them or to obey the rules and regulations prescribed 
for their government. But the work so ably planned 
by my predecessor, has continued to grow until our 
summer normals will compare favorably with those of 
other States haying public school systems much older 
than ours. That the teachers and school officials see the 
good resulting from them is evidenced by the growing de- 
mand for them and for professional instructors to con- 
duct them. Last year, many counties asked for State 
aid which could not be granted because of lack ‘of funds, 
the State appropriation for Institutes being only $1,500. 
The demand for these training schools should be 
encouraged by suitable legislation and liberal appropria- 
tion. It can confidently be asserted that no like amount 
has been more productive of good to the State. Because of 
the State appropriation, $1,200 from the Peabody Fund 
was received for Institutes in Tennessee. In addition 
to these amounts, local appropriations were made at all 
places where the State and: Peabody Institutes were 
held. In round numbers, 1,500 teachers attended these 
Institutes an average period of one month each. The 
cost of tuition to the State was one dollar per month 
per teacher, and when it is remembered that they were 
conducted by the most efficient school workers in the 
State, no one will doubt but that the appropriation justi- 
fies itself. To aid in conducting these summer insti- 
tutes, an appropriation of not less than $5,000 should be 
made by the State. To better insure a judicious ex- 
penditure of this money, all disbursements should be 
audited and approved by the State Board of Education. 
The State Superintendent should be free to locate these 
Institutes, and select conductors and instructors as is 
now the case, but the appropriation should be made to 
the State Board of Education for Institute purposes, and 
the amount appropriated should not be less than the sum 
2
-P-A-G-E-17
Ea (foe, 
above named. If, in the judgment of the Board, this 
amount cannot be wisely expended in one year, it can 
be carried over or returned to the school fund. 
I submit as a part of this report the official course of 
study and syllabus for the State and Peabody Institutes. 
This syllabus was followed in the six Institutes con- 
ducted by the State, and was made the basis of work in 
many county Normals:

County InstiTuTEs. 
Instructors appointed by this department will assist 
in the Institutes to be held in the following counties: 
Greene, Lawrence, Macon, Jackson, Clay, peas 
Overton and Pickett. 
It is recommended that the course of study pressribed 
for the Peabody and State Institutes be adopted as the 
course of study for all County Institutes. 
Opjyects oF PEABODY AND STATE INSTITUTES. 
To furnish teachers of the State courses in sound and 
reliable methods of teaching the common branches of 
study taught in the public schools; to supply, in a small 
measure, the lack of early professional training on the 
part of many of our teachers, some time out of train- 
ing schools; to quicken the ideals of any whose stand- 
ard of teacherhood is lowered ; to furnish fresh thought 
by contact with the strongest, brightest, clearest minds 
in the profession ; to invigorate and inspire the whole 
teaching corps of the State. 
ADVANTAGES OFFERED FoR 1896. 
The programme for 1896 is strong and well balanced. 
There are no weak spots. The best qualified instructors 
and institute workers have been employed. Although 
the institutes are free to all teachers, the opportunities 
offered, the quantity and quality of the courses, the 
character of the corps of instructors, the high standard 
maintained in all departments, the usefulness and practi- 
cal yalue to*live teachers of all the work outlined, chal- 
lenge favorable comparison with the advantages to be 
gained at any summer institute in the country, public 
or private. The best talent has been secured, and will 
be-kept employed during the whole institute period of 
four weeks. The course is freely offered to all teachers, 
and those who take advantage of the same will find that 
the free association of so many enthusiastic, earnest,
-P-A-G-E-21
eo ee 
thoughtful teachers must have a large influence on the 
mental and educational life of every teacher in attend- 
ance. 
CERTIFICATE. 
Institute certificates will be granted to all persons of 
good moral character who have attended the re- 
quired length of time, and who have attained, in the 
branches of the Primary Course of Study, a general

of study for the Secondary Course be taught in ac- 
cordance with the following schedule, - j 
Il. We submit the following schedule as a general » 
guide, to be changed in its details to suit the exigencies ( 
of the several Institutes. It is intended for Institutes 
holding one session per day, but can be adapted, by 
changing the hours, to those Institutes which may find 
it better to hold two sessions per day. ‘

Ill. We make the following general recommenda- 
tions for the several branches of the course : 
1. Pedagogy.—This subject shall occupy one term, 
and shall be taught in accordance with the recommenda- 
tions contained in the report of the Committee on Peda- 
gogy and Reading Course, which have been adopted 
by this convention. 
2. Algebra.—The course in this subject shall occupy 
the first term, and shall be followed by Geometry in the 
second term. The course shall embrace daily recita- 
tions in selected portions of Elementary Algebra, said 
portions of text, or topics, being selected by the in- 
structor with reference to the special needs of the class. 
3. Geometry.—This course shall occupy the second 
term, following Algebra, and shall consist of daily reci- 
tations upon selected topics or portions of text. 
4. Civil Government.—The course in this study shall 
occupy one term, and shall include instruction in the 
civil government of Tennessee and of the United States, 
with reference to constitutional history, State and 
Federal. 
5. Natural Philosophy.—The course in this branch 
shall occupy one term, and the instruction shall be ele- 
mentary, practical, and as thorough as circumstances will 
admit.. The instruction will consist. of recitations, 
lectures and experiments. Laboratory work will be 
used wherever it is possible. 
6. Rhetoric or Higher English, including Elocution 
or the Art of Public Speaking.—The work in Rhetoric 
or Higher English will occupy both terms, and includes 
the study of masterpieces for style and thought, and 
special points in language study and in literature. The 
subject will be taught topically, partly by lecture and 
partly by text-book. 
The subject of elocution or the art of public speaking 
will occupy one hour per week during one term, and 
may consist of lectures by the instructor, or of declama-
-P-A-G-E-30
—3Ii— 
tions, speeches or recitations by. the class. If pre- 
ferred by the instructor, this subject may extend through 
both terms. 
7. Book-keeping.—This subject will occupy one term. 
The instruction will be practical, and will be directed to 
imparting a knowledge of keeping accounts with accu- 
racy, and to acquiring familiarity with business trans- 
actions and forms. _ 
8. Elementary Geology of Tennessee will occupy one 
term, and will embrace instruction in the elementary 
principles of general geology, the application of these 
principles to the geology of Tennessee, a study of the — 
several geological divisions of the State, the mineral 
deposits, fossils, etc. 
9g. Elements of Agriculture.—This course will em- 
brace the general principles of the science and their 2 ap- 
plication to the soil and the climate of Tennessee. 
10. We recommend that all branches of study be: 
taught with reference to imparting a knowledge of the 
subject-matter, and also with reference to illustrating 
methods of teaching. The exigences of the Institute 
require that the instruction in the subject-matter shall be 
confined to selected topicts or portions of texts, and shall 
be in the form of reviews suited to matured minds and 
to students possessing a previous knowledge of the sub- 
ject. Such instruction should be mainly topical, and 
should be imparted. partly by recitation and partly by 
lecture. ‘ 
IV. We recommend a Gadel: for admission to 
the Secondary Course, must present, on the first or 
second day, a certificate from one of the Peabody or 
State Institutes of Tennessee, showing that the appli- 
cant has completed the Primary Course ; or a certificate 
or diploma from one of the institutions of learning 
authorized by the Tennessee State Board of Education - 
to confer degrees exempting the holder from examina- 
tion. No other applicants can be admitted to the Sec- 
ondary Course.

V. Examinations.—In consideration of the fact that 
graduation in the Secondary Course of the Peabody or 
State Institutes will entitle the graduate to be placed 
upon the Roll of Honor of the State, and to be exempt 
from all future examinations, we recommend that the 
examinations shall be complete and thorough in each 
branch of study, shall extend to the entire subject-mat- 
ter of each branch, and shall not be limited to the topics 
specially treated at the Institute. 
We further‘recommend that the last day of the first 
term, the last two days of the session, and such additional 
_ time as may be necessary, shall be devoted to examina- 
» tions. ; Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PEDAGOGY 
AND: PROFESSIONAL READING. 
We, your Committee on Pedagogy and Professional 
Reading, recommend that the teachers throughout the 
State read during the current year, in the Primary 
Coursg, White’s School Management, and that they be 
required to pass a satisfactory éxamination in the same. 
For Professional Reading, we suggest that they be re- 
quired to read Page’s Theory and Practice of Teaching 
and Painter’s History of Education. 
In the second year’s course we recommend that the 
teachers be examined in White’s Elements of Pedagogy, 
.and that they be required to read Raub’s Methods of 
Teaching, Payne’s School Supervision, and Hughes’ 
Mistakes in Teaching. 
We also recommend that the teachers of the respective
-P-A-G-E-32
3 
counties throughout the State organize themselves into 
“reading circles, ”? to meet monthly, or at least once in’ 
every two months, to discuss the books read and to be 
questioned by the County Superintendent, or such per- 
sons as they may appoint or select, for the purpose of 
testing the progress made in such a course of reading. 
‘We recommend that these reading circles be extended 
through the teachers into and through the different 
grades of the schools, and, to, this end, it is suggested 
by us that the teachers recommend to their pupils of © 
the different grades such a course of supplementary 
reading as will most interest and benefit them, thereby 
cutting off all trashy and worthless literature from the 
children. Tuomas H. Parne,

“Hon, J. L. M. Curry, 
General Agent Peabody Education Fund, 
3 Washington, D. C. 
Dear Sir: Complying with your request that you 
_ be furnished an account of Institute work in Tennessee 
for 1896, and a statement of the expenditure of Peabody 
money, I beg to submit the following report : : 
The funds for the support of the Institutes were de- 
rived from three sources, (1) the Peabody Fund, twelve 
hundred dollars ($1,200) ;*(2) the State appropriation, 4
-P-A-G-E-34
—35— 
fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500) ; (3) and local appro- 
priations from County Courts and city boards of educa- 
tion. All the Institutes supported by these funds were 
under the supervision of the State Superintendent, and 
the grade of work in each was the same; but in appre- 
ciation of the aid extended by the Peabody Board, three 
of the Institutes, one in each grand division of the State, 
were distinguished as Peabody Institutes. There were 
three additional State Institutes, while State aid was 
given in five counties. Three Institutes for colored . 
teachers were supported by State funds, and conducted 
by teachers appointed by this department. 
A meeting of the conductors appointed for the six 
Peabody and State Institutes was held in Nashville on 
April 17 and 18. Those present were: 
Ex-Supt. Thos. H. Paine, Jackson Peabody Institute. 
Prof. Jno. W. Hyden, Lewisburg Peabody Institute. 
Ex-Supt. W. R. Garrett, Chattanooga Peabody In- 
stitute. - 
Capt. C. S. Douglass, Union City State Institute. 
Prof. A. D. Wharton, Morristown State Institute. 
Prof. C. L. Hayes, Knoxville State Institute. 
A programme and syllabus was prepared, a copy of 
which I enclose, and which I desire to submit as a part 
of this report. From it you will gather that a princi- 
ple of the work in Tennessee is, that in the Institutes 
‘*all branches of study shall be taught with special refer- 
ence to imparting a knowledge of the subject-matter, 
as well as with reference to illustrating methods of 
teaching. The exigencies of the Institute require that 
instruction should be confined to selected topics, or por- 
tions of texts, and should be in the form of reviews, 
suited to matured minds, and to students possessing a 
previous knowledge of the subject. Further, that such 
instruction should be mainly topical, and should be im- 
parted partly by recitation and partly by lecture.”’ 
From the very excellent report of Ex-Superintendent,
-P-A-G-E-35
Thos. H. Paine, conductor of the Jackson Peabody In- 
stitute, I take the following: ‘‘The Institute was con- 
ducted very much as a regular school, and no time was 
lost by the introduction of any outside matters that would 
any Way detract from the great purpose of the Institute 
—that of professional training and special instruction in 
subject-matter of the course. A notable feature of the 
Institute was the earnestness of the teachers in attend- 
ance in their efforts to profit by the opportunity offered 
them for improvement, ./: '. .Vhe-teachers were all 
so busily engaged in preparing their daily work that no 
time was found for evening entertainments.”’ 
I desire to invite your special attention in the course 
of study and syllabus to the provision exempting from 
future examinations for teachers’ certificates those who 
complete the full course of study, take the required pro- 
fessional reading, and who have had not less than three 
years’ experience in teaching. ‘ This regulation of the 
State Superintendent has been approved by the State 
Board of Education. In consideration of the fact that 
such graduation would exempt from further examina- 
tion, it was required that the examinations be thorough 
and complete in each branch of study, that they extend 
to the, entire subject-matter in each branch, and that 
they be not limited to the topics specially treated at the 
Institute. These certificates were granted to teachers 
of good moral character, who attended the required 
length of time, at least one-half the recitations in each 
branch of study, who attain in examinations a general 
average of not less than eighty-five, with no grade in any 
branch below fifty, and who had been engaged three 
years in the profession of teaching. Of the ninety-nine 
applicants for Roll of Honor Certificates, forty-three 
succeeded in meeting all the requirements. 
I have not received official reports from all the In- 
stitutes, but the statistics furnished are conservative esti- 
mates, and will not be changed materially by final re- 
ports,
-P-A-G-E-36
—37— 
In the three Peabody: Institutes there was an enroll- 
ment of more than 550 teachers, in the State Institutes 
more than 550, in the county Institutes, aided by State 
funds, 375, in the Institutes for negro teachers, 125, 
bavi a grand total of more than 1,600 teachers, an 
pitrcncs in enrollment over last year of fully fifty per 
cent. This increase is most gratifying when it is con- 
sidered that no increase in the appropriation from either 
Peabody or State funds was enjoyed, that the work was 
conducted in a more systematic manner, and that the 
instruction was more thorough and practical. 
It must not be lost sight of, however, in the matter of 
funds, that at every place where an Institute was located, 
the local authorities responded with a liberal appropria- 
tion, which they placed at the disposal of the State 
Superintendent. 
It is to be hoped that sufficient funds will be appro- 
priated and placed at the disposal of this department to 
support and enlarge the work of the State and Peabody 
Institutes already organized, to give aid in counties in 
which heretofore the State has not sent Institute 
workers, and to more generally place Institute instruc- 
tion within reach of the colored teachers of the State. 
The last report of the State Superintendent showed a 
colored scholastic population of 182,302 taught in 1,648 
schools by 1,778 teachers) The welfare of the State 
demands that these schools be made more efficient by 
_ improvement in their teaching force. 
At the last meeting of the Tennessee Colored 
‘Teachers’ Association the following resolution, show- 
ing their interest in the work, was adopted: ‘ That a 
committee of five be appointed, who shall represent the 
interests of the colored people of the State of Téennes- 
see with reference to urging the claims of our people 
upon the State authorities toward receiving proper recog- 
nition in the State appropriations for normal work.”’ 
The State Teachers’ Association, at Humboldt, July 
23, passed the following: ‘The State and Peabody
-P-A-G-E-37
Be ag 
Institutes held in Tennessee have proved to be exceed- 
ingly helpful to the teachers. ‘They have justified, by 
the great work done in them, the wisdom of the State 
Superintendent in establishing them. By their means 
the great body of teachers who, through lack of funds, 
are unable to attend professional training schools, have 
an opportunity of increasing their efficiency as teachers. 
During the past year, the appropriation of $1,500 
by the State was the means of securing additional appro- 
priations to pay for the training and instruction, for one 
month each, of fifteen hundred teachers ; therefore, be it 
‘‘Resolved, That the State Teachers’ Association re- 
spectfully urges upon the Legislature an ample appro- 
priation for the further maintenance of the Institutes.’’ 
Tennesseans are gratified to read in your last report 
to the Trustees of the Peabody Education Fund, that 
the ‘‘ Peabody Normal College, at Nashville, Tenn., 
has been our pride and joy, and has received a large 
portion of our annual income. The expenditure has 
justified itself in many ways.”’ 
«Because of this liberal policy toward this great insti- 
tution, we are the more thankful that in the support 
given by the Board, through your recommendations, to 
Institutes for teachers, Tennessee is generously remem- 
bered. It is confidently trusted that this expenditure 
will also justify itself. 
With this report I send you a statement of the ex- 
penditure of the twelve hundred dollars ($1,200) ap- 
propriated from the Peabody Education Fund. 
In conclusion, permit me to assure you of the high 
esteem in which you are held by the’ teachers of Ten- 
nessee, and to thank you personally for the interest you 
have manifested in the success of my administration. I 
trust in the future, as in the past, to have the benefit of 
your valuable suggestions. 
I have the honor to be, véry truly yours, 
S. G. GILBreAtu, 
State Superintendent.

To, Hon. S. G. Gilbreath, State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction, Nashville: 
KNoxvILLE STATE INSTITUTE, 
KNOXVILLE, July 17, 1896. 
Dear Str—I have the honor to submit the following 
report of the State Normal Institute, at. Knoxville, 
Tenn., which began June 29th and lasted three weeks. 
We had at the opening one hundred and twenty-four 
teachers in attendance. On Wednesday following the 
secretary reported an enrollment of a much larger num- 
ber. Before the close the number of actual teachers 
reached two hundred and one, with more than fifty vis- 
itors registered, besides many that did not register. 
In addition to the faculty, as reported on the blank 
for that purpose, we had a sub-faculty, employed and 
paid by Mr. McCallie, which occupied a part of the 
time allotted to him and did excellent work in their 
special branches. The sub-faculty was as follows: 
1. Mrs, Genie Mynders, of Ninth Ward School, five 
pe primary lessons with classes. 
. Mrs. Sarah E. Grigg, of the Knodville Kinder: 
dae school, two illustrative lessons in kindergarten 
work. 
3. Prof. Price, of the Knoxville Business ee 
one lesson in penmanship. 
The interest manifested and the attention given to the 
various instructors were perfect.’ From first_to last not 
a moment of disturbance or even a disposition to whis- 
per among those in attendance. Several who came to 
stay only a short while remained to the close of the In- 
stitute. There are many reasons for these gratifying 
results. The place of meeting, the University School, 
was accessible to all and delightfully clean, cool and 
well arranged. Superintendent Ford and Mr. McCal- 
lie left nothing undone that could be thought of to make 
the work pleasant and profitable.
-P-A-G-E-45
Ge 
The Knoxyille daily papers, the Tribune, the Journal 
and the Sentinel each gave full accounts of the pro- 
ceedings daily and did much to keep the work of the 
Institute before the public, and for their generous sup- 
port should have our hearty thanks. 
We had only half day sessions and stuck close to our 
programmes. Outside or irrelevant matters more than 
mere announcements were kept out all together. 
Psychology, Subject Matter and Methods, received 
respectively their proportion of the time. The exer- 
cises were rendered more pleasant by frequent inter- 
spersions of music, led by Prof. J. C. Wilson and Miss 
Augusta Hood. Occasionally this was superseded by 
spicy recitations. 
At the close of the Institute Capt. Frank M. Smith 
volunteered to pay a high tribute to the efficient work 
of retiring Superintendent J. C. Ford, and on behalf of 
the teachers of Knox county presented him a handsome 
gold-headed cane. 
Resolutions were unanimously adopted endorsing the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the County 
Superintendent, the Faculty of the Institute, etc. 
The last three days were devoted to examinations. 
We found that amount of time ‘‘enough, but little 
enough.’’ We spared no pains to see that the examina- 
tion was fairly conducted in every respect and were 
satisfied fully with our success. 
The Institute was not local, though of course Knox 
county took the lead in representation. The roll call of 
counties was as follows: Knox, 180; Sevier, 7; Lou- 
don, 2; Blount, 2; Hawkins, 1; Grainger, 1; Sumner, 
1; Wilson, 1; Lauderdale, 1; Bradley, 1; Roane, 1; 
Union, 1; Greene, 2. 
The personnel of the Institute was especially good. 
The teachers in attendance were ‘true ladies and gentle- 
men—alive to the demands of their profession. Ped- 
antry was conspicuous by its total absence.
-P-A-G-E-46
The Institute enjoyed many courtesies, among others 
a delightful trip in a body to Fountain City as the guest 
of Holbrook Normal College. 
As appendices, you will find-the details of the report 
as required by the department of which you are the 
head. Respectfully submitted, 
Cig a AvEs, 
Conductor.

  GENERAL REMARKS. 
Lewissure, TENn., July 3, 1896. 
flon. S. G. Gilbreath, Nashville, Tenn.: 
My Dear Sir—Our Peabody State Institute, held at 
Lewisburg, Marshall County, Tenn., was a great suc- 
cess; in fact we think it the most satisfactory Institute 
we have ever attended ; peace, unity and harmony pre- 
vailed. I was ably assisted by Professors Goldsby and — 
Lawrence, also by Miss Thenie McLemore. We had 
141 teachers present, representing a large scope of — 
country. The citizens of Lewisburg extended a hearty 
welcome to all teachers, and those interested in educa- 
tion. All the sessions were well attended by citizens 
and friends to edecation from a distance. -The inter- 
est increased from day to day on the part of teachers 
and those friendly to the teaching profession. 
The general educational meetings were well attended, 
and were highly enjoyed by all present. The teachers 
and citizens of Marshall County are quite anxious to 
have the Peabody Institute permanently located at 
Lewisburg. 
Ringing resolutions were unanimously adopted in- 
dorsing Hon. S. G. Gilbreath, who has so well dis- 
charged the duties of State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction during his present term of office, and asked . 
for his reappointment. Upon the whole, the Institute 
was a grand success. Very respectfully, 
Joun W. Hypven, President. 
W. L. Lawrence, Sécretary.

flon. S. S. Stlbreath, Nashville, Tenn.: 
My Dear Sitr—In submitting the following report 
of the State Institute, held at Union City, would add 
that I regard it as one of the most successful and har- 
monious meetings that I have ever held. Certainly the 
teachers who attended were in earnest, and from their 
close application to the work, the deep interest mani- 
fested, and the courteous obedience on their part to 
every regulation and requirement, forces me to submit 
that the Institute was a success in every particular. 
We enrolled two hundred and seven-two (272) teach- 
ers who, for the most part, came with their text books, 
procured boarding houses close to the college and went 
to work in ‘‘spirit and in truth.’’ We held two sessions 
each day, beginning promptly at 8:30 o’clock a.m., and 
closing at 4:30 o’clock p.m., and endeavored to execute, 
to the very letter, the curriculum agreed upon. All of 
the work was practically demonstrated upon the board. 
In truth, the Institute was but a thoroughly organized, 
well equipped and well disciplined school, assembled as 
it were for the mutual benefit and interest of each other. 
My faculty, consisting of Professors Willingham, 
Williams, Henderson and Miss Butler, having been as- 
signed’ especial branches, had thoroughly prepared 
themselves for the work, and for the most part, made 
their instruction telling, interesting and profitable. 
Another feature of this Institute to which I would 
especially invite your attention was the deep interest 
manifested by the citizens in the progress and success 
of the meeting. Not only did large crowds of the 
representative people of the city and vicinity attend 
the daily exercises, but, atthe close of the Institute, 
manifested their appreciation by giving a splendid ban- 
quet to the faculty and teachers, assuring them that 
they were satisfied that a great work was being done 
for that community, and insisted that the Institute be 
_ located with them permanently.
-P-A-G-E-52
—53-— 
In conclusion, I would submit that the locations of 
the Institutes in West Tennessee are good, and, we 
judge from the large attendance of the teachers, that a 
thorough educational enthusiasm has been kindled in © 
that locality that will result in great and lasting good to 
the people. We feel that our teachers are becoming 
thoroughly interested, and are using their best efforts to 
make themselves proficient in their work, and we cer- 
tainly do commend you for the deep interest that you 
have shown in building up and permanently locating 
these Institutes. Let the work go on, and we can but 
foretell rich and glorious results. 
Respectfully, 
C. S. Douetass, 
Conductor.

Hon. S. G. Gilbreath, Nashville: 
Sir—I have the honor to submit herewith a report of 
the work of the Eee? Institute, located by yan at 
Jackson, Tenn. : x 
The Institute opened on Monday, June 8, and closed 
Friday, July 3, inclusive. I invite your attention to the 
accompanying statistics for full information as to the 
enrollment, average daily attendance and general char- 
acter of the work done. A 
The course of study arranged by you was strictly ad- 
hered to, and the work was divided among the mem- 
bers of the faculty as indicated in the statistical report. 
The Institute was conducted very much as a regular 
school, and no time was lost by the introduction of any 
outside matters that would, in any way, detract from 
the great purpose of the Institute, that of professional 
training and special instruction on subject-matter of the
-P-A-G-E-57
course. A notable feature of the Institute was the 
earnestness of the teachers in attendance, in an effort 
to profit by the opportunity offered them for improve- 
ment. 
The work of Prof. G. R. McGee, Prof. Wharton S. 
Jones and Capt. S. A. Mynders was most satisfactory 
in all respects. These gentlemen labored faithfully, by 
day and night, to promote the success of the Institute, 
giving individual instruction to the many who sought 
the same. 
The faculty was materially aided in the work by Miss 
Marianna March, of the Jackson City School, who 
gave a number of most excellent papers on Primary 
Work, illustrating the same by various devices. Mrs. 
C. B. Bell gave an admirable paper on Literature, as 
did Miss Allie Shapard on History. The teachers were 
all so busily engaged in preparing their daily work that 
no time was found even for evening entertainments, 
and none were given, except that of a lecture on 
“ William Shakespear,’’ by Dr. Joseph E. Martin, of 
Jackson. This the teachers very much enjoyed, and 
they pronounced it one of the best literary productions, * 
in the nature of a lecture, to which they had been 
privileged to listen. 
~ Your visit and address gave us all great pleasure. 
Very respectfully, 
Tuomas H. Paine, Presrdent.

Morristown StTatre INSTITUTE. 
Morristown, TENN., July 10, 1896. 
flon. S. G. Gilbreath, Re ion Public Instruc- 
tion: 
Dear Str—Herewith is sopeiece the report of the — 
State Institute held in this place from June 15 to July 
10, inclusive, a session of four full weeks, or twenty 
school days.
-P-A-G-E-63
ogee 
This was the first State Institute ever held in Morris- 
town and, all circumstances considered, it was a success- 
ful and satisfactory one. The instruction given was 
altogether in the primary branches taught in the public 
schools, and nearly every teacher present was a primary 
teacher. Hamblen County being one of the smallest 
counties in population in the State, there was only a 
limited teaching force who could possibly be expected 
to attend; nevertheless, the average attendance of 
teachers present was within six of the entire number 
employed in the county. This fact shows the fine spirit 
and zeal with which the Institute was welcomed. The 
town authorities gave the use of its splendid school 
building in which the daily sessions were held, and 
through Mayor Goodson, in a charming address, every 
one was made to feel as if he was wanted in Morristown. 
President Sherwood, of the Board of Education, took 
an active interest in the Institute, and was often present, 
lending counsel and participating in discussions to the 
profit of all. 
Appended herewith is a copy of the daily programme 
of exercises which was carried outin full every day. It 
worked very smoothly and to the evident enjoyment of all 
the student-teachers. It is commended to your considera- 
tion as a programme for all Institutes where only the pri- 
mary courseistaught. The work done was almost alto- 
gether in the way of actual instruction in branches taught 
in the public schools. Subjects were arranged each day 
for study and the teachers were examined catechetically 
on them the following day. They kept in constant use 
the pencil and tablet, and the liveliest interest was alw ays 
manifested. We honestly think that real good, and 
much of it, was done to the cause of public education 
by this Institute. ‘ 
The last three days of the session were devoted to 
written examinations upon all the subjects taught. The 
questions used and the results are submitted with this re- 
port. There were ten (10) certificates granted of ad-
-P-A-G-E-64
missions to the secondary course from among twenty- 
four applicants who stood the examinations. 
The Conductor and President cannot close this report 
without returning his hearty thanks to Supt. Charles 
Mason and Miss Sallie B. Dyer for the work they did. 
At home in the branches they taught, happy in their 
presentation of the subject matter, easy and self-possessed 
in their bearing while upon the platform, they always 
attracted and held the undivided attention of the Insti- 
tute ; to them its success is mostly due. 
Very respectfully, 
A. D. WuartTon, 
President and Conductor.

Secretary.

' 
Hon. S. G. Gilbreath, State Superintendent of Public 
_Lnstruction : 
Srtr—The State and County Institute held in Greene- 
ville, was opened June 29; and continued for two 
weeks. The School Board of Greeneville kindly ten- 
dered us the use of the public school building for the 
sessions of the Institute, in which they were held until 
Wednesday of the first week, when the crowd became 
so great that the elders of the C. P. Church came to our 
relief and tendered us the use of the basement of their 
church, where the work was continued to the close. 
On the first day we enrolled fifty-five teachers, and 
quite a number of visitors, among the latter were many 
influencial citizens of the city, There was a daily’ in- 
crease in the number of teachers and visitors until the’ 
close, when the record showed an enrollment of one 
hundred and sixty-one teachers and over five hundred 
visitors. The teachers gave us the closest attention 
and much aid during the entire term. The citizens of
-P-A-G-E-66
— 67 — 
Greeneville are anxious to have a permanent State Insti- 
tute established in their city. 
There were present several educators, who rendered 
valuable aid and assistance. Among them we would 
name: Prof. Will A. Cate, Holbrook Normal; Presi- 
dent Jere Moore, Tusculum College; Dr. W. D. Dob- 
son, Missouri State Normal. County Superintendent 
John H. Lane did all in his power to make the Insti- 
tute a success. - : : 
We followed the syllabus to a certain extent, but had 
several valuable addresses by such men as Maj. A. H. 
Pettibone, Hon. J. M. Brabson, A. N: SHO Esq., 
and others. ‘ 
The visit of the State Superintendent on Tuesday of 
the second week, and his plain, practicable and able 
address gave additional interest to the Institute. 
Miss Julia Doak, of Nashville, was, present on“ the 
last day, and gave us a very pleasant talk. 
Hon. J. C. Park, ex-County Superintendent of 
Greene county, gave us a kind welcome to the city. 
I cannot close without testifying to the excellent 
work of my associate instructor, Prof. J. W. Trotter, 
of Knoxville. © His instruction was accurate, inspiring, 
and valuable. : 
Hoping the seed sown at Greeneville may, bring forth: 
. much fruit, and that the teachers of Tennessee may do: 
better work than has ever been done in the past, I am, 
Yours truly, 
J. M. Hicks, Conductor.

Fon. S.-G. Gilbreath, State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction : 
Dear Sir: I most respectfully submit my report of 
the Peabody County Institute, held at Celina, July 6.to 
10, and at LaF ayette, July 13 to 18, 1896. At Celina,
-P-A-G-E-67
SG Gece 
Superintendent M. L. Moore had his teachers aroused 
and they were all in attendance. The Institute sylla- 
bus was followed, as closely as possible, according to 
your instructions. There were enrolled 65 teachers, 
and they were the most prompt set of teachers I ever 
saw in an Institute. They took hold of the work with 
great eagerness. . 
This is the first Institute work that had ever been 
done in this county by the State, and the teachers and 
citizens really appreciated it. Superintendent Moore is 
doing a most excellent work. He is one of the most 
competent county superintendents in Tennessee. We 
held two sessions a day, and had several night sessions. 
The citizens attended the meetings, and seemed much 
reyived in educational matters. 
This Institute work, so wisely begun by you in the 
‘supper Cumberland ”’ country, ought to be continued. : 
Many teachers were in attendance from adjoining 
counties. The teachers decided to have two weeks In- 
stitute next year. They passed a resolution of thanks 
to you for extending this aid to them. 
At LaFayette, there was an attendance of go teachers, 
many coming from adjoining counties. The citizens 
attended the Institute and seemed much interested in 
‘the work. 
There ate some strong teachers in this county, and_ 
many of them rendered valuable services to me in the 
work. Superintendent M. P. Howser, is a very active 
superintendent, and his work is reviving the educational 
interests of Macon county. 
, The teachers have a good County Association that 
meets every month and much good is accomplished by 
it. They decided to hold a two weeks Institute next 
year.” ‘ : 
I gave primary work and school management in both 
institutes more prominence than other subjects, as these 
subjects are more neglected, perhaps, than the more 
advanced branches. 
1 ie
-P-A-G-E-68
— 69 — 
We had some interesting talks from many of the 
citizens on educational topics at the night meetings. 
A very strong resolution was passed thanking you 
for so kindly aiding them in the work, and kindly ask- 
ing the State Department to aid them again next year. 
I have attended Institutes in nearly all of the large 
counties of Tennessee, but I have never seen teachers 
anywhere take hold of Institute work more earnestly 
than did the teachers in both Clay and Macon Counties. | 
Respectfully, : : 
J. L. Brooks, Conductor. 
Lawrence County Instrrute. 
Lesanon, TENN., July 15, 1896. 
Supt. S. G. Gilbreath, Nashville, Tenn.: 
DEAR Str—I do not know that a report of my Insti- 
tute will be required from me, but to be on the safe side 
I will submit a brief one. I ask your special attention 
to some points in the following (note point 6) : 
1. Attendance.—Although there are only 100 schools 
in the county, we enrolled 121 actual teachers. Large 
crowds attended every session who did not enroll. I 
insisted that only those enroll who came to attend reg- 
ularly. We otherwise might have enrolled 160. 
2. Lnuterest.—This word hardly expresses it. Enthu- 
siasm and intense interest characterized every session. 
3. Work.—The Institute was organized as system- 
atically and disciplined as thoroughly as a school. 
Regular topics for study were assigned in all the branches 
of the primary course daily ; much written work was 
done, and every recitation had a definite, preconceived 
object—to arouse a spirit of investigation among the 
teachers ; to illustrate by actual example the bést methods 
of handling every part of each subject, and of managing a 
class, etc. Nothing was taken for granted, but definite, 
authoritative reasons were required for every statement.
-P-A-G-E-69
— 70 — 
In this way I have reason to believe that a spirit of in- 
dependent inquiry was awakened among those teachers 
that will prove a lasting good. 
Miss Duval, my co-worker, proved herself invaluable, 
and her work cannot be too highly commended. 
4. fesults—The teachers have been ‘‘ waked up.”’ 
New methods and new ideas have been shown them, and 
the ‘* good old ones ’’ haye been impresssed. 
- Interest has been aroused among all classes of the 
citizens. Not only indifference, but actual opposition 
was said to exist among the citizens at first. Happily 
‘we were able to overcome that, and before we closed 
the citizens were enthusiastic in our support. 
Expressions from teachers and business men were 
quite complimentary ; such as ‘‘ This is the best Insti- 
tute I ever attended;’’ ‘* This will accomplish more 
good than any thing that ever happened in this county ;”’ 
«This work will raise the standard of teaching in Law- 
rence County,’’ etc. 
5. OnFriday, the last day of the Institute, at a public 
meeting of the teachers and citizens, it was unanimously 
and enthusiastically declared that Lawrenceburg must 
have qne of the four weeks State Institutes next year, 
andin a few minutes $300 good, solvent subscriptions 
was raised to pay half the expense. They wished to 
begin at once, so as to present their claims as strongly 
as possible. 
6. Everywhere appreciation and thanks were tendered 
the State department for holding the Institute. 
Yours truly, 
R. L. McDonavp.

fon. S. G. Gilbreath, Superintendent, Nashville : 
Dear Str—Acting under your orders, the writer last
-P-A-G-E-70
—7i— 
week conducted a Teachers’ Institute at Jamestown, 
Fentress county. The Institute began June 22, and 
lasted one week. There was a good attendance, forty- 
three teachers being enrolled and in full attendance 
each day. The morning sessions were taken up in the 
recitation of lessons previously assigned, in model 
recitations conducted by teachers with Jamestown chil- 
dren as pupils, and in instruction by the conductor. The 
exercises of the afternoon consisted of discussion in 
regard to methods of teaching, school organization, 
school management, school government, and other 
topics of interest to the teachers ; and visitors present, in- 
terested in the work, made short talks on educational 
subjects. 2 
On Thursday night an ‘‘ Educational Rally ’’ was 
held, and the teachers were addressed by several of 
the foremost professional men of the county, who gave 
many words of counsel and inspiration. : 
The County Superintendent, Miss Ellen Wright, is a 
young lady of marked ability, and one much interested 
in the work of public education. Under her careful 
supervision the schools of Fentress county are making 
decided advancement. 
All the teachers present took a lively interest in the 
exercises of the entire week, and I believe good will 
result from the meeting. Very truly, : 
O.N. Smiru.

Supt. S. G. Gilbreath, Nashville, Tenn.: 
DEAR Srr—Our Institute has closed and many of 
our schools have been in session almost one week. Our 
Institute was largely attended and is unanimously pro- 
nounced the best that has ever been held in our county. 
Prof. J. L. Brooks arrived Monday evening. We had
-P-A-G-E-71
—72— 
spent the day in organizing and discussing the first 
work of the syllabus. In the absence of Prof. Brooks 
I made an assignment of work for Tuesday. Prof. 
Brooks made no change in the plan I had mapped out 
for the week. He gave his best energies to make the 
work interesting, and had you looked over the entire 
Union I do not think you could have sent us a man 
better adapted to our needs.

TRENTON, TENN,, June.14, 1896. 
Hlon. S. G. Gilbreath, Superintendent of Public 
Instruction: 
DEAR Str—The following I most respectfully submit 
as my report of the Colored State Institute held at 
Trenton, beginning June 8, and-continuing one week. 
Although little time was allowed for advertising this 
Institute, yet from its very beginning a complete success 
seemed assurred, for our seats were nearly filled upon 
the first day, and every teacher seemed anxious for the 
work, and entered, as it were, resolved to cultivate 
every apportunity presented. In obedience to instruc- 
tion from the State department we adopted the pri- 
mary course of study and syllabus for Peabody and 
State Institutes, and all the time adhered closely to the 
text. : 
Finding the teachers not sufficiently prepared in the 
primary course, we used recitation as the plan of instre- 
tion. We gave full time to each study in the course. 
I found some very good local talent, which gaye me 
very beneficial assistance. Two sessions were held 
each day, closing at 4 o’clock, and all the time being 
given to essential and practical work. While there are 
_about forty (40) teachers in the county, we succeeded 
in enrolling sixty (60) or more.
-P-A-G-E-72
—73-— 
We are pleased to say that there was a deep interest 
manifested by the citizens, for not a session was held 
but that we had a good representation of the people. 
Each night we held a meeting in one of the churches, 
at which there were addresses on education and other 
literary exercises rendered. This feature was appre- 
ciated by a crowded house each night. 
There were thirty who took the primary examination, 
and now applying for a secondary certificate. A 
  majority of those examined passed. 
I must frankly admit that most of the success of this 
Institute is due to the strong practical and energetic 
Superintendent, Miss Flora Fitzgerald, who during the 
entire session never wavered in her duty or relaxed her 
efforts in the discharge of every obligation. 
If in your wise judgement and benevolence the col- 
ored teachers of the western division of the State are 
given a four weeks Institute I think no better place 
than Trenton could be selected. | 
In conclusion, I will say, taking all in all, this Insti- 
tute was a grand success and has done great good. 
Respectfully, 
J. B. Barre, Conducior.

In the Act of 1873 establishing a public school sys- 
tem in Tennessee, the school age was fixed at from six 
to eighteen years. The acts of 1879 amended the law 
so as to read from six to twenty-one years. The reason 
for this extension of the school age, if oe ever existed, 
has certainly passed. 
The following table will prove interesting :

The showing would be much better if the large schol- 
astic population should be lessened by making the 
school age from six to eighteen years. This will ex- 
plain why the per cent. of enrollment and attendance 
in Tennessee is not greater. Not taking into considera- 
tion those over eighteen years of age, it would be con- 
servative to estimate those enrolled at 75 per cent., while 
the average daily attendance would not fall far short of 
60 per cent. But few people over eighteen years of age 
are enrolled in the public schools, and it is recommended 
that the law of 1873 on this point be revived. 
QUALIFICATIONS OF TEACHERS. 
It is made the duty of the State Superintendent to
-P-A-G-E-87
oo — 
prescribe the mode of examining and licensing school 
teachers, and their necessary qualifications. 
Under date of April 1, 1896, the following regulations 
were prescribed : 
To the County Superintendents: 
You are earnestly requested to follow the instructions 
as to the examination and licensing of teachers. 
1. Read the explanation at the bottom of the certifi- 
cate,-and then act accordingly. 
Explanation.—The grade of attainments ranges from 
1to 10. Seven is the lowest average accepted. No 
applicant should be admitted to the first grade unless he- 
shall average in his examination at least 84 on all the 
subjects required to be taught in a Secondary School, nor 
to a second grade unless his average is at least 7 on the 
same subjects required for first grade. Third grade 
certificates are to be given to those whose average is 84 
on the subjects required in the Primary Schools. 
2. A public school certificate is not a license to teach 
school; neither is a public school diploma. Those who 
present these and demand a teacher’s certificate thereon 
have been misinformed. See that all such are examined. 
3. Persons holding diplomas from the Peabody Nor- 
mal College are exempt from examination. Their 
diplomas are equal to life certificates. 
Note.—The following regulations have been ade 
by the State Board of Education: 
‘*All persons who are exempt from examination for 
teachers’ certificates, by authority of the State Board of 
Education, shalt conform to the requirements of the 
State Superintendent, as to time when said persons shall 
make application to the County Superintendent for teac- 
hers’ cerificate.”’ 
‘« Parties holding roll of honor certificates issued by ~ 
the State or Peabody Institutes, shall be exempt from 
examination for teachers’ certificates in any of the 
counties of the:State.”’ 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  —9I— 
4. Graduates from reputable colleges in this State, or 
those who come to us from other States who hold di- 
plomas from reputable colleges, should be given certifi- 
cates without examination. Teachers of well-known 
ability, and who have been successful in their profession, 
should be given certificates without “examination, and 
teachers recommended by the State Superintendent 
must be granted certificates without examination. 
5. The annual examination should be held at the 
close of the County Institute. All certificates expire on 
the 30th day of June following the date of issuance. 
6. Do not issue a. certificate to an incompetent per- 
son, no matter what pressure may be brought to bear. 
Stand firm on this point, and you will be commended. 
Urge upon your teachers the value of attending Insti- 
tutes, reading school journals and professional literature. 
7. Start a teachers’ library in your county immedi- 
ately, if one has not been established. _ Use every means 
possible to improve the teachers of your respective coun- 
ties. You will have my co-operation at all times. 
Yours truly, ‘ 
S. G. GruprEaTtH, 
Superintendent. 
(See School Laws, Section 7, Sub-section 9, and Sec- 
tion g, Sub-section 4.) 
QUALIFICATIONS OF DIRECTORS. 
It is provided in section. 11, of the Public School 
Laws that any person shall be eligible to the office of 
director who is qualified, by being able to read intelli- 
gently and write legibly, to perform the duties required. 
This requirement should be strictly met, and when the 
County Superintendent is notified that an incompetent 
person has been elected director, he should declare the 
election void, and proceed to fill the same by appoint- 
ment as authorized by section 16, of the Public School 
Laws. The law has not been strictly followed in all
-P-A-G-E-89
oo 
cases, and in the event that it is not more generally ob- 
served, specific legislation should be had, clothing the 
County Superintendent with authority to remove from 
office those directors not possessing the required quali- 
fications. i 
QUALIFICATIONS oF County SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The Legislature of 1895 very wisely passed a law | 
raising the standard of qualification of County Superin- 
tendents, by requiring each applicant for that position 
to undergo a public examination, under rules and regu- 
lations prescribed by the State Board of Education. 
Acting under authority given in said Act the State 
Board, on August 15, 1896, issued the following cir- 
cular: 
QUALIFICATIONS OF COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
: CHAPTER 54. 
An Act to amend an Act passed March 6, 1873, and 
‘approved March 15, 1873, entitled ‘“‘An Act to 
establish.and maintain a uniform system of Public 
Schools, and to define the qualifications of the 
County Superintendent of Schools.’’ 
Secrion 1. Be at enacted by the General Assembly 
of the State of Iennessee, That Section 8 of Chapter 
25 of said Acts of 1873, be, and the same is, so amended 
as to read: ‘Said County Superintendent shall be a 
person of literary and scientific attainments, and of skill 
in the theory and practice of teaching ; provided, that 
preceding each biennial election, or any election to fill 
a vacancy for County Sapenicnada of Schools, each 
applicant shall file with the Chairman of the County 
Court a certificate of qualification given by the State 
Board of Education ; provided, that on the first Mon- 
day in October preceding each biennial election for 
County Superintendent of Schools, each applicant for 
said office shall undergo a public examination at the 
county site of the county in which he or she is an ap-

plicant, by and before a commission of three residents 
of the county, said commission to be previously ap- 
pointed by the Chairman of the County Court, and to 
be citizens who, by education and experience, are most 
eminently qualified to hold said examination, the same 
to be held under such rules and regulations as may be 
prescribed by the State Board of Education; provided, 
that if qualified as attested by said examination, said 
applicant shall receive a certificate of qualification by 
the State Board of Education.”’ 
Sec. 2. Be tt further enacted, That this Act take 
effect from and after its passage, the public welfare re- 
quiring it.

RULES AND REGULATIONS, 
To carry into effect Chapter 54 of the Acts of 1895, 
defining the qualifications of County Superintendents, 
the following rules and regulations are prescribed by 
the State Board of Education, ee under authority 
ay en by said Act: 
: The examination shall be written, and shall begin 
on er first Monday in October preceding each biennial 
election for County Superintendent of Schools, and may 
continue two days. 
2. The examination, in addition to papers on all the 
branches in which instruction is now given in the Pub- 
lic Schools, shall embrace questions on Theory and 
Practice of Teaching and School Law. ; 
3. The questions for examination will be prepared by 
the State Board of Education, and sent by said Board
-P-A-G-E-91
on 
to the various commissions appointed by the Chairmen 
of the County Courts, as provided in the Act. The 
questions will be mailed under seal, and must not be 
opened until the day of examination, and then in the 
presence of the commission and applicants. 
4. The papers submitted by the applicants shall be 
carefully graded by the commission, and the papers, 
with the grades marked thereon, shall be forwarded, 
within five days from the date of the examination, to 
the State Superintendent of Public Instruction for final 
grading by the State Board of Education. 
5. Under the proyisions of the Act the State Board 
has no authority to exempt from examination applicants 
for certificates of qualification for the position of County 
Superintendent. 
By order of the State Board of Education, in called 
session, held August 15, 1896. 
FRANK GoopMAN, Secretary. 
This being the first trial of the law some confusion 
necessarily resulted, but examinations were held in 
eighty-six counties on the first Monday in October. 
The questions were prepared by the State Board, and 
sent under seal by the State Superintendent to the 
members of the Examining Commission, with instruc- 
tions to open only on the day of examination, and then 
in the presence of the applicants. The papers of the 
applicants were graded by the Examining Commission, 
and, when necessary, were re-graded by a committee 
appointed for that purpose by the State Board. 
In the eighty-six counties in which examinations 
were held October 5th, 208 applicants received Certifi- 
cates of Qualification, an average of less than three to 
the county. aS 
It is estimated that heretofore the average number of 
applicants in each county was not less than five, so the 
operation of the law has been satisfactory in that it has . 
lessened the number of contestants and raised the
-P-A-G-E-92
es ODN ‘ 
standard, by cutting out those unprepared and unfitted 
for the work of the Superintendency. 
A second examination was ordered for November 
27th and 28th, in the ten counties where total failures 
were reported. In nine of these counties applicants 
were examined and granted Certificates of Qualification, 
leaving only one county in the State, Lake, with no 
qualified condidate. 
The following is the list of questions prepared for the 
first examination, October 5 and 6, .1896.

The scholastic year closes June 30. The enumeration 
of the scholastic population shows the number of children 
between the ages of 6 and 21 on that day, although the 
census is taken ‘‘in the month of July.’’? District di- 
rectors are required to report annually to the County 
Superintendent of Schools, on the 15th day of Septem- 
ber. Their term of office, which is for two years, be- 
gins September 1. The County Trustee is required to 
report on the 15th of September in each year to the 
’ County Superintendent of Schools a full and correct 
report of the school money received and disbursed by 
him. 
County Superintendents are required to make an an- 
nual report to the State Superintendent on the ist of
-P-A-G-E-99
— 102 — 
October. Their term of office is two years from the 
first Monday in January. 
The State Superintendent is required to submit to the 
Governor a report in each year on or before the 15th 
of December. His term of office is two years from the 
date of his appointment. 
It is seen from the above that the beginnings of the 
terms of the various officials in our school system are 
scattered throughout the year, and that with the scho- 
lastic year closing June 30, the final report is not re- 
quired until December 15th following. The reports 
being thus delayed are often wholly neglected, and much 
confusion results. To avoid this, and make possible the 
collection of more reliable statistics as to school work, I 
beg to make the following suggestions : 
District Directors and Trustees should be required to 
report to the County Superintendents on or before July 
15, annually, the scholastic year closing June 30, as is 
now the case. 
County Superintendents should be required to make 
their annual report to the State Superintendent on or 
before August 1. The report of the State Superin- 
tendent to the Governor should be made on or before 
the 15th of September in each year. 
The term of office of the State Superintendent should 
date from July 1, the beginning of the scholastic year, 
and should be for four years. 
Directors are not required to submit a report until 
September 15, while their term of office closes Septem- 
ber 1, consequently many of them fail to submit any re- 
port whatever of their work. Failing to receive state- 
ments from the District Directors, the County Super- 
intendent finds it next to impossible to make a full and 
correct report to the State Superintendent, which greatly 
embarrasses this official in the making of his report to 
the Governor. / 
It is believed that the changes suggested, if made, 
would be a step toward a more uniform system, and
-P-A-G-E-100
— 103 — 
would greatly facilitate the collecting of reliable sta- 
tistics, and the attention of our Legislature is called to 
the advisability of the amendments outlined. 
It is made the duty of the State Superintendent to 
prepare and distribute blank forms for all returns re- 
quired by law, or deemed by him necessary to be made 
by teachers, school officers and county superintendents, 
for the use of the several counties. At the present time 
seventeen forms are used, as follows: 
No. 1—County Superintendent's Report to Oe State 
Superintendent. 
No. 2—Trustee’s Report to County Superintendent. 
No. 3—Trustee’s Report to State Superintendent. 
No. 4—Blanks for Enumerating Scholastic Popula- 
tion. ‘ 
No. 5—Directors’ Report to County Superintendent. 
No. 6—Abstract, Directors’ copy (now in Register) . 
No. 7—Abstract, County Superintendent’s copy (now 
in Register). 
No. 8 —Teachers’ Contracts. 
No. g—Teachers’ Certificates. 
No. 1o—City Superintendent’s Report to County Su- 
perintendent. 
No. 11—City Superintendent’s Report to State Su- 
perintendent. 
No. 12—Warrant Book. 
No. 13—District Clerk’s Record. 
No. 14—Primary Registers. 
No. 15—Secondary Registers. 
No. 16—Certificates for Pupils Completing Fifth 
Grade. 
No. 17—Diplomas for Pupils Completing School 
Course. , 
In addition, he is required to have printed and dis- 
tributed to County Superintendents and other school 
officers as many copies of the school law as may be © 
necessary, with appropriate forms for carrying. said 
laws into execution.
-P-A-G-E-101
— 104 — 
For the printing and distributing of all these forms, 
school laws, etc., $4,000 per annum is appropriated. In 
this connection I beg to call attention to the fact that 
there are more than 7,500 schools in the State, and 
more than 3,000 districts to be supplied. The cost of 
printing alone, the contract for which is made by a 
printing commission, exceeds the appropriation, as can 
. be seen by the following statement showing the ex- 
penses of the department for the scholastic year closing 
June 30, 1896:

SCHOOL EXHIBITS IN THE TENNESSEE 
CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 
The public school teachers have shown much interest 
in the proposed exhibit of school work in the Tennes- 
see Centennial Exposition, which opens May 1, 1897, 
and continues six months. That the exhibits might be 
prepared and placed with some uniformity, and that 
teachers might be further encouraged to prepare suit- 
able exhibits of their work, and thus do credit to the 
State, the following instructions were prepared by the 
committee appointed for that purpose: 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PREPARATION OF SCHOOL Ex- 
HIBITS FOR CHILDREN’S DEPARTMENT OF THE 
TENNESSEE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION. 
Believing that the public school system of Tennes- 
see should be represented by a display of its work at 
its Centennial Exposition, and that it is possible to make 
such a display thereof as will excel all former exhibits 
of this kind, we, the undersiged committee, appointed 
for that purpose, would respectfully submit the follow- 
ing suggestions as to dimensions and material to be 
used in the preparation of school work for such exhib- 
its. By observing these suggestions, uniformity will 
be maintained, and the beauty and the force of the ex- 
hibit will be greatly enhanced thereby’ 
The aim of this exhibition is to show as nearly as 
possible the present educational standing of the schools 
of Tennessee, and only such work as is regularly taught 
in the schools should find a place in the exhibit. The « 
more nearly the real, every-day work of the school is 
represented, the more interesting and instructive will 
this feature of the Centennial appear.
-P-A-G-E-103
. — 106 — 
1. Each school or system of schools should prepare 
specimens: for exhibition in two ways—(a) “on wall 
space, (b) on tables. 
2. The exhibit on wall space should be enough to 
give a general idea of the character of work done in 
the different branches taught in the grades represented, 
and should be mounted on cardboard or heavy paper, 
22 x 28 inches, or as nearly this size as possible. 
3. Each specimen should be headed so as to show at 
a glance the following: Name of pupil, grade or year 
in school, name of school or system of schools, and 
when executed. 
4. The wall exhibits shall consist of maps, drawings, 
framed or otherwise, photograps of schools, school 
buildings and school grounds, and all other specimens 
of work suited to such space. 
5. All general class work should be tied or bound 
together in such a manner as will permit it to be easily 
inspected. These bound specimens will be placed on 
tables below wall exhibit, and should constitute the 
greater portion of “exhibit. On outside cover ‘should 
appear the name of study, grade or year in school, and? 
name of school or system of schools. 
6. As nearly as possible all branches taught in the 
school should be represented in such exhibit. Ample 
space will be provided on tables or walls for all work 
in clay modeling, paper cutting, stick laying, drawing 
and painting, penmanship, children’s handiwork of all 
descriptions, Arithmetic, Physiology, etc. 
7. All schools or systems of schools, public or pri- 
vate, doing primary and preparatory work are requested 
to contribute to this exhibit of the Children’s Depart- 
ment. It has been decided by the Classifications Com- 
mittee that all exhibits of school work, representing 
individually any public school, county, or city, shall be 
made in the Children’s Building, Each county exhibit 
should include a complete map of the county, showing
-P-A-G-E-104
— 107 — 
the location of the different schools, and may also in- 
clude school reports, catalogues, manuals, etc. 
All applications for space should be made to W. T. 
Davis, Chief of the Children’s Department. 
This committee would respectfully invite the co- 
operation of all teachers and school officials, and would 
urge the importance of preparing and reporting exhibits 
at least thirty days before the opening of the Exposi- 
tion, May 1, 1897. Do not “delay, but write at once. 
All space for school exhibits will be free. 
Have your school represented, your county repre- 
sented, and your city represented. : 
Report at the earliest date posstble the probable 
amount of space wanted.

Committee. 
The Department of Public Instruction has not been 
directly recognized by the Exposition Company, but 
the efficient Chief of the Children’s Department, Prof. 
W. T. Davis, has been untiring in his efforts to secure 
a creditable exhibit of public school work. 
TEMPERANCE PuystoLocy. 
The law requiring, that in addition to the branches 
in which instruction was then given the public schools 
of the State, Physiology and Hygiene, with special 
reference to the nature of alcoholic drinks and narcotics 
and smoking cigarettes and their effect upon the hu- 
man system, should be taught as thoroughly as other 
required branches, did not go into effect until January 1, 
1896, yet the number of those enrolled in Physiology 
and Hygiene has largely increased since that date. 
Text-books on Temperance Physiology have been 
adopted in almost every county in the State, and the
-P-A-G-E-105
— 108 — 
requirement that the subject be taught as thoroughly as 
other required branches will be observed by the super-— 
4ntendents and other school officials. 
The text-book question is one that has been much, 
and very often bitterly, discussed in States having 
public school systems. The cost of books for 500,000 
children, which number must be supplied in Tennes- 
see, is necessarily very great, and to furnish their chil- 
dren with the required texts is found a very heavy bur- 
den to many parents. Happily for us we have avoided 
a State adoption, with its many objectionable features, 
though it has been eloquently championed by those who 
profess to believe that it would prove a panacea for all 
school book evils of which complaint is made. 
The entire matter is left in the hands of the local 
authorities by the following provision: ‘‘ It shall be the 
duty of the County Superintendent to keep himself in- 
formed as to the merits of text-books and to suggest to 
the District Directors such changes as may from time 
to time be advisable, with a view to securing uniformity 
in the course of study throughout the county, when it 
can be done without increased expense to the parent.’? 
Those who secured the enactment of this law were 
wisely influenced by two considerations, which should 
underlie all school book legislation, (1) uniformity 
throughout the county, and (2) without increased ex- 
pense to the parent. An economical system must be 
based on these two principles. 
In connection with our method of adoption two criti- 
cisms are heard, and those who criticise have just 
grounds of complant, though they sometimes attribute 
them to the wrong source. These criticisms are, (1) 
The cost of books, and (2) the number of branches in 
» which instruction is given. Neither can be met by 
changing our method of adoption. ; 
The cost of books can be lessened by making fewer 
changes in adopted texts. When a series of books are 
selected for use in the schools for a term of years, the,
-P-A-G-E-106
— 109 — 
Superintendent and Directors should strictly enforce 
their use, regardless of the particular whims or wishes _ 
of the teachers, and should permit no change to be made 
until the expiration of the period for which they were 
adopted. 
The cost of school books can be kept down by having 
the various school book companies compete with each 
other in the open market, and by forcing local dealers 
to sell at less profit to themselves. When a legal adop- 
tion has been made, a public contract should be entered 
into, setting forth. the price of the different books, as 
agreed to by the Superintendent and Directors. This 
price list should be put into the hands of each teacher, 
and he should see to it that the patrons of his school are 
protected from “iolation of the contract and extortionate 
profits made by booksellers. The number of books re- 
quired for country schools is very reasonable, if changes 
in texts are not made with every change of teacher. 
To correct the evils that are complained of paternalism 
in the form of a State adoption is not desired ; it would 
be flying to other ills greater than we now ‘endure, and 
the demand for such legislation, if any exists, does not 
come from the practical school people of the State. 
The attention of the Superintendent has been repeat- 
edly called to the waste of school money in the purchase 
of worthless school supplies in the shape of high-priced 
charts, maps, etc. Directors often are not familiar 
with the aids needed in the school-room, and give orders 
upon the recommendation of the agent, without consult- 
ing the County Superintendent or teacher. In this way 
tens of thousands of dollars have been lost to the school 
children of the State. : 
Attention was called to this waste in the following 
circular issued from this department :
-P-A-G-E-107
Or 
STATE oF TEND 
DEPARTMENT OF PusBLic INSTRUCTION, 
  NASHVILLE, March 20, 1896. 
To District School Directors: 
. Ina circular to the County Superintendents, issued 
from this department September 20, 1895, attention was 
called to the waste of school funds by the purchase of 
unnecessary and worthless apparatus, charts, maps, etc. 
I deem it necessary to emphasize the warning then 
- given; and, to assist you in further protecting the school 
funds, I make the following suggestions : 
1. Do not purchase school apparatus, maps, charts, 
etc., from traveling agents or tramp Canvassers. 
2. Order all school supplies from or through y our 
local dealers or direct from the publishers. 
3. All orders for supplies should be made by the Board 
of Directors, in session, and not by the members of the 
Board individually. 
4. Do not sign your name to any testimonial, recom- 
mendation, note, school warrant, or any other paper at 
the solicitation of a stranger or chart agent. 
5: When you purchase school supplies, be sure that 
the articles are actually needed, and know that your 
order is for the very thing wanted. 
6. If the school funds are wasted, or foolishly ex- 
pended, the School Directors are the officials responsible 
» for the loss. a Very tauly,

Extracts from Annual Reports 
OF 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
BEDFORD COUNTY, 
\ 
J. H. Allen, Superintendent. 
I have forwarded my statistical report of the public 
schools of Bedford County for the scholastic year ending 
June 80, 1896. This report will complete my record as 
County Superintendent of this county, a record extending 
over a period of twelve years of hard but very pleasant 
work. ’ B : 
My predecessors—J. R. Dean, J. L. Iintson, and W. H. 
Whiteside—were worthy, faithful, and efficient, men; 
hence I found the work in good condition, comparatively 
speaking, when I came into the office. I continued build- 
ing on the foundation so well laid, and have studiously 
sought to keep the work growing in every department. 
Our growth has been slow, but substantial and. steady. 
My bumble efforts have been well and cheerfully sus-_ 
tained by, the county court, directors, and teachers, to all 
of whom I am placed under many and lasting obligations. 
Their generous and hearty codperation has made my work 
very pleasant, and has led to many substantial and impor- 
tant improvements. Teachers are better qualified, houses 
much improved and better furnished, enrollment larger, 
attendance much more regular, general interest in public 
education much greater. kor
-P-A-G-E-169
la os ae 
From a system composed of 103 primary schools, taught, 
in many instanecs, by incompetent teachers, we have 
grown into a system made up of 65 primary and 55 sec- 
ondary ‘schools. Our primary schools are much better 
than they were ten years ago, because the importance of 
correet primary teaching is better understood. Onur sec- 
ondary schools are of a truly legal type. None of them 
employ less than two teachers, and they are so distributed 
throughout the county as to place a good secondary school 
within easy reach of almost every child. 
The public school directors and teachers of this county 
have been well organized for several years. The semian- 
nual meetings of the Directors’ Association are held in May 
and December; the Teachers’ Association meets annually, 
and continues in session two weeks. If I have been suc- 
cessful in my work, it is largely due to the ready and hearty 
codperation of these associations. 
Since my last annual report, Shelbyville has established 
a first-class corporation school system. The town now has 
a large, beautiful, well-arranged, and well-furnished new 
building, an excellent corps of teachers, and consequently 
an excellent school system. 
The Teachers’ Institute this year maintained its former 
zyecord in every particular. I was held in the new public 
school building in Shelbyville, continued two weeks, and * 
closed with publi¢ examination July 3. The attendance 
was good, as my statistical report show 
pleased with the generdl results of the work. We were fa- 
vored with addresses by Dr. Kirkland, of Vanderbilt Uni- f and all were 
  _versity; Prof. J. W. Terrill, of Terrill College; and our 
State Superintendent. The addresses were of the highest 
erder, clear, strong, and practical, and‘were much appre- 
ciated, © ‘ ‘ s

BENTON COUNTY. 
‘L. Witt Cuff, Superintendent. 
  
Inclosed you will please find my second annual report of 
the schools of Benton County for the year ending June 30, 
1896. While the educational interest is not the best, yet 
it is much better in this county than formerly. I am very 
glad to see the interest manifested by the school directors 
and patrons in all parts of the county in all our educational 
meetings. We have a Teachers’ Association, which meets 
every few weeks in variqus parts of the county, which is 
well attended by the teachers. I think these meetings 
have been of great benefit to the teachers of the county, as 
these meetings are attended by the best talent in the coun- 
ty, who take great interest in the discussion of various edu- 
cational subjects, which makes it interesting for all who | 
attend. I held a “ Normal Training School” at Big San- 
dy, beginning June 15, and continuing two weeks. This 
was well attended by the teachers of the county, and was 
pronounced a success by all. This was the first school of 
this kind ever held in the county, and no one knew how it 
would sueceed. However, it is no longer an experiment, 
but an established fact, that such a school can be held. I. 
had a very able faculty, it being composed of the following 
eminent instructors, who did excellent work, and were 
highly praised by the teachers in attendance: J. W. Blair, 
Orthography, Grammar, and Geography; J. C. King, Pen- 
manship and Mathematics;)D. G. Curd, Physiology, Ten- 
nessee History, and United States History; J. F. Peeler, 
Reading, Theory, and Practice. The Normal was favored 
with very able addresses by the following distinguished 
men and educators, which was 'very instructive and appre- 
ciated by all in attendance: Prof. W. T. Wade, of the - 
Dickson Normal; Prof. John T. Hill, of Bolivar; Rey. W. 
A. Diggs, Dr. Luter, and Dr. Cunningham, At the close 
of the Normal resolutions were unanimously passed re-
-P-A-G-E-171
—174— 
questing the County Superintendent to hold a month’s 
Normal next year. \ fC 
I also held examinations at Camden and Holladay to 
give those who could not attend the Normal an opportu- 
nity of attending a written examination, which they did. 
I have visited most of the schools of the county, and find 
them in good shape, being conducted nicely in most cases. 
Most all the schools will be five months in length this 
year, or nearly so. The County Court increased the 
school fund this year; consequently the apportionment is 
more to the scholar than it has been for years. 
Tn short, I can say that I am greatly pleased with the 
educational outlook in Benton County, as our schools are 
on a higher plane than formerly. Our teachers and diree- 
tors are endeavoring to keep up and do better work all 
along the Jine. May such continue in old Benton. 
BRADLEY COUNTY. 
James I. Harrison, Superintendent. 
  
In submitting to you my fourth annual report of the 
schools of Bradley County, it gives me pleasure to say that 
the work being done in this county is very satisfactory. 
Neariy all the schools are very well graded. Our teachers 
seem to be very enthusiastic in the work. Nearly all the 
schoolhouses are new and very well furnished with desks 
aud blackboards. fa 
CAMPBELL COUNTY. 
  
Miss Rutha B. Davis, Superintendent. 
I hereby submit my fourth annual report. I have used 
every effort in gathering directors’ reports and- teachers’.
-P-A-G-E-172
abstracts, desiring my report exact. I think it is very near 
correct. : 4 
T held a five-days’ Normal at College Hill. Ninety-five 
teachers and many visitors were present. Our friend, 
Prot. R. A. Brown, of Knoxville, conducted the work, and 
proved himself well equipped. We are still reaping its 
fruits. In our teachers’ mectings, which are held every 
three weeks in different parts of the county, teachers and 
friends are very much interested along the line of educa- 
tion. . 
I held the first Normal that was ever held in my county, 
and have kept this up every year since. I have sacrificed 
my small salary to employ a first-class instructor, and T 
am proud to,say great improvements have been made in 
our school work. 
I have visited almost all of my schools, and find them 
doing nicely. The failure of the T rustee and fraud of the 
chart agent have been a great hurt. 
My term will soon close, and I feel like the Lord has 
been working with us, and showers of blessing have fallen 
on Campbell County. 
CARTER COUNTY. 
RR. M. Cass, Superintendent. 
[ have the honor to transmit herewith my annual report 
of the public schools of Carter County for the year ending 
June 30, 1896. Our schools have made substantial prog- 
ress during the past year. ‘Teachers and pupils are work- 
ing with a zeal which is a sure harbinger of success. It 
is true, there is still considerable apathy among parents; 
but the increasing interest among teachers and pupils is 
sure to communicate itself to them soon. 
Milligan College, Milligan, Carter County, and Holly 
Springs College, Butler, Johnson County, furnish very
-P-A-G-E-173
176 — 
nearly all the teachers for our Carter County publie’ 
schools. 
I secured the services of Prof. J. P. McConnell, Pres- — 
ident of Milligan College, and Prof. J. H. Smith, Pres- 
ident of Holly Springs College, for our County Normal. 
' About forty teachers attended. The work was carried on 
with earnestness and enthusiasm from the beginning. 
Many distinguished educators from other parts of the State 
honored us with their presence. 
A written examination- was held during the last week, 
and certificates issued to those found worthy. 
A number of local Institutes have been held since the 
close of the County Normal, and all have been interesting 
and successful. The effect on the schools of our county 
has been marked. The attendance has increased; pupils 
are manifesting more interest, and better order is being 
kept, with less corporal punishment than formerly. The 
only drawback has been lack of sufficient funds to continue 
the schools the length of time which their importance de- 
mands; and we still hope that this defect will be remedied 
when it is more clearly pointed out by our teachers and 
leading educators, and the great importance of cultivating 
the.minds and hearts of the young is more clearly perceived 
by our people. 
’ CHESTER COUNTY. 
Miss Hattie Massengill, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my annual report. I am pleased to 
state that the schools in Chester County are in good con- 
dition. In visiting schools, I see that the teachers are alive 
to their work. We hold monthly Institutes, which are 
well attended by teachers and patrons. All are enthusias- 
tic, and our meetings are interesting and beneficial.

CLAY COUNTY. 
M. L. Moore, Superintendent. 
I have the honor toysubmit herewith my second annual 
report for the scholastic year ending June 30, 1896. Iam 
glad to note the improvement that is being made in the _ 
schools of this county. I have visited all the schools twice 
since I have been County Superintendent. One or two 
were not in session at the time of my visitation, sickness be- 
ing the cause. T have invariably sent the teachers a print- 
ed notice of my visitation, so that they could strive to bring 
out the patrons. In many instances the schools have been 
well attended by the patrons, and I feel that the interest in 
public education has been increased. 
Our Institutes have been very interesting and successful, 
We had Superintendent Johnson, from Jackson County, 
with us during the Institute held under this report. 
I must be excused for anticipating the report of next 
Sie to tell of the excellent work done this year by Prof. 
J. D. Brooks. We are quite thankful that you were so 
howls and kind as to send us so able and efficient an ~ 
instructor as Prof. Brooks. I have found many of his val- 
uable suggestions made in the Institute being carried out 
by my teachers during my-visits to the schools this year. 
We sorely need three things to make our schools better: 
1. A larger school fund, which could be obtained in coun- 
ties like this by having each child in the State to receive ~ 
the same per capita of the entire school fund. This would 
give us a State system, whereas we now have a county sys- 
tem. 2. We need a law to compel the people to build 
schoolhouses fit for the abode of their children. - 3. We 
need a uniform examination of our teachers, and then I 
am sure our schools would be much improved. 
I hope that this report will aid you in compiling your 
report to the Governor, and that we may be again remem- 
bered in the Institute season.

COFFEE COUNTY. 
; C. L. Phillips, Superintendent. 
' I herewith hand yon my annual report of the public 
schools of this county. They are in!’ a much more vigorous 
condition than usual. The teachers have been untiring in 
their efforts to render efficient service, and the results at- 
tained are fitting testimonials of eminent success. They 
are advancing, surely, along many lines, reading more and 
beiter educational journals, attending Summer Normals, 
  Institutes, etc. The attendance generally has increased, 
and popular sentiment improved. 
Our Summer Institute in Jane, at Manchester, was pro- 
ductive of good. The enrollment reached about one hun- 
dred; and the public interest was manifest by the increased 
number of visitors, perhaps two thousand, during the ses- 
sion. Valuable service was rendered by Profs. Terrill and 
Hopkins and Miss Maud Terrill, of Decherd; Profs. Den- 
ton and Evans, of Viola; Miss Lizzie Clarke, Winchester; 
and Prof. Webb, of Bellbuckle. Other prominent visitors 
participated in the exercises. 
Special mention should be made of the public school of 
Manchester, supervised by Prof. H. H. Vincent. Being 
at the county site and so ably managed, it is a potent factor 
in Coffee County education. 
The city schools of Tullahoma, superintended by Prof. 
8. J. Farris, are the equals of any schools of their class in

Please find inclosed my report for the scholastic year 
ending June 30, 1896; also our Trustee’s report. Within 
the last five years our teachers have improved at least one 
hundred per cent in a knowledge of the branches as well 
as in the theory and practice of teaching. The instruc- 
tion and management of some of our schools will compare 
favorably with the best schools in more favored counties. 
We had a two-weeks’ Institute last summer, conducted by 
home talent. Everybody was well pleased, and much 
good was accomplished.

T herewith submit my fourth annual report as County . 
Superintendent of Cumberland County. .In doing so, I 
am pleased to note the continued progress in the public 
schools of our county. By steady, persistent effort, a 
strong, healthy, educational sentiment pervades the entire 
county. . : 
The last week in June we held, in Crossville, a County 
Institute, which proved to be of great benefit to the teach- 
ers. During that Institute we were highly favored by 
four lectures by Rev. Dr. R. A. Young, of Nashvile; two 
excellent lectures by Rey. Dr. T. C. Carter, of Chattanoo- 
ga; and one forcible lecture by Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath, State 
Superintendent. This excellent lecture course, which in-. 
terspersed our regular work, broadened the mind of every 
one present, and was profoundly appreciated by all.

Our regular Tustitutes and educational mass meetings 
have been kept up since the schools began this year. One 
of these meetings occurs every Saturday in some part of the 
county during the school terms, and are productive of ! 
great interest among the patrons of the schools. Cum- 
berland County is proud of her public schools. 
DAVIDSON COUNTY. 
  
A. H. Wright, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith send you my fourth annual report of the 
publie schools of Davidson County. I think our schools 
are in a better condition than they were at this time last 
year, J think our teachers are improving in their work, 
and our schools are getting better each year. All our 
teachers are becoming more interested in their work. We 
have never had such interest in Institute work as we now 
have. Our monthly meetings are well attended. At our 
Sunuer Institute we enrolled 186, with an average at- 
tendance of 120. It continued two weeks, and was pro- 
nounced by the teachers to be the most enjoyable Institute 
they ever attended. 
The colored teachers have their monthly and annual In- 
ctitute, nor are they Jacking in interest. Nearly every one 
of them attends these meetings. (

County is taking a great interest in education. Our Coun- 
ty Court is liberal in its appropriation to the school fund, 
and has placed itself on record as a friend to education. — 
I have held eight Institutes during the year, with good 
attendance. Our Summer Normal was a success, over one 
hundred teachers being in attendance. \ 
‘We have been making a strong effort to grade our 
schools this year. I have made it a point to visit every 
school in this county, and I find that our teachers are tak- 
ing great interest in their work. Our directors do not 
manifest the interest they should in sending in their re- 
ports: hence it causes delay on tny part, 
DICKSON COUNTY. - 
Agnes Shipp, Superintendent. 
You will find inclosed the annual report of the public 
schools of Dickson County-for the year ending June 30, 
1896. While we have made advancement, our schools 
are not yet what they should be. We are having Institutes 
once a month, but Ido not think that is often enough. 
Teachers should meet every two weeks and discuss the 
methods of teaching. 
I have been meeting my teachers once a month at dif- 
ferent places in the county. The Institutes are very well 
attended. _ 
My report is not correct. I could not prevail on the 
Trustee to make his report to me, and the law makes no 
provision for me to obtain the required information from 
any other source. : 
The schools in our county are very short this year. Our 
school directors are watching after the school fund closer

than ever before. Our schools are constantly growing in 
favor with all classes of people, and becoming more popu- 
lar. The teachers are doing better work this year than 
usual. I have visited seventy-eight schools in the county | 
this year; last year I visited eighty-eight. i 
FAYETTE COUNTY.

Inclosed you will find my annual report. It should 
have been sent on Oct. 1, but I have been kept very busy 
for the past month preparing for the examination. I have 
not been engaged in teaching for several years; and, there- 
fore, it required hard study to qualify myself to stand. If 
Ihave failed, I at least will have the consciousness of know- 
ing that the schools have prospered, and that the County 
Court has appreciated my services, and supports the pub- 
lic schools by reasonable taxation 
The schools of this county, when I took charge of them, 
were almost useless, and of little importance; now every. 
district in this county points with pride to her public 
schools. 
I have had ne opposition before the County Court since 
my election in 1890; and I will have none in January, pro- 
vided I pass the examination. 
Excuse this letter if it seems to contain much of the “I 
myself ” in it. 
The public school of Somerville is doing nicely, and the 
people adapting themselves to the new order of things, and 
are now highly pleased with the change. The school has 
about 200 pupils and five teachers employed.

Ellen Wright, Superintendent. 
Inclosed please find my report of the publie schools o¢ 
Fentress County for the past year. This report is not as 
complete as I would like to have it; but, on account of the 
failure of the directors and teachers to make reports 
promptly, I am unable to furnish a more accurate state- 
ment. 
The interest in public schools has been greatly advanced 
during the last year, and I hope that a bright future awaits 
us. IT made my annual tour of the county, visiting all ‘the 
schools, during the months of September and October. IT 
found them better advanced than I had expected. The at- 
tendance was fairly good, and the teachers were giving first- 
cl atisfaction. Both teachers and the people are be- 
coming, as I believe, more interested in the schools than 
  in the past.

Inclosed please find my second annual report, which is, 
in my opinion, a correct one. The school directors were 
very slow in forwarding their respective reports, but steady 
P from each clerk. Of course some of the reports did not 
state facts satisfactorily; but, having carefully preserved 
the monthly reports of my teachers throughout the county, 
T was enabled to supply the deficiencies in the reports of 
directors. ; 
  stency on my part was at last rewarded by a report
-P-A-G-E-181
— 184 — 
\ 
Tam glad to state that the school work of the county is 
_very satisfactory, and shows, when compared with last 
year, an increased interest on the part of patrons, teachers, 
and officials. Every school in the county is graded; but, 
owing to the short terms of some schools, the gradation is 
not uniform. 
IT have held two directors’ conventions, one being for the 
purpose of selecting and adopting suitable text-books on’ 
ithe subject of “ Physiology and Hygiene,” the other for 
the purpose of diseussing the educational interests of the 
county, and to devise ways and means for the promotion 
of such interests. A resolution was passed by the directors 
at a meeting of the kind last mentioned, stating, in effect, 
that teachers who failed or refused to attend. either State 
or County Institutes would not be employed in the public 
schools of the county. 
June 6 of this year our schools celebrated at Trenton the 
one hundredth anniversary of the State’s admission into 
the Union. Yourself and Capt. Douglass honored the oe- 
- casion with your presence. 
Your kind liberality in providing a State conductor for — 
the Colored Teachers’ Institute was productive of excellent 
results. The Institute continued six days, with an average 
_daily attendance of seventy teachers; and their examina- 
tion exhibited a remarkable improvement in every respect. 
I refer with pardonable pride to our Institute for white 
teachers, which continued two weeks, under the supervi- 
sion of Capt. Thomas H. Paine and Capt. S. A. Mynders,. 
assisted by the following instructors well established in our 
county—viz., Profs. G. R. McGee, H. L. Higes, J. C. 
Wright, E. M. Fitzgerald, W. A. Muse, C. S. Henning, 
A. D. Hassell, B. F. Watson, G. A. Campbell, and Mrs. 
Fannie McGee. The interest and attendance never . 
flagged from first to last.” The enrollment reached 150, 
‘and among the educators who lectured for us we mention

monthly at different places in the county, and is always 
well attended by teachers and the publie. 
Our library continues its healthy increase, having now 
300 volumes, valued at $500. Evéry white teacher is a 
member, and we can gladly assert that the educational wel- 
fare of our county is slowly, but surely, increasing. 
GILES COUNTY.

In submitting my report of the Giles County schools for 
the year ending June 80, 1896, T beg to call your atten- 
tion to the “ earmarks”? of improvement over other years, 
in point of increased enrollment, better daily average at- 
  
tendance, longer term, higher average salary of teachers, 
and a reduction of the cost of tuition per month. 
Our Summer Normal, beginning June 29, and contin- 
uing two weeks, was very profitable under the efficient 
management of E. R. Eldridge, LL.D., of the Troy Normal 
College, with the assistance of W. B. Davidson, C. H.

GRAINGER COUNTY. 
  
W. T. Phillips, Superintendent. 
  
I beg leave to report as follows upon the schools of 
Grainger County, Tenn.: 
  We are in the midst of times that are depressingly hard, 
and the people of Grainger County have not escaped. We 
have had shorter terms this year than we have had for 
years, owing partly to the above cause, and another more 
perilous than the one above named. We have had with us 
that most consummate of all sharks, the “chart tramp.” 
He has invaded our beautiful hills and lovely valleys, and 
the school director has been his especial prey. He has car-. 
ried off from our school children enough funds to run the 
schools of our county, all of them, one month. I think it 
especially necessary I should report upon this; for of the di- 
rectors who were inveigled into buying cheap and worth- 
less goods at an enormous price, they cannot but say that I, 
as superintendent, fought against it all of the time; but I 
cannot altogether blame the director for his 
some who had been high in the councils of our school sys- stupidity, when — 
  tems lent a hand to help the tramp in his swindling. 
FT said last year in my report: “A brighter day is dawn- 
ing for old Grainger.” I confess I was miserably mis- 
taken. I had confidence at that time in our directors, but 
that confidence has been terribly shaken. The people may 
always be depended upon in an emergency. So in_ this. 
In the August election the chart-buying director was left 
without a job. The teachers have also lent a hand, and 
now I can truthfully say we will have no more chart-buy- 
ing in our county for the coming two years. 
In ovr Normal (July 13-19) we had a large attendance 
of teachers. The general public was more interested than 
I have seen for years. We only had three failures out of 
seventy-five enrolled. The grades of those were so near ~ 
that required that the committee on grading licensed them.
-P-A-G-E-184
  — 187 — 
The superintendent was assisted in this work by able edu- 
cators. Each branch was introduced by a specially pre- 
pared lecture. 
in our Institutes we have had large crowds. The teach- 
ers attend; so do the public. We have nice times, educa- 
tionally; and we generally consider we are mentally and 
morally improved. Any one who is conversant with the 
conditions confronting us in Grainger knows we have 
reached our lowest ebb, and that from now on, instead of 
large debts to pay attorneys and railroad’ companies, it can 
go to the school fund. , 
All of which is respectfully submitted. 
GRUNDY COUNTY. 
L. V.. Woodlee, Superintendent. 
Herewith inclosed please find my sixth annual report of 
the schools of Grundy County, Tenn. I note a marked 
change for the better in the schools of said county this year, 
which I am truly delighted to see. The school directors, 
patrons, teachers, and pupils of the various schools of the 
county are more enthused and more deeply interested in the 
work this year than heretofore; and I do trust that the time 
is not far distant when Grundy County will stand along- 
side of her sister counties in an educational line. ,

this lengthened to eight months.

HAWKINS COUNTY. 
L. L. Livesay, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith transmit you my annual report for the scho- 
lastic year ending June 30, 1896; and, as stated in my last 
report, I must confess that a great deal of it is a simple ap- 
proximation of the true status of the information desired in_ 
such reports. | have used all the means at my command — 
to secure the’ information necessary to secure correct an- 
_ swers to all the questions in the tabulated report; but it is 
almost impossible to do so, as many of the school directors 
fail to have their teachers make such reports to them as 
would enable them to make carefully and correctly com- 
piled reports to- the County Superintendent. In some 
cases the directors do not understand how to compile their 
reports, if they had correctly made reports from their 
teachers. 1 really think, after all, that my report is ap- 
proximately correct. : 
As intimated in my last report, T sueceeded in organiz- 
ing a CountyTeachers’ Association, which I hope will be 
permanent as well as valuable to our teachers. Our teach- 
ers are looking forward to our next annual association with 
much anxiety, expecting it to be one of the largest and best 
attended educational meetings ever held in the county. 
We also have our district associations, out of which our 
teachers are getting a great deal of information. It is to 
be hoped that we will soon have a county teachers’ library. 
The importance of a library is being discussed in almost all 
local educational meetings; and I really believe that it will 
be decided at our next annual association, which convenes 
at Glendale, Nov. 13 and 14, 1896. - 
During the month of July we held four weeks of Normal 
work in the county at four different places in the county, 
one week at each place. Nearly all the teachers of the 
county registered at one or the other of these places, some 
of them attending two or more, We had some very ex-
-P-A-G-E-187
— 190 — 
cellent work done during these Normals. The best educa- 
tional talent of the county was secured at the various 
places. : 
Our teachers all entered their work this year with more 
zeal than heretofore; hence we have more efficient work 
than ever before in the history of the schools, and the least 
friction that I have ever known. 
HAYWOOD COUNTY. 
B. L. Capell, Superintendent. 
I send herewith my annual report for the year ending 
June 30, 1896. Our schools are doing fairly well; and 
there is a slow, but steady, improvement, especially in the 
matter of public favor. There is more interest taken and 
a better feeling toward our public 
  chools than heretofore, 
and it has warm advocates now where a few years ago there 
Was open opposition. 
In June I held an Institute for white teachers, which 
was not as well attended as it should have been, but was 
much appreciated by those who did attend. The meeting 
lasted five days, was conducted by our local talent, and 
strengthened confidence in our ability to conduct, if neces- 
sary, an Institute with our own force. 
T also held an Institute for our colored teachers, com- 
mencing the first Monday in July, and lasting five days. 
There were more teachers present at this meeting than at 
any time before, and it was a success. These colored 
teachers are improving, and will soon be equipped for the 
work before them. 
On the whole, we are on the up grade, and the improve- 
ment in the future from year to year will be more marked.

HENDERSON COUNTY. 
A. H. Fowler, Superintendent. 
Tn submitting my second annual report, I think T can 
safely say the schools of Henderson County are in a state of 
advancement. ‘Teachers are manifesting greater interest 
in Institute work than they have for several years for- 
merly. Directors and patrons are looking forward to the 
education of the vouth, which is destined to make Hender- 
/son County stand in the front ranks of educational prog- 
ress of the old Volunteer State. 
By strict examination, the gerade of teachers has been 
raised in the last two years, thereby placing better in- 
structors in the schoolroom. 
We have two high schools in Lexington, which are do- 
ing grand good in training teachers. 
One great help the schools need is more money, which 
will no doubt be supplied by the County Court in the near 
future. | 
HOUSTON COUNTY. 
W. R. Boone, Superintendent. 
Herewith please find my second annual report of the 
schools of Houston County. I'am proud to say that the 
schools of this county ave improving 
  ; and if you will com- 
pare my report of last year with this report, you will see a 
marked difference. It was my object when elected Coun- 
ty Superintendent to make the schools of Houston County 
rank among the first in the State, and I hope the time is. 
not far distant when my object. will be realized. Our 
school directors do not manifest the interest they should in
-P-A-G-E-189
—192 — 
sending in their reports; hence the delay in sending in my 
report. 
T held a three-days’ Institute at Erin, our county site, 
this year; and all of our teachers were in attendance ex- 
cept two. 
We have an educational association, which meets on the 
fourth Saturday in each month; and I note that the older it 
grows the more interest the teachers manifest in it. Our 
last meeting was a joint meeting of the teachers of Hum- 
phreys and Houston Counties; and IT was surprised at the 
large crowd of teachers and visitors, as well as the interest 
the teachers manifested. 
The greatest trouble we have to contend with is irreg- 
ularity of attendance. I hope the day is not far. distant 
when we will have a law in Tennessee compelling patrons 
to send their children to school. TI have always entertained 
_the idea that it was the teacher’s fault for the pupils not at- 
tending any better; but, after visiting all the schools and 
seeing the work that each teacher is doing, I am convinced 
that the patrons are not taking the interest they should. 
HUMPHREYS COUNTY. 
A. B. Simpson, Superintendent. 
I herewith submit my second annual report of the 
schools of Humphreys County. I believe it is correct in 
every particular. I had full reports from teachers and 
directors. Briefly stated, we have a population of 4,867; 
enrollment, 3,310 (nearly seventy per cent); average at- 
tendance, 1,692 (fifty per cent of the enrollment); 53 dis- 
tricts, 73 schools, 77 teachers at $30.98 per month, and « 
$150 superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-190
— 193 — 
Your attention is especially called to the fact that, with 
162 applicants and 73 schools, I licensed but 77 teachers; 
and in this connection I should be pleased to call upon 
Hon. A. L. Peterman to say, “Amen.” ‘This was done in 
the face of very great opposition, outspoken \disapproval, 
and a full measure of profanity; and, should the election of 
a superintendent have been held last January, I could 
not have polled more than three votes in a court of thirty- 
one; but I have stood by my guns and slept on foot this en- 
tire year; and, although it is but five days till examination 
day, it is generally understood that I will have no oppo- 
nent; and one member of the court who was opposed to me 
last year says he is in favor of my election two terms more. 
I do not and will not duplicate or renew certificates; and 
Task my brother superintendents to join me in an effort to 
have better teachers, though we may have fewer schools. 
JACKSON COUNTY. 
L. D. Johnson, Superintendent. 
Inclosed find my fourth annual report of the schools in 
Jackson County for the year beginning July 1, 1895, and 
ending June 30, 1896, which is only approximately true. 
The financial part is correct, but the schbdlastic population 
is incorrect, I think; for, you see, it has fallen off one hun- 
dred, which is not reasonable to suppose. The private 
school report is not correct; but the directors will hardly 
make an accurate report of the public schools, much less 
the private schools, ‘ 
The grading of schools is just about perfected under the 
present system, which I do not exactly approve of. 
We had an interesting Institute of six days, beginning 
July 6, with J. T. Tracy in the chair and Wesley Fox, clerk. 
Fifty-five teachers were in attendance, and a large crowd
-P-A-G-E-191
— 194 — 
of visitors. Good speeches were made from time to time 
by the leading teachers of the county, and there was a full 
discussion of all subjects and questions relative to the best 
methods of teaching. ‘ 
We havé a regular monthly Institute held at different 
points in the county, and teachers are alive to the impor- 
tant work in which they are engaged. 
I am sorry to say we have no library in our county. 
Teachers say that the salary paid them is not sufficient to 
justify them in contributing thereto; but as the subject is 
being talked up by the citizens all over the county, we hope 
that the court will be more liberal in laying a school tax. 
I invariably believe that this is all that is lacking in old 
Jackson now. I wish that we could get a Legislature that 
would provide that the County Court shall impose a tax 
sufficient: to run each school in the county five months in- 
. stead of taking a vote on it. You know this is business. 
Well, in a just proportion of all elements that confront 
us, it is reasonable to say that the common cause of edu- 
cation is favorable up here in the mountains of Tennessee.

in school journals and educational papers. On account of 
disability, I did not get to visit all the schools last year; but 
what schools I did visit I found them in good working or- 
der. i - ; 
We held an Institute the first ten days in July, which 
was well attended, and good interest was manifested. Prof. 
W. W. Matney, of Sevier County, was our conductor. His 
work was well commended by all those who attended.

. Mrs. L. A. Watkins, Superintendent. :   
  
Please find inclosed my annual report, which is as accu- 
rate as can be made under the existing provisions for col- 
lecting statistics. I have reports from only two or three 
district directors, consequently am unable to give accurate- 
ly the amounts expended for different purposes. Our 
schools have steadily improved, especially those with pro- 
gressive teachers in charge. 
We had the privilege of a most pleasant and instructive 
Institute of five days’ duration, conducted by Prof. T. ©. 
Cherry, of Bowling Green, Ky., during the month of June. 
I am pleased to say that our teachers are fully alive to the 
importance and benefit of Institutes, as such have borne all 
expenses of the same for the last and the present year. 
LAWRENCE COUNTY. 
  
J. P. Rippy, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith submit my second annual report, in which 
Lam glad to state the schools of Lawrence County are en- 
joying an “ era of good feeling ” in the school work. Since 
my last annual report the course of study for this county 
has been revised, and about four hundred copies printed _ 
and distributed among the teachers and school officers. 
We have organized a teachers’ meeting, which meets each 
month. 
The County Teachers’ Institute held at Lawrenceburg 
, was a grand success, Hon. 8. G. Gilbreath favoring us with 
two conductors: Prof. R. L. MeDonald, of the Nashville 
High School, and Miss Mary E. Duvall, formerly of Nash-

ville. The Institute continued two wecks. The attend- 
ance was very gratifying throughout the entire time. At 
the close of the Institute resolutions were offered and unan- 
imously adopted indorsing the management of a State In- 
stitute at Lawrenceburg in 1897. There is no doubt: that 
the State would be gratified with the results from a State 
Institute held at Lawrenceburg; and, with this end in view, 
we respectfully ask the favorable consideration of the State 
officials. : : 
LOUDON COUNTY. 
John T. Henderson, Superintendent. 
Our schools are making some progress. They are be- 
coming very uniform in their government and in the meth- 
ods used in instructing. There is an increase in attend- 
ance in the lower grades, but the attendance in the higher 
grades does not increase as much as it should. Especially 
is this true of the seventh and eighth grades. 
We had some very good Institutes last year. Our sec- 
ondary schools are better this year than ever before, and T 
think that is a great step toward improving all the schools. 
The annual County Institute this year was conducted by 
Prof. J..W. Hyden. He did some excellent work, which 
was calculated to be highly beneficial to the teachers. 
Among other prominent educators who visited our Insti- 
tute were Profs. Minter and Smith, of Nashville; Prof. 
Neblett, of Harriman; Prof. W. A. Cate, of Fountain 
City; and Exsuperintendent Frank M. Smith. The public 
were entertained by lectures from Pres. Bachman, of 
Sweetwater; Prof, Neblett, and Supt. S. G. Gilbreath. 
May we hope for a greater rate of progress soon.

M. P. Howser, Superintendent. 
  
We are glad to report an increased interest in the schools 
of Macon County. Our Teachers’ Association has done 
much to revive an interest in professional work. The peo- 
ple are becoming more aroused; and, although our school 
fund is small, we think that within a few years our schools 
will rank among the best in the State. 
MARSHALL COUNTY. 
  
J. G. Stinson, Superintendent. 
  
I have the pleasure to submit herewith my second annual 
report of the schools of Marshall County. I am glad to 
state that our schools are in a more prosperous condition 
than ever before. Most of the schools are being graded, 
and our teachers are using their best efforts to improve their 
schools by raising their grades of qualification. 
The State Peabody Institute, held in Lewisburg during 
the month of June, did much to elevate the standard of ed- 
ucation in the county, and the inspiration given to the 
teachers by that Institute will long be felt in the schools of 
Marshall County. It is the unanimous desire of the peo- 
ple of this county that the Institute be permanently located 
~ at Lewisburg. I am sure that the people will support it 
liberally with their means. 
WMINN COUNTY.   
M. R. M. Burke, Superintendent. 
  
Inclosed find my second annual report of the schools of 
my county. There has been a marked improvement along —
-P-A-G-E-196

the line of teaching during the term of my office. We are 
gaining ground, but much needs to be done before we will 
be what we ought to be along all lines. 
WNAIRY COUNTY. 
C. Hamm, Jr., Superintendent. 
The educational interest in McNairy County has been 
improving for some time. The teachers are earnestly try- 
ing to do their whole duty. 
We held an Institute one week for the white and one 
for the colored teachers in June... Good Institute work was 
done by Thomas, Abernathys, Ijams, Hodges, Croy, 
Bourne, McConnell, and. Hamm. The attendance was 
very good at both, and the interest manifested was never 
better. The attendance of teachers was the best we. have 
ever had in the county. We had about 130 teachers in at- 
tendance. ; : 
We have good schools established at Selmer, Bethel 
Springs, Adamsville, Chewalla, McNairy, Gravel Hill, and 
Ramer. ‘They have all opened with good attendance this 
fall. Most of our schools are taught in the summer. The 
interest was not very good last summer on account of the 
extreme hot weather. The tendeney is moving in favor of 
winter schools. We hope to be able to sustain a better 
grade of schools through the winter than we have done for 
years. It will give us a much better chance to improve 
our teachers and elevate the cause of education. If we 
could diminish the number of our schools and increase our 
school fund,.and thus lengthen the term of our schools, we 
would soon be enabled to do much more efficient school 
work.

MONROE COUNTY. 
Samuel J. Parks, Superintendent. 
T herewith submit my second annual report of the pub- 
lic schools of Monroe County, which I have carefully com- 
piled from teachers’ abstracts and directors’ reports. 
During the year I held two Normals and two Teachers’ 
Institutes. Over one hundred teachers attended the Nor- 
mals, and the districts in which the Institutes were held 
were well represented by the teachers of those districts. 
Profs. J. L. Bachman, John W. Hyden, J. T. Henderson, 
W. Morris Harrison, and J. H. Kelso deserve special men- 
tion for efficient services rendered in the Normals. Prot. 
Bachman is one of the finest Institute workers that I have 
ever had the pleasure of meeting in the State. 
I made a tour of the county last fall and visited almost 
every school in it. I find that the directors are taking 
more interest than usual in our schools. They are grad- 
ually placing frame houses in the place of the old-time log 
house. {Homemade desks, and in a good many places pat- 
ent desks, are taking the place of the “ puncheon and back- 
less benches.” In fact, our schools are beginning to put on 
the appearance of civilization. If we had a compulsory 
school law and a few other necessary changes in the law, 
the day would not be far distant when five thousand chil- 
dren would be in daily attendance in the public schools of 
this county. 
I haye induced a good many of our teachers to read and 
study books on pedagogy and teaching. Already I see 
that good results are coming from their application to such 
necessary branches of information. In my talks and lec- 
tures to schools and educational meetings, I try to persuade 
teachers, parents, and children to come in proximity to one 
another and to be colaborers in the great work of educa- 
tion. > 
There is a tendency toward the consolidation of some of 
our schools which, if carried out, will greatly benefit the 
school interest in certain districts.

R. B. Honeycutt, Superintendent. ' 
  
T herewith submit my annual report for the year ending 
June 30, 1896. While the conditions of our schools and 
the general adyancement of education are not all that may. 
be desired, yet I am proud to say there is a marked improve- 
ment from year to year. 
Our County Institute this year was well selenide: and 
teachers seem more than ever to realize that if they would 
follow the profession they must qualify. This higher 
standard of qualification required has shown beneficial re- 
sults in all the schools of the county. 
MONTGOMERY COUNTY. 
P. L. Hamed, Superintendent.   
  
T herewith submit my sixth annual report of the public 
schools of Montgomery County, and will say that the pros- 
pects for good schools were never more encouraging. Of 
course there is room for improvement yet, but everything 
cannot be done in one year. + 
During the past six years the County Superintendent has 
been given an office in the courthouse, and that room is fur- 
nished better than any other room in the building. There 
has been established a County Teachers’ Library, and the 
County Court gives us one hundred dollars a year to keep 
it up. Annual Institutes for both white and colored teach- 
ers have been established, and are running ‘successfully. 
The Montgomery County Teachers’ Reading Circle has 
been organized, and is doing well. In this the teachers 
are working for better scholarship, and a great deal of im- 
provement has resulted from these monthly meetings. Be-
-P-A-G-E-199

sides, we have an increased tax levy that will give us a long- 
er term than we have ever had. Nearly every school is 
now taught in a house belonging to the public school, and 
these houses are furnished with desks and such things as 
are necessary to the comfort of the pupils. Our directors 
are not buying any trash in the way of so-called school sup- 
plies, but are using the money of the public in a better way 
We have one burden on our hands, however; but we hope 
that the next Legislature will relieve us of that: the special 
school district. 
‘We have one district in the county that has sufficient 
funds to run the schools ten months, and buy books for pu- 
pils besides. Messrs. Brad. Martin, W. A. O’Neal, and 
William Caudle, directors, inaugurated that system, and, 
by careful management, the books are kept well; and the 
system has enabled the principal to better grade the school. 
The plan is working entirely satisfactorily. 
We are proud of our secondary schools. There are only 
a few, but they are doing good work. The Southside Pre- 
paratory School, a training school for the University of 
Tennessee, established at Southside in August, 1890, had 
an enrollment last year of 156. Not only is it holding some 
of the young people in the county for their academic train- 
ing, but it is attracting attention from other counties and 
States. 
The city schools of Clarksville are doing good work. 
OBION COUNTY. 
J. H. Tackson, Superintendent. 
T herein have the honor to submit my fifth annual report, 
in which I am pleased to state that our schools are steadily 
- improving, and we are having a better and a more interest- 
ed class of teachers. Nearly every teacher in our county 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
— 203 — 
and a large number from adjoining counties attended the 
State Institute at Union City for the entire term of four 
weeks. The enrollment at the Institute here was next to 
the largest in the State. The teachers were pleased with 
the excellent management of the Institute by Capt. OC. S. 
Douglass, of Gallatin, Tenn., and the systematic and effi- 
cient instruction given by him and his able assistants: 
Profs. D. A. Williams, of Union City Training School; W. 
L. Willingham, of West Tennessee Normal College; F. ue 
Henderson, of Humboldt City Schools; and Miss Mattie 
Butler, of Trenton, Tenn. Many of our teachers are sys- 
tematically studying the course of study prescribed for the 
State and Peabody Institutes. Our County Court appro- 
priated $125 for the white Institute and $25 for the col- 
ored Institute. The colored Institute continued seven 
days, including examination of teachers for certificates.” 
It was again under the excellent management of Prof. 
Thomas MeMakin, of the Union City Graded Schools. It 
was decidedly the best colored Institute ever held in the 
county. 
We have two good circulating libraries for our teachers. 
The white teachers’ library has over 200 well-selected vol- 
umes, and many of the teachers are reading regularly. 
The colored teachers’ library contains over 50 volumes. 
Most of our teachers are making substantial progress. 
By reference to my statistical report, you will find that a 
  per cent of our teachers have remained more than one 
year in the same schools, which is another evidence that 
they are doing good work. 
Our two monthly associations, which meet in different 
parts of the county, have greatly encouraged the teachers, 
and secured the codperation, of many patrons who could 
not have been reached in any. other way. Some of our 
schools have organized good libraries, and have succeeded 
in getting both pupils and patrons interested in “ good lit- 
erature.” T sincerely hope that my successor will be able 
to organize a good library in every school, from which 
\
-P-A-G-E-201
— 204 — 
good literature can be furnished to every home. This can 
be more easily done now, since the teachers have organized 
and are sustaining two good libraries for themselves. 
The number of school districts in this county should be 
reduced, and thereby secure longer terms and more effi- 
cient work at the same cost. 
PERRY COUNTY. 
L. G. Bunch, Superintendent. 
I herewith send you my second annual report of the pub- 
lic schools of Perry County. I am glad to note that our 
schools are doing a great deal better than they did last year. 
The people have at last awakened to their duty, and are 
now taking an interest in the welfare of their children. Al- 
though our enrollment is not quite as good as last year, our 
average daily attendance has increased nearly one-third 
more. We attribute this to the interest our teachers are 
manifesting with the patrons of the schools. Our school 
term has also increased from 54 days to 64 days. The sal- 
aries of the teachers are also increasing as the standard of 
qualification is raised. The County Court has at last 
awakened from its ignorant slumber, and is now making 
some liberal appropriations for our schools, which are duly 
appreciated by the patrons and teachers. 
I visited nearly all of the schools of this county this year, 
and found not only the teachers being more interested in 
their work, but a majority of the patrons becoming more 
enthused. 
We held a monthly Institute during the year, with very 
fair attendance. The teachers enjoyed the work. We 
also held three Institutes at different places in the county 
during the month of June, conducted by Profs. J. W. 
Overton and J. R. Godwin, a written examination being 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
— 205 — 
held at the close of each. These Institutes were pro- 
nounced a grand success by all of the teachers, and also by 
all of the patrons in the communities where they were held. 
I might add that the schools of this county are now more 
prosperous than at any other time in the history of the coun- 
ty. 1 think in a few years Perry County can boast of as 
good schools as any other county of equal population in the 
State. 
POLK COUNTY. 
A. E. Love, Superintendent. 
Inclosed find my second annual report. It is, I think, 
correct. I have visited thirty-seven schools, and find them 
progressing nicely. We are, I believe, improving in 
school work in this county. Our Normal Institute was 
held at Benton, and was a decided success. There was a 
large attendance, and great interest was manifested. 
  PUTNAM COUNTY. 
A. N. Ford, Superintendent. 
You will find inclosed ny fourth annual report. I take 
pleasure in stating that our schools are in reasonably good 
condition, and gradually improving. Our teachers are do- 
ing good work. : 
My report is possibly not as complete as it should be, but - 
it is as good as I could get it under the circumstances. The 
Trustee made no report to me, so I got the County Judge 
to assist me. :

RHEA COUNTY. 
C. T. Stout, Superintendent. 
  
I have the pleasure of submitting to you my second an- 
nual report of Rhea County. I think the report very near 
correct. It is almost impossible to get everything needed 
in making out these reports. I have received the scholastic 
report from every district in the county. I find the popu- 
lation increased by 331 over last year. My report of the 
schools for the past year is not as good as I wanted to see it. 
The enroliment is too small for the scholastic population in 
the county. The daily attendance falls short of what it 
should be. The pea crop in this county hurt our schools 
last year. Our schools are better attended this year, and 
our teachers are working to make the schools of the county 
a success; and I think the most of them will be successful. 
T have visited about half the schools in the county, and 
find the teachers doing good work generally. I will start 
to-day to complete the round of visits to schools. 
T held an Institute of ten days at Evensville. I think 
much good work/was done. Our teachers are coming to 
“the front in Institute work, as the following programme 
of our Institute will show:

the same. e 
We trust that we shall have the codperation of all. 
ROANE COUNTY. 
  
Ben. F. Brown, Superintendent. 
  
Find inclosed my annual report. Our schools opened 
this year with a better attendance than last year. The
-P-A-G-E-205
  — 208 — 
teachers are more in earnest, the parents are sending more 
regularly than last year. We are making an effort to 
gradé the schools of the county according to law. When 
the schools opened last year, there were four graded schools 
in the county; this year the teachers are working very ear- 
nestly to grade their schools. Some have succeeded very 
well—in fact, have their schools graded; others are doing a 
good work along these lines. As soon as we can have a 
uniform series of text-books our schools will all be properly 
graded. 
ROBERTSON COUNTY. 
  
A. D. Brashear, Superintendent. 
  
T have the honor to submit my second annual report. for 
Robertson County for the scholastic year ending June 30, 
1896. You will note a decided improvement over last 
year. The enrollment is better, the attendance is better, the 
teachers’ salaries are better, and last, but not least, we had 
nearly a six-months’ session this year, compared with four 
and one-half months last year. We have now about as 
much money for this year as we’had the first of last year. 
We have now good houses well supplied with desks, maps, 
globes, charts, etc. I have called the directors together 
twice and explained the law to them on the more impor- 
tant points, especially emphasizing the importance of ju- 
diciously disbursing the school funds at their command. T 
have a very high opinion of the directors of the county. 
They readily respond when called upon. 
I feel certain that, few county superintendents have all 
their reports in and are ready by Sept. 1 to make their an- 
nual report. 
We held two Summer Institutes, white and colored. 
The white Institute convened May 25, and continued two 
sae 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
— 209 — : Le 
weeks, with eighty-six teachers in attendance. We had 
good interest and regular attendance. Profs. J.W. Huey, 
M. E. Moore, W..M. MeNeely, J. W. S. Green, and J. E. 
Ruffin instructed the classes from day to day. We closed 
with two-days’ examination, which resulted in the grant- 
ing of forty-one certificates and the rejecting of twenty- 
four. 
I wish to conclude by saying that in no county in the 
State is the standard of qualification of teachers more close- 
ly guarded than in Robertson. We are determined on 
having our schools taught by competent teachers. We 
had one applicant that failed here and went to Davidson 
and passed the examination, made a grade,of 85, came back, 
and asked me to duplicate. . I refused, unless he came be- 
fore the board again. He consented, took the examination 
again, and failed, making only 65 per cent. We need uni- 
formity in examinations. 
Our colored Normal opened June 22, and continued two 
weeks, with thirty-one in regular attendance. Prof. Ut- 
ley instructed the class, assisted by Miss Susie Bransford. 
The Institute closed with two-days’ examinations. Twenty- 
seven were examined; fourteen passed. I have refused to 
give private examinations, and only have two days in each 
month. That has a tendency to bring about some dis- 
satisfaction, yet I think I am right. 
We are waging to the front, superintendent, teachers, 
directors, and people working with one mind and one pur- 
pose for the greatest good to those whom they serve. We 
have realized in the past that there must be only the frie- 
tion that comes from motion forward; that each and every 
one must recognize relation to the State Superintendent, 
County Superintendent, State Board, and the people. We 
have a bright future before us; and when we get our people 
educated to the point that they can see the great good that 
would result from eight months of free school, we will get 
that. 
Our directors have called a meeting to organize a month-
-P-A-G-E-207
Cat ee Ouse 
ly association, and they propose to invite the members of 
the County Court to meet with them. Altogether, we 
are encouraged.

T herewith inclose you my report of the public schools of 
Rutherford County for the school year ending June 30, 
1896. While oyr schools are yet far short of what they 
ought to be, Lam proud to say they are wonderfully bet- 
ter than I found them six years ago. During these six 
years in office I haye held largely attended Institutes each 
summer for both white and colored, held rigid written ex- 
aninations at the close of each Institute, and have conse- 
quently strengthened our interest in school work, and 
greatly diminished our number of would-be teachers. 
We are very proud of the number and excellence of our 
secondary schools.

SEVIER COUNTY. 
_J. J. Massey, Superintendent. 
T submit herewith my first annual report. I have 
worked very faithfully in getting up and combining the 
statistics, so as to make my report as nearly correct as pos- 
sible, notwithstanding I had to make some estimates in the 
official report of the work done by the former superintend- 
ent (deceased), whose unexpired term I am filling out. I 
failed to find any official record of his work, consequently 
I could not do otherwise than to estimate his work.
-P-A-G-E-208
, UI 
The educational interests and the efforts put forth by the 
citizens of my county have received a mighty blow from 
the “ chart agents.” A grand swindle was placed upon our 
directors, taking from the children of Sevier County about 
$1,500. ‘Notwithstanding all these disadvantages, I real- 
ize that a brighter day is dawning, and that Sevier County 
will soon move on to progress. 
On looking over the reports of other superintendents; I 
find that there is a similarity existing in almost all the coun- 
ties in the State regarding some of the deficiencies in our 
public schools. There is a great deficiency, or neglect of 
duty, somewhere; for I find that less than one-half of the 
scholastic population of the State constitutes the average 
attendance. Somebody is responsible for this great wrong 
committed against the children of the State. Cannot 
something be said or done to get parents and teachers to 
feel their great responsibilities? Some parents seem to 
content themselves with the idea that the teacher will bear 
all responsibilities. Every parent is responsible to God in 
a measure for the ends and results of the lives of their chil- 
dren; and just so long as a parent occupies the position of a 
parent, just so long will he occupy a place of great and un- 
measured responsibility. 
Our last annual Institute, conducted by Prof. Wickliffe 
Rose, of the University of Nashville, was quite successful. 
The work to be done in the schoolroom characterized the 
work throughout. The teachers took home new inspira- 
tions and new zeal for action. Our motto is to lift our- 
selves up and to lift our schools up with longer terms, bet: 
ter teachers, and larger attendance.

bog J. E. L. Seneker, Superintendent. 
  
T submit herewith my fourth annual statistical report of 
the schools of Sullivan County. In addition to the infor- 
mation given therein, I wish to add that the schools of Sul- 
livan County still go on in “ the even tenor of their way,” 
constantly improving and gradually extending their influ- 
ence and usefulness. We know that, upon the whole, we 
are steadily advancing in means and methods. We see, 
however, plenty of room for improvement yet; but we 
know that patient labor, perseverance, and enthusiasm will 
reach the desired end: the education of all 
The many local Institutes held in different parts of the 
~ county have done much good in awakening enthusiasm in 
the patrons. Our County Teachers’ Association is now a 
very potent factor in our educational work. Our annual 
Institute was held at Fair View Academy, July 13-24; and 
at Paperville, August 3-8. As principal instructor, Super- 
intendent L. 8. Loudon most satisfactorily proved himself 
“the right man in the right place.” I was further ably as-

better than usual, good feeling prevailed throughout the

hauled and refitted, coming out good as new. Neat, com- 
fortable houses are fast taking the place of those long since 
past the “repair age.” A few districts are yet behind 
along this line; but I trust the spirit of education may take 
hold of them in the near future, that they may see the error 
of their ways and turn their attention to the wants of the 
present age. 
TIPTON COUNTY. 
  
James A. Cotten, Superintendent. 
  
TI have the honor to hand herewith my sixth annual re- 
port. While no great county can afford to be satisfied with 
less than perfection in its schools, we have reason to be 
grateful for the steady improvement of the teachers and 
our schools. 
Our annual Summer Normal furnished by our progres- 
sive County Court’ was a success. We were in session 
twelve days. Our conductors—J. C. Brooks, of Franklin, 
and Robert Lord Cave, Nashville—did excellent work. 
Our teachers returned to their schools with much inspira- 
tion, and better prepared to do good work. Many thanks 
for your assistance and courtesies extended.

R. W. H. Gilbert, Superintendent. 
  
I herewith inelose you my report for the year ending 
June 30, 1896. By reference to the report, you will ob- 
serve that we have enrolled nearly ninety-five per cent. of 
the entire scholastic population of the county. The per 
cent of attendance is also very gratifying, yet not perfectly 
satisfactory. “

Tam glad to inform you that the educational interest in 
Unicoi County is surpassed by that of no county in the 
State. 
I held nity County Normal the last week in July. Ey- 
ery teacher in the county, except two, was in attendance. 
I require the teachers of my county to attend teachers’ 
"meetings, and also to take and read educational journals. 
I find nothing more helpful to the teachers or conducive to 
good teaching than good literature. No county in the 
State can truthfully boast of teachers more deeply interest- 
ed in the educational and moral welfare of those confided 
to their care than the teachers of Unicoi County. 
_ The academy at Flag Pond enrolled more pupils last 
year than any previous year in its history. 
I invoke God’s blessings upon the educational and moral” 
welfare of our entire State.

Franie B. Sharp, Superintendent. 
  
Find inclosed my second annual report. Our schools 
are doing much better work this year than last year. We 
have a much better grade of teachers than we had last year. 
The teachers are all attending our Institutes, and seem to 
have their whole soul in the work. While our schools are 
not what they should be, we are pleased with their work, 
and try to take a more hopeful gaze into the sweet by and 
by, when they will be what they should be.

After repeated efforts to get reports from teachers and 
directors, I have the pleasure to send my second report 
from Washington County. Teachers very often hasten 
off somewhere to go into business, and forget the abstract 
they should send to the Superintendent; and hence it is 
almost impossible to get mp a respectable report. 
Prof. W. M. Rogers, Greeneville, Tenn., conducted the 
Normal this year; and it is said that “it was the best Nor- 
mal that has been held in this county for years.” Repre- 
sentatives from various leading institutions in East Ten-

85 of the 114 districts took the scholastic census, but. this 
year we have them all. We received only 44 directors’ 
annual reports last year, while we have almost all this year. 
Tf our directors understood the law, we would make rapid

University of Tennessee. 
Sir: The Board of Trustees of the University of Tennes- 
see respectfully submit this their biennial report for the 
two years ending Dec. 20, 1896. 
During the two years since the last biennial report the 
board has lost by death two of its members: Judge Milton 
Preston Jarnagin, who departed this life on May 12, 1895, 
and Colonel Robert H. Armstrong, who died on May 13, 
1896. Judge Jarnagin’s useful career was referred to in 
the last annual report. Colonel Armstrong was a graduate 
of the University of Tennessee. After leaving college, he’ 
studied law, and settled in the vicinity of Knoxville, where 
he resided during his whole life. He was a member of the 
General Assembly of the State of Tennessee in 1851. He 
was an honored and faithful trustee of this University for 
many years, and was a trustee and treasurer of the East 
Tennessee Asylum for the Insane since its foundation. 
Colonel Armstrong was always a public-spirited, patriotic 
citizen, ready at all times to serve his State and country. 
On account of his removal from the State, Mr. Jo. W. 
Allison, who has been for a number of years a devoted, en- 
ergetie, and faithful member of this body, has tendered his 
resignation. The board regrets exceedingly the necessity 
to accept it. 
To fill the vacancies thus created, the Board of Trustees, 
in accordance with the provisions of its charter, has elected, 
subject to confirmation by the General Assembly, the fol- 
lowing gentlemen: Joshua W. Caldwell, Fsq., of Knox 
County; Hal. H. Haynes, Esq., of Sullivan County; and ~ 
James Maynard, Esq., of Knox County. ‘Their names are 
respectfully submitted to the Les Assembly for con- 
firmation. 
The board has etlcored all funds regularly due it, and
-P-A-G-E-215
— 218 — 
has disbursed them in accordance with law. The biennial 
report of the treasurer, which is transmitted herewith, will 
show all the receipts and disbursements. 
This board has frequently called the attention of the 
General Assembly to the dilapidated condition of its older 
buildings. Some of these are beyond repair, but it has 
done everything it could to keep the better ones in a hab- 
itable condition. Finding that there was a demand for a 
better class of dormitory room, for which the students were 
willing to pay an increased rent, provided they were sup- 
plied with the best modern conveniences, the board this 
year rebuilt completely the dormitory hitherto known as 
North College. The front was entirely changed, and a - 
new story and roof were superimposed upon the old walls: 
The structure was then completely rebuilt throughout, and 
equipped with steam-heating apparatus, hot and cold water, 
and the best arrangements for drainage. The building 
was ready for occupancy by students at the opening of the 
session, and has proved a great comfort to them. The to- 
tal expense of this improvement was a little less than $7,- 
000. The building has, by resolution ‘of the board, been . 
named Humes Hall, in memory of Rey. Dr. Thomas W. 
Humes, President of the institution from 1865 to 1883. 
The attendance upon the Academic Department of the 
University has been as follows during the last ten years:

considerably advanced during these years, the increase in 
numbers shown above is very satisfactory. 
The attention of the General Assembly of 1893 and that 
of 1895 was called to the system’ of appointing students 
to free scholarships in this institution by Representatives 
and Senators, which had, owing to the great complication 
of the method, become a dead letter. This system requires 
the efficient codperation of at least four State officials in 
order to appoint one person to free tuition in this institu- 
tion. Finding that it was practically impossible to operate 
such a system, and desiring to extend the advantages of the 
institution to all students of suitable age and character, 
having the necessary preparations, the Board of Trustees 
have opened the doors of the University to all such stu- 
dents from all States. Since this law (contained in See- 
tions 327 to 329 of The Code) is entirely useless and inop- 
erative, ‘it is recommended that it be removed from the 
statute books. , 
THE STATE UNIVERSITY IN THE CONSTITU- 
TION AND THE LAWS, 
The history of the University of Tennessee is unique in 
many respects. Born with the Territory that preceded the 
State, it has survived a hundred years of very varied for- 
tunes, outliving all the other State colleges, and is to-day 
the only distinct State institution for higher education in 
Tennessee. The most remarkable fact in its history, how- 
ever, is that it has lived so long without any direct appro- 
priations from the State Treasury. It has done a great 
and beneficent work for the people, but has not added one 
dollar to their burden by direct taxation. The several par- 
ent institutions of the University of Tennessee gaye in- 
struction, between 1794 and 1869, for very moderate 
charges for tuition, to nearly 8,000 persons; and since 
1869, when it received the additional national endowment, 
the University has-given free instruction to 8,542 others. 
Tis graduates number nearly 2,000.
-P-A-G-E-217
=|220 —- 
Tennessee was the daughter of North Carolina, and, 
through her and the State of Virginia, traces her institu- 
tions to England. North Carolina and Tennessee were 
founded chiefly by the Scotch-Irish, who loved their 
schools next to their church, and established them wher- 
ever they went. So it was that the means of education 
were among the very first things provided for in the consti- 
tutions made by these people. The Constitution of North 
Carolina, adopted in 1876, declared that “a school, or 
schools, shall be established by the Legislature for the con- 
yenient instruction of youth, with such salaries to the mas- 
ters, paid by the public, as may enable them to instruct at 
low prices; and all useful learning shall be duly encour- 
aged and promoted in one or more universities.” The un- 
settled condition of the country prevented a compliance 
with this requirement until 1789, when the University of 
North Carolina was duly established. ‘ 
That the people who came over into the Western val- 
leys from Virginia and North Carolina brought the same 
principles and purposes with them is evident from many — 
of their public acts. The most notable of their utterances 
in this relation is the proposed Constitution for the State 
of Franklin, submitted to the convention at Jonesboro in 
1784, which declared that “all kinds of useful learning 
shall be encouraged by the Commonwealth—that is to say, 
the future Legislature shall erect before the year 1787 one 
university, which shall be near the center of the State, and 
not in any city or town; and for endowing the same there 
shall be appropriated such lands as may be judged neces- 
sary, one-fourth of all the moneys arising from the sur- 
veys of land hereafter to be made, one half penny upon 
every pound of inspected tobacco, forever; and if the fund 
thence arising shall be found insufficient, the Legislature 
shall provide for such additions as may be necessary; and 
if experience shall make it appear to be useful to the inter- 
est of learning in this State, a grammar school shall be 
erected in each county; and such sums paid by the public 
‘shall enable the trustees to employ a master or masters of
-P-A-G-E-218
= 225 
approved morals and abilities.” Truly a most remarkable 
utterance this for so early a day, and only to be explained 
when we learn that educated Scotch-Irish preachers wrote 
it. Although this Constitution was set aside, these prin- 
ciples, so firmly fixed in the minds and hearts of the peo- 
ple, were duly imbedded in their later laws. 
The celebrated Ordinance for the Government of the 
Territory of the United States Northwest of the Ohio, 
passed July 13, 1787, contained these memorable words: 
“Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to 
good government and the happiness of mankind, schools 
and the means for education shall be forever encouraged.” 
Accordingly, when North Carolina ceded to the United 
States the territory from which the State of Tennessee was 
formed, it stipulated expressly that the inhabitants of the 
Territory Southwest of the River Ohio “ shall enjoy all the 
privileges, benefits, and advantages set forth in the ordi- 
nance of the late Congress for the government of the Terri- 
tory Northwest of the River Ohio.”? North Carolina thus 
demanded for her people who were to be cut. off from her 
in the new Western Territory the same educational priv- 
ileges which had been provided in her Constitution, Acts 
of 1789. The United States accepted this territory, there- 
fore under an obligation to provide “schools and the 
means of education; ” and right royally has it fulfilled its 
pledge : 
In the Act for the Government of the Territory South- 
west of the River Ohio we find a complete recognition and — 
confirmation of this covenant. It says: “ The inhabitants 
shall enjoy all the privileges, benefits, and advantages set 
forth in the ordinance of the late Congress for the Terri- 
tory Northwest of the River Ohio.” As the only general 
privileges or advantages mentioned in the Ordinance for 
the Northwest Territory were ‘ ‘schools and the means of ed- 
” it is evident that Congress meant thus to accede 
to the demands of North Carolina and to bind ne to pro- 
vide these things. 
On Sept. 10, 1794, the fifteenth day of the first regal ucation,
-P-A-G-E-219
See 
session of the first Assembly of the new Territory South- 
west of the River Ohio, the bill creating the mother insti- 
tution of our State University became a law, baptizing her 
with the name of “ President and Trustees of Blount Col- 
lege,” in honor of the Governor of the Territory. Colonel 
Moses White, the historian of the University, claims that 
this was the first strictly nondenominational college estab- 
lished under the jurisdiction of the United States, the fore- 
runner of all the State colleges and universities, as distin- 
guished from church colleges; for the charter of Blount 
College stipulated that “the trustees shall take effectual 
care that students of all denominations shall be admitted 
to the equal advantages of a liberal education and to the_ 
emoluments and honors of the college, and that they shall 
receive a like fair, generous, and equal treatment during 
their residence therein.” That the great men who organ- 
ized our State intended to found a territorial (State) col- 
lege is further shown by the men named in its charter. 
The trustees were the elegant William Blount, the Goy- 
ernor of the Territory and the friend of President Wash- 
ington; the Secretary of the Territory; its two judges— 
General John Sevier, the Exgovernor of the State of 
Franklin, and the first Governor of Tennessee; Colonel 
William Cocke, who had,been the mover of the Act for the 
college, and was afterwards Blount’s colleague in the Sen- 
ate of the United States—and eleven other leading men,- 
two of whom (Roane and Willie Blount) were Governors 
of the State, and four United States Senators. These no- 
ble pioneers gave the new college all they had to give: a 
charter and trustees. They doubtless had in mind, even 
then, their obligation and that of the United States to pro- 
vide “schools and the means of education ” in the Terri-» 
_ tory. y 
In 1806 Congress ceded to Tennessee the vast territory 
of public lands comprising the eastern two-thirds of the 
present State. In yielding this magnificent empire, it was 
evidently mindful of the solemn covenant contained in the 
Northwest Ordinance and of the contract with the State of
-P-A-G-E-220
— 223 — 
North Carolina that “ schools and the means of education” 
should be a perpetual privilege to be enjoyed by the inhab- 
itants of this soil; for, in order to insure its faithful per- 
formance after the land should have passed from the Unit- 
ed States, the Act of 1806 made it the inseparable condi- 
tion of the concession that Tennessee should set apart with- 
in the ceded territory 100,000 acres, free of all incum- 
brances, which should be sold for not less than two dollars 
per acre, and the proceeds invested for the use of two col- 
leges—one in East and one in West (now Middle) ‘Tennes- 
see. A like amount was to be devoted to academies in all 
the counties. , 
The General Assembly of Tennessee, at the next session 
following the passage of this Act, made it heir of Blount 
College, which was merged into it, and endowed it with the 
proceeds of the sale of one-half of this land. Cumberland 
College, at Nashville, was established and endowed with 
the other half of the fund. In this manner the parent ¢ol- 
lege of our State University received its first endowment. 
It was in accordance with the requirements of the ‘first 
Constitution of North Carolina, the Northwest Ordinance, 
and the deed of cession of the State of North Seon : 
which separated this portion of the territory. 
One would have thought that no endowment could have 
been more secure. It was guaranteed by the faith of the 
United States and two independent States, which stood to 
each other in the relation of mother and daughter. It is 
extremely sad, therefore, to have to record that East Ten- 
nessee College, after being starved for thirty-two years, 
secured a final settlement for this land and the various 
claims growing out of it, which, with ‘all the dribblets of 
payments that had been made before, aggregated only 
about one-fifth of what the original $100,000 (50,000 acres: 
at two dollars) should have provided. In vain did Govern- 
ors MeMinn and Carroll call the attention of the General 
Assembly to the great wrong and urge an investigation for 
the purpose of ascertaining how the matter stood and how 
it might be righted. The college endowment was largely
-P-A-G-E-221
C2 goa 
frittered away by gross mismanagement and by favoritism 
to squatters upon the land. To this day the State of Ten- 
nessee has never given the college a dollar, either by way 
of restitution or of gift. 
The Constitution of 1834 declared: “ Knowledge, learn- 
ing, and virtue being essential to the preservation of repub- 
lican institutions, and the diffusion of the opportunities and 
advantages of education throughout the different portions 
of the State being highly conducive to the promotion of 
this end, it shall be the duty of the General Assembly in 
all future periods of this government to cherish literature 
and science.” This Constitution goes on to say that the 
common school fund “shall remain a perpetual fund, the 
‘principal of which shall never be diminished by legislative 
appropriation; and the interest thereof shall be inviolably 
appropriated to the support. and encouragement of com- 
mon schools throughout the State and for the equal benefit 
of the people thereof.” Then, as if to remove all doubt 
as to the meaning of the above, it adds that these provi- 
sions, with regard to the common schools, shall not be con- 
strued to “prevent the Legislature from carrying into ef- 
fect any laws that have been passed in favor of the colleges, 
/ universities, or academies.” These declarations have come 
down to us in the Constitution of 1870, in the same lan- 
guage in the Constitution of 1870, and are, therefore, the 
law of the State to-day. zg 
The University idea has thus been traced back through 
two State Constitutions, the charter of Blount College, the 
charter of the Territory South of the River Ohio, the deed 
of cession from the State of North Carolina to the United 
States, and the Northwest Ordinance to the Constitu- 
tion of the State of North Carolina. It is proved, there- 
fore, beyond possibility of denial, that the State of Ten- 
nessee, as the heir of this soil, is bound by its several Con- 
stitutions and the terms of the grant under which it re- 
ceived this territory to “forever encourage and maintain 
schools and the means of education.” That this includes a 
State University as well as common schools is apparent
-P-A-G-E-222
  — 225 — 
from all of the Acts from the earliest times down to the — 
present. The conclusion is irresistible, therefore, that the 
State of Tennessee is bound by the Act of cession of the 
State of North Carolina, the Act of Congress granting it 
the largest part of its territory, and by every Constitution 
it has had, to maintain a State University which shall 
“cherish literature and science.” 
The fact that it has not done more of its own means for 
this cause may possibly be explained by the frequent grants — 
made to it for college purposes by the United States. The: 
grant of 1806 above referred to yielded, in all, about $60,- 
000, part of which was paid in small amounts within thirty- 
two years, and was expended for buildings or for the or- 
dinary expenses of the college. The remainder ($34,- 
397.29, received in 1839) was expended in later years for 
a college farm; and $5,000 is still held by the University 
in State certificates, which is said to represent the balance 
of this fund. ‘This is all that remains of the original land 
grant of 1806. 
The Act of Congress of July 2, 1862, donating public 
lands for agrienitural colleges, was accepted, with all of its’ 
conditions, by ‘the General Assembly in 1869. This Act 
donated certain land script to the several States and Ter- 
ritories, the proceeds of the sale of which should “ consti- 
tute a perpetual fund, the capital of which shall remain 
forever undiminished, and the interest of which shall be 
inviolably appropriated by each State which may take and 
claim the benefit of this Act to the endowment, support, 
and maintenance of at least one college, where the leading 
object shall be, without excluding other scientific and 
classic studies, and including military tactics, to teach such 
branches of learning as are related to agriculttre and the 
mechanic arts, ete. One of the conditions of this Act was 
that “ no portion of said fund, nor interest thereon, shall be 
applied directly or indirectly, under any pretense what- 
ever, to the purchase, erection, preservation, or repair of 
any building or buildings.” Another section’ provides 
that “any State which may take and ‘claim the roe of the 
45 j 
ey
-P-A-G-E-223
— 226 — 
provisions of this Act shall provide, within five years, at . 
least not less than one college, as described in the fourth 
section of this Act, or the grant to said State shall cease.” 
In other words, the State was to provide the college, with 
all that pertained to-it, especially the land and buildings; 
while the United States provided the funds with which to 
carry it on. 
This land seript was sold, the money invested in State 
bonds of the value of $400,000, and all except four thou- 
sand (fives) bearing six per cent interest. By contract this 
institution was required to “provide free instruction for 
two hundred and seventy-five students from the State of 
‘Tennessee ” in consideration of this endowment. At the 
same time the State reorganized the Board of Trustees, 
thus taking complete charge of the institution. By this 
act the State of Tennessee didnot forever discharge its ob- 
ligation to maintain a university. In accepting this sec- 
ond grand trust for its State University, the State under- 
took a continuing responsibility, one that must grow with 
the State and the demands of the people. The United 
States Government has been wonderfully beneficent in its 
dealings with the State, but the State thereby is put under 
a great obligation to do its part. Surely if the general gov- 
ernment has given these opportunities for the youth of the 
State, the State will think enough of them to provide the 
necessary house and home. 
The great need of the University of Tennessee at the 
present time is better buildings. The original buildings, 
constructed when the board had very little money, were of 
a very plain and simple character, and are now rapidly ap- 
proaching that condition in which repairing is expensive, 
and, indeed, almost impossible. ‘The institution has been 
suffering for the need of more and better buildings for 
many years. It needs a great central academic hall for 
lecture rooms and offices, and it also needs comfortable and 
healthful dormitories for its students. It has no adequate 
funds with which to erect these buildings, but must look te 
the State for them. For these purposes the educational
-P-A-G-E-224
— 227 — 
needs of the State demand the expenditure of not less than 
two hundred thousand dollars. 
As explained above, the board holds now only $5,000 of 
the proceeds of the first land grant; and this is absolutely 
the only fund in its possession which it would have the 
right under law to use for the erection or repair of build- 
ings. The Act of Congress prohibits the use of any part 
. the principal or interest of the fund of 1862 for’ the 
| recs preservation, or repair oe any building or bnild- 
ings.”” 
This board comes to the General Assembly with an ear- 
nest petition for an appropriation for a great, permanent 
academic building for the University, It asks that a spe- 
cial committee be appointed to investigate the needs of the 
institution and to report a method for supplying them at 
an early day.

The Peabody Normal College, 
NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE. 
WiiuiiaM H. Payne, PRESIDENT. 
Hon. S. G. Gruspreatu, Supt. of Public Instruction: 
I herewith submit my annual report of the Peabody Nor- 
mal College for the year 1895-96. Z 
The synoptical table which follows shows the registra- 
tion of students by States from the founding of the college 
in 1875 to the close of the last academic year, in May, 
1896. It will be seen that the registration for the year 
1895-96 was 575, the largest in the history of the school. 
It will be further noted that within the period of nine years 
the enrollment has risen from 175 to 575. When this fact 
is considered in connection with the fact that during this 
period the standard for admission has been steadily raised 
from year to year, this growth is phenomenal in the history 
of educational institutions. The standing of the college at 
home is shown by the fact that the enrollment from Ten- 
nessee has risen from 69 in 1888 to 283 in 1896. It thus 
appears that very nearly one-half of the aggregate enroll- 
ment is from Tennessee.

The special appropriation of $10,000 made by the last 
General Assembly for the support of a Chair of American 
History has been turned to excellent account. In addi- 
tion to the ordinary duties of his professorship, Dr. Garrett 
has conducted the American Historical Magazine, in which 
he has published for the first time selections from the Rob- 
ertson letters, which throw much light on the early history 
of Tennessee. Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, the foremost of 
contemporary American historians, pays this tribute to the 
Historical Magazine: 
“Tt is a pleasure to be able to say that the valuable Rob- 
ertson manuscripts are now in course of publication, under 
the direction of a most competent editor in the person of 
Mr. W. R. Garrett, Ph.D. They are appearing in the 
American Historical Magazine at Nashville, Tenn. The 
first installment appeared in January, and the second, in 
April, 1896. The magazine is doing excellent work exact- 
ly where this work is needed, and it could not render a bet- 
ter service to the study of American history than by print- 
ing these Robertson papers.” 
The Germans have a saying that whatever is to go into 
the life of a nation must first be put into its schools; that 
the schools are the source of a nation’s prosperity and great- 
ness. This is a true saying, but it should be added that 
whatever is to go permanently and beneficently into the 
schools must first be planted in the minds and hearts of 
their teachers; so that the question that takes precedence of 
all others in State and national prosperity is the education 
of teachers. If teachers, as a class, are broad-minded, in- 
telligent, patriotic, virtuous, and skillful in their art, then
-P-A-G-E-231
— 234 — 
the successive generations of children will. become wise, 
_virtuous, intelligent, and patriotic citizens, and the State 
will move forward in all lines of wholesome growth. -Ten- 
nessee has reason to be proud of the institutions of learning 
within her borders, but the school that lies nearest the 
sources of her real prosperity is the one founded by George 
Peabody for-the professional education of teachers. It is 
through this benefaction and the liberality of the trustees 
of the University of Nashville that Tennessee has at a small 
cost a Normal School which otherwise would entail an an- 
nual expenditure of fifty thousand dollars. 
The large growth of the Normal College has produced 
the most serious embarrassinents in respect of room. The 
chapel is not large enough to seat the entire body of stu- 
‘dents; class rooms are overcrowded, to the great discomfort 
of students and teachers; and the gymnasium is so meager 
in space and appointment as to fulfill only partially the 
purposes for which it was designed. In some departments, 
owing to an inadequate teaching force, the classes have be- 
come so large ( in some eases numbering more than one hun- 
dred) that individual instruction, has become impossible, a 
sad plight, especially for a Normal school. 
A most pressing need is a physical laboratory. Strange 
_ as it may seem for such an institution of learning, the Nor- 
mal College ig almost entirely destitute of apparatus for in- 
struction in physical science; and if such apparatus were to 
be supplied, there is no place whatever where it could be 
safely stored and profitably used: In this respect there are 
numberless high schools that are far better equipped for 
science teaching. ; 
In view of these extreme needs, will not the State of 
_ Tennessee codperate with the Peabody Board of Trust and 
equip their joint school so that it shall stand fairly well 
with similar institutions? It was Mr. Winthrop’s pious 
wish that this “living monument to the memory of George 
Peabody ” should be the best: of its kind on the American 
continent. Respectfully submitted, 
is W. H. PAYNE, 
Nashville, Dec. 1, 1896. mn ~ President.

The University of Nashville. 
I have the honor to transmit my annual report of the 
University of Nashville for the year 1895-96. The ag- 
gregate attendance in all departments for the last academic 
year was as follows:

The reorganized Medical College has had a year of sig- 
nal prosperity. As was expected, the new building proves 
to be admirably adapted to the purposes for which it was 
constructed; and the better facilities for medical instruc- 
tion have attracted an unexpectedly large number of stu- 
dents. In accordance with the catholic policy of the Uni- 
versity, all its departments are open on equal terms to men 
and women, and several young ladies have improved this 
opportunity to acquire a medical education. The session 
which opened on Oct. 7 shows a still larger registration of 
students, and the permanent prosperity of the college 
seems fully assured. 
It pains me to record the death, during the summer, of 
Dr. John H. Callender, Dean of the Medical College. He 
was a man of the highest standing in his profession, and of 
unsurpassed competence in his special field of study and
-P-A-G-E-233
pa 236 — 
teaching. As an executive officer, his gifts were of the 
highest order; and it is to his wisdom and skill that the re- 
organized Medical College is largely indebted for its new 
era of prosperity. 
In the Literary Department the vacancy in the Win- 
chester Chair of Modern Languages, caused by the resig- 
nation of Miss Tozer, has been filled by the appointment 
of Miss Carolyn Humphrey, who has acquired special com- 
petence for her position by the most careful training at 
home and abroad. 
The Collegé of Music, lately incorporated into the Uni- 
versity organization, gives promise of a prosperous career. 
Its distinguished director has drawn a large number of stu- 
dents into its membership, and the excellence of the in- 
struction offered has enlisted the confidence and patronage 
of the music-loving public. 
At the Annual Commencement, held on May 27, 1896, 
the following degrees were conferred in the Literary De- 
partment:

The honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred 
as follows: On Dr. Samuel A. Green, of Boston; on Prof. 
Isaac N. Demmon, of Ann Arbor, Mich.; on Prof. John 
M. Webb, of Bellbuckle, Tenn. 
For the purpose of promoting the corporate life of the 
University, and of bringing the several departments into 
closer union, steps have been taken for the organization of 
a University Senate, to be composed of the professors in 
the service of each department and of the principals of the 
allied schools. 
As now organized, the University of Nashville places a 
liberal education within the reach of any who care to se- 
cure it. The child, boy or girl, may enter the Winthrop 
Model School, by a succession of ascending steps may com-

Tennessee School for Deaf and Dumb. 
Dear Sir: I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your fa- 
vor of the 7th inst., and to submit the following report of 
the condition of the Tennesseé School for the Deaf and 
Dumb: 
The present attendance of pupils is 203, representing 
nearly every county in the State. There are 118 boys and 
85 girls now present. The average attendance for the past 
two years has been 190. | The general health of the pupils 
during that time has been excellent, no death having oc- 
curred among the pupils or any very serious illness. 
The expenditures of the institution for the biennial pe- 
riod have been $62,550, estimating one month the ac- 
counts of which have not been fully made up. 
Our course of ‘study consists of the common school, pri- 
mary and intermediate branches, much time being devoted 
to language. The school is conducted upon the plan 
known as “ the combined system ” for the education of the 
deaf, which includes manual, or sign, teaching in connec- 
tion with oral, or articulation, teaching. Our oral work 
has been considerably enlarged during the two years. 
‘We have a well-equipped gymnasium, where systematic 
instruction in physical culture is given to all pupils. This 
work is new with us. It has thus far been very beneficial. 
Our boys are taught shoemaking, printing, carpentry, 
outdoor work, ete.; and the girls are taught housework, sew- 
ing, darning, fancy needlework, ete. Our aim is to make 
our pupils intelligent, moral, self-supporting citizens. 
Very respectfully, 
. THOMAS L. MOSES, 
Knoxville, Dec. 9, 1896. Principal.

Tennessee School for the Blind. 
Dear Sir: I cheerfully respond to your request for a re-- 
port of Tennessee School for the Blind.” We have always 
claimed that our institution, while a great and noble char- 
ity, and one that reflected lasting credit on the humanity 
and benevolence of the people of Tennessee, who through — 
their rulers and Jawmakers foster this and kindred institu- 
tions, properly belonged to the Department of Education. 
Tennessee School for the Blind was founded in 1845 
through the efforts of Mr. Champlin. It oceupied for sev- 
eral years a rented house; then, in 1852, property on what 
is now called Asylum Street was bought and a good build- 
ing erected. In 1863 this building was demolished by or- 
der of the Chief Engineer of the Army of the Cumber- 
land. No remuneration has ever been made the State by 
the general government. From 1867 to 1872 the school 
occupied rented houses. At this latter date, Judge John 
M. Lea purchased and donated to the State the property 
upon which the buildings now stand. Our grounds and 
buildings are valued at about $100,000. We have no in- 
come except from legislative appropriation. There are no 
charges for board and tuition to the blind children of the 
State. We admit all who are of good health and between 
the ages of seven and seventeen. _ 
I will briefly make report for the two years closing with 
December, 1896. This report is substantially the same 
that will be embodied in my regular biennial report to the 
Board of Trustees, and through them to the Governor and. 
General Assembly. ;

Our teachers are paid, with board, about $40 a month. 
Our appropriation for two years is $39,000. I can in this 
only say that it is expended, and is barely sufficient for our 
present number of pupils; and there are many others in the: 
State who ought to be in school. Twenty-three counties 
in the State have not had a pupil from them in the last two 
years. Very truly,

institutes; and, 
Whereas, so little attention has been given to the matter 
of normal training of colored teachers by the State, of Ten- 
nessee (for the last few years, even the money usually al- 
lowed for the holding of county institutes has been with- - 
held); and, , 
Whereas, this Association has learned with pleasure from 
State Superintendent S. G. Gilbreath such words of encour- 
agement with reference to appropriating aid for such train- 
ing among the colored people; and since he doubly assures 
the State teachers in convention assembled that the aid will 
be granted should proper steps be taken to secure the same; 
therefore be it

Paper read by A. R. Merry, of Jackson. 
THE HOME AND THE SCHOOL. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the theories and systems 
of belief and thought, with regard to education, are many 
and various, there is substantial agreement on this point, that 
its chief ends are intelligence and virtue. That all true ed- 
ucation has an intellectual and a moral side. Whatever else 
may do or not do, it is expected to produce capable, intel- 
leetual men and women, of good moral character. Apart 
from original capacities and inherited dispositions the two 
most potent factors in this work are the home and the school. 
Whatever a man is in intellect, in moral character, in general 
culture is due mainly to these two agencies. Then the edu- 
cational value and province of each is a subject that deserves 
the most thoughtful consideration. 
A distinguished writer said recently in one of the reviews: 
“Our cherished school system is in some danger of breaking 
down under burdens that do not properly belong to it, by a 
thoughtless attempt to put upon it the whole task of educa- 
tion. One of the popular needs of the time is a careful 
survey of the whole range of educational forces.” There | 
is a widespread disposition to make the schools responsible 
for the pupils’ morals as well as their minds, when it is evi- 
dent from the amount of work that is put upon us as teachers, 
along purely intellectual lines, that the whole public school 
: system of this country is so shaped as to emphasize the intel- 
lectual side, while the family is assigned, and, I think, justly, 
the main work of moral and religious training. This is in ac- 
cord with the great principle of division of labor, which is 
that different kinds of work be distributed to different classes 
and individuals so that each shall do that for which he is best 
fitted. From this principle it follows that the foundations 
of character must be laid in the homé if laid at all. For 
there ali the details of the child’s life are brought under di- 
rect supervision during its most impressible years. Strong 
natural affection and a feeling of dependence on the part of 
_ the child are forces of immeasurable value in that directfon 
of obedience. ‘Through the influence of unconscious sympa- 
thy and example those things upon which father and mother 
set value naturally have most weight with the child. The
-P-A-G-E-251
— 254— 
parents’ ideals are apt to become the ideals of the chiidren, 
at last during the formative period of their lives. Since 
the teacher has to deal with his pupils in the mass his in- 
fluence is more diffused, hence the parent is far better able 
as well as more strongly disposed by the ties of nature to 
study the child’s individuality and to adapt his methods to 
its peculiar needs. 
Now it is conceded that on the intellectual side our public 
schools are doing a valuable work for those who come for any 
length of time under their influence, but on the moral side 
the results are not considered so satisfactory. Wither directly 
or by implication there is a widespread attempt to charge — 
up the moral delinquencies of our young people to a failure 
on the part of the schools to do their legitimate work, while 
a thought of the duty of the home in this matter is scarcely 
entertained. If the moral progress of our youth has failed 
to keep pace with their intellectual advancement, and no 
_ candid man will deny it, does the responsibility rest with the 
schools? It is a fact that the moral status of our young 
people, speaking broadly, is a matter of grave concern to ~ 
every thoughtful man of the race, and is a problem that 
should be met honestly, candidly and without fear. A man ‘ 
who says anything in public that is not highly complimentary 
to the race often incurs the odium of being called a pessi- 
mist or a traitor; but it seems to me that nothing is to be 
gained by acting the part of the proverbial ostrich, which, 
being attacked, hides his head in the sand and leaves his 
whole body unprotected and vulnerable at everv point. A. 
man is not estimated at what he says of himself, but at what 
others know him to be. So it is with a race. Nothing 
we may say in praise of ourselves amounts to anything un- 
less it accords with the facts in the case. The first step in 
the proper treatment of a patient is a correct diagnosis of the 
disease. It does not improve his condition to tell him he* 
is not seriously sick when he has a malignant tumor that 
needs heroic treatment. 
What do the police records and the criminal statistics of 
the country say as to the moral status of our young people? 
What, indeed, is the concensus of opinion of our own people, 
/ privately expressed? Are our boys as fond of good, honest 
toil as we would like to see them? Have they in general an 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
— 255 — re ¥ hie 
unquestionable reputation for faithfulness and reliability? « 
Is their development in public gatherings such as to fill us 
with pride and admiration? It is not a sufficient defense 
to say there are others. If these questions must be answered 
in the negative, where is the responsibility? 
The disposition to lay it at the school house. door has had 
a tendency to relieve parents of a due sense of their own per- 
sonal and immediate responsibility for the moral training of 
their children. Since the schools have been able to accom- 
plish far less in the way of character building than our older 
people have been led to believe, there isa growing tendency 
on their part to lose confidence in the schools. To set less 
and less value upon them. How often. do we hear the re-. 
mark, “Education does not seem to be doing our boys and 
girls much good!” They do not seem to realize that the in- 
cessant care of the best and wisest teacher is often counter- 
acted by the example, the conyersation, and all the details 
of the home life. The ideal condition of development is at- 
tained only when these two co;ordinate factors in education, 
the home and the school, work in perfect harmony; each do- 
ing its own special work, and both being materially helpful 
to each other. It seems to me that the most serious obstacle 
that confronts the teachers of this Association to-day is the 
fact that our pupils in the main are subjected to such op- 
posite influences at home and in the school. How many 
teachers have not found their work embarrassed, and the 
progress of their pupils impeded by adverse conditions at 
home more than by any other cause whatsoever. The low 
intellectual life, the absence of the ennobling influence of 
books and papers, and especially of that fireside conversa- 
tion upon topics that elevate the mind and broaden the view. 
Professor Payne says that mental culture has a direct ten- 
dency to weaken the empire of the passions and emotions. 
However that may be, it is certain that the discipline and 
methods of the school room have a high moral value, but often 
the boy goes from a school where obedience, orderliness, in- 
dustry, courtesy and self-control are insisted upon to a home 
where none of these things are enforced, and where no useful 
employment is provided. A single afternoon spent with a 
crowd of idle, vicious boys will neatralize the work of months 
Afier a somewhat extended experience and intercourse with
-P-A-G-E-253
we — 256 — 
the teachers of our State and of others, I am convinced that 
these are the conditions that confront us. Of course there 
are many homes to which these remarks do not apply, and, as 
the years go by, there will be more and more; but at present — 
they are certainly applicable in a large majority of cases. 
What then ought to be done? What can be done? . These 
questions are in order, and they are of vast import. 
The parents on their part should realize that they cannot 
shift the responsibility of their children’s moral training upon 
the shoulders of others without the most disastrous results. 
It is not proposed that the schools should do less, but that ; 
the parents should do mere. They should desist from throw- 
ing stones at the school for not doing their work, and throw 
around their children the wholesome restraints of a firm and 
efficient parental discipline. They should give their moral 
support to the teacher in enforcing those school regulations 
which have such a salutary effect upon the character of their _ 
children, instead of so often assuming an attitude of hostility 
when a question of discipline is to be settled. In this connec- 
tion the following remarks of Professor Du Bois, whose recog- 
nized eminence as a scholar entitles him to a thoughtful 
hearing, are very significant. He says: “Our educated and 
cultured classes, instead of being regarded, either within or 
without the race, as legitimate leaders of the negro people, 
are regarded by the whites as exceptions which.do not influ- 
ence of negro barbarism and by the blacks as a selfish clique, 
who think themselves better than their people, and only want 
to use the other eight million. American negroes as a batter- 
ing ram to open the doors of opportunity in order that they ~ 
themselves may pass through and escape from a company 
which they secretly dislike and despise.” Now, if our edu- 
cated classes are guilty as charged in this terrible indictment, 
if they have been educated out of touch and out of sympathy 
with the great mass of our people in their fierce struggle for 
existence in this country, then the salt has lost its savor and 
is henceforth good for nothing but to be cast out of doors and 
trodden under foot of men, and the salvation of the negro 
race must wait until God can raise up a class of men more 
worthy of their high vocation—men who are willing to accept 
the responsibilities as well as the rewards of leadership. But 
T believe that this charge is too sweeping. I believe that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
— 257 — 
great mass of our really educated men and women are ac- 
tuated by motives higher than a gross aggrandizement of self, 
that they feel to have something more in concern with our 
brothers on the cotton farms, on the sugar plantations, in the 
slums, if you please; something more in common, than a com- 
mon humanity. But the fact that such a charge should be 
made is certainly suggestive. It indicates a danger and a 
duty. A danger that our educated classes, by a spirit of ex- 
clusiveness and exaggerated notions of the dignity that at-~ 
taches to culture, may destroy their influence as moral leaders 
of the people. It indicates a duty on our part as teachers to 
remove as far as may be possible, a lack of confidence in our 
strong personal sympathy with the people among whom we 
work, wherever God has called us to labor. To bring the 
schools and the homes, humble though they be, in touch with 
each other, so that, hand in hand, they may work out the 
moral and intellectual regeneration of the race.

TENNESSEE STATE TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION, — 
On Tuesday afternoon, July 21, 1896, the thirty-first an- 
nual session of the Tennessee State Teachers’ Association 
convened in the public school building in the pleasant little 
city of Humboldt, at 3 o’clock. 
On the platform were seated President G. R. McGee; Prof. | 
Frank Goodman, Secretary; State Superintendent 8. G. Gil- 
breath; Hon. John T. Crews, Mayor of Humboldt; Prof. J. 
L. Brooks, and Rey. R. P. Mason. 
After many pleasant greetings among the teachers, the As- 
sociation was opened by the singing of “America,” by the 
audience. i 
After a short, fervent prayer, by the Rev. F. H. Ford, pas- 
tor of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, President McGee 
introduced Mayor John 'T. Crews, who in a most cordial ad- 
dress of welcome made the teachers feel that each had re- 
ceived a personal welcome to Humboldt. The keys of the 
city were handed over to the visiting members of the Asso- 
ciation, and the privilege of even walking “on the grass” was 
extended to them. : 
Mayor Crews spoke of the importance of the meeting, show- 
ing that he was well acquainted with our educational needs 
and appreciated our efforts in the cause. Among other 
things he said: ; ; 
Ladies and Gentlemen and President of the Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation of Tennessee: 
Iam glad that it is “my privilege to stand before this cul- 
tivated and refined Association of teachers, and extend to you 
a hearty welcome to our homes and hospitality. The keys 
of the city are in your possession, to.do with as you please. 
Now just haye a good time while in Humboldt, and even
-P-A-G-E-261
— 264 — 
“walk on the grass” if you feel like it, and this is a privilege 
seldom granted by any city. I am glad that I have lived to 
see the day when your calling and vocation are recognized as 
such an honorable and dignified position. In my opinion you — 
stand second to no profession known to man, and are truly 
worthy of our highest esteem and consideration. Yet. not- 
withstanding all this, you are not as thoroughly appreciated 
as you should be. I believe that for the services rendered, 
you are more poorly paid: than any other profession. As you 
advance upward, step by step, the responsibilities have kept 
pace with your onward march, but I am sorry to say that 
salaries have failed to keep up with the procession. 
There is another thing that commends your profession to 
the world, and that is its moral and Christian influence with 
all with whom you come in contact. In the practice of med- 
icine, law and other professions, an immoral man may suc- _ 
ceed, but let the teacher be found guilty of bad conduct — 
and his days will be few and full of trouble—he will be a 
failure. Because your standard of excellence is so high is 
one of the many reasons why we are so happy to have you 
with us. We feel that we are associating with “our betters,” 
and consequently expect to receive impressions that will do. 
us good. We all love good society, and we congratulate our- 
selves on this three days of social enjoyment. 
I want you to say that you are among your friends be- 
cause our people believe in schools and education. We all 
are in harmony on this question—people, teachers and Board 
of Education. We have no wrangling over these matters in 
our community. We haye one aim and purpose, and that. is 
that we shall have and maintain one of the best high schools — 
in Tennessee, and when our children are grown up they shall 
be educated and be able to take their places in the world as 
ideal citizens. 
_T hope you will not accuse me of presumption and of giving 
gratuitous advice, but as I have had three years of experience 
as Secretary of the Board of Education in this city, I will 
take this opportunity to speak of a thing that is of interest 
to teachers, patrons and Boards of Education, and that is the 
vicious and unruly student. The laws of our country pro- 
tect society from criminals by committing them to imprison- 
ment and hard labor in the penitentiary, for the protection of
-P-A-G-E-262
  — 265 — 
the law-abiding citizen and for the reformation of the law- 
breaker. On this well-established rule and practice I believe 
our children have rights that should be respected and shouid 
have protection from harmful influences, from a vicious class 
that get into our public schools. I do not believe it is suffi- 
cient to expel these characters from school, but there should 
be laws enacted by the State that being expelled from a public 
‘school was a verdict of guilty, and a committal to the State 
Industrial School at the expense of the State. These same 
bad boys will be men sometime if they live, and if they are 
not reformed in youth the chances of them becoming good 
and useful citizens are lessened as they grow older. 
If such a law as I have suggested was passed and enforced, 
it would not become necessary to expel but very few, and 
would soon become a thing of the past. What does one of 
these mean boys care for being expelled from school? Often 
it is the very thing he mostly desires. He will have his time 
and liberty to himself to use as he pleases. He had rather 
play baseball, spin tops and fish on the banks of the creek 
than to go to anybody’s school. This may seem an extreme 
_ measure, but I‘honestly and truly believe this to be the only 
solution to the question. The Teachers’ Association can ac- 
complish some legislation in this direction if they feel so in- 
clined, for in organization there is strength, and in a multi- 
tude of the council there is wisdom and a division of responsi- 
bility. g 
Well, again as the responsibility of the teacher in their age 
of progress. Parental training at home is declining, and be- 
ing sadly neglected, and now it is left to a great extent to the’ 
school teacher, to train the children in good manners and 
social etiquette. 
Another burden resting upon your shoulders is ‘teaching 
patriotism. A few years ago, even in my recollection, it was 
the delight of the fond father to gather his boys around him 
and recite valorous and heroic deeds of courageous Ameri- 
cans. The soldiers that fought for our freedom and liberty _ 
“were loved and revered. Now the world moves swifter and. 
many changes have been wrought. Bringing down the father 
to a mere bread winner, and the teacher is now left to in- 
struct the youth in these whole principles and sentiments. ; 
I long to see the day when every American born man or.
-P-A-G-E-263
— 266 — 
woman, will feel proud of the honor and distinction of thar 
nativity. 
It seems to be a fad of recent years to give our language 
a foreign dudish accent. There is no language as sweet as - 
the pure English, or spoken in America (“and the heart of 
America is the South”). I have known some of our boys to 
go off to college (and they did not leave the United States 
either), that when they returned home at the end of the first 
term, their identity was completely lost in cuffs, collars, a. ~ 
big shoe-fly and a brogue. Let us have our country man, then - 
we will develop Statesmen that are wise enough to lead the — 
people aught, and not demagogues and politicians to lead the 
people. When we have accomplished these high purposes, 
these United States will be no place to nest anarchy, then 
we can all join in the grand chorus, “America, sweet land 
‘ of liberty, ’tis of thee we sing.” 
Ladies and gentlemen of the Teachers’ Association, when 
I consider the high moral standard, and educational qualifica~ ~ 
tions required of you in these times, I feel that our children 
are safe in your hands for proper training, provided, of course, 
that you receive the hearty co-operation of your patrons. 
T alluded in the beginning to your insufficient remunera- 
_ tion ior the services rendered, but offered no remedy, though 
I can offer this consolation, inasmuch as you are a Christian 
and God fearing profession, there is a royal diadem awaiting 
you in that. celestial city, and a golden harp, that you may 
sing with the angels on the banks of the river of life, in that 
summer land of song for evermore. p 
Now in conclusion allow me to bid you welcome, and I 
_ trust you will have a profitable and pleasant meeting, and 
that you will honor us again with your presence in the near 
future. 
Prof. Walter C. Anderson, of Nashville, made an elequent. 
response to the Address of Welcome, as follows: \ 
Mr. President, Hon. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
The duty of responding to the cordial address of welcome 
. to which you have listened is a very satisfactory one. It is 
an honor.to speak for this Association and a pleasure to thank _ 
you for the hospitality and kindness tendered us on every side. 
We are happy to find the gates of your city not simply “gates 
ajar,” but swinging wide to welcome the teachers of the State. 6
-P-A-G-E-264
— 267 — 
and yet we feel that formal words of welcome are scarcely nec- 
essary. ‘The cordial grasp of friendly hands, and the 
practical evidences of your good will have already made us 
feel perfectly at home. And I venture the prophecy that as 
the waters of our great State from Eastern Mountain and 
Central Basin flow to the west, so the gratitude and good will 
of the teachers from other sections shall gravitate to the west, 
and abide with you. But while as individuals we enjoy your 
hospitality, full well do we realize that it is the glad tribute 
you pay to the cause we represent. . ¢ 
We thank your representative for his kind words in refer- 
ence to the dignity and worth of the teacher’s work. We be- 
lieve that no grander cause demands the service of trained 
minds, willing hands, and loving hearts. It is second to none 
save the work of him who stands within the sacred desk to 
proclaim, “Peace on earth, good will to men.” Nor am I 
sure that even in that respect our work stands on a lower 
plane, for every teacher who has a proper conception of his 
profession, feels that he too is commissioned to bear glad tid- 
ings of great joy to all men, that it is his privilege and duty 
to impress upon the young mind and heart the truths that 
underlie happy home life, true citizenship and practical Chris- 
tianity. That they may better accomplish this work these 
teachers come into your midst from all sections of the State, 
recognizing the fact that in union there is strength, and that 
organization is the key to success. We have found that no 
teacher is sufficient unto himself, and that whether he comes 
from the log house among the hills or from university halls 
he needs the sympathy and help of those who labor with him 
for the common cause. Then may we not meet together and 
bow at the shrine of true education, feeling that as teachers 
our personal power is increased; that we obtain a_ better 
knowledge of the strength and weakness of our work; that we 
may in this way influence needed legislation, and that offi- 
cials’ teachers, parents and pupils may be brought into 
closer relationship? : 
May I not in closing give you by an illustration my con- 
ception of what should be the result of all educational work? 
_ Water drawn from the ocean by the warmth of the sun’s rays

of life and beauty; then gathering in sprakling brook, wind- 
ing stream and majestic river pours itself again into the 
ocean from which it came. An immortal soul, drawn from the 
infinite ocean of God’s creative power, by the warm rays of 
divine love, by ihe breath of his providence is borne to earth 
and finds lodgment in the form of humanity., If life’s les- 
sons are well learned, having blessed the world by its pres- 
ence and work, gathering strength in its onward course, 
strong in the consciousness of its power should it not again 
return to the bosom of the God who gave it birth? If edu- 
cation fails to produce this result, our work has been in vain. 
Ladies and gentlemen, we accept your hospitality. We 
tender our thanks, and we ask you to take part with us in 
the work of this meeting and help to make it a success. 
After singing the hymn, “All hail the power of Jesus’ 
name,” led by Miss Lockie Hinson, President G. R. McGee, of 
Trenton, addressed the Association, setting forth in an able 
and eloquent manner the work that has been accomplished 
for the cause of education in Tennessee. 
Presiden G. R. McGee then presented the Annual Address 
which was well received, and, after delivery, the same was, 
upon motion, referred to the Committee on Schools Laws. 
‘The address was as follows: 
ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT G. R. WGEE. 
-Thirty-first Annual Session of Tennessee State Teachers’ As- 
sociation. 
The centennial year of the State of Tennessee finds her 
teachers assembled in their annual convention in the younges- 
division of the State. Though this section is less rich in his- 
toric associations than the older ones, in educational affairs 
she is no less active, earnest and progressive. 
We meet to-day for counsel upon grave and important 
questions and the result of our discussions and deliberations 
will be felt by no section alone, and limited in time only by 
the future history of our State. 
To the question, “Who is the State?” the famed answer of 
Louis XIV. might with both propriety and truth be given by 
the school teacher. Let the great public think and act as it 
may, it is as inevitable as the connection between cause and

effect that no State can ever rise higher in intellectual power 
or moral character than the average level of the instructors. 
of her youth. 
Your committee has provided in the programme of this. 
meeting for the discussion of: 
1. School Officials, Their Duties and Influence. 
2. The Graded Public Schools. 
Examination and Promotion of Pupils. 
. Revision of our Course of Study. 
Summer Institutes. 
Normal School Work. 
Relations of the College and the Public Schools. 
The Literature of the South in Education. 
The Centennial Celebration and the Schools. 
. Weakness and the Strength of our School System. 
Here is a veritable feast of fat things, the preparation of 
which has been committed to able and competent hands, and 
from which we may confidently expect a season of both 
pleasure and profit. 
In the year 1806 the United States Congress donated to- 
Tennessee for free school purposes 100,000 acres of land. 
The proceeds of this land furnished the basis of a public 
school fund in Tennessee. Through the ante-bellum State 
banks, through the civil war, through the Brownlow Re- 
construction period, and through political operations of 
varied shades, the ghost of this fund, and what was added to 
it, has come down to us as a “State Debt” of $2,500,000, the © 
interest on which furnishes part of our school revenue to-day. 
In 1823 the State added the proceeds of certain tracts of land, 
and in 1827 some other revenues, to the public school fund. fe SO 
MWD Be 
In 1830 legislation was attempted looking to a general sys- 
  tem of public instruction; but so inefficient was the legislation 
and so indifferent were the people that little if any good was 
accomplished. In 1845 the State was divided into districts 
  and the treasurer was authorized to pay to each district an ‘ 
‘amount of the school fund proportioned to the amount of 
school tax the people of that district levied upon themselves. 
b A few years later this law was repealed and an act passed 
authorizing the County Court of each county to levy a school 
fax if they chose to do so, but making no. provision for 
general or county supervision of either the money or the 
   
-P-A-G-E-267
  — 270 — 
the schools. In. 1858 the public school fund was 
declared by law to be $1,500,000 and was then a part of the 
capital stock of the Bank of Tennessee. The annual interest 
on this fund, at 6 per cent, was distributed yearly among 
the counties according to population and so ingeniously 
wasted, on the pro-rata plan in private schools, that it ae- 
complished almost nothing for the children of the State. 
In 1867 the legislature aitempted to establish a general sys- 
tem of public instruction, with State and county superintend- 
ents and local boards of education. The system was to be 
maintained by a direct State tax, the proceeds to be distrib-- 
uted to counties according to scholastic population. The 
tax-payers of the State thought they had few if any represen- 
tatives in that legislature, and so bitter and determined was 
their opposition to this free school system that it was a total 
failure in almost every quarter. In 1873 a school law was 
enacted which, with various amendments and modifications, 
is that under which we are working to-day. Its features of 
both strength and weakness will be discussed in this meet- 
ing. fc 
I have thought this outline of our educational legislation 
not inappropriate to this centennial year, and as most of the 
amendments to our school law have originated in the State 
Teachers’ Association, I would respectfully ask that you give 
proper consideration to the following recommendations: 
1. That the term of office of State and County Superin- 
tendent should not be less than four years. : 
2. That the salary of the County Superintendent should 
be fixed by the Legislature at a certain per capita on the 
school population of the county, provided that in no county 
shall the salary be less than $300 nor more than $1,800 per 
year. 
3. That the Legislature should at its next session provide 
for establishing and maintaining at some suitable point in 
West Tennessee a normal or training school for teachers. 
It has been said that the average “American Citizen” will 
not accept thought in its abstract form. He does not care 
for the statement that success in order to exist must fulfill 
its own conditions; but he readily takes up the maxim, 
“Nothing succeeds like success.” To him education, in com- 
mon with other things, must be what he regards as a success 
or it is nothing. 
     
-P-A-G-E-268
      ata a 
The object of this meeting of the State Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation, yea, the very object for which the Association ex- 
ists, is to insure educational success in our State. But what - 
is success in education? What are we trying to do? Have 
we definite aims, and are we working together to attain them? 
You, ladies and gentlemen, who come from every grade of 
the teaching profession—from the great universities, from 
remote country schools, and from all that stand between 
these—you are and ever should be the leaders in educational 
thought in Tennessee; and you are the parties who are in the 
largest measure responsible for educational progress, or for 
the lack of it. Without the slightest spirit of carping or 
fault-finding let us ask ourselves a few direct questions: ~_ 
Is this. Association fully meeting the responsibility of its 
high calling? Are our educational methods and systems 
adapted to our country and our people, or we are blindly fol- 
lowing the lead of others? 
Clothing that is comfortable for one people is; wholly un- 
suited to another inthe same latitude because of difference 
in the physical geography of their homes. The same is true 
of food, of medicine and of industries. That which is both 
pleasant and profitable to people of a particular race or ta- 
tionality may be distasteful, even positively hurtful, to those 
of another. Are not similar things true in the inteliectual 
and moral world? May not a certain arrangement and ad- 
ministration of school affairs give the most satisfactory re- 
sults i Switzerland or New England and be wholly unsuited 
to Tennessee? May not a system of city schools be admirably 
* adapted to Hamburg or Lyons and prove a miserable failure 
in Nashville or Memphis? Haye we to-day an educational 
system that properly meets the wants of our own age, and 
State, and that is so suited to the temper and disposition of 
“our own people that it promises for the future better per- 
sonal character for the individual, better material for social 
‘and domestic life, and better citizenship for the State? I 
‘suggest these and similar ideas for your careful considera- 
tion. t : 
Allow me in this connection to call your attention to the 
fact that at the close of the school year just past, more than 
two-thirds of the graduates of our public high schools were 
young ladies. Private schools show nearly the same propor-  
-P-A-G-E-269
i — 272 — 
tion. For years the per cent of girls has steadily increased’ 
while that of the boys has as steadily diminished. The same: 
jaw applies in even greater ratio to the profession of teaching. 
What, in a few more years, is to be the result of this? That 
the social and domestic consequences must be disastrous no- 
one can doubt. Do not the facts also warrant us in fearing 
that history ‘may complete its circle through our free educa- 
tion by reducing women again to slavery just as accom- 
plished and scholarly Greeks were often, on account of their: 
attainments, made profitable slaves to ignorant and brutal 
Romans? 
Young women are also entering the ollegés and universi- 
ties in annually increasing numbers. The falling off of men 
in these institutions is at this time scarcely perceptible. But . 
the inevitable conclusion stares us in the face, if the high 
schools and academies annually prepare fewer men for col- 
Jege, then fewer men must go there. As our population in- 
creases the proportion of educated women is increasing, but 
the proportion of highly educated men. is not keeping pace 
with our progress in other directions. Here is an unques- 
tioned evil, and one that needs the application of a prompt 
and vigorous corrective. 
We suppose that no one desires that the number of women 
in high school or college should be diminished, but it is de- 
sirable that the number of men should be increased unless. 
we wish to see our learning, our social, professional and polit- 
ical life lose all its virility. 
T believe that much of the trouble referred to would dis- 
appear if our people could be convinced that there is some- 
thing else in life besides the “single gold standard” or “the 
~ free coinage of silver and gold at the ratio of 16 to 1.” 
Three hundred and fifty years before the Christain Era 
the Grove of Academus flourished at Athens and the Athe- 
nians studied war, oratory and philosophy. Two centuries 
later the Romans did much the same on the banks of the 
Tiber. These nations desired educated men only as gener- ~ 
als, statesmen. and philosophers.. The schools of the Middle 
Ages in Europe taught almost nothing but Latin and Greek 
because these languages were supposed to contain all the liter- 
ature that was worth knowing. And should we trace the his- 
tory of education from its dawn in Greece to the present
-P-A-G-E-270
  time, we would in every instance find it reflecting the popular 
ideas of the land in which it existed. Occasionally a great 
reformer broke from the beaten path and proclaimed some- 
thing positively good for his age and his people. We look 
back upon what these ancients called education and are 
amazed at the narrow limits to which they restricted the 
term. They meant by it special training for warriors, poli- 
ticians or priests. Some now think that it should be a special . 
training for the office, the’shop or the engine room. These 
narrow views of long ago should haye been buried in the 
grave of Feudalism, and our people should now learn that in 
the progress and enlightenment of this age education means 
something more than a knowledge of how to get bread and 
nutter, and that our boys are not prepared to leave school 
hecause they have grown strong enough to wield a hammer, 
or skillful enough to use a pen. 
Lord Bacon proclaimed, “Knowledge is power.” Jt is un- 
fortunately true that to the lawyer this means knowledge 
of Blackstone’s Commentaries; to the physician, of Horner's 
Anatomy; to the professor, of fluxions or the conjugation of 
upto; to the farmer, of how to raise turnips and fatten-hogs; 
and to Mrs. Grundy, of how to fasten neckties and enter a 
parlor. Are not these approximately correct specimens of many 
of the views that underlie the popular conception of educa- 
ion? Are they not false? Is it not our duty to combat 
them at every opportunity? Are. not these views, together 
with the greed of gain, hurrying our boys away from school 
sefore they can. obtain that broad and liberal culture essential 
to a generous manhood, and before they are prepared to learn 
he high and noble duties of a free citizen in a great common- 
wealth? as 
Is not education the sharpening of perception, the 
strengthening of memory, the arousing of imagination, the 
training of reason, the quickening of conscience, the deepen- 
ing of spiritual life, the broadening of the whole intellectual 
and moral being? Is not its end, in the widest’ sense, the 
production of correct thinkers; the increase of true directive 
power for every problem of human life, in order that to each 
individual may come the highest measure of usefulness and 
happiness, and to iho State peace and PrOspenY at oe 
with respect and dignity abroad?

At the Battle of the Pyramids Napoleon pointed up to~ 
those venerable monuments and said to his army, “Soldiers 
of France, forty centuries are looking down upon your deeds 
to-day.” 
Teachers of Tennessee, we are an army of more than ten 
thousand strong. A century of Statehood is looking down 
upon the thirty-first annual meeting of the State Teachers’ 
Association, and 800,000 young faces are looking up to us 
for leadership and guidance in the ways of wisdom and truth. 
The past is all behind us, rich in its historic memories and 
grand in the strides of progress that it has made. The fu- 
ture is spanned by the bow of promise and is bright with 
hopes and aspirations that we must not, we dare not disap- 
point. 
In conclusion, what is the object of this Association? Al- 
low me to answer by quoting the first section of the con- 
stitution: “The object of this Association shall be to pro- 
mote fellowship and fraternity among the teachers, to draw 
them together in social feeling and intercourse, to canvass 
and discuss methods of teaching and courses of study, and 
generally to promote the cause and elevate the standard of 
education.” 
“Tf ye know these things, happy are ye if you do them.” 
The Secretary and Treasurer, Prof. Frank Goodman, pre- 
sented his Annual Statement, showing a balance of $74.10 
at close of last annual meeting at Franklin. Upon motion of 
Secretary Goodman the Statement was referred to the Ex- 
ecutive Committee. 
The President then appointed a Committee on Resolu- 
tions, consisting of Prof. S. A. Mynders, Miss Flora Fitz- 
gerald and Prof. Walter C. Anderson. 
_ The appointment of other committees was deferred until 
a subsequent session. 
TUESDAY EVENING SESSION. 
Long before the hour of opening had arrived the large hall 
was filled to overflowing, and, after the meeting opened, with 
a vocal trio, by Messrs. Lee, John and Macie Garth, Chancel- 
lor J. H. Kirkland, of Vanderbilt University, addressed the 
Association on the subject of “The Teacher Himself.” After. 
_ listening to this valuable lecture every one present felt that 
he had a higher conception of the teacher and his work. 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
—275— 
Chancellor Kirkland said: 
“The teacher belongs to a distinct class among men. In 
his composition of parts all other classes of men have been 
utilized, and some new ingredients added. But all teachers 
are not alike. There are many varieties, many distinct types, 
many striking contrasts. There is the dignified teacher, the 
self-important teacher, the egotistical teacher, the superficial 
teacher, the scholarly teacher, the petulant teacher, the 
lazy teacher, the bad teacher, the good teacher, ete. 
But our theme leads us not so much to dwell on these 
varied kinds of teachers as to speak of certain points that. be- 
long to all teachers, certain interests that they have in com- 
mon. Ms 
“1. The preparation of the teacher.—Thorough prepara- 
tion is essential, if one expects to do thorough work. The 
preparation of the teacher involves knowledge of the sub- 
jects to be taught and also knowledge of the science and art 
of teaching. Neither side can be neglected, but the first 
demands longer and more careful training. ‘The second side 
may be looked after in part by normal schools, but most of 
our skill in teaching must be acquired in the class room. 
The preparation of the teacher varies with the kind of school 
work to which he means to devote himself. The Grammar 
School, the High School, the College, call for men of very 
different training. High School teachers have been’ content 
-with too low a standard of intellectual trdining. ‘These posi- 
tions are among the most important school positions in the 
land and should be filled by our most capable men. The 
preparation of the teacher is never finished. He must be a 
growing man, setting an example to his pupils of earnest 
study and intellectual vitality. : 
“2. The teacher’s difficulties——These arise from many 
sources, but possibly none are so constant as those which 
arise from himself. The difficulties that arise from pupils 
constitute a large part of the whole theory of school disci- 
pline. The difficulties that arise from patrons are among 
the most annoying of a teacher’s life. These are the little 
things that wear the soul. The best interests of patrons 
-would be served by keeping in close and sympathetic touch 
wiht the teacher of their children. They can well afford to 
be his ally and friend.   
 
-P-A-G-E-273
— 276— 
“3. The teacher's work.—The largeness of this theme for- 
bids full discussion. The teacher’s work is the building of the 
State, the securing for the coming generation of all the glory 
of past civilization. He is the trustee into whose hands 
have been committed the treasures of the past with an in- 
junction that he distribute. His mission in the largest: and 
divinest sense is to make men, to build character. In a more 
restricted sense his work is to make scholars and to prepare 
the leaders who shall occupy the most important positions in» 
church and state. 
“4, The teacher's reward.—This is never realized in 
money. The teacher must be poor; his natural end is to 
die of starvation. No teacher can afford to be mercenary; 
his services are not a question of barter. He should get all 
he can in the way of salary, but he should never make his ~ 
salary the measure of labor or‘allow poor pay to cause him to 
be content with half-hearted work. His true reward is in 
the gratitude of those whom he serves. This is no mean re- , 
turn. But his best reward will be in the consciousness of a ~ 
great work faithfully done. The plaudit “Come, ye blessed 
of my Father, I was an hungered and ye gave me meat” be- 
longs also to him who unselfishly tries to furnish the highest 
~ food to man.”

ELEMENTS OF EFFICFENCY AND WEAKNESS IN 
~~ OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL, SYSTEM. 
A Paper Read Before the State Teachers’ Association at 
Humboldt, July 23, 1896, and the East Tennessee Educa- 
tional Association at Cleveland, August 21, 1896, by S. G. 
Gilbreath, State Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
The growth of the public school system. in. Tennessee has 
heen largely an experimental growth, and the reforms insti- 
tuted from time to time, in response to the demands of those 
-most closely in touch with the needs of the common schools, 
andthe efficiency or weakness of the changes suggested, haye
-P-A-G-E-274
— 277 — 
been tested by fair, impartials trials. As we find the laws 
governing public instruction in Tennessee, they represent. a 
continued development, a crystallization of the opinions of 
the leaders of educational thought. That the applied sys- 
tem is still not perfect, is apparent. to those who know of its 
practical workings in ‘all departments, but that its spirit 
promises the greatest good to the State, that it is tending in 
the right direction, is not controverted by those who have 
more than a primary insight into its beneficent influence. 
To point out the elements of weakness is not to oppose,’ 
but to strengthen by making it possible to put in new timbers - 
where decayed columns now stand, and the reforms demand- 
ed by those who believe in the good results of public educa- 
tion are more to be considered and are more calculated to 
improve the school system and to make better the instruction 
given, than the weakness pointed out by those who at heart 
oppose the spirit of the system, or the loud commendations 
of some who publicly render support but privately condemn. 
FOR ALL. |! . 
The common schools, supported as they are by compulsory 
taxation, are institutions of the people, for the people, and 
the idea once dominating the minds of the friends of State 
education, that they were instituted for the benefit of some 
particular class or classes, was erroneous in its conception 
and detrimental to their best interests. They are not, and 
should not be considered, schools for the rich or poor, but 
for rich and poor; not for Protestant, Catholic, Jew, or un- 
believer, but they should grant equal privileges to all, with- 
~ out giving offense to the conscience of any; not for white or 
colored, but for both, with existing regulations as to their 
separate schools continued. The fact that they are for all 
classes of citizens constitutes their chief bulwark, is the prin- 
cipal element of strength, and must be sacredly preserved. 
HIGHER EDUCATION. 
The Stats, supported and perpetuated as it is by the intel- 
ligence of its citizens, has a right to insist on the education of 
its people, on the training of those who are to make, execute, 
and obey the laws. The State needs, and must have, an edu- 
cated citizenship. There are those who do not approve the , \
-P-A-G-E-275
— 278 — 
higher education of the people at the expense of all by en- 
forced. taxation, as provided for in the State University and 
secondary schools, but they need to be reminded that public 
higher education is not intended to benefit, exclusively, the . 
particular person receiving the training, but in a broader 
sense, it is for the good of the commonwealth. The State 
demands men of broad culture and industrial proficiency, 
just as the churches need men trained in the theology and 
history of their peculiar creed; and as the churches provide — 
means for the education of their sons and daughters, so 
should the State provide a way, accessible to all, for the 
higher education of its citizenship, not only in intellectual 
  development, but also in mechanical and industrial training. ~~ 
Our legislators in their, wisdom, realizing this, have made 
provision for the higher education of the people. They give 
our secondary schools. and State University a prominent - 
place in our system of public education. This important 
provision constitutes a second pillar of strength—a second 
element «of efficiency—to be judiciously guarded and 
strenethened. 
TRAINED TEACHERS. 
Tn any system of education at the expense of the State, 
the most important factor is the character of the teaching 
force. On the personal, individual work of the teacher, and 
on hig ability, rests the success of the common schools. He 
builds up by his earnest, well-directed efforts, or he pulls 
down and ‘destroys by incompetency or lack of training and 
experience. Upon him, as upon no other agency, hinges the 
welfare of the school. He does not have at his command 
the surroundings and appliances which so strengthen the 
work of the teachers in the higher institutions of learning, 
but he is the soul and surroundings and appliances. It is, 
then, a necessity, not to be lightly considered, that he be 
thoroughly and honestly prepared for his work. He must 
needs have professional training;and just as the public schools 
are not to be dispensed with, so are professional teachers 
to be put in charge of them. The State is under as much 
obligation to provide a way for the professional training of — 
‘the men and the women who undertake the work of public |
-P-A-G-E-276
    ea ear 
education, as it is under obligation to provide a fund from 
which their salaries are to be paid. 
This necessity for competent, well-trained, professional in- 
structors has been realized by our legislators, and, in a 
measure, wisely met by the provision authorizing the estab- 
lishment of a normal school or schools by the State Board 
of Education, and by the appropriation of $20,000 per year 
to the Peabody Normal College to make effective this pro- 
vision, as well as by the appropriation of $3,000 per annum 
for the normal education of children of Tennessee of African 
descent, and the further appropriation of $1,500 per annum ~ 
to aid in establishing and maintaining State institutes where 
teachers may receive instruction in the texts required to be 
taught, as well as in professional training. This legislation 
should meet the hearty approval of the friends of our pub-— 
lic schools, and must be considered as a third element of 
strength. Money judiciously used in training teachers should 
be encouraged. In no other way is it possible to expend it _ 
more wisely; in no other way can better results be secured. ; 
INSTITUTE LEGISLATION. 
As to the method of making the appropriation, it may not 
be out of place to say in this connection that we should have 
some specific institute legislation. The amount necessary 
to continue from year to year the State summer training 
schools should he determined by the State Board of Educa- 
tion. This Board should have authority to set aside, for in- 
stitute purposes, such funds from the interest of the per- 
manent school fund as should be found necessary to enable 
the State Superintendent to organize. institutes which 
shall be productive of the greatest good to the greatest num- 
ber, said funds to be expended (as tnder present regula- 
tions) under the personal direction and supervision of the 
State Superintendent. The growth of institutes for teachers 
in the past few years is a most encouraging feature of 
public school work. With wise institute legislation, now so 
much needed, they will be strengthened, and another ele- 
ment of efficiency will be added to the great system of pub- : Coe ‘ lic education in Tennessee.

TEACHERS’ TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
Under authority of the State Board of Education, the 
Peabody Normal College issues certificates and diplomas 
to graduates which are equivalent to teachers’ ‘cer- 
tificates, and which exempt the holders from further exami- 
nation. This college,.so recognized by the State board, and” 
to which the State makes an annual appropriation, is the 
only institution in the State so favored. It is the one State © 
normal in Tennessee, a State with a school population of — 
721,000, and a teaching force numbering nearly 9,000. : 
The State University is supported, in the main, by funds 
collected from the taxpayers, but which is the legal interest 
on, bona fide obligations. instead of a voluntary appropria- 
tion, as is the case with the Peabody Normal. q 
Other and progressive States support more than one State © 
normal each. Massachusetts, in 1895, with 12,000 teachers, 
supported six normal schools, at a cost of more than $125,- 
000 per annum, and one normal art school, for which an 
annual appropriation of nearly $20,000 was made. * 
Connecticut, with a teaching force of nearly 4,000, pro- 
vides for three normal schools. New Jersey, with 5,500 
teachers, supports one normal school, but appropriates there- 
for $32,000-per year. New York has established ten State 
normals, which cost more than $325,000 per annum, 
That these States have efficient public school systems 
is evinced by the fact that the per cent of attendance in 
Massachusetts is 92, in Connecticut 80, in New Jersey 78, 
and in New York more than 70. From their experience may 
we not gain a lesson? : 
Tennessee, as above stated, has one normal college to, 
which, the State makes an annual appropriation. Chancellor 
Payne reports for 1895, 528 students enrolled, of which num- 
ber 243 were registered from Tennessee. At the commence- 
ment in 1895, forty-three from Tennessee were graduated 
with the degree of Licentiate of Instruction. : 
The majority of the ‘I'ennessee students, outside the 
holders of scholarships, enter from the middle division of 
the State. That the college is doing good work is proved 
by the hearty and enthusiastic support of each succeeding 
Legislature. ‘Then, the question arises, “If one normal
-P-A-G-E-278
    — 281 — 
school is good, why not support other training schools?” 
when it is clear that others are needed. 
The next Legislature, to strengthen in a very material way 
the public school system, should establish and provide for 
the maintenance of two additional teachers’ training schools, 
one in the Heastern division, the other in the Western divis- 
jon. These schools should be required to do as thorough 
work for the degrees conferred as the Peabody Normal, and 
should enjoy equal honors and privileges. In the light of 
the experience of other States, $40,000 per annum should 
be used in Tennessee in better preparing teachers for the 
work of public education. A wiser expenditure in the inter- 
ests of the common schools could not be suggested. 
COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
The report of the State Superintendent for 1895 shows 
there are in Tennessee 7,568 district schools in 2,984 dis- 
tricts, and 131 city schools, all taught by 8,590 teachers. To 
combine in one grand whole, to systematize the work of the 
schools, makes imperative a wise, strong superintendency, a 
superintendency that will come in personal contact with each 
teacher, that will know of the condition of each school in 
the State. This army of 8,590 teachers, to do the most. ef- 
fective service, must be officered by men of ability and profes- 
sional experience. Hence it is that no office was ever cre- 
ated touching more closely the welfare of the people than 
that of County Superintendent of Schools, supervising as he 
must those who have in charge the earlier training of the 
children. 
As the usefulness of the schools is measured by the ability 
of the teachers, so the efficiency of our system of public in- 
struction is measured by the wisdom and energy and interest 
of the County Superintendents. They must, because of their 
position, be the leaders in their respective counties, and it is 
- well io have a leader in each county. It has worked well 
in the past, and as more and more is required of them, as a 
higher grade of professional and executive ability is de- 
manded, as they are given more clearly defined authority, as 
they are paid salaries more commensurate with the import- 
ance of the work assigned them, it will be known that they 
constitute the advance guard of better schools, that they are     
-P-A-G-E-279
— 282 — 
one of the most important pillars of strength in our State 
educational structure. 
THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT. 
The position of State Superintendent is one of greatest 
responsibility in our system of public education, and in keep- 
ing with views heretofore expressed, as to the best mode of 
strengthening and reforming our school laws, it is contended 
that the State Superintendent should be g   
iven more clearly 
defined and enlarged authority, and, more important. still, | 
he should be clothed with power to carry into execution his 
plans, to perform in a satisfactory manner the duties required’ 
of him by law, the schools will respond more readily to his _ 
suggestions than to the demands of other school officials. Te 
should be sade the head of a great department, the most 
important perhaps to which the attention of legislators is 
called, rather than be confined, in the main, to clerical du- 
ties, as is now the case. It should be his duty to supervise, 
to plan progressive movements, to educate in a general way 
the people as to the necessities of State education. He 
should not be hindered in his work by lack of clerical force, 
or rendered helpless by insufficient appropriation to meet the | 
legitimate expenses of his department. That the efficiency 
of this department has been crippled by too rigid economy is 
known to those who are familiar with the requirements of — 
the office. 
Tt is the duty of the State Superintendent to make tours 
of inspection among the public schools throughout the 
State, vet no provision is made for the payment of the neces- 
sary expenses ‘of such inspection, to collect and disseminate 
statistical and other information relating to the public 
schools, to prepare and distribute blank forms for all returns 
required by law, or deemed by him necessary to be made by 
teachers, school’ officers and County Superintendents, and 
the appropriation made therefor is wholly inadequate. The 
strictest economy should be practiced in all departments of 
State government, but the retrenchment should not ‘begin. 
with the schools; and a too rigid economy will always prove 
disastrous. A few thousand dollars placed at the disposal of 
the State Superintendent, or put in the hands of the State 
Board of Education for the purpose of enlarging the work |

    Sa 
of the State department, and judiciously expended, will re- 
sult in vastly more good than will the same amount distrib- 
uted throughout the ninety-six counties, where its expendi- 
ture will not increase the average school term by more than 
a bare fraction of a day. f 
The importance of the Department of Public Instruction 
should be given due recognition, and every facility should be 
afforded the State Superintendent for the carrying into exe- 
cution of school laws wisely planned and enacted. 
Thus, I have in a brief outline enumerated some of the 
elements of efficiency which justify the wisdony of those who 
incorporated in our laws these provisions relating to the 
common schools of the State, and it may be encouraging to 
note that these strongholds are, in the main, the fundamental 
principles of the system upon which the superstructure 
rests. 
ELEMENTS OF WEAKNESS. 
T now turn, not with a spirit of criticism, but rather of 
reform, to the second division of my subject, and point out 
some of the elements of weakness. 
As was suggested in the beginning of this paper, the public 
schools represent a growth, a development, and as we con- 
tinue to grow and deyelop, new plans will have to be adopted 
to take the place of those which, in earlier periods, were 
found best suited to carry into effect the proposition to bring 
to every child an opportunity to enjoy a primary education. 
DISTRICTS AND DIRECTORS. 
Under the present law, ours is a district system—the dis- 
trict is the unit—and, not content with the existing number 
of independent units, the county courts have been empow- 
ered to create new school districts, until they now number, 
as above given, 2,984, an increase of 274 in two years. In 
these 2,984 school districts serve 8,952 directors. Thus it is 
seen that there are more directors than teachers. These di- 
rectors receive no compensation, and in many cases are 
elected not because of peculiar fitness for the position. When 
will creating of new districts, this multiplying of directors, 
end? We are now overburdened in this particular. No con-
-P-A-G-E-281
76 
certed action on their part is possible. As far as the adoption 
of books, the election of teachers, the purchase of supplies, 
is concerned, lack of system and confusion is the rule, rather 
than harmony and unity. Furthermore, with this multiplica-_ 
tion of districts, the grading of the schools, for which elab- 
orate preparation has been made by law, has no foundation 
upon. which to rest, and its practical application, so much 
needed ito strengthen the efficiency of the system, becomes 
an impossibility. 
The schools should be consolidated rather than multiplied, 
and the number of the districts and directors should decrease — 
rather! than increase. The growth of the system demands a 
change from the district as a unit to the county as a unit; 
to a centralization in the management and control of the pub- ~ 
lic schools, and the interest involved demand the change at 
the earliest day possible. And by centralization is meant> 
not the removing from the people the guidance and direc- 
tion of the educational interests, but bringing the schools 
nearer and more directly under their personal supervision. 
Centralization will result in placing the authority more in 
touch with the people, by a specific and concentrating grant- — 
ing of responsibility to reliable and competent officials. 
COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
Not content to merely point out this element of weakness, 
I beg to submit a plan to make possible the reform suggested. 
The district board of directors should be abolished, and civil 
and school districts should be made identical. Then in each 
school-district should be elected one director. The directors 
thus elected in the county should constitute a board of edn- 
cation, which should hold regular stated meetings, and 
should direct, manage and control the general educational 
interests of the county. The County Superintendent of 
Schools should be ea officio secretary of the County Board of 
Education and its executive officer. All local school matters 
should be attended to by the district directors. i 
The adoption of books, and the approval of school sup- 
plies should be made by the Board of Education, and all war- 
rants, other than for the contracted salaries of teachers, 
should be approved by the County Superintendent. 
. By way of DApeREnE I may add that the salaries of 
 
-P-A-G-E-282
  — 285 — , 
County Superintendents should be fixed by the County 
Board of Education, and paid by said board out of the gen- 
eral school fund. ) * 
PROTECTION OF SCHOOL FUND. 
Another element of weakness to which attention has been 
called by former State Superintendnts, as well as by,the pres- 
ent incumbent, is the very unbusiness-like method of collect- 
ing and disbursing the school fund. It is next to impossi- 
ble to obtain. from the County: Trustee absolutely correct 
statements, not because of carelessness or dishonesty, or lack 
of competency in many instances, but because of the very 
vague laws governing the care of such fund, laws that are 
construed to fit the peculiar views of the Trustee, or not 
construed at all, if he so wills. While other accounts must 
be subjected to strict auditing, not so with the school ac- 
counts; while exact and frequent reports must be made of 
other moneys collected, not so with the school moneys. That 
legislation is needed, is known to those who have given the 
subject any thought, and it is to be hoped that this associa- 
tion will urge the enactment of such laws as will protect 
the funds provided by taxation for the education of the 
children, and make it possible to know of the collection and 
disbursement of every cent of school money, that will make 
it impossible for a Trustee to default with the school fund 
the principal loser. It is much to be deplored that under 
exisiting regulations as to the protection of school moneys, 
such fund is always the first lost when a trustee fails to 
make settlement, or defaults.   CITY SCHOOL SUPERVISION. 
Another point to which your attention is called, is the 
“lack of sympathy existing hetween the city schools and the 
supervised by the State and County Su- 
- perintendents. The city schools should not lose their iden- 
tity or independence. They have special work and special 
supervision, and they should have, in the largest measure, 
a separate existence and a distinct management. But with     
  _ schools more closely 
  of their indépendence as a system, they should be brought 
   no surrender of the principles on which they are founded, or -
-P-A-G-E-283
— 286 — 
more closely in touch with the State schools proper, they 
should be kept more in touch with the State Department of 
Public Instruction, their Superintendents should be required 
to report more fully their condition and workings, they 
should become more closely identified with the system. This 
is mentioned not so much as an element of weaknsss, as to 
call attention to a fact that should not be overlooked by those 
who would centralize and systematize. 
UNIYORM EXAMINATIONS. 
A very large and influential body of educators favor ex- 
aminations for teacher’s certificates on questions prepared 
and sent out by the State Superintendent. Under the law, 
which provides that it shall be the duty of the State Super- 
intendent to prescribe the mode of examining and licensing 
school teachers and their necessary qualifications, they con- 
~ tend that no further legislation is necessary to require such 
examinations. While this claim is not disputed, other points 
must be taken into consideration. The average grades re- 
quired for teacher’s certificates are prescribed by the State 
Superintendent, but uniformity in examinations is not had, 
for the simple reason that each County Superintendent is a 
law unto himself in the preparation of the questions, as well 
as in the more important consideration of grading. It is true 
that these various standards of qualification set up by the 
County Superintendents are confusing and lacking in uni- 
formity, but we must not forget that uniform questions sent 
out by the State will not meet or solve the problem until a 
uniform system of grading can be required.’ 
The law recently passed, wisely providing for the exami- 
nation of candidates for county superintendency, was a step 
toward uniform examinations, by requiring that the exam- 
iners, the County Superintendents, should be men of more 
uniform qualifications and fitness for the work. But this is 
not sufficient, and the friends of State examinations should 
not insist on the carrying into execution of their plan until 
unti! they know that the experiment will not prove disastrous. 
While it is admitted that the examination of teachers is now 
conducted and regulated, with no provision for their recog- 
nition beyond the boundaries of counties in which the cer- 
tificates are issued, is not an element of efficiency or uniform-. 
   
-P-A-G-E-284
298) — 
ity, it must be contended that other important provisions 
must be made before this advance movement can be made. 
To lay well the foundation for uniformity in examinations, 
we must change from the district system to the county sys- 
tem, and have in each county in the State a board of ex- 
aminers, acting under the County Board of Education, and 
in conformity to the rules and regulations prescribed by the 
State Superintendent. To leave the matter entirely in the 
hands of the County Superintendent would make no notice- 
able improvement in the grade of teachers, as the final test 
would be left, as it is now, in the hands of one man, and to 
have the papers sent to the State department for final grad- 
ing is not to be taken into consideration. Another very im- 
portant point not to be overlooked, but which can be more 
easily provided for, is that the preparing and sending out 
of these questions would necessitate an additional appropria- 
tion, as well as an increase in the clerical force of the State 
department. :   
This question is being discussed more and more, and con- 
tinted discussion strengthens its demands, and it is safe to 
predict, with the proper response on the part of our Legis- 
Jatures, that in the course of a few years this change will be 
made to uniform examinations, a step which will wonder- 
fully improve the efficiency of our schools by improving the 
teaching force. 
“To secure uniformity, other reforms of minor importance 
‘demand consideration. Reports should be required nearer 
. the close of the school year; provision should be made for 
more professional reading on the part of the teachers, and 
this preparation should be considered in their examination; 
the authority of the County Superintendent should be en- 
larged and more clearly defined. But of these matters it is 
not necessary to speak in detail at this time. 
The aim of the friends of the common schools should be 
to combine in one grand, uniform, harmonious whole, a sys- 
tem of instruction having its birth because of the necessities 
and humanity of a free people. and growing because of their 
sympathy, loyalty, and support. 
No more important interests demand the consideration of 
the people than the welfare of the public schools, and around 
them should stand in united devotion the friends of intel-

fr WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION. 
Wednesday morning witnessed another large assembly in 
the schoo] hall. The session was opened with prayer, by Rev. 
Mr. Garth, after which the Association enjoyed a vocal selec- 
tion by the Garth trio. : 
“The School Director and his Influence” was presented by | 
Supt. J. H. Jackson, of Obion County. He placed the Di- 
rector among the important factors in our. educational sys- ~ 
tem and called attention to the fact that teachers should be 
selected with special reference to their fitness for the position 
to be filled, so as to make our schools more efficient. His re- 
port was as follows: 
THE SCHOOL DIRECTOR AND HIS INFLUENCE. 
Mr. President, Fellow Téachers, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
My subject not only embraces the public school directors, 
but all school boards, private schools, colleges and universi- 
ties; but it is my intention to devote most of my time to the 
public school directors.. This year we are to elect officers, 
from constable to President of United States, and in the po- 
litical excitement even school people are likely to forget one 
of the most important and far reaching, in its results, of any. 
of the offices in the gift of the people. It is in the power of 
the school board to say whether a community shall haye a- 
good and suitable building, good furniture and apparatus, 
good text-books, and good teachers, in fact, the public school 
directors have more power than any other school officers in 
Tennessee. The future of over seven hundred thousand chil- 
dren in Tennessee largely depends upon the selection of di-_ 
rectors in the August election. Tf possible every school di- 
rector should be educated, should have children of his own to 
educate, should be a broad and liberal man, a man who will 
not use the school system in the interest of sons, daugh- 
ters. uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces or cousins, when much 
better work could be secured from “outsiders.” I believe in 
local self-government and local talent; but local teachers _ 
showld not be used to the exclusion of better ones. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
  _ a8oes 
  school director is the only school officer in our State who 
does not receive a salary, yet many people blame him when 
they ought to encourage him, and praise him for his pa- 
triotic spirit, for his labor of love. 
In fifteen years every child who is now school age will he! b 
twenty-one years of age, and will have to take upon himself 
the responsibility of manhoood and womanhood. Directors 
should realize that they are directing a training: school for 
citizenship, and that the future of this grand old State 
depends largely upon the success of these training schools. 
Every person should take an interest in the selection of 
school directors and should give, after their. selection, him 
encouragement and hearty SE °

“Summer Institutes” was ably presented by Capt. S. A 
Mynders, of Jackson. He reviewed the history of Institutes,” 
and showed wherein they had been the means of improving 
the work of teachers and served in a great degree as a substi- 
tute for the State normal training schools. 
Capt. Mynders’ report in substance was as follows: 
The development and progress of institute instruction in 
Tennessee form a most cordial feature of our system. The 
institute has been the great popularizing medium for our 
public schools and their methods. While the State Teachers’ 
Association has originated our public school laws and nearly 
every amendment, it has been the duty of the institutes to 
put. them into operation. When our first law was enacted, 
it was unpopular. ‘The institutes going from county to coun- 
ty and district to district have taught them to the people. 
Following the popular institute came the institute of methods. 
_ Just emerged from the rear our home teachers were not 
A ‘trained for the work. It was either necessary to go abroad 
for teachers or encourage our home boys and girls by giving 
them a irial. We wisely selected the latter. So assembled in 
district and county institutes the teachers gave their expe- 
rience and each profited by what others had found out. 
The institutes have changed plans in keeping with the 
19
-P-A-G-E-287
— 290 — 
demands of our conditions. So following the institutes men- 
tioned, came those located at central points, where the best 
instructors were employed, and the subject of methods re- 
ceived special attention, and institute conductors were 
trained were trained to go home to the counties and teach 
what they had learned to others. 
Scholarship is the chief qualification of the teacher. While 
methods are neeessary, scholarship is more important. Even 
the primary teacher should have a high degree of scholar- 
ship. This is now demanded, and as ninety per cent of our 
teachers are not able to attend colleges and universities or 
even home schools; the institutes must supply the demand, 
so that the time has come for our institutes to establish 
courses of home study and the summer normal insti- 
tutes of four weeks must furnish opportunities for review and 
enlarging as well as methods, and above all other things 
must give the teachers higher ideas of their wor ‘ and thus 
encourage them. to higher preparation. 
Our State institutes this year so largely attended produced 
results, the benefits of which cannot be told. The influence 
is felt all over the State and teachers are studying and look- 
ing higher. Now let the counties put a similar plan into op; 
eration and let there be-a closer connection between State 
and county institutes. ~~ 
Compulsory attendance at institutes is not desirable. Make 
the institutes schools of instruction where the teachers can 
receive value for his time and money and teachers will at-. 
tend. : 2 
There must be some permanent plan for our institutes 
and the legislature should be urged to permanently provide 
for them. ; 
Supt. 8. G. Gilbreath opened the disci 
lowing valuable report: 
Six State and Peabody Institutes were conducted in 'Pen- 
nessee during the institute season just ended. At these in- 
stitutes from 1,100 to 1,200 teachers were in attendance. This» 
enrollment does not’ include visitors and visiting teachers, 
but represents the attendance of bona fide teachers. . 
State aid was rendered five county institutes, in which 
more than 500 teachers were enrolled. Thus we see the t in’ 
the summer training school, reported as assisted by State on with the fol-

Seka: 
funds, not less than 1,600 teachers received instruction in 
professional work and methods, as well as in the texts re- 
quired to be taught. 
These institutes were supported by the $1,500 State ap- 
propriation, the $1,200 appropriation from the Peabody 
fund, and more than $1,000 in the way of local support. : 
The State, at an expense of $1 per month, pays the tu- 
ition of these teachers. Because of the State aid, the Pea- 
body.appropriation is made, the local support is given. The 
State makes no appropriation which brings in. better returns, 
and the teachers should earnestly demand that this appro- 
priation be increased. 
The report on Summer Institutes was further diseussed by 
the folloiwng: J. C. Wright, Professor Muse, A. H. Wright, 
Wharton 8. ae C. i. Hayes, R. bb. McDonald, 8: A. 
Mynders, C. 8. Douglass, 8. G. Gilbreath, Frank M. Smith, 
A. H. tae of Arkansas, Thos. H. Paine and W. L. Wil- 
lingham. 
It was the unanimous sentiment of the Aseocltti on that 
the legislature should be urged not only to continue the usual 
appropriation for summer institutes, but that uncalculable 
good would result if the same were increased. 
Little Maude Mynders; four years of age, entertained. the 
teachers with a vocal solo, and was elected an honorary. mem- 
ber of the Association. if 
“The Influence of the Normal School in Education” was 
presented by Prof. J. A, Baber, of the Southern Normal Uni- 
versity, as follows: 
Mr. President, Fellow Teachers, Ladies and Gentlemen; 
I am pleased with the subject. assigned me by your com- 
mittee, because it is one in which I am especially interested. 
and further, because it is evident that it is recommending 
itself to the considération of the leading Clinker of this 
country.   
Considered in its onde sense, my ibicet would be two- 
fold, since there are two distinct classes of normal schools 
in this country; the State normal, so named because it-is of 
and for the State, and the Independent normal, so desig- 
nated because it exists without endowment, either public or 
private. I may call attention to the further difference that 
the term normal is applied differently, the Independent nor 
 
-P-A-G-E-289
— 292 — 
mal using it purely as descriptive of its methods, and the 
State normal using it to denote the end for which the insti- 
- tution exists, i. e., for the training of teachers. With no 
intentional disregard or depreciation of the great good 
wrought by these State institutions, with an honorable rec- 
ord of two centuries and a present investment of more mil- 
lions than years old, I am, under the circumstances, led to 
presume that my discussion should be confined wholly to that 
class of schools known as Independent normals, with also a 
proud history of less than half a century and a present numer- 
ical strength of more schools than the world has great cities 
and a greater and truer band of adherents than followed the 
ereat Alexander. However, let me here disclaim any inten- 
tion of making either defense or atonement for the spurious 
claims of many so-called Independent normals. The success 
of true normals in securing and retaining patronage has made 
the term a password to thousands not entitled to it, to whom 
it eventually becomes a sibboleth of defeat and shame instead. 
  of the shibboleth of success. Paraphrasing the dying words 
of Madame Roland, we exclaim, “O normalism, what impos- 
sibilities are committed in thy name!” 
The influence of the normal school might be either in the 
theory or the practice of educational pri inciples. While 
theory is beautiful and yaluable, if set to the music of ac- 
tion, yet a world of theories only would be “a dungeon hor- | 
rible or all sides round.” Indeed, there is enough theory in 
the world now to require a millennium for its best practice. 
‘IT am not here to proclaim that independent normalism has 
borne a distinguished part in originating educational theory. 
Tf has done little if aught in that direction. If we claim that 
the only true government is self-government, it is not new 
theory, we have only to step to the telephone of time and call ‘ 
for 169% and August Hermann Francke sends us the mes- 
sage, “Trust is the basis of self-government. ” If we claim 
that co-education is new, we have but to call for 1592 and 
John Amos Comenius responds, “Education aims at the de- 
velopment of the human being and to shut out any one from 
it is injustice.” But, hold on, “Father Comenius, while we 
have you at the *phone, we should like to question you furth- 
‘er, “What about the long years of Greek and the wee small 
arte of English in the college course?” Again the answer

_ «comes, “The mother tongue is of far more importance than 
Latin or Greek.” “What is owr greatest guide in methods?” ; 
and the answer comes, “Follow nature.” “Do you mow any- 
thing of object teaching?” “Read my ‘Orbis Pietus’” If- 
we desire a definition ‘of thoroughness we have but to ring up 
Jacotot, No. 1770, and the response comes promptly, “Thor- 
‘oughness is concentrated and applied enthusiasm.” All these 
answers I might explain are indicative of what we sometimes — 
call distinctively normal doctrine and they might be contin- 
ued through the catalogue of educational principles, if in- 
dependent normalism*has not enriched the world by new 
theories, what has it done? It claims to have done something 
in practice. The great need of the world to-day is executive 
power. The greatest failure of the world is the failure to 
live up to the best we know, ideals executed would be heayen ~ 
realized. 
“Unless above himself he can erect himself, 
How poor a thing is man.” 
And so it is that whatever of excellence independent nor- 
malism can lay claim to, lies within the practical. It claims 
little in the stoichiology of the science but much in its prac- . 
tical methodology. It has led in many reforms which it 
neither originated nor-caused. Its influence, I say with re- 
gret, has been greatly crippled by the lack of that recognition 
which the world gives only to money. I shall notice this in-_ 
fluence under three headings: First, in the management of 
schools; second, in the methods of the class room; and third, 
in reaching those who need education. 
1. in the management of schools.—Here the first great 
lesson. that the world needs is economy-—economy of time, . 
economy of energy, economy of means. Normal schools 
teach and practice and believe every other institution should 
teach and practice every phase of economy consistent with 
thrift and thoroughness, not only to enable thousands to be- 
come educated who could not otherwise do so, but also to 
inculcate into the next generation the greatest principle un- 
derlying individual business success and national prosperity. 
They teach economy of time by lengthening the scholastic 
year from eight or nine months to eleven, twelve or thirteen 
months, the scholastic week to six days, the scholastic day to 
 
-P-A-G-E-291
‘ waste energy of humanity. — 294 — 
the limit of each student’s physical and intellectual capacity, i 
and the scholastic hour to sixty of the brightest, happiest and. 
most intensely earnest minutes that can slip through the 
hand of time. They-teach economy of energy, which is but ~ 
time’s equivalent, not only by encouraging its highest exer-_ 
cise on the part of the pupil, but also by its intelligent and _ 
skillful application to a carefully selected subject matter. 
The philosopher has said there is enough energy in the little 
diamond-bosomed drop of water that hangs innocent on the 
modest spear of grass to destroy the life of the greatest animal. 
But I say that there is enough potential energy in a sin- 
gle human being, if properly applied, to turn the world over. 
That reform is yet to be born which will be worth as much 
to the world as the one that shall conserve and utilize the 
  Nations have been fields of mili+ 
a goddess from whose closed hands 
investigators have wrung scientific secrets, the great universe 
of thought is a book whose bound pages philosophers have 
been cutting with the knife of logic for centuries and have 
not yet passed the “introduction,” but yet the humanitarian 
who solves the problem of utilizing this great reservoir of 
waste energy shall he crowned king of men. Normal schools 
teach economy of means’ by cheapening the expense of living 
while in school. It costs a student nine hundred dollars to 
attend a year at Harvard, seven hundred at Yale, six hun- 
dred at Cornell or Amherst. The unendowed normal schools 
rival -the highly endowed universities in point of 
numbers mainly because they bring an education to people 
  tary conquest, nature i 
  
  of small means and because they popularize the practice of 
economy, In these points I believe the normal school is ex- 
- erting a great influence not only among the schools of the 
land but among the teeming, toiling masses. 
Again, normal schools are having great influence on both 
the pleasure and profit of school life, by substituting for the 
perfunctory work of coercive government the better and 
higher work of love. Independent normalism has planted 
the flower of joy on the rugged rocks of labor along the 
student’s pathway. I wish I might dwell longer on this point 
for [ helieve it to be the philosopher’s stone that turns every 
individual it touches into a golden success. 
2. In methods of the class room—lI shall speak first of 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
SS ags— 
methods of dealing with the pupil. It is a doctrine of inde- 
pendent normalism that the mission of the teacher is to ren- 
der himself useless to his pupils. This great law is true of all 
missionary forces in the world. he individual, the society, 
the political party, and even the Church of Christ will be 
useless when they have performed their mission. The mis- 
sion of the teacher is to make the pupil independent of him. 
The teacher and the pupil are two variables whose sum is a 
constant equal to a complete human unit. The one decreases 
as the other increases until the pupil becomes the complete 
unit; when the teacher becomes nought. That teacher, 
therefore, does best who gets most and best out of his pu- 
pils. He most quickly renders himself useless to his pupils 
because he soonest prepares them not to need him. A. state 
of independence of teacher and a state of preparation for life’s 
work are one. And beyond this point, confinement within™ 
the school room is hurtful, dogmas of school men to the con- 
trary notwithstanding. Now this great doctrine is parent of 
many deyices and methods of {he normal school room. The 
pupil goes forth to investigate a subject, he comes to class to 
report. His investigation should cover a broad field—his 
text, the library, his teacher, his friend, nature, the whole 
world, every where and every how. © His report is intended 
to cover three primary purposes:', First, the expression by 
him of what he has learned in the best form he can com- 
mand; secondly, correctness by classmates, seldom by teach-    
  er, of errors in observation and reasoning; thirdly, the ob- 
taining of direction and inspiration for further conquests. 
From this normal method of procedure arise many valuable 
results: First, the pupil does the reciting and not the teach- 
er; secondly, the pupil tells as the best possible evidence that 
he knows; thirdly, a high mental tension is Secured resulting 
in the greatest possible activity of muscle and nerve in both 
preparation and recitation, and securing a thoroughness: of 
investigation, breadth of knowledge and development of 
power entirely unknown under other circumstances; fourthly, 
daily, just and helpful grading which prevents cramming for 
examination and removes all incentives to theft and trickery; 
lastly, that puzzle of so many teachers, the enlisting and hold- 
| ing, through a period of fifty minutes of the undivided at- 
tention and participation of every student in a class of ‘thirty
-P-A-G-E-293
to fifty pupils, a kind of pedagogical “Coup @’ Btat” that 
every true teacher must master. ate 
T shall speak -secondly and briefly of the methods of deal- 
ing with the subject matter. In point of curriculum inde- 
pendent normals have been very much misunderstood. No 
one who comprehends the facts will claim that the curriculum 
of normal schools is as extensive as that of the great univer- 
sities. I mention three particulars in which these curricula 
differ: First, few if any normals have established post-grad- 
uate courses for original research and honorary degrees; sec- 
ondly, normals have dropped from their courses much of the 
matter that is of doubtful, or at best of purely culture value, 
claiming that importance has been given these studies not due — 
them and expensive to the studies of practical value and to 
usefulness in life; thirdly, they have attached more import- 
ance to studies of practical value, believing that after all that 
is the true culture which leads to the greatest usefulness in 
life. They believe their curriculum is sufficient to meet every 
demand of the age for a popular education, but they do not 
object to their graduates taking post-graduate courses in the 
great universities of the land. In these respects I believe - 
they have exerted a marked and salutary influence on the 
educational progress of the day. Normal schools do! not 
claim to be perfect; far from it. They are willing to bear 
their share of just criticism. They court investigation and 
believe great injustice has been done them through lack of it. 
When on the offensive. they attack only error as they see it, 
and do not men or institutions; and who is not opposed to 
error? Every true teacher should at all times be ready to 
pray, 
“Tf I am right thy grace impart, 
Still in the right to stay; 
If I am wrong, O teach my heart 
To find that better way.” 
3. In reaching those who need education.—Not the least 
‘among its claims to influence is the large share the nor- 
mal school has contributed toward making it possible for 
any industrious, ambitious young man or woman to acquite, - 
by personal effort, a liberal, practical education. With no 
fortune but will and no genius but energy; a have ex-

tended the paths and by-ways of learning to every enh and 
hamlet in the land. Like, angels of mercy they have gone 
out those by-ways to where the “slaye was delving in the 
nobler clod,” with the gospel of a higher life, and have said, 
“Stop, look up, yonder is a road, will you travel it? At the 
other end is a crown, will you wear it?” and God be praised 
for the countless multitudes who have trooped. their way 
from Egypt to Israel through the humble instrumenjalit of 
the normal school. ‘ 
  Dr. J. Wi. Kirkland, Chancellor of Vanderbilt ives. s 
opened the discussion on Professor Baber’s Reaper, making, the 
‘following points: 
The title “Normal” is an old and historic ones It comes 
from France, where it was first used to designate a peculiar 
kind of school having for its main purpose the training of 
teachers. The term has never been current in Germany, 
though the best types of such schools have flourished. there. 
’ Used in this sense the term is a legitimate one and has a dis-’ 
tinct meaning. “Independent normals’ have taken . this” 
term because they found it a popular one, and because it af- 
forded them a good name to conjure with. It is admitted 
by the leaders of this movement that they have discovered 
no new pedagogical principles, and yet the impression is 
made that they have a number of new methods and patent: 
appliances by which results impossible to others are easy for 
them. ‘The principles that are constantly advertised as pe- 
culiarly their own are the virtues that are as old as history 
and as universal as humanity, Diligence, enthusiasm, con- 
centration, perseverance, did not wait till the present cent- 
uty to he discovered or applied to school work. “Independ- 
ent normals” have no features. either of organization or of 
principles distinct enough to make a class worthy of special 
name or consideration. One cannot even criticise them as 
a class, for the shortcomings of one such school may be ab- 
     mal school, one might just as well say an x, y, z school. The 
objection to this procedure is that an unmeaning symbol is 
advertised as a guarantee of peculiar excellence. So far as 
‘one can judge from the published statements of institutions 
ealling themselves “independent normals,” these belong to 
‘that large class of schools that claim to have found a short 
        
  sent from another. Instead of saying an independent nor- -

      way to success. They 
und often add the title 
of college or wniversity to their otherwise pretentious names. | 
The degrees which ‘they give are conferred as the reward for 
courses of study which ought not to admit to the Freshman 
Class of a reputable college. Subjects which require a whole 
year to master are finished by them in a few weeks, and pu- 
pils aressent away with the idea that they are thoroughly 
educated, when, as a matter of fact, they have not acquired eut to an educational goal, an easy

  __ the first, principles. If the methods practised by such insti- 
“tutions are sound, then the whole educational world up to, 
~ the present time has been wrong. If the founders of “inde-- 
pendent normals” are right, then instead of hiding their 
light under a bushel, starting schools in frontier districts, 
they ought to be at the head of the great universities of the 
Jand, and in charge of all important educational positions 
that are created by church or State. 
‘A further discussion took place between Dr. Kirkland and 
President Baber as to the claims and practices of the Inde- 
pendent Normal, but President Baber said that, those who 
had really seen the work of the Independent Normal were 
better able to know the good accomplished, and that Dr. 
Kirkland was too severe in his criticisms, but the Chancellor — 
still plead for a thorough and careful development and prep- 
aration of the teacher. z 
Prof. R. Li. McDonald also spoke in the interest of thor- 
ough preparation of the teacher. 
Miss Macie Garth pleased the audience with a popular 
vocal selection, and then the Association adjourned until 2

      EXAMINATION AND PROMOTION OF PUPILS. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
} consider this an important question—one about which 
much has been said, and about which there are yet erroneous 
ideas. oth extremes have been reached. Those who be- 
lieve in examinations have gone so far as to pin their entire 
faith to them; have based promotions on them and nothing 
else. On the other hand, those who would avoid this evil, 
have gone so far as to contend that examinations are useless 
—that they prove nothing, and hence have discarded them. 
However, it is gratifying to learn that some very staid insti- 
tutions, that for a while discareded this old way of stimulat- 
ing students and testing their understanding of subjects, 
have found that it was not altogether a wrong way, and oth- 
ers, who considered examinations “all and in all,” have real- 
ized that they are only one factor to be considered in estimat- 
ing a pupil’s attainments. z 
The subject assigned me, the “Examination and Promo- 
tion of Pupils,’ may be considered in a dual sense—that 
is, either ‘examinations and promotions separately, or as one 
subject. If we consider examinations separately, I wish ‘to 
say that I consider it clearly demonstrated hy experience, ob- 
servation and common sense, that examinations may be made 
profitable servants of the teacher, if properly managed; or if 
improperly managed, may become her master, merely to vex, 
annoy, hinder and burden her. Such is the case when the 
teacher fails to promote a pupil whom she knows deserves 
promotion, simply because that pupil has failed to make the 
“required grade” on examination, or promotes one known to 
     
-P-A-G-E-297
— 300 — 
   
  be unworthy of it, who has made the “required grade” by 
dishonesty. 
Yn our country schools what we need is proper classifies’ 
tion. In the city schools, gradation. To classify, or to 
grade properly, the examination must be resorted to in some 
form or other, and the form should be in full accord with 
commen sense. The environment of the pupils—their past 
experience with examinations—their, training and lan- — 
" guage—-their age—should all be considered in determining 
the nature and severity of the test. The examination should 
be somewhat flexible—the ironclad nature of these exercises; — 
particularly in our graded schools, is what has brought them : 
into so much disrepute. I believe there should be (1) no per 
cent taken as an absolute deadline; (2) only about one-third 
the importance attached to results in making promotions that 
attach to recitations, effort, and the eacher’s judgment of — 
the pupil’s ability to advance; (3) business-like methods: in, 
conducting examinations and grading the papers. 
Kyery temptation to dishonesty should be removed, so far 
as possible, and in no offensive manner. ‘The questions and 
directions should be as clear and unequivocal as good Eng- 
lish can make them, and the time allotted to the subject 
should be amply sufficient to allow the voluntary phase of the 
memory to do its utmost, and the reasoning powers to come 
fully into play; especially with older pupils. Much of the ex- 
citement that we hear so much complaint of, is due to a 
lack of time. This complaint is frequently just. The mind 
has its ways of working—its laws by which it is governed, | 
and if we do not proceed in harmony with these, we need 
not expect satisfactory results. ‘The old adage, “Whatever is 
worth doing at all is worth doing well” applies to every phase — 
of school duty, and to the one under consideration as forcibly 
as any. I have been astonished, sometimes, to hear a school 
officer engaged in examining teachers for license, with per- 
haps half a summer vacation before him, make the. announce- : ; 
ment, “Only forty minutes for ; we must get: through — 
to-day.” Yet I was less amazed than some of the candidates 
themselves, when, on the following day their miserably low 
grades were made known. No wonder such examiners, and 
those examined in such a way, come to the conclusion that 
examinations do not prove anything—that they are ooey a 
test. ‘ 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-298

He who arranges the schedule of an examination should 
possess both a head and a heart. Without the exercise of 
good sense and sympathy, great injustice may be done. Not 
only are the “lightning caleulator” methods of examining 
children comparatively worthless, as tests of scholarship with 
a view to promotion, but by overtasing the energies, are liable 
to result in permanent injury to the mental powers. We 
should remember that it is only appropriate exercise that 
strengthens mental faculties, and not simply exercise of any 
sort, as some seem to imagine. 
Examinations stimulate pupils to better efforts, But you — 
ask, Do pupils need such a stimulant? T answer, They do; 
if the stimulant is applied with moderation. The mental 
appetite is not analogous to the physical appetite—children 
never fail to relish bread and butter, pies and puddings, 
chocolate and caramels, beef steak and chicken. So far as 
mental diet is concerned, in many instances the child has no 
such longings, and must be induced to eat until an appe- 
tite is created. Studying for examinations, not the night be- 
fore, but for weeks and months before, will often enable pu- 
pils to taste sufficiently of the sweets of knowledge to be- 
come fond of them. When the process of preparation ex- 
tends over a long period, it is not the “cramming process” 
harped upon by the opponents of examinations. xe 
But is an examination a test of scholarship? Yes. An 
absolute test? No. :Does it always do justice to the party? 
No. But what can you substitute for it? We have nothing 
that is absolute. Our established theories in science, in phil- 
osophy, even in imathematies, are frequently overturned. 
Then why should we condemn examinations because they are 
not absolutely satisfactory? It is true that there are just a few. 
who do not “do themselves justice,” owing to excitement, but 
where the examinations are properly conducted, this number 
is exceedingly small: If the announcement of an’ examina- 
tion produces a panic among the pupils, it is because the 
teacher has caused the pupils to look upon the examination 
from a wrong standpoint. He has made it a shibboleth of pro- 
motion. They understand that their heads muct come. off 
if they do not’ make the “required grade.” 
Furthermore, examinations are not only tests for the pu- ’ 
pils’ but tests for the teacher. She needs a standard by which 
 
-P-A-G-E-299
. — 302 — 
she may measure herself occasionally. She needs to know 
  the quality and quantity of her success. I have never yet 
had a series of examinations that did not reveal some mis- 
take or weakness in my teaching. We may have taught thor-_ 
oughly (as we think)—explained everything so clearly (to our’ 
own minds).                            e (?) for misunderstand- 
ing, and_yet have made (or shall I say left?) some very er- 
roneous impressions. If you, my fellow teachers, have not 
had an examination, and doubt my statements, try one. Then    
  write to me about the result. I do not remember teaching © 
my sixth grade that the “Rhine rises in Holland, flows south 
through France, and empties into the Mediterranean Sea,” 
or that the Celts occupied a group of islands east of Asia; 
or the fifth grade that “clouds are colored air;’ the fourth 
grade that “the Rocky Mountains flow south and empty into 
the Gulf of Mexico;” or the eighth grade that the ocean cur- 
  - vents are caused by the water running ‘down hill’ from the 
equator toward the poles.” Yet I found all these and other 
astonishing answers in what 1 confidently believe was an 
excellent lot of papers. Some of these mistakes—in fact 
most of them—:were made by good pupils, and were not al- 
together slips of the pencil; but wrong impressions which 
they had received from what I meant to be right teaching. 
But why not em ploy oral examinations instead of the writ- 
    ten ones. to which I have referred in all I haye said above?” 
Because oral examinations are better for show than for test. 
When a person can write a thing correctly—especially if it is 
done in his own language—it is evidence that he knows it. 
Oral examinations very frequently lead pupils to overestimate 
their requirements, even though the tests are searching. 
Written examinations give to every pupil the same test, so 
‘that no one may console himself with the thought that he 
has missed only the questions that others would have missed, 
and could have answered the questions which they answered.    
  Some of our teachers are very fond of explaining things—_~ 
in fact. they do little else than explain. No time for exami- 
nations. No time for written work. In fact, examinations 
in their schools are unnecessary. Let them try one, and see 
if they do not have their eyes opened. Sy 
However, I suppose it is necessary to say there are some 
  examinations which cannot be written—as tests of power or 
=

skill—which must be expressed by the voice, as in ‘reading or 
singing. 
‘lo remedy the evils which have attended our examina- 
tions, it would be well for teachers to quit giving lists of 
“probable questions,” for this rule leads to what is known as 
_the cramming process. To quit requiring so many dates in 
history, and more of cause and effect. To have no compe- 
tition between classes or schools for the highest average. ‘T'o 
ask such questions as will cause the pupil to think, and not 
merely to remember. To stop rating pupils on a public bul- 
letin. To give the recitation record and the judgment of the 
teacher two or three times as much value as the per cents 
made on examination. These, with. the suggestions made 
above—if adopted-—would cure most of the evils of our ex- 
aminations, and promotions. made accordingly, would be 
natural and would remove much of the ‘machine work” 
which is grinding the life-out of what ought to be our best 
schools. : 
Prof. R. E. Geldsby opened the discussion, placing more 
importance upon recitations than examinations, and he set a 
lively pace for those who followed in the discussion, he un- 
doubtedly demonstrated the fact that he had due. considera- 
F tion for pupils and understood their interests. :

On motion of the Secretary the Executive Committee was 
requested to report favorably, accepting the invitations. 
Dr. J. H. Kirkland placed the use of the Chapel and 
other apartments of Vanderbilt University at the disposal of 
the Association in which to hold its meetings. 
A vote of thanks was extended Dr. Kirkland and the-mat- 
ter was referred to the Executive Committee with instruc- 
tions to accept the kind invitation of Dr. Kirkland, the sen- 
timent of the Association being absolutely unanimous in 
favor of holding the next meeting in Nashville. 
A letter from Maj. J. W. Thomas, President of the Ten- 
nessee Centennial, was read, expressing his regret at being 
unable to accept the invitation to be present at the meeting, 
which invitation he most highly appreciated. 
Music—A song by the Garth trio, “Some Day, Some

“Should the Course of Study for the Public Schools be 
Revised?” was made the subject of a verbal report by Supt. 
Thos. H. Paine, of Jackson, who said he would not advise any 
change but would suggest that if a change was to be made, 
he would favir substituting literature for the elements of 
agriculture and introducing something else in the place of 
bookkeeping. : 
In the discussion which followed it was clearly demon- 
strated that the Association was not in favor of eliminating 
either the study of agriculture or bookkeeping from the

   in which to entertain the Association, so Wednesday evening 
was set aside for that purpose. 
The exercises were held in the same hall and consisted of 
a well rendered programme of charming vocal and instru- 
mental selections and enjoyable recitations and readings by 
the local talent, interspersed with a cordial exchange of greet- — 
ings between the members of the Association and the local 
educators and citizens. j 
After the exercise had been finished, a large number of 
members as well as citizens adjourned to the ice cream lawn 
festival, given by the ladies of the Cumberland Presbyte- 
rian Church, thereby giving an additional opportunity for. 
the members to become better acquainted with the people of e 
Humboldt, and thus closed a most pleasant evening, which 
will long be remembered by the members present. 
THURSDAY MORNING SESSION. 
The last session of the Association was opened at 9 o’clock - 
with Scripture reading and prayer, by President McGee. 
Little Miss Mynders sang, “Kiss Me Quick,’ which de- 
lighted the entire audience. 
“The Elements of Weakness and Efficiency in our Public 
School System” was the subject of a strong paper by State 
Superintendent S. G. Gilbreath, and the Association passed 
a resolution requesting the same should be published by the 
Press of the State. The paper was as follows:

REPORT OF CENTENNIAL COMMITTEE. 
The Committee appointed last year to represent this Asso- 
ciation at the Atlanta Exposition, and also in connection 
with the Tennessee Centennial Exposition made the follow- 
ing report: 
We, your Centennial Committee, would report as follows: 
Soon after the adjournment of this Association at Frank- 
lin, a correspondence was opened with the Exposition author- 
ities at Atlanta, and your Committee only received eight 
days’ notice of the date set apart as Educational Day. 
This did not give sufficient time to give the teachers of 
the State sufficient notice, but Supt. S. G. Gilbreath, as State 
Superintendent and in behalf of the Committee, at once is- 
sued and distributed the following letter: 
‘ Nashville, Tenn., Oct. 19, 1895. 
To Tennessee State Officials: 
The Directors of the Cotton States and Tniatauinal Ex- 
position have set apart October 28-31, inclusive, as Educa- 
tional Week. An interesting programme has been arranged, 
and the instructors and students in the schools, colleges and 
universities of our State should attend. — 
At the Tennessee State Teachers’ Association, held in 
Franklin, the following resolution was unanimously adopted: 
“Resolved, That we ask that a week be set apart to attend 
the Educational Congress at the Cotton States and Inter- 
national Exposition, and that we recommend that the State 
Superintendent of Public Instruction invite all Boards of 
Education and school officers to grant a vacation of one week 
to enable the teachers, school officers and students, without 
loss of salary to teachers, to be announced by the State Su- 
_ perintendent of Public Instruction.” 
In accordance with above resolution, and at request of 
Ex-Goy. W. J. Northern, Chief Department Education, T set 
apart the week beginning Friday, October 25th, for the pur-
-P-A-G-E-305
oy 308 shag 
pose above indicated, and respectfully urge all school officials 
of Tennessee to grant to teachers said week to attend the Ed. 
ucational Congress. 
It is much to be regretted that announcement. of Ane 
_ meeting was not made sooner by the Exposition authorities. 
We irust that this notice will be given publicity without de- 
lay, and that Tennessee will be largely represented at the : 
Exposition during the week above named. Very truly, 
8. G. GILBREATH, . 
State Superintendent. 
No concerted action could be expected on such short no- 
      
  tice, and the only hope of the Committee and the State Su- — 
perintendent in sending out the foregoing letter was to en- 
courage individuals to visit the Atlanta Exposition, with the 
hope. that they would become more interested in their own | 
Centennial Exposition. 
The Public School Officers’ Association, however, ad- 
journed one of its sessions so as to attend the Exposition, and. 
a large per cent of its members attended, among the number. 
your enterprising City Superintendent. : 
The Tennessee Centennial has also been duly considered 
by your Committee, and we haye been in touch with the Cen- 
tennial officials, especially with W. T. Davis, Chief of the 
Children’s Department, who has shown great interest in our 
work and accorded proper representation, and in fact your 
Committee feels that through the Children’s Department 
- 
and its officials, we are to expect the most valuable recogni- — 
tion and satisfactory results.

Report of Committee on Resolutions was read as follows, ! 
and unanimously adopted, as follows: 
Resolved, 1. That the State Teachers’ Association recog- 
nizes the great value of the Centennial Exposition as an edu- 
cational factor, and believes that its greatest value as an. ob- 
ject-lesson in progress and patriotism will be its influence 
oe the minds and hearts of the children of our State. 
_ That we believe the work of W. T. Davis, Chief of the 
Children’s Department, has been very largely instrumental —
-P-A-G-E-306
— 309 oie 
in developing a general interest-in the Centennial movement 
and especially in preparing the way for a creditable educa- 
tional exhibit. ‘ 
3. That we regret that the Centennial authorities have 
thought best to discontinue the work of Chief Davis, and we 
urge them to reconsider this action. We think the work of 
sufficient importance to demand the constant supervision of 
a wide-awake, intelligent chief, and that otherwise the 
Children’s Department and the educational interests of the 
State will suffer. 
Resolved, That the thanks of this Association are hereby 
tendered to Supt. F. K. Henderson and those associated with ™ 
him as members of the “Committee on Arrangements and 
Reception” for the kind and courteous manner in which they 
have ministered\to our pleasure and conyenience. 
We appreciate the fact that to the earnest efforts of this 
Committee is largely due the success of this meeting, and we 
are glad to make this expression of our gratitude. . 
Resolved, by the Tennessee State Teachers’ Association; 
That we recognize in State Superintendent S. G. Gilbreath an 
earnest, efficient and trustworthy official and that we indorse — 
his administration as progressive, and decidedly favorable to 
the advancement of our public school system. 
Resolved, That we renew our recommendations in fae 
to the Tennessee Centennial, passed at our meeting at 
Franklin in 1895, and continue the committee appointed at 
that time, with the, State Saeed as chairman ex 
officio. 
Resolved, That we sider the Tennessee School. Journal, 
published by Prof. A. C. Minter, of Nashville, Tenn., and 
authorize the officers of this Association to use it as an cient 
organ, provided the same can be done without expense to this 
Association. 
Whereas, the State and Peabody Institutes, held in the 
different sections of the State, have proven to he exceed- 
"ingly helpful to the teachers. They have justified by the 
  great work done in them, the wisdom of the State Super- 
intendent in establishing them. By their means the great 
body of teachers, who through lack of funds are unable to 
attend professional training schools, have the opportunity of 
increasing their efficiency as teachers.

During the last year the appropriation of $1,500, paid for 
the instruction and the training of 1,500 teachers for one 
month; therefore be it 
Resolved, That the State Teachers’ Association respectfully 
urge upon the legislature an ample appropriation for the : 
further maintenance for these institutes. 
Resolve, That we give expression of our indebtedness and 
gratitude to the young ladies who favored the Association 
with their appropriate and well rendered recitations, to the 
Musical Committee for the rare treat given, the effects of 
whose sweet strains will long linger as a comforting and 
gladdening reality in the lives and hearts of the teachers, 
and the people of Humboldt for their hearty welcome, their 
hospitable treatment and their manifest appreciation of the 
efforts put forth by the members of the Association. 
Teselved, That our thanks are due our President, Capt. G.- 
R. McGee for the able and impartial manner in which he 
has presided over our deliberations, and to Prof. Frank 
. Goodman for his efficient services as secretary.

  ADDRESS OF WELCOME, 
4 
HON. T. F. P. ALLISON, 
Maj. Allison.—Ladies and Gentlemen of the Public School 
Officers’ Association:—I am very sorry that Gov. Turney is 
not here to-day to welcome you in such a manner as he 
would if we were here. I have been somewhat of an educator 
‘myself for the last few years, but not exactly in your line. 
I have been in the Agricultural Department of this State, and 
have been trying for some time to educate the farmers into 
their duties and their interests, and I want to say to you to- 
day that you can do a great deal of good in your capacity in 
helping the Commissioner of Agriculture to benefit the farm- 
ers of the State of Tennessee. You are the educators of Ten- 
nessee and its prosperity in the future depends, in a great 
measire, upon you, and I might say here I hope you will take 
into consideration to-day the question of agriculture in your 
common schools. I think a great deal depends upon it; why 
we should keep the farmers at home, and why the farm 
should be made more pleasant to keep the farmer boys at 
home, at their own firesides and their own homes. The edu- 
cators of Tennessee can do a great deal in that line to make 
the farmers interested... Make these branches studies in school, 
teach them the science of agriculture in the common schools, 
that they may be learned on that question in the future. I 
have been trying to do that at the Agricultural College at 
Knoxville and to establish other experimental stations. I 
have been aiming for severel years to get an experimental 
station in Middle and West Tennessee, which, I think, 
would be of great advantage to the State. ; 
I frequently get letters from foreign states, and they have 
always asked about the public schools, and I am always proud 
to speak of the public schools of Tennessee, and tell . their 
steady TD EOY, ement.
-P-A-G-E-317
— 320 — 
On behalf of the city of Nashville, this being the capital, ~ 
1 extend to you a welcome to the city. The doors of the 
capital are thrown open to you, and I hope you will have 
pleasant entertainment while you are in the city. xe 
The President.—I now introduce to you Prof. A. J. Bran- 
don, who will deliver the response to the address of welcome. 
Prof. Brandon.—I esteem it quite a privilege ‘this morning 
te have the pleasure of responding to the address of welcome, | 
which you have just heard. The greetings that have come 
from the teachers already, have given us a double assurance    
  % 
<a 
  of our welcome to this city. Nashville is noted for its hospi- Q 
tality, and has been demonstrated by the entertainment of — 
her visitors, in the past. It gives me great pleasure indeed to 
ineet this body of teachers, where we can interchange views 
relative:to school work that may prove of great benefit to us _ 
when we return. to our respective duties. We assemble here 
this morning in the capitol of this our great capital city, and 
we realize that Nashville is not only the center of the educa- 
tional interests of this State. but “the Athens of the South.” i 
With all of the wonderful resources of our State, with her 
manufacturing interests with their smoke stacks like a mighty ~ 
  forest pointing heavenward, with the hum of the spindles of 
industry and the roar of the wheels of progress, and we begin 
to be impressed with the responsibility resting upon us as 
educators, with the fact that the masses must he educated, 
in order to enable the people to be expert in their respective 
lines of business. 
When Napoleon had drawn up his soldiers in the shadow 
-of the great pyramids he said, “Men, remember that forty 
centuries are looking down upon you.” This morning these 
teachers should remember that the great educational work of - 
the past is looking down upon us and urging us forward in 
order that we may put our public schools on.a higher plane. 
When I realize the responsibility of the teacher, I almost 
shrink from its duties. When we work on immortal souls ax 
and human destinies, how greatly we should feel, and how ° ie 
greatly-we should realize the responsibility that we have as- 
sumed. : 
This morning I am glad to realize the fact that Nashville 
has shown her pluck and her enterprise in carrying forward 
the great Centennial Exposition that we are, to have next 
.
-P-A-G-E-318
  — 321 — 
year, in the face of the opposition, and in the teeth of the 
hard times. She has gone pluckily forward, and despite the 
opposition and the sneers of others they have out here on the 
Centennial grounds, buildings as monuments of her energy 
and enterprise, and I hope before this meeting shall have - 
closed that the Centennial interests in the public school line 
shall have had favorable recommendations at your hands, and 
T believe you will do something to forward the interest on all 
educational lines by giving all the consideration possible to 
the public school work of this State. Here, as we stand to- 
day in the proudest period of American civilization and in 
one of the greatest responsibility, marvellous have been the 
achievements of the past, but still more marvellous will be 
the achievements of the future, in educational lines. Let us 
take adyantage of these opportunities to forward the interests 
and welfare of our public schools, and take advantage of 
every opportunity as it comes. Let us unite our heads, our 
hearts, our hands in this great work, and march grandly down 
the pathway of progress, fostering the interests of our public 
schools. We can do it, we must do it; let us put our should- 
ers to the wheel and move forward the great vehicle of the 
public school. I feel sure that when this grand body shall 
have concluded its labors, we will return to our respective 
homes and charges with a feeling of inspiration, resolved to, 
do better work during the coming year. (Applause.) 
PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS. 
From its constitution I find the object of the Public School 
provement of its members,” the other, “The development of 
a satisfactory and efficient system of public schools for the 
State;” hence I deem it my duty, as president, to make sug- 
Officers’ Association to be two fold, one, “The mutual im- 
gestions that seem to me most likely to promote these objects. 
In this, our tenth annual meeting, it behooves us to ask 
what we have accomplished in this direction? 
Great has been the enjoyment of our meetings, and, by so- 
cial intercourse and exchange of methods, much mutual im- 
provement has resulted. But, have we accomplished what we 
- should in “the development of a satisfactory and efficient sys- 
~ tem of public. schools?” 
Have we, as a body, accomplished what our name and offi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-319
— 322 — 
cial position demand? Have we made ourselves enough felt 
as a power for reform? Has not our work been too general 
for best results? Has not our attendance been too small for 
the best influences? 
Ought not each session to have some definite work to ac- 
complish? Ought not each meeting to have double its actual 
attendance?. What has prevented the attendance of our su- 
perintendents? Has it been from insufficient pay; from a 
want of recognition here, or from their want of individual in- 
terest? 
These statements are made, not with a spirit of criticism, 
but from the fact that I believe a president’s address should 
deal with real issues, instead of soaring oratory, or lauding 
generalities. 
If by a practical view of existing conditions thereby deduc- 
ing inferences and making suggestions, | can bring’ about ace 
tion that shall accomplish needed reforms, | shall feel my zeal 
wisely directed and my services amply compensated. 
Let us give all due praise to the much good legislation that 
has already been enacted, and, without consuming time in 
idle boasting, devote every possible moment of this meeting 
to a thorough searching out. of neglected needs and ees | 
their remedies. : 
In the march of progress our Tennessee lawmakers find 
the constitution prepared by our solons twenty and six years 
ago, insufficient for the requirements of the present; so, with 
due acknowledgment of the efficiency of our public school — 
system, when adopted twenty odd years ago, we can but re- 
alize its weakness for our present demands. 
As the acknowledged leaders in public school ranks it be- 
hooves us to take the first action in regard to a thorough re- 
vision of her laws and a complete exposition of her needs. © 
Your programme for this meeting was prepared from a 
conviction of these views, hence made completely on needed 
school legislation. - 
So now let us have a thorough discussion of each com-_ 
mittee’s preséntation, and from thorough inspection and care- 
ful consideration determine upon the reforms most needed 
for the improvement of our schools. Let us put our wants in | 
some definite form and have them presented, with all the 
stress possible, to our incoming legislature for action. ; y: 
   
-P-A-G-E-320
  — 323 — 
Then, if we will add our individual influence to these con- 
certed demands we most assuredly can secure favorable legis- 
lation. 
Let us steer clear of all hobbies and foster thought in our 
deliberations that will prove a credit to the name we bear 
and the positions we fill. 
Let us demand such a revision of our existing public school 
laws as will secure the greatest good, with the least possible 
- disturbance to existing conditions. 
The following changes, outlined by a prominent commit- 
tee at our last annual meeting, have many valuable sugges- 
tions and undoubtedly demand consideration. We have out- 
lined the matter, and recommended that a committee be ap- 
pointed to take this matter under consideration, to be re- 
ported at our next meeting. 
1. To make school and civil districts co-extensive. 
2. That one director be elected from each district. 
3. That directors constitute a County Board of Education. 
4. That the County Board of Education appoint a board of 
three examiners, of which the County Superintendent shall 
be chairman. ~ ‘ 
5. That the County Superintendent of schools shall act as 
Secretary and Treasurer of the Board of Education. 
6. That the County Board of Education shall meet semi- 
annually for the transaction of business, and at such other 
times as the chairman of the County Board of Education shall 
deem necessary; each member to be allowed $1 for each of 
the semi-annual meetings. 
Y. District Directors shall select teachers for their respec- 
tive districts, subject to ¢onfirmation or rejection by the 
County Superintendent, and attend to the local affairs of the 
district. \ 
8. The County Superintendent shall have general super- 
vision over the schools of the county, and attended to such 
other business as the duties of the office may require. 
9. His term of office shall be four years. 
10, His compensation shall be fixed by the County Board 
of Education, and paid out of the school fund. . 
11. He may be removed from office for misconduct or in- 
efficiency. 
12. The Board of Examiners shall examine and license all 
teachers, and hold all other examinations required by law. :
-P-A-G-E-321
— 324— 
18. Applicants for license to teach will pay the County 
Board of Examiners $1 for each examination. 
14. Members of the Board of Examiners, except the Coun- 
ty Superintendent, shall be paid $2 each per day for time ac- 
tually employed in the examination and licensing of teachers, 
out of examination fees. 
15. That the remaining fees be used in the support of Coun- 
ty Teachers’ Institutes. 
We recommend that a committee of five, of which the State « 
Superintendent shall be ex officio chairman, be appointed to 
take matters into further consideration and report upon 
them at our next meeting.

16. Accepted amendment: 
‘That the State Superintendent of Public Instruction pre- 
. pare examinations for teachers offering for candidates to teach 
in the public schools of the State, and that these examinations 
be held upon the same day throughout the State. 
17. I would:add as 17th: 
That. certificates issued upon examination to candidates for. 
County Superintendent of Public Instruction be designated 
First, Second, and, if necessary, Third Grade, according to 
the percentage of their attainment. 
With these points as a nucleus and the valuable papers we 
shall have presented at this meeting as an amplifying and an 
outlining source, I now submit everything to your considera-

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SECONDARY 
f SCHOOLS, DECEMBER, 1896. 
To the President and Members of the Tennessee Public School 
Officers’ Association: : 
Your Committee on Secondary Schools respectfully report 
as follows: 
1. We regard the primary schools as the foundation of the 
public school system. We therefore recommend that no 
amendments to the school Jaw shall ever be made which will 
impair their efficiency, or which will divert from their sup- 
port the funds necessary to maintain them. We further — 
recommend that the maintenance and improvement of the 
primary schools shall always be regarded by this Association 
as the prime object of its careful attention. 
2. We consider the secondary schools as the second dee of 
importance in any well regulated school system. We therefore 
recommend to this Association to devote its efforts to promote 
the building of a complete system of secondary instruction — 
upon the foundation of 2 thorough system of primary schools, 
always watching with tender care that the foundation shall 
rot he injured in adding the superstructure. 
3. Considering the diverse environments of education in 
the different counties of the State, and in different districts 
of the same county, the legislature has wisely provided two 
classes of schools to meet the differing conditions of the sev- 
eral localities. The primary school includes eight required 
branches of study, and two optional branches, to be taught 
in five grades. These branches are necessary parts of a pri- 
mary course, and include the full measure of instruction that 
can be safely conducted by a single teacher. The secondary 
school includes seventeen required branches, and two optional 
branches, to be taught i in eight grades.. Tk is plain, that a 
‘secondary school cannot be successfully conducted by one 
teacher. We therefore recommend, that no secondary school 
shall be established with a less teaching force than two teach- 
ers, to consist of principal and one or more assistants.
-P-A-G-E-323
e326 
4. We point out to the Association, that the greatest danger — 
to the efficiency of both the primary and secondary schools, 
is the power given to the directors to establish secondary _ 
schools without- sufficient teaching force. The school law 
provides that additional teachers may be employed in secon- 
dary schools but does not reauire it. This law should be 
mandatory. In the absence of this positive prohibition, we 
recommend that this Association use its influence to warn di- 
rectors of the injurious effects of establishing secondary 
schools without providing sufficient teaching force. 
. In examining the curricultm of the secondary schools, 
your committee nade no reason to suggest any change. The 
number of branches taught cannot be increased without ad- 
ing additional grades, attended with additional expense. We 
_ think the branches well selected with a view to imparting a 
\ practical education. The course lacks about two years of pre- 
{paring pupils to enter college, and provides no instruction in 
\foreion languages, either ancient or modern. Your commit- ; 
tee believes that a course in languages would be desirable, but 
they can see no way to introduce such studies under the pres- 
ent laws. 
6. Your committee can see but one way to enable country 
’ districts, which may desire it, to extend their secondary 
schools so as to add additional grades, and to include linguis- 
tic studies, thus affording a course preparatory to college. An 
amendment to the State Constitution is needed, to enable 
“7 each school district to levy an additional tax. Under the 
school law, as enacted in 1873, each school distriet was au- 
thorized to levy an additional tax to be applied to enlarging 
~ the curriculum, or increasing the term of its schools. This part 
of the law was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme — 
Court, and was subsequently repealed. ‘Thus, an ‘important 
link in the chain of the school system was broken, and the 
power of providing for the introduction of higher branches 
in the schools was lost to the school districts. 
In 1885 the General Assembly repaired this broken link 
as far as the constitution would permit, and took the only 
step in its power to provide for local taxation. A law was 
eed empowering municipal corporations to levy-additional 
- taxes and to establish “graded high schools.” This enact- 
- ment was eminently wise, and has led to important results. 
   
-P-A-G-E-324
  — 327 — 
Graded high schools are now in successful operation in all 
the cities and in many of the towns. The example of these 
corporation schools has had the effect to make the country dis- 
tricts feel still more keenly the lack of the power of local 
taxation. This power ought to be given them, and can come 
only by an amendment to the State Constitution. 
7. The object of providing secondary education would not 
be completely reached by an increase of State or county tax, 
for the reason that such increase would be general, and its 
proceeds would be distributed to the several districts in pro- 
portion to scholastic population. It would not, therefore, fit 
the peculiar condition of any particular district. It wouid be 
much better to give to each school district the power of levy- 
ing a tax sufficient to provide such additional instruction as 
may be needed in the district. This point could. not be 
reached by general legislation, even if the legislature had the 
constitutional power. A constitutional provision is necessary 
io put the district on a level with the municipal corporation, 
supplemented by legislative enactment to permit the district 
to apply its loca! taxation to extend the prescribed cure la 
of study. 
8. We therefore recommend that a committee of three be 
appointed to confer with the State Superintendent, the au- 
ihorities of the colleges of the State, and other friends of edu- | 
cation with a view to taking such steps as may be best adapted 
to carrying into effect the suggestions of this report.

PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS AND — TEACHERS’ 
TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
After stating’ that it was found necessary to enter into a 
rather lengthy discussion of the subject in order to do it jus- 
tice the chairman reported as follows: 
TEACHING IS A PROFESSION. “; 
We maintain that teaching is a profession that may be 
- learned as much as medicine or law, and, since it is such, it is 
both wise and proper for suitable schools to be established,
-P-A-G-E-325
— 328 — 
in which those who expect to practice this most difficult of 
arts may become familiar with its underlying principles. 
The objection to this theory, too frequently offered, is that, 
true teachers are born, not made. If so, training schools are 
not necessary. But this is not true. It is only a part of a 
truth. There are mental, physical and moral endowments 
which nature gives to some and withholds from others, ren- 
dering them fit or unfit material, out of which education and 
environment may or may not make a true teacher. One is 
a teacher by nature to the same extent that a bank of clay 
is a natural kiln of brick; a tree in the forest a natural ship= 
mast; a piece of iron ore a natural carwheel, plow- 
share or watchspring. He is such in posse. No more. Those 
who have seemed to be such, evidently had the necessary ele- 
ments of character as natural endowments, but without in- ; 
fluences, internal and external, conscious or unconscious, 
would have been the blunderers that their predecessors of 
the Dark Ages were. : 
But normal school graduates are sometimes the most piti- 
able failures as teachers and why is it so if so much depends 
on training? At least two plausible reasons may be given: ‘ 
1. The tout ensemble of the candidate’s character may have 
‘been such as to render him unfit material, or, 
2. The training school may have failed because its efforts 
were not in harmony with the necessary laws. ; 
In almost every instance the untrained teacher (and the 
trained one as well, if the training be merely in’ method) be- 
gins teaching as an imitator. His former teacher is his only 
criterion. Whether he comes from a common school, a nor- — 
mal school, or a college, it is the same and not unfrequently 
do students go out from college, the recent graduates, and 
try to introduce the methods of their favorite professors into 
primary schools. As an example we have in mind a “much 
trained” teacher who taught small children by lecture as stu- 
dents in German universities are taught. To be a blind imi- 
tator is to be a slave to the imitated, and so long as a teacher 
does things only because he has seen others do them or has 
heard of others doing them he remains a slave. But truth is 
at the foundation of the teacher's art as well as all others an 
he may “know the truth and the truth shall make him free.” 
As an illustration of ‘the difference between proceeding in
-P-A-G-E-326
= 429 
the light of guiding principles and out of it we have only to— 
call attention to the marvelous progress of medical science 
since the germ theory of disease has been known. Quaran- 
tine, disinfection, aseptic surgery, with their inestimable bless- ~ 
ings to mankind depend upon this recently discovered princi- 
ple, and for a physician of to-day to display ignorance of it 
is to stigmatize himself as a fraud.. The alchemist worked in 
the dark for centuries. He knew no principles but depended, 
as so many teachers ‘do, on empirical experiments hoping to 
make the most useful discoveries. He worked in earnest and 
though kings’ treasuries were at his command, he found 
neither the major nor the minor magisterium. The chemist, 
guided by eternal principles, has discovered and invented 
more in the last three decades than did all the alchemists of 
all the centuries preceding this one and the last. 
CLASSES OF TEACHERS. 
Since the teaching art has its underlying principles, the 
practice of it in the schools is either (1) empirical or’ (2) 
rational, and the teaching fraternity is divided accordingly 
into two great classes, the Pee and the non-profes- 
sional. : 
It may not be out of place here to state that experience 
alone is not sufficient to make a teacher any more than it is 
a mechanic, a physician, or an electrician. Skill is the result 
of experience guided by knowledge. Some discoveries are 
made when experimenting is done by those ignorant of prin- 
ciples, but it is alarming to think of so much precious mate- 
rial being ruined when the knowledge of a few primary laws 
might save it. 
PREREQUISITES. 
At present, few people will deny, as some did in former 
times, that three things at least, even four, are necessary to 
purely rational teaching; to-wit: 
1. A thorough understanding of what is to be taught— 
knowledge. 
2. A clear conception of the processes of mental develop- — 
ment—psychology. 
3. How the teaching is to be dene—method; and if we add 
e fourth,
-P-A-G-E-327
0 
4. The experience of others for guidance—history of edu- 
cation. 
We deem it hardly necessary to argue the first point. One 
must have accurate scholarship to teach the truth and in or- 
der that he may inspire as he should he must have additional 
knowledge to that needed for the immediate wants of his class. © 
lie must have a reserve fund with which to retain his own 
confidence and that of his pupils. 
A knowledge of the child and of the laws governing his 
mental and physical development are as necessary to profes- 
sional teaching as a knowledge of the effects of sunshine and 
rain, plant food and cultivation are to the growth of plants— — 
even more since to educate is a more complex and therefore 
amore difficult task than the mere production of plants. 
By method in teaching, as in other things, we simnlv mean 
the manner in which the teaching is to be done; briefly, the 
low. Where what is to be taught is fully known and the in-. 
tellectual wants of the child are fully understood, the method 
will be easy. It will usually even suggest itself. Those who - 
bave little or no knowledge of psychology may sometimes 
follow the methods of others, mechanically, especially under 
the supervision of those who do comprehend the principles 
involved with very good results, as is often the case in our 
city schools, but such teachers do not belong to the class prop- 
erly called professional. 
’ Mere method is of little avail without both scholarship and 
a knowledge of principles. To us it seems that the teacher 
with a stock of methods as the chief part of his capital in 
trade with which to begin the business of professional teach- 
ing is about as well equipped as the hotel cock with only a | 
cook hook to tell him how to cook, but with nothing in 
the pantry and no knowledge of the age, wishes, or tastes for 
the guests for whom the cooking is to be done. 
When a man determines to be a physician he does not be- 
gin by learning the best method of holding a spoon from 
which medicine is to be taken, but learns (1) something about 
the human system, its nature and wants in health and disease, 
then (2) something of the nature and effects of the various 
drugs and (3) lastly, methods of practice. Instead of going 
directly: into the hospital to learn to do by doing he en-— 
'deavors to get a fair knowledge of both subject and object | 
\   { 
% 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
  Sra cae 
and then corrects and verifies his knowledge by frequent visits 
to the hospital, the physician’s model school. 
HISTORY OF EDUCATION. 
Teachers, like studies, “are perfected by experience,” but 
they need not rely solely on their own experience. The his- 
tory of education is merely an account of the experience of 
nations and of individuals and we do not have to read it long 
to exclaim with Lowell: ; 
“O thou, whose days are yet all spring, 
co * co * * * x  % * 
Experience is a dumb, dead thing, 
The victory’s in believing.” 
SCHOOL ECONOMY. 
The professional teacher should furthermore have a knowl- 
edge of school economy, He should know something of the 
school systems of the leading nations of the world and of the 
effects they have produced upon the citizens of those na- 
tions. 
THE PROFESSIONAL TEACHER. 
The professional teacher is more than a pedagogue—a lead- 
er of boys. He is a leader of teachers as well as a molder of 
public opinion and a framer of educational systems. It is 
true that there are not a great many of them but it is equally 
true that they are almost or quite alone, fully identified with 
educational progress and hence their great worth to the 
State. 
SEMT-PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS. 
- There are many teachers whom we may designate as semi- 
professional. They never understand principles thoroughly, 
though they read the lighter journals, attend institutes, study 
methods extensively, have a fair knowledge of subjects and 
remain for some time in the business of teaching, manifest- 
ing a pleasure in it. These are a valuable addition to the 
teaching force of any State. They are in sympathy with 
their duties and are ready to co-operate with the leaders of the
-P-A-G-E-329
‘caged ONG Aeragh 
more purely professional type. We believe it would be prop- 
er to designate the graduates of many State normal schools—_ 
those having slender courses of study and giving much atten- : 
tion to mere method—as semi-professional teachers. 
NON-PROFESSIONAL TEACHERS. i 
But in every State there is a large per cent. of the teaching 
force that is purely non-professional, people who teach as a 
makeshift, have no thought of acquiring skill in the art or 
remaining Jong in the service. Their work is necessarily in- 
ferior, the character of it depending largely on. the schools 
they have attended—for they go out as imitators. Unfortu- 
nate as this may seem it is nevertheless true that there will 
Likely be for some time to come a large class of this kind. The 
meager recompense given teachers in very many schools is — 
such as to render teaching an uninviting profession to many 
who have the means for the necessary self-culture and to de- 
bar quite as many others, who enter upon a_ career 
of teaching, poorly prepared, from attending between 
sessions, the proper professional schools. At present 
the non-professional teacher is a necessity. He does for edu- 
cation what the justice of the peace does for justice; he takes 
it to every man’s door. But just as we need the higher courts - 
of justice to which we can appeal and from which we learn 
wisdom, we need a strong body of purely professional teach- 
ers in Tennessee. 
SPECIAL TRAINING SCHOOLS NECESSARY. 
Though every school is in several respects a training school 
since methods are exhibited (incidentally) and subject matter 
tavght (intentionally), special training schools are necessary. 
They should have (1) an extensive course of study; (2) a suita- 
ble course of professional study and (3) an atmosphere of lib- 
erty, catholicity, patriotism, humanity. They “should impart 
quenchless zeal for knowledge” and a contempt for pedantry 
and bigotry. It would be well, as with our own Peabody 
Normal College, to have a university course ever within the 
student’s view to fire his ambition. As an illustration of the _ 
extreme narrowness of the course of study in some normal 
schools, we have only to quote the following, relative to the
-P-A-G-E-330
— 333 — oe 
State normal schools of Vermont; viz.: “*No foreign lan- 
guage, either ancient or modern, shall be included (in the 
course of study).” . 
Nor should the spirit of the normal school be confined 
strictly to the practical. To do so is to rob it of most of its 
» culture value. Its course of study, as already intimated, 
should be considerably higher than the schools in ee its 
graduates are to teach. 
HISTORY OF THE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
The growth of the normal school or training school move- 
ment in America since the inauguration of it at Lexington, 
Mass., fifty-eight years ago, has been rapid indeed. The fact 
that there is a much larger number of these schools in ex- 
istence now than ever before and that, very many of our best 
colleges and universities have also taken up the work, is proof 
that the professional training of teachers is, looked upon 
with increasing favor. The old idea that scholarship alone 
is necessary to successful teaching has passed away; so has 
the newer one that method is the chief requisite. We are 
new slowly but surely coming to recognize the great qualifi- 
cations for professional teaching, which’ we have already 
mentioned, ever the four: Scholarship, Psychology, Method- 
cology, History of Education.- - 
Another proof of. thé usefulness of normal schools is in 
the fact that in Massachusetts where 36 per cent. of the teach- 
ers have attended them and 30 per cent. are graduates of 
tiem, “the demand has already exceeded the supply.” 
TENNESSEE’S EXPERIENCE. 
Tennessee has had the question of training schools for 
teachers presented to her legislature in the form of appeals 
for appropriations bienially for twenty years, and has watched 
with increasing favor the beneficent results of her expendi- 
tures. So much has the idea grown in favor with our peo- 
_ ple that an appropriation of $20,000 for the Peabody Normal 
College was obtained from the last legislature almost as easily 
as was the privilege to establish it “without cost to the   
; *Report of the United States Commissioner of Education, 
1894, vol. ii., page 1,075.
-P-A-G-E-331
  = ee a 
  State” in 1875. Moreover, the colored population are re- 
ceiving most considerate aid of this kind and the result is 
quite clearly seen in the improved condition of their schools. 
Nor, are the colleges and universities of Tennessee behind 
those of her sister States in offering special inducements to 
those who desire to teach. 
RECOMMENDATIONS. 
But we come now to the most important part of the re- 
port; viz., What, the State should do for the professional ~ 
training of teachers. We would especially reeommend— 
1. The continuation of the present liberal policy toward 
the Peabody Normal College and the schools for the profes- 
sional training of colored teachers. 
2. The appropriation of a larger sum for institute pur- 
poses. 
3. Giving teachers the privilege of attending teachers’ in- 
stitutes, conventions, ete., without loss of pay. 
4, Some arrangement whereby city superintendents would 
he required to give or have given regular instruction in psy- 
chology and history of education as well as methodology to” 
the teachers under them, providing, of course, some means for 
a just recompense for the same. 
5. The establishment and maintenance of a good profes- 
sional library in every city and county as soon as possible.

THE DUTIES AND QUALIFICATIONS OF STATH | 
AND COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
Your Committee on Qualifications and Duties of State and 
County Superintendents have ea considered this sub- 
ject and report as follows: 
That we think it no ious cation to say that by virtue of 
iheir close and peculiar relationship to the teachers and school 
directors of their respective counties, that County Superin- 
tendents have it within their power to exercise a greater in- 
fluence upon society, either for good or eyil, than any one 
individual in his county. 
If this be true, of course, it must logically follow that the 
Covnty Superintendent’s duties and responsibilities are corres- 
pondingly great. It cannot be questioned that the first and 
most important qualifications of both State and County Su- 
perintendents should be that’ of a moral nature, for whatever 
may be their intellectual acquirements and capabilities, their 
influences will be pernicious if their practices are immoral. 
Teaching by example has always been a more powerful and 
efficacious method of instruction than by precept, men are 
judged, felt and followed much more by, what they do than 
by what they say. So if the State and County Superintend- 
ents would lead the officers and teachers under them and the 
children of the State into straight and beautiful. paths, they 
must not walk in devious ways themselves. Their conduct 
should be characterized by gentility and sobriety, truth and 
virtue, if they would retain the respect of the teachers and 
the admiration of the children, or permanently impress them 
with good principles and noble practices. Supposing the Su- 
perintendents to be qualified in this respect, then they should 
be the intellectual masters of all the branches required to be 
_ taught in our public schools, and make themselves perfectly 
familiar with the school law; in other words, he should be “a 
person of literary and scientific attainments.” For if he should 
be calied upon by either teachers or pupils, to explain some 
question, example or proposition, pertaining to his work, and 
fail to give the desired information, he would then forfeit the 
confidence and esteem of his teachers and the children, who 
would be justified in pronouncing him a “sham.” 
Great earnestness is another necessary qualification for a
-P-A-G-E-333
— 336 — 
successful County Superintendent. A languid and creeping 
. superintendent will never have lively and progressive schools. 
He must warm and viyify the school commissioners and 
  _ teachers, and also the county courts with his own zeal and 
energy. His success will be measured by the value he at- 
taches to his duties and the amount of energy, enthusiasm and 
learning he carries into his work. He should also work to 
establish and maintain happy, kind and affectionate rela- — 
tions between himself, teachers, directors and members of — 
the county court, for in unity there is strength. The rapid - 
increase of popular intelligence is calling for a more varied 
and critical eulture on the part of the County Superintend- 
ents/and they should be equal to the demands of the hour, 
and, in this connection, we will add that we heartily approve 
the law requiring County Superintendents to be examined 
and receive a certificate from the State Board of Education, 
before they can be eligible to the office. 
In addition to the many and varied duties of the County 
Superintendent, as laid down in the school law, we would 
recommend that a law be passed requiring the endorsement of 
the County Superintendent of all warrants issued by the di- 
rectors, for all school supplies, such as maps, globes, charts, 
desks, ete., as the directors cannot become familiar with the 
prices of such articles, and are easily imposed upon by oily- 
tongued agents, who sell at fabulous prices; much money 
would be saved by the passage of such a law. 
We would further suggest that the term of office of the 
County Superintendent be extended to four instead of two - 
years, as it now stands, and that the compensation be fixed by 
legislation, either salaried or in proportion to scholastic pop-— 
ulation. If the State would desire the services of good men 
and women, they must be paid in proportion to services and 
anoneenilinient We must also enter our respectful protest 
against any move to limit the powers already given to superin- 
tendents; instead we are in favor of enlarging them.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON DISTRICT DIRECTORS, 
AND COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. a 
The questions submitted to us for consideration are of vital 
importance to the school interests of the State. We have given. 
them as careful attention as time will permit. While all 
members of the Committee do not agree as to some of the 
recommendations, we believe that most of those present. will 
endorse the report in the main. ‘Some of the changes sug- 
gested are radical in their nature, but we feel that they are 
vital to the best interests of the schools of our State. 
Believing, as we do, that a few good men will accomplish 
more than a larger number, in elevating the standard of ed- 
ucation in our midst, we recommend that the schools dis- 
iricts be made co-extensive with the civil districts of the 
counties, and that one director be elected from each dis- 
trict to serve for four years, one half of this number to be 
elected at each bi-ennial election. Care should be taken in 
the selection of such men as are broad-minded, liberal, full 
of interest in educational matters, and influential in their 
respective communities. 
Each director shall have power over the local affairs of his 
‘district. Ife shall employ all teachers for the schools of his 
district, subject to approval by the County Superintendent 
who shall sign all contracts with teachers; but no teacher 
shall be employed until he presents a certificate for the coun- 
_ ty in which he expects to teach. 
He may dismiss a teacher or pupil by and with the consent 
of the County Superintendent; but such teacher or pupil may 
appeal from this decision to the County Board of Education 
at any regular meeting. 
He shall establish schools, build and repair houses and fur- 
nish same, and provide all needed supplies with the consent 
of the County Superintendent. 
He shall visit the schools in his district, explain and enforce 
_ the school laws, see that only the adopted text-hooks are used, 
_and see that only the studies prescribed by law are iret in 
_ the schools of his district. 
All warrants issued by the director, except those for teach- 
ers’ salaries, shall be countersigned by the County Superin- 
’tendent. He shall use no money derived from the State 
ehool fund for any other than tuition purposes. 
   
-P-A-G-E-335
That he may give such time and attention to the school in- — 
terests of his district as the importance of the cause of educa- 
tion demands. He shall be paid a reasonable compensation 
for the time actually employed in taking the school census, 
in looking after the school prosperity, and attending to all 
  other business pertaining to the welfare of the schools of his - 
district. 
We further recominend that there shall be a County Board. 
of Education which shall be composed of the directors of the 
yarious school districts of the county. ‘ 
Said Board of Education shall hold regular meetings on 
the first Saturday of January, April, July and October, at 
which time they shall attend to any business pertaining to 
the welfare of the schools of the county, and decide all ap- 
peals made by teachers and pupils. 
This County Board of Education shall elect a County Se 
perintendent who shall possess the qualifications required by 
law, and his term of office shall be four years; but he may 
be removed from office by the Board for misconduct or in- 
efficiency. 
The County Superintendent shall act as President of tite 
Board, and they shali elect one of their number to act 
ag secretary, who shall keep a full and complete record of all 
proceedings. 
They shall appoint two of the leading teachers of the coun- 
2 ty to act with the County Superintendent in the examina- 
tion and licensing of teachers. - 
That the best possible results may be secured, they shall 
prescribe a course of study, which shall be printed, and a copy — 
_ furnished’ to each ‘teacher in the county, who shall be re- 
‘quired to follow it as closely as is practicable. 
To avoid the expense of numerous elections, they shall fill 
all yacancies caused by death, resignation or removal of di- | 
rectors until the next general election; but where deemed 
necessary the County Superintendent may appoint some one — 
to serve until the next regular meeting of the Board of Edu- 
cation.

RECEIPTS AND. DISBURSEMENT 
FUNDS. OF SCHOOL 
  To the Public School Officers’ Association Assembled: 
1. We, vour Committee on Receipts and Disbursements of 
Fublic School Money, beg to submit the following: 
We believe that the assessment of all school taxes, State 
and county, should be made, and the same collected in a way 
that will make the burden proportional on all classes of peo- 
ple that receive benefit from our public schools. However, 
there is a large class of people in the State financially able 
to pay a school tax, that pays but $2 a year, and a still 
Jarger class that pays nothing except: every four years 
when a candidate for office or a’ political party pays it. 
These people have a great many children to educate, and 
since they are able to bear a part of the expense of main- 
taining the public school system, it is only just that they do 
it. But the out-of-date Constitution of Tennessee has the 
system chained so.that counties anxious to keep the public 
schools running eight or ten months in the year cannot do 
so. We, therefore, suggest that our State Constitution should 
be so revised that any county desiring it should be allowed 
to increase the levy on polls, and property, too, if necessary, 
to inaintain such a system as the county desires; and, there 
should be such statutes made as will collect. every dollar of 
the poll tax oftener than presidential election years. 
2. Concerning the disbursement of the public school 
money we are frank to state that this is done at present in a 
yery loose way. ‘There are several thousands of persons in the 
State of Tennessee who sign warrants for the payment of 
school money. ‘There is no one required to audit the accounts 
of the County Trustee to find if a warrant has been forged 
y some skillful imitator who has in some way got in his pos- 
session a form and imitated the signature of some district 
clerk: and to briefly summarize, the people pay the tax, but 
do not know just what becomes of it in the end. “To remedy 
this matter we recommend that the following duties be 
added to the County Superintendent: ‘ : 
To be at his office each Saturday to countersign all war- 
vants. drawn by any person whomsoever, if to be paid out of 
the school money of the county.   
         
      
      
-P-A-G-E-337

Te keep a record of cach warrant so drawn in a book pro- _ 
vided for the purpose. 
To audit accounts of the County Trustee monthly and 
make settlement with him so far as the public school money is 
concerned. = - ' 
To keep an itemized account of all school money and re- 
port to the County Court quarterly actual receipts and dis- 
bursements during preceding quarter, said itemized report — 
to be filed by the County Clerk.

REPORT ON CITY SCHOOL SUPERVISION. 
Nashville, Tenn., Dec. 9th, 1896. 
To the Tennessee Public School Officers’ Association: 
Your Committee believes an ideal system of school ‘super-, 
vision would have at its head a State Superintendent, with 
power to impress his ideas upon the system; a State Board of 
Examiners, to pass upon the qualification of all applicants for — 
positions as teachers; County Superintendents, subordinate to 
tue State Superintendent, to supervise the schools of the 
county; City Superintendents subject to the direction of 
County Superintendents to more closely look after the details 
of city schools. 
This would naturally presuppose the abilities of the re- 
spective officers to be in the order of their rank. Salaries 
should of course be in same order to secure this. Good men ~_ 
should hold positions so long as good results flow. New men | 
shculd be appointed for their peculiar fitness for the work to 
be done, and not as reward for political services already or 
expected to be rendered. 
. The system in Tennessee is now thoroughly Democratie— 
maximum authority to locality, minimum to head. Centrali- F 
zation is only dangerous when central power ceases to be wise 
and good. a 
State Superintendents are appointed by the Governor who | 
is,elected every two years—thus in a State where political par- 
ties are nearly evenly divided change every two years is proba- — 
bie. 
 
-P-A-G-E-338
oe Sabir 
County Superintendents would likely change as often as 
State Superintendents. City-Superintendents are elected by 
B of E. and they are elected so that at no time can there 
be a complete change in its make-up. Hence spasmodic 
changes would not affect the City Superintendent, but a 
more permanent change of public sentiment would be _neces- 
sary to produce a change in his office. 
‘There are in the United States as many different systems _ 
of public school supervision as there are States, each peculiar 
to the conditions of such locality. 'Tennessee’s school law be- 
ing enacted long after city schools had been organized and 
supported by city taxation, wisely exempted from the oper- 
ations of its provisions all city schools already organized. 
Luter this provision was extended to all city schools that 
might hereafter be organized. 
Your Committee believes that if permanency of office and 
sufficient inducements to command high order of talent couid 
be secured for the offices of County and. State Superintend- 
erts. then city schools should. be supervised by County and 
State Superintendents. But until such conditions do exist, it 
is not wise to hamper men more permanently located by tem-* 
porary power. It therefore recommends no change in the 
school law bearing upon city school supervision.

We shall notice: 
(1) The present conditions and practices. 
(2) The objections to a system of uniform examinations. . 
(3) The points in favor of the system. 
(4) And suggest in outline a plan for this system. 
We beg your indulgence while calling attention to some of 
the conditions which confront us, and the praculces | in yogue 
- in some counties of the State. 
  Each county is a law unto itself, and no such thing as har- 
mony, co-operation and system is apparently intended. One

scnted, and another absolutely refuses to recognize any certi-’ 
ficate, or diploma, and when he does recognize a diploma | — 
frem. the Peabody Normal College, State University, or any 
State institute, it is under a serious protest. And already we 
hea the warning call from some conservative worker that 
there is danger lest the granting of State certificates by these s 
institutes becomes too common, and the prize too easily — 
eained; and a fair share of this warning comes from the. ~ 
ranks of the institute workers themselves, and not from some 
disgruntled. unsuccessful applicant for State institute work. 
There is a feeling that in some institutes the work is far _ 
superior to that in others, and the examinations more rigid 
and far-reaching in scope. There is more of dignity. 
    system,   
scholarship and professional work, and less of noise, hap- —~ 
hazard and unprofessional instruction. 
These conditions must inevitably follow so long as our 
- present lack of system prevails. i 
There are too many young boys and g who are entering 
_the ranks ill-prepared, and with no adequate conception of 
‘what it isto really teach. These County Superintendents 
well know what this means. They have them to. contend 
with; and while occasionally one of these may do good work, 
yei it does not stand to reason that they should, even if this — 
“js distinctively an age when age is not respected. So many 
  patrons want a school at their gate, and a near relative to.» 
teach it,regardless of what anybody else in the district de- 
sires; so there is nothing to do but sub-divide the district, 
ther re-sub-divide, then sub-re-sub-divide till there are — 
enough schools to keep these incompetents in work for about 
six weeks. Such conditions are a shame and disgrace to any 
community, and we hope in the near future to see a stop toy 
th 
  OBJECTIONS TO THIS SYSTEM... — + os 
Although this system has met with success in several States 
in the East and South, including Kentucky, Florida and Miss- 
opi, yet we hear objections from several sources. 
‘The chief objection is that it is impracticable. It is stated — 
in proof of this objection that a set of questions that would | 
suit. Davidson, or Hamilton, or Gibson, would not at all suit. 
      senseless and useless frittering away of the public funds, ©

  ets 
Certer, or Fayette, or Hardeman. We consider this the 
weukest possible point. 
Ii it will not do now, when will it do? When will there 
come under the present plan a time when these less favored 
counties will reach. the ever-increasing standard of excel- 
lence in the more favored counties? We consider this a 
point decidedly in favor of uniform examinations as they will 
cause the teachers of these plodding counties to bestir them- 
selves, awake from their stupid condition and rise to the 
proper level. ‘ : 
Another objection is the expense; yes, it is true that for a 
year or so there will be an increase in expenses; but the 
great good to be accomplished will far outweigh the expense. 
After the system is well introduced there need not be so much 
expense. 
    
In this case, as often in business, it would be economy to 
spend more money.. Still another objection is that it would 
tyke away local self-government. 
Now there is not an intelligent, liberal minded, ob- 
servant teacher, or school officer, in the State who is fully ac- 
quainted with our conditions, and with the results in other 
Stetes where uniform examinations have been introduced, 
yho would bring up this ante-bellum argument. to defeat what 
he realizes is for the good of the State. You well know what 
trouble is caused by the multiplicity of schools as a result of 
pendering to this sentiment of local say-so, and other evils 
needless to mention. We want to rise aboye so narrow, big- 
ected and selfish a sentiment, and labor for the common good. 
POINTS IN FAVOR OF THIS SYSTEM. 
We are not so sanguine as to hope that the adoption, and 
even successful operation of this system, will cause all our 
- educational evils to yanish as the dew of the morning. We 
do not advocate it as a cure-all, but we do claim that it will 
give us better teachers, therefore, better schools, and hence 
a better citizenship; and these teachers will demand better 
equipment, inculcate higher ideas and instil broader views. 
Jf the saying, “As is the teacher so is the school,” be true, 
then it behooves us to look well to anv possible plan that will 
give us teachers of the best attainments, well drilled in the 
subjects te be taught, with an adequate comprehersion of
-P-A-G-E-341
— 344— 
the end to be reached and a clear conception of the principles 
and right procedure to this end. 
Let us here introduce some testimony from reliable sources: 
(N. Y. 794, p/29; 795. p. 31-2-3; 796, p. 20-1-2.) 
(Pla. ’82-3-4.) (Letters from Kentucky and Florida.) 
And yet we hear objection to a system which has done so 
n.uch for the cause of education in other States. We can but 
feel that a good deal of this objection comes from ignorance 
ot the benefits and higher resulis of the system as used in 
other States. : 
PLAN PROPOSED. 
The usual plan is to have the questions prepared bv the 
State Superintendent, State Board of Education, or State 
Board of Examiners, and the lists are sent under seal to every 
county, where they are opened by the County Superintend- 
ent, or County Board of Examiners, in presence of the teach- 
ers assembled, after the manner of the examination for Pea- 
body scholarships in our Normal College. We favor the plan 
of a State Board of Examiners. (Stewart County.) 
Then these answer papers in some States are reviewed and 
graded by the County Superintendent or County Board of 
Examiners. while in some States all answer papers are re- 
turned to the State Board of Examiners who review them, 
and issue certificates to successful candidates. 
We favor this latter plan, for-without it, the very purpose 
of the uniform system is, in a great measure, thwarted. 
These certificates in some States are of two classes, State 
end county; and three grades in each; while in others there 
are only three grades in all, two of these being county and one 
State. : 
  We favor none of these plans, as we think any certificate 
ought to allow a teacher to teach in any county in the State. © 
  We favor a primary certificate of a certain average per cent., 
in certain studies for one year and not renewable, then a. first 
grade primary of a certain per cent. to be issued for three 
years, and on condition the applicant has taught one year, 
    and renewable, provided the applicant for renewal is required — 
to pass an extra examination in a few branches of culture 
study and has taught two years of the three in the life of the 
certificate; then a secondary certificate of a certain per cent., 
‘  
-P-A-G-E-342
  rake err 
good for two years, not renewable; and a first grade secondary 
of a certain per cent., good for five years, and renewable, pro- 
vided the applicant has taught. three of the five years, and is 
required to pass an extra examination of certain studies. 
And lastly, a life certificate to be issued pon examination 
only to teachers of at least five years’ experience, provided 
that this ayplies only to a secondary certificate. 
These examinations shall be held at stated petono: ‘times 
throughout the State.

REPORT or PROF. W. R. GARRETT ON WATKINS 
INSTITUTE NIGHT SCHOOL. 
Mr. W. R. Garrett was called on for a report of the Wat- 
kins Institute Public Night School, and reported as follows: 
Mr. President: I was not expecting to be called on so soon 
and I have not prepared any report. I have been engaged 
all day in work with the Committee on School Laws and 
have not had time to think of any thing else. I will very 
briefly tell you a little about the Night School. Ke 
Mr. Samuel Watkins left to the State of Tennessee by his 
will a certain donation in trust for the working men. The 
Legislature of the State accepted the trust and appointed a 
Loard of three Commissioners. In the discharge of the trust — 
and in accordance with the will they made the institution

parely educational. They invested its fund in a building 
and the rental of the building meets their expenditures. They 
devoted a part of the proceeds to aid the Tennessee Historical 
Scciety and a part of the proceeds to provide a place for and 
aid the Howard Library. Tn addition to that they established 
night schools and appointed a superintendent and teachers 
fo. these schools. The schools are free to any person, any citi- 
zen of Tennessee, without any limit to age, but of course 
enly those who live around Nashville can avail themselves of 
them. There is an average enrollment of about 250, with an 
average attendance of about 150 on the night school. They 
continue in operation about four months in the year. The 
orly restriction is that no one can be admitted who attends 
upon the day school. The first class, which we usually call 
our infant class, are about 25 years of age. We call it the in- 
fant class because they are just learning to read and write. 
A great many have now passed through the course and owe 
it entirely to that institution. In addition to that we have a 
special technical class, in which are taught bookkeeping, type- 
writing, shorthand and commercial arithmetic, anything to 
give them preparation for business. This school, as I said, 
has about 250 enrolled with a nightly attendance of abont 
150. It is an institution which, we think, is doing a great. 
deal of good. In the regularly graded city schools these peo- 
ple have found that.there is no place for them, They do not 
like to go with the little children and they cannot go 
in the higher grade. and: this. institution was © organ- 
ized for them, and also for all those who have not the oppor- 
tunity to attend-the day schools. Some becin at the begin- 
ning. at the A B C, and are engaged at work in the dav time 
and come to attend this institution at night, which is the onlv 
opportunity they haye to acquire an education.

CBILDREN’S S DEPARTMEN’ ', TENNESSEE CENTEN- 
NIAL. 
Dr. Geo. W. Fy Price. 
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Public School 
Officers’ Association: 
Appreciating, as I do, the brevity of your time and the 
urgency of your business, I should not venture to trespass 
; upon your attention, had I not been solicited to represent to 
you some facts connected with the Children’s Department 
of our approaching Centennial Exposition. The movement 
was fortunately placed in charge of a man whose energy and 
industry have infused life and animation into the enterprise _ 
in spite of manifold and serious discouragements. At a mo- 
ment when the whole question hung in doubt, Prof. W. T. 
Davis maintained his attitude of earnest and persistent adyo- 
cacy of this important movement. It was our hope to secure 
from the Centennial authorities an adequate provision for 
representing the educational interests of Tennessee. We have 
unfortunately, however, had the usual experience of those 
who have attempted to make educational exhibits. The im- 
portance of the public welfare of our movement has not been 
fully realized. We find ourselves at the last moment restricted 
for space, and compelled to use ‘the utmost economy and cir- 
cumspection in apportioning the space at our command. A 
building, two stories in height, 60x40 feet, with two wings, 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
T3490 : ¢ 
cne story in height, each. 20x24 feet, is the entire limit of 
space thus far assigned’to us by the Centennial authorities. 
We do not feel that we can urge them with safety to our 
interest to make a larger appropriation. 
Accepting the space at our command, we find that we will 
have something like 5,000 square feet of table and wall space 
to be appropriated to exhibits of school work. While this 
is very inadequate, it becomes us to accept what has been 
given us, and to-use it to the best possible advantage. It may. 
have one useful effect in compelling us to be exceedingly 
choice and select in the character of the exhibits which we 
“receive, and which we seek to display. The space at our com> 
mand will allow us 100 square feet of space to each 50 
schools, and a proportionately larger space to a smaller num- 
ber. 1t would be easy for the city of Nashville alone, with 
its extensive public schools and its twenty colleges and uni- 
yersities, to occupy more space than has been allotted to us. 
We stand pledged, however, to the public to make a fair 
and equitable distribution of the space at our command in 
ihe interest of education throughout the State. : 
We come now to you, as a body of representative ladies ana 
gentlemen connected with the public school system of the 
Stite of Tennessee, and appeal to you for your interest and 
co-cperation in this enterprise. You can do us and the cause 
of education in the State an essential and permanent service 
by taking an interest in the Children’s Department, and pro- 
moting its welfare in your several communities. It is the 
earnest and cordial desire of all who are connected with the 
r.ovement officially that you should lend us your co-operation, 
your sympathy and your practical assistance. This you can 
do by securing in your several counties, and from your leading 
schools, representative exhibits to be offered to our commit- 
ive for their selection and approval. It would be wise for you 
as County Superintendents to canvass the matter in your 
several counties, speak to your school directors and to your 
pupils. explaining to them the importance that is to be at- 
tached to this exhibit. 
I have had some observation in ue matter in nee years. 
T have attended meetings of the N. E. A. in Saratoga, San 
Francisco, Chicago’ and our own city. I have attended and 
examined the exhibits at the Centennial in 1876, at the New
-P-A-G-E-347
a meas 
Grleans Exposition in 1884, and Chicago World’s Fair in 
1893. On ail these occasions I have been put to the blush 
as a Southern man, and more lately as a citizen of 'Tennes- 
see, to see the meager and insufficient exhibit that was made 
of our school resources. It is well known, and will pass with- 
out discussion, that people who seek residence in a common- 
wealth will look not only at the material resources of the 
State, but at the provisions for intellectual and moral cul- 
ture. 
Your mountains may be as picturesque as the Aloe your 
skies may be as blue as those of Italy; your air as balmy as the 
atmosphere of Southern France; your rivers may be as lucent 
and sparkling as the Rhine; your soil may teem with fertility; 
your mines may be as rich as can be found in the world, and 
yeur resources.as boundless, yet if you cannot offer to immi- 
grants: the advantages of education for their children, they 
will pass on to other States more favored with the elements 
and factors of the higher civilization. 
. We have now the! one supreme opportunity of a life time. 
Never in the history of the State has such an event occurred. — 
Phe youngest child in your schools can scarcely be expected 
to live to see the celebration of Tennessee’s bi-centennial ex- \ 
position. You have the opportunity of doing more for your. 
State in the six months of your Centennial Exhibition than 
can be accomplished in a quarter of a century of writing and 
talking and speaking about our magnificent territory and our 
splendid resources. ‘Should you permit the opportunity to 
pess without improvement, you will necessarily subject your- 
sclyes to blame and criticism. Your fellow citizens will justly 
charge you with indifference to the highest welfare of the 
commonwealth. : 
T will not elaborate the question. Suffice it, that every in- 
telligent lady and gentleman present has some appreciation 
of the magnitude and importance of the occasion. Urge your 
schools to*show their best work. Urge your teachers to 
lect-from their best pupils the most eligible specimens which 
will reflect credit upon the teachers and upon the public 
school sytem of the State. We wish every department repre- 
sented, the kindergarten, the primary, the secondary and the 
higher educational institutions of Tennessee. We wn your 
co-operation and your assistance.

As I said recently to my friends of the Methodist Confer- 
ence, assembled in this city, “Many ‘of you can boast, as I 
am not able to boast to-day, of being natives of this historical 
commonwealth. The praise of Tennessee is to-day on the lips 
of every proud citizen of the State. The very atmosphere 
vibrates with patriotic sentiment. The hills and valleys and 
fields are in sympathy with the movement. When Tennessee 
shall throw open her glittering, snowy palaces of the Centen- 
nia! and invite the world to inspect and to admire her glo- 
rious achievements in every department of life and of labor, 
every potato in her soil shall wink its eye in laughing jubila- 
tion; every cornstalk upon her alluvial plains shall draw its 
blade and flash its amber green glory into your face; every 
cotton plant shall lift its boles to the wnwinking sun of a 
semi-tropic sky to he filled with the golden splendor of the 
midday: every wayside flower shall hold its cupfull of sugared 
jiices to the lip of the vagabond honev ‘bee, her fertile

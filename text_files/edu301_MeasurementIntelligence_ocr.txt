EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Tux present volume appeals to the editor of this series 4s 
one of the most significant books, viewed from the stand- 
point of the future of our educational theory and practice, 
that has been issued in years. Not only does the volume set. 
forth, in language so simple that the layman can easily under- 
stand, the large importance for public education of a careful 
measurement of the intelligence of children, but it also. 
describes the tests which are to be given and the entire pro- 
cedure of giving them. In a clear and easy style the author 
sets forth scientific facts of far-reaching educational impor- 
tance, facts which it has cost him, his students, and many 
other scientific workers, years of painstaking labor to ac- 
cumulate. 
Only very recently, practically only within the past half- 
dozen years, have scientific workers begun to appreciate 
fully the importance of intelligence tests as a guide to edu- 
cational procedure, and up to the present we have been able 
to make but little use of such tests in our schools. The 
conception in itself has been new, and the testing procedure 
has been more or less unrefined and technical. The following 
somewhat popular presentation of the idea and of the meth- 
ods involved, itself based on a scientific monograph which 
the author is publishing elsewhere, serves for the first time 
to set forth in simple language the technical details of giving 
such intelligence tests. 
The educational significance of the results to be obtained 
from careful measurements of the intelligence of children 
can hardly be overestimated. Questions relating to the 
choice of studies, vocational guidance, schoolroom proced-

ure, the grading of pupils, promotional schemes, the study of 
the retardation of children in the schools, juvenile delin- 
quency, and the proper handling of subnormals on the one 
hand and gifted children on the other, — all alike acquire 
new meaning and significance when viewed in the light of 
the measurement of intelligence as outlined in this volume. 
As a guide to the interpretation of the results of other forms 
of investigation relating to the work, progress, and needs of 
children, intelligence tests form a very valuable aid. More 
than all other forms of data combined, such tests give the 
necessary information from which a pupil’s possibilities of 
future mental growth can be foretold, and upon which his 
further education can be most profitably directed. 
The publication of this revision and extension of the 
original Binet-Simon scale for measuring intelligence, with 
the closer adaptation of it to American conditions and needs, 
should mark a distinct step in advance in our educational 
procedure. It means the perfection of another and a very 
important measuring stick for evaluating educational prac- 
tices, and in particular for diagnosing individual possibilities 
and needs. Just now the method is new, and its use some- 
what limited, but it is the confident prediction of many 
students of the subject that, before long, intelligence tests 
will become as much a matter of necessary routine in school- 
room procedure as a blood-count now is in physical diagno- 
sis. That our schoolroom methods will in turn become much 
more intelligent, and that all classes of children, but espe- 
cially the gifted and the slow, will profit by such intellectual 
diagnosis, there can be but little question. 
That any parent or teacher, without training, can give 
these tests, the author in no way contends. However, the 
observations of Dr. Kohs, cited in Chapter VII, as well as 
the experience of the author and others who have given 
courses in intelligence testing to teachers, alike indicate that
-P-A-G-E-9
    
EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION ix 
sufficient skill to enable teachers and school principals to 
give such tests intelligently is not especially difficult to 
acquire. This being the case it may be hoped that the requi- 
site training to enable them to handle these tests may be 
included, very soon, as a part of the necessary pedagogical 
equipment of those who aspire to administrative positions 
in our public and private schools. 
Besides being of special importance to school officers and 
to students of education in colleges and normal schools, this 
volume can confidently be recommended to physicians and 
social workers, and to teachers and parents interested in 
intelligence measurements, as at once the simplest and the 
best explanation of the newly-evolved intelligence tests, 
which has so far appeared in print.

  PREFACE 
Tux constant and growing use of the Binet-Simon intel. 
ligence scale in public schools, institutions for defectives, 
reform schools, juvenile courts, and police courts is suffi- 
cient evidence of the intrinsic worth of the method. It is 
generally recognized, however, that the serviceableness of 
the scale has hitherto been seriously limited, both by the 
lack of a sufficiently detailed guide and by a number of 
recognized imperfections in the scale itself. The Stanford 
revision and extension has been worked out for the purpose 
of correcting as many as possible of these imperfections, 
and it is here presented with a rather minute description of 
the method as a whole and of the individual tests. 
The aim has been to present the explanations and instruc- 
tions so clearly and in such an untechnical form as to make 
the book of use, not only to the psychologist, but also to 
the rank and file of teachers, physicians, and social workers. 
More particularly, it is designed as a text for use in normal 
schools, colleges, and teachers’ reading-circles. 
While the use of the intelligence scale for research pur- 
poses and for accurate diagnosis will of necessity always 
be restricted to those who have had extensive training in 
experimental psychology, the author believes that the time 
has come when its wider use for more general purposes 
should be encouraged. 
However, it cannot be too strongly emphasized that no 
one, whatever his previous training may have been, can 
make proper use of the scale unless he is willing to learn the 
method of procedure and scoring down to the minutest de- 
tail. A general acquaintance with the nature of the indi- 
vidual tests is by no means sufficient. 
 
-P-A-G-E-12
  xii PREFACE 
Perhaps the best way to learn the method will be to begin 
by studying the book through, in order to gain a general 
acquaintance with the tests; then, if possible, to observe a 
few examinations; and finally to take up the procedure for 
detailed study in connection with practice testing. Twenty 
or thirty tests, made with constant reference to the pro- 
cedure as described in Part II, should be sufficient to pre- 
pare the teacher or physician to make profitable use of the 
scale. 
The Stanford revision of the scale is the result of a number 
of investigations, made possible by the codperation of the 
author’s graduate students. Grateful acknowledgment is 
especially due to Professor H. G. Childs, Miss Grace Lyman, 
Dr. George Ordahl, Dr. Louise Ellison Ordahl, Miss Neva 
Galbreath, Mr. Wilford Talbert, Mr. J. Harold Williams, 
and Mr. Herbert E. Knollin. Without their assistance this 
book could not have been written.

INTELLIGENCE 
CHAPTER i 
THE USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 
Intelligence tests of retarded school children. Numerous 
studies of the age-grade progress of school children have 
afforded convincing evidence of the magnitude and serious- 
ness of the retardation problem. Statistics collected in 
hundreds of cities in the United States show that between 
a third and a half of the school children fail to progress 
through the grades at the expected rate; that from 10 to 
15 per cent are retarded two years or more; and that from 
5 to 8 per cent are retarded at least three years. More than 
10 per cent of the $400,000,000 annually expended in the 
United States for school instruction is devoted to re-teach- 
ing children what they have already been taught but have 
failed to learn. 
The first efforts at reform which resulted from these 
_ findings were based on the supposition that the evils which 
had been discovered could be remedied by the individualiz- 
ing of instruction, by improved methods of promotion, by 
increased attention to children’s health, and by other re- 
forms in school administration. Although reforms along 
these lines have been productive of much good, they 
have nevertheless been in a measure disappointing. The 
trouble was, they were too often based upon the assump- 
tion that under the right conditions all children would be uy
-P-A-G-E-24
4 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
equally, or almost equally, capable of making satisfactory 
school progress. Psychological studies of school children 
by means of standardized intelligence tests have shown that 
this supposition is not in accord with the facts. It has been 
found that children do not fall into two well-defined groups, 
the ‘‘ feeble-minded ” and the “ normal.’’ Instead, there 
are many grades of intelligence, ranging from idiocy on the 
one hand to genius on the other. Among those classed as 
normal, vast individual differences have been found to 
exist in original mental endowment, differences which 
affect profoundly the capacity to profit from school in- 
struction. 
We are beginning to realize that the school must take into 
account, more seriously than it has yet done, the existence 
and significance of these differences in endowment. In- 
stead of wasting energy in the vain attempt to hold men- 
tally slow and defective children up to a level of progress 
which is normal to the average child, it will be wiser to 
take account of the inequalities of children in original 
endowment and to differentiate the course of study in 
such a way that each child will be allowed to progress at 
the rate which is normal to him, whether that rate be rapid 
or slow. 
While we cannot hold all children to the same standard 
of school progress, we can at least prevent the kind of re- 
tardation which involves failure and the repetition of a 
school grade. It is well enough recognized that children do 
not enter with very much zest upon school work in which 
they have once failed. Failure crushes self-confidence and ° ik 
destroys the spirit of work. It is a sad fact that a large ’ 
proportion of children in the schools are acquiring the habit 
of failure. The remedy, of course, is to measure out the 
work for each child in proportion to his mental ability. 
Before an engineer constructs a railroad bridge or trestle, 
   
-P-A-G-E-25
  USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS & 
he studies the materials to be used, and learns by means of 
tests exactly the amount of strain per unit of size his ma- 
terials will be able to withstand. He does not work empiri- 
cally, and count upon patching up the mistakes which may 
later appear under the stress of actual use. The educational 
engineer should emulate this example. Tests and fore- 
thought must take the place of failure and patchwork. 
Our efforts have been too long directed by “trial and error.” 
It is time to leave off guessing and to acquire a scientific 
knowledge of the material with which we have to deal. 
When instruction must be repeated, it means that the 
school, as well as the pupil, has failed. 
Every child who fails in his school work or is in danger of 
failing should be given a mental examination. The examina- 
tion takes less than one hour, and the result will con- 
tribute more to a real understanding of the case than any- 
thing else that could be done. VIt is necessary..to determine 
whether a given child is unsuccessful in school because of 
poor native ability, or because of poor instruction, lack of 
interest, or some other removable cause. 
It is not sufficient to establish any number of special 
classes, if they are to be made the dumping-ground for all 
kinds of troublesome cases — the feeble-minded, the physi- 
cally defective, the merely backward, the truants, the in- 
corrigibles, etc. Without scientific diagnosis and classi- 
fication of these children the educational work of the special 
class must blunder along in the dark. In such diagnosis and 
classification our main reliance must always be in mental 
tests, properly used and properly interpreted. 
Intelligence tests of the feeble-minded. Thus far intelli- 
gence tests have found their chief application in the identi- 
fication and grading of the feeble-minded. Their value for 
this purpose is twofold. In the first place, it is necessary to 
ascertain the degree of defect before it is possible to decide
-P-A-G-E-26
  6 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
intelligently upon either the content or the method of in- 
struction suited to the training of the backward child. 
In the second place, intelligence tests are rapidly extending 
our conception of “ feeble-mindedness ”’ to include milder 
degrees of defect than have generally been associated with 
this term. The earlier methods of diagnosis caused a major- 
ity of the higher grade defectives to be overlooked. Pre- 
vious to the development of psychological methods the low- 
grade moron was about as high a type of defective as most 
physicians or even psychologists were able to identify as 
feeble-minded. 
Wherever intelligence tests have been made in any con- 
siderable number in the schools, they have shown that not 
far from 2 per cent of the children enrolled have a grade 
- of intelligence which, however long they live, will never 
develop beyond the level which is normal to the average 
child of 11 or 12 years. The large majority of these belong 
to the moron grade; that is, their mental development will 
stop somewhere between the 7-year and 12-year level of 
intelligence, more often between 9 and 12. 
The more we learn about such children, the clearer it be- 
comes that they must be looked upon as real defectives. 
They may be able to drag along to the fourth, fifth, or sixth 
grades, but even by the age of 16 or 18 years they are never 
able to cope successfully with the more abstract and diffi- 
cult parts of the common-school course of study. They 
may master a certain amount of rote learning, such as that 
involved in reading and in the manipulation of number com- 
binations, but they cannot be taught to meet new condi- 
tions effectively or to think, reason, and judge as normal 
persons do. 
It is safe to predict that in the near future intelligence 
tests will bring tens of thousands of these high-grade de- 
fectives under the surveillance and protection of society.
-P-A-G-E-27
  
USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 7 
This will ultimately result in curtailing the reproduction 
of feeble-mindedness and in the elimination of an enor- 
mous amount of crime, pauperism, and industrial inef- 
ficiency. It is hardly necessary to emphasize that the high- 
grade cases, of the type now so frequently overlooked, are 
precisely the ones whose guardianship it is most important 
for the State to assume. 
Intelligence tests of delinquents. One of the most im- 
portant facts brought to light by the use of intelligence 
tests is the frequent association of delinquency and mental 
deficiency. Although it has long been recognized that the 
proportion of feeble-mindedness among offenders is rather 
large, the real amount has, until recently, been underesti- 
mated even by the most competent students of criminology. 
The criminologists have been accustomed to give more at- 
tention to the physical than tothe mental correlates of crime. 
Thus, Lombroso and his followers subjected thousands of 
criminals to observation and measurement with regard to 
such physical traits as size and shape of the skull, bilateral 
asymmetries, anomalies of the ear, eye, nose, palate, teeth, 
hands, fingers, hair, dermal sensitivity, etc. The search was 
for physical “stigmata” characteristic of the “criminal 
type.” 
Although such studies performed an important service 
in creating a scientific interest in criminology, the theories 
of Lombroso have been wholly discredited by the results of 
intelligence tests. Such ee beyond 
any possibility of doubt, that the most important trait of 
at least 25 per cent of our criminals is mental weakness. 
The physical abnormalities which have been found se

ity, but the physical accompaniments .of feeble-minded- 
ness. They have no diagnostic significance except in so 
far as they are indications of mental deficiency. Without

exception, every study which has been made of the in- 
telligence level of delinquents has furnished convincing 
testimony as to the close relation existing between mental 
weakness and moral abnormality. Some of these findings 
are as follows: — 
Miss Renz tested 100 girls of the Ohio State Reformatory and 
reported 36 per cent as certainly feeble-minded. In every one of 
these cases the commitment papers had given the pronouncement 
“imtellect sound.” 
Under the direction of Dr. Goddard the Binet tests were given 
to 100 juvenile court cases, chosen at random, in Newark, New 
Jersey. Nearly half were classified as feeble-minded. One boy 17 
years old had 9-year intelligence; another of 1514 had 8-year 
intelligence. 
Of 56 delinquent girls 14 to 20 years of age tested by Hill and 
Goddard, almost half belonged either to the 9- or the 10-year 
level of intelligence. 
Dr. G. G. Fernald’s tests of 100 prisoners at the Massachusetts 
State Reformatory showed that at least 25 per cent were feeble- 
minded. | 
Of 1186 girls tested by Miss Dewson at the State Industrial 
School for Girls at Lancaster, Massachusetts, 28 per cent were 
found to have subnormal intelligence. 
Dr. Katherine Bement Davis's report on 1000 cases entered in 
the Bedford Home for Women, New York, stated that there was 
no doubt but that at least 157 were feeble-minded. Recently there 
has been established at this institution one of the most important 
research laboratories of the kind in the United States, with a 
trained psychologist, Dr. Mabel Fernald, in charge. 
Of 564 prostitutes investigated by Dr. Anna Dwyer in connec- 
tion with the Municipal Court of Chicago, only 3 per cent had 
gone beyond the fifth grade in school. Mental tests were not 
made, but from the data given it is reasonably certain that half or 
more were feeble-minded. 
Tests, by Dr. George Ordahl and Dr. Louise Ellison Ordahl, of 
cases in the Geneva School for Girls, Geneva, Illinois, showed 
that, on a conservative basis of classification, at least 18 per cent 
were feeble-minded. At the Joliet Prison, Illinois, the same 
authors found 50 per cent of the female prisoners feeble-minded,
-P-A-G-E-29
    
USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 9 
and 26 per cent of the male prisoners. At the St. Charles School 
for Boys 26 per cent were feeble-minded. 
Tests, by Dr. J. Harold Williams, of 150 delinquents in the 
Whittier State School for Boys, Whittier, California, gave 28 per 
cent feeble-minded and 25 per cent at or near the border-line. 
About 300 other juvenile delinquents tested by Mr. Williams gave 
approximately the same figures. As a result of these findings a 
research laboratory has been established at the Whittier School, 
with Dr. Williams in charge. In the girls’ division of the Whittier 
School, Dr. Grace Fernald collected a large amount of psychologi- 
cal data on more than 100 delinquent girls. The findings of this 
investigation agree closely with those of Dr. Williams for the 
boys. 
At the State Reformatory, Jeffersonville, Indiana, Dr. von 
Klein-Schmid, in an unusually thorough psychological study of 
1000 young adult prisoners, finds the proportion of feeble-minded- 
ness not far from 50 per cent. 
But it is needless to multiply statistics. Those given are 
but samples. Tests are at present being made in most of 
the progressive prisons, reform schools, and juvenile courts 
throughout the country, and while there are minor discrep- 
ancies in regard to the actual percentage who are feeble- 
minded, there is no investigator who denies the fearful 
réle played by mental deficiency in the production of vice, 
crime, and delinquency.! 
Heredity studies of “degenerate” families have con- 
firmed, in a striking way, the testimony secured by intelli- 
gence tests. Among the best known of such families are 
the “ Kallikaks,” the “ Jukes,” the “Hill Folk,” the 
“Nams,” the “ Zeros,” and the “ Ishmaelites.” 
The Kallikak family. Martin Kallikak was a youthful soldier in 
the Revolutionary War. At a tavern frequented by the militia he 
met a feeble-minded girl, by whom he became the father of a 
feeble-minded son. In 1912 there were 480 known direct descend- 
ants of this temporary union. It is known that 36 of these were

10 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
illegitimates, that 33 were sexually immoral, that 24 were con- 
firmed alcoholics, and that 8 kept houses of ill-fame. The explana- 
tion of so much immorality will be obvious when it is stated that 
of the 480 descendants, 143 were known to be feeble-minded, and 
that many of the others were of questionable mentality. 
A few years after returning from the war this same Martin 
Kallikak married a respectable girl of good family. From this 
union 496 individuals have been traced in direct descent, and in 
this branch of the family there were no illegitimate children, no 
immoral women, and only one man who was sexually loose. There 
were no criminals, no keepers of houses of ill-fame, and only two 
confirmed alcoholics. Again the explanation is clear when it is 
stated that this branch of the family did not contain a single 
feeble-minded individual. It was made up of doctors, lawyers, 
judges, educators, traders, and landholders.! 
The Hill Folk. The Hill Folk are a New England family of 
which 709 persons have been traced. Of the married women, 24 
per cent had given birth to illegitimate offspring, and 10 per cent 
were prostitutes. Criminal tendencies were clearly shown in 24 
members of the family, while alcoholism was still more common. 
The proportion of feeble-minded was 48 per cent. It was esti- 
mated that the Hill Folk have in the last sixty years cost the State 
of Massachusetts, in charitable relief, care of feeble-minded, 
epileptic, and insane, conviction and punishment for crime, pros- 
titution, pauperism, etc., at least $500,000.? 
The Nam family and the Jukes give equally dark pictures as 
regards criminality, licentiousness, and alcoholism, and although 
feeble-mindedness was not as fully investigated in these families 
as in the Kallikaks and the Hill Folk, the evidence is strong that 
it was a leading trait. The 784 Nams who were traced included 187 
altoholics, 232 women and 199 men known to be licentious, and 
40 who became prisoners. It is estimated that the Nams have 
already cost the State nearly $1,500,000.3 
Of 540 Jukes, practically one fifth were born out of wedlock, 37 
were known to be syphilitic, 53 had been in the poorhouse, 76

had been sentenced to prison, and of 229 women of marriageable 
age 128 were prostitutes. The economic damage inflicted upon the 
State of New York by the Jukes in seventy-five years was esti- 
mated at more than $1,300,000, to say nothing of diseases and 
other evil influences which they helped to spread.! 
But why do the feeble-minded tend so strongly to be- 
come delinquent? The answer may be stated in simple 
terms. Morality depends upon two things: (a) the ability 
to foresee and to weigh the possible consequences for self 
and others of different kinds of behavior; and (6) upon 
the willingness and capacity to exercise self-restraint. 
That there are many intelligent criminals is due to the 
fact that (a) may exist without (b). On the other hand, 
(b) presupposes (a). In other words, not all criminals are 
feeble-minded, but all feeble-minded are at least potential 
criminals. That every feeble-minded woman is a potential 
prostitute would hardly be disputed by any one. Moral 
judgment, like business judgment, social judgment, or any 
other kind of higher thought process, is a function of in- 
telligence. Morality cannot flower and fruit if intelligence 
remains infantile. 
All of us in early childhood lacked moral responsibility. 
We were as rank egoists as any criminal. Respect for the 
feelings, the property rights, or any other kind of rights, of 
others had to be laboriously acquired under the whip of 
discipline. But by degrees we learned that only when in- 
stincts are curbed, and conduct is made to conform to 
principles established formally or accepted tacitly by our 
neighbors, does this become a livable world for any of us. 
Without the intelligence to generalize the particular, to: 
foresee distant consequences of present acts, to weigh 
these foreseen consequences in the nice balance of imagina-

tion, morality cannot be learned. When the adult body, 
with its adult instincts, is coupled with the undeveloped 
intelligence and weak inhibitory powers of a 10-year-old 
child, the only possible outcome, except in those cases 
where constant guardianship is exercised by relatives or 
friends, is some form of delinquency. 
Considering the tremendous cost of vice and crime, which 
in all probability amounts to not less than $500,000,000 
per year in the United States alone, it is evident that psy- 
chological testing has found here one of its richest applica- 
tions. Before offenders can be subjected to rational treat- 
ment a mental diagnosis is necessary, and while intelligence 
tests do not constitute a complete psychological diagnosis, 
they are, nevertheless, its most indispensable part. 
Intelligence tests of superior children. The number of 
children with very superior ability is approximately as 
great as the number of feeble-minded. The future wel- 
fare of the country hinges, in no small degree, upon the 
right education of these superior children. Whether civi- 
lization moves on and up depends most on the advances 
made by creative thinkers and leaders in science, politics, 
art, morality, and religion. Moderate ability can follow, 
or imitate, but genius must show the way. 
Through the leveling influences of the educational lock- 
step such children at present are often lost in the masses. 
It is a rare child who is able to break this lockstep by extra 
promotions. Taking the country over, the ratio of “ ac- 
celerates ” to “ retardates ” in the school is approximately 
1 to 10. Through the handicapping influences of poverty, 
social neglect, physical defects, or educational maladjust- 
ments, many potential leaders in science, art, govern- 
ment, and industry are denied the opportunity of a normal 
development. The use we have made of exceptional ability 
reminds one of the primitive methods of surface mining.
-P-A-G-E-33
  USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 13 
It is necessary to explore the nation’s hidden resources of 
intelligence. The common saying that “ genius will out ” 
is one of those dangerous half-truths with which too many 
people rest content. 
Psychological tests show that children of superior abil- 
ity are very likely to be misunderstood in school. The 
writer has tested more than a hundred children who were 
as much above average intelligence as moron defectives 
are below. The large majority of these were found located 
below the school grade warranted by their intellectual 
level. One third had failed to reap any advantage what- 
ever, in terms of promotion, from their very superior intel- 
ligence. Even genius languishes when kept over-long at 
tasks that are too easy. 
Our data show that teachers sometimes fail entirely to 
recognize exceptional superiority in a pupil, and that the 
degree of such superiority is rarely estimated with anything 
like the accuracy which is possible to the psychologist after 
a one-hour examination. 8B. F., for example, was a little 
over 714 years old when tested. He was in the third grade, 
and was therefore thought by his teacher to be accelerated 
in school. This boy’s intelligence, however, was found to 
be above the 12-year level. There is no doubt that his 
mental ability would have enabled him, with a few months 
of individual instruction, to carry fifth or even sixth-grade 
work as easily as third, and without injury to body or 
mind. Nevertheless, the teacher and both the parents of 
this child had found nothing remarkable about him. In 
reality he belongs to a grade of genius not found oftener 
than once in several thousand cases. 
Another illustration is that of a boy of 1014 years who 
tested at the “average adult” level. He was doing superior 
work in the sixth grade, but according to the testimony 
of the teacher had “ no unusual ability.” It was ascertained
-P-A-G-E-34
  14 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
from the parents that this boy, at an age when most chil- 
dren are reading fairy stories, had a passion for standard 
medical literature and textbooks in physical science. Yet, 
after more than a year of daily contact with this young 
genius (who is a relative of Meyerbeer, the composer), the 
teacher had discovered no symptoms of unusual ability.! 
Teachers should be better trained in detecting the signs 
of superior ability. Every child who consistently gets high 
marks in his school work with apparent ease should be given 
a mental examination, and if his intelligence level war- 
rants it he should either be given extra* promotions, or 
placed in a special class for superior children where faster 
progress can be made. The latter is the better plan, because 
it obviates the necessity of skipping grades; it permits 
rapid but continuous progress. 
The usual reluctance of teachers to give extra promo- 
_ tions probably rests upon three factors: (1) mere inertia; 
(2) a natural unwillingness to part with exceptionally satis- 
factory pupils; and (3) the traditional belief that preco- 
cious children should be held back for fear of dire physical 
or mental consequences. 
In order to throw light on the question whether excep- 
tionally bright children are specially likely to be one-sided, 
nervous, delicate, morally abnormal, socially unadaptable, 
or otherwise peculiar, the writer has secured rather ex- 
tensive information regarding 31 children whose mental 
age was found by intelligence tests to be 25 per cent above 
the actual age. "This degree of intelligence is possessed by 
about 2 children out of 100, and is nearly as far above 
average intelligence as high-grade feeble-mindedness is 
below. The supplementary information, which was fur- 
nished in most cases by the teachers, may be summarized 
as follows: —

-P-A-G-E-35
USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 15 
  1. Ability special or general. In the case of 20 out of 31 the abil- 
ity is decidedly general, and with 2 it is mainly general. The 
talents of 5 are described as more or less special, but only in 
one case is it remarkably so. Doubtful 4. 
2. Health. 15 are said to be perfectly healthy; 13 have one or 
more physical defects; 4 of the 13 are described as delicate; 
4 have adenoids; 4 have eye-defects; 1 lisps; and 1 stutters. 
These figures are about the same as one finds in any group 
of ordinary children. 
8. Studiousness. “Extremely studious,” 15; “usually studious” 
or “fairly studious,” 11; “not particularly studious,” 5; 
“lazy,” 0. 
4. Moral traits. Favorable traits only, 19; one or more unfavor- 
able traits, 8; no answer, 4. The eight with unfavor- 
able moral traits are described as follows: 2 are “very self- 
willed”’; 1 “needs close watching”’; 1 is “cruel to animals”; 
1 is “untruthful”; 1 is “unreliable”; 1 is ‘‘a bluffer’”’; 1 is 
“sexually abnormal,” “perverted,” and “vicious.” 
It will be noted that with the exception of the last child, 
the moral irregularities mentioned can hardly be regarded, 
from the psychological point of view, as essentially abnormal. 
It is perhaps a good rather than a bad sign for a child to be 
self-willed; most children “‘need close watching”; and a 
certain amount of untruthfulness in children is the rule and 
not the exception. 
5. Social adaptability. Socially adaptable, 25; not adaptable, 
2; doubtful, 4. 
6. Attitude of other children. “Favorable,” “friendly,” “liked 
by everybody,” “much admired,” “popular,” ete., 26; “not 
liked,” 1; “inspires repugnance,” 1; no answer, 1. 
7. Is child a leader? “Yes,” 14; “no,” or “not particularly,” 12; 
doubtful, 5. 
8. Is play life normal? “Yes,” 26; “no,” 1; “hardly,” 1; doubt- 
ful, 3. 
9. Is child spoiled or vain? “No,” 22; “yes,” 5; “somewhat,” 2; 
no answer, 2. 
According to the above data, exceptionally intelligent 
children are fully as likely to be healthy as ordinary chil- 
dren; their ability is far more often general than special,
-P-A-G-E-36
  16 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
  they are studious above the average, really serious faults 
are not common among them, they are nearly always so- 
cially adaptable, are sought after as playmates and com- 
panions, their play life is usually normal, they are leaders 
far oftener than other children, and notwithstanding their 
many really superior qualities they are seldom vain or 
spoiled. 
It would be greatly to the advantage of such children if 
their superior ability were more promptly and fully recog- 
nized, and if (under proper medical supervision, of course) 
they were promoted as rapidly as their mental develop- 
ment would warrant. Unless they are given the grade of 
work which calls forth their best efforts, they run the risk 
of falling into lifelong habits of submaximum efficiency. 
The danger in the case of such children is not over-pressure, 
but under-pressure. 
Intelligence tests as a basis for grading. Not only in the 
case of retarded or exceptionally bright children, but with 
many others also, intelligence tests can aid in correctly 
placing the child in school. 
The pupil who enters one school system from another is 
a case in point. Such a pupil nearly always suffers a loss 
of time. The indefensible custom is to grade the newcomet 
down a little, because, forsooth, the textbooks he has 
studied may have differed somewhat from those he is 
about to take up, or because the school system from which 
he comes may be looked upon as inferior. Teachers are too 
often suspicious of all othér educational methods besides 
their own. The present treatment accorded such children, 
which so often does them injustice and injury, should be 
replaced by an intelligence test. The hour of time required 
for the test is a small matter in comparison with the loss 
of a school term by the pupils. 
Indeed, it would be desirable to make all promotions on
-P-A-G-E-37
    
USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 17 
the basis chiefly of intellectual ability. Hitherto the school 
has had to rely on tests of information because reliable tests 
of intelligence have not until recently been available. As 
trained Binet examiners become more plentiful, the infor- 
mation standard will have to give way to the criterion which 
asks merely that the child shall be able to do the work of 
the next higher grade. The brief intelligence test is not 
only more enlightening than the examination; it is also 
more hygienic. The school examination is often for the 
child a source of worry and anxiety; the mental test is an 
interesting and pleasant experience. 
Intelligence tests for vocational fitness. The time is 
probably not far distant when intelligence tests will be- 
come a recognized and widely used instrument for deter- 
mining vocational fitness. Of course, it is not claimed that 
tests are available which will tell us unerringly exactly 
what one of a thousand or more occupations a given indi- 
vidual is best fitted to pursue. But when thousands of 
children who have been tested by the Binet scale have been 
followed out into the industrial world, and their success in 
various occupations noted, we shall know fairly definitely 
the vocational significance of any given degree of mental 
inferiority or superiority. Researches of this kind will 
ultimately determine the minimum “ intelligence quotient ” 
necessary for success in each leading occupation. 
Industrial concerns doubtless suffer enormous losses from 
the employment of persons whose mental ability is not 
equal to the tasks they are expected to perform. The pres- 
ent methods of trying out new employees, transferring them 
to simpler and simpler jobs as their inefficiency becomes 
apparent, is wasteful and to a great extent unnecessary. 
A cheaper and more satisfactory method would be to em- 
ploy a psychologist to examine applicants for positions and 
to weed out the unfit. Any business employing as many

18 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE . 
as five hundred or a thousand workers, as, for example, a 
large department store, could save in this way several 
times the salary of a well-trained psychologist. 
That the industrially inefficient are often of subnormal 
intelligence has already been demonstrated in a number of 
psychological investigations. Of 150 “hoboes” tested under 
the direction of the writer by Mr. Knollin, at least 15 per 
cent belonged to the moron grade of mental deficiency, 
and almost as many more were border-line cases. To be 
sure, a large proportion were found perfectly normal, 
and a few even decidedly superior in mental ability, but 
the ratio of mental deficiency was ten or fifteen times as 
high as that holding for the general population. Several 
had as low as 9- or 10-year intelligence, and one had a 
mental level of 7 years. The industrial history of such 
subjects, as given by themselves, was always about what 
the mental level would lead us to expect — unskilled work, 
lack of interest in accomplishment, frequent discharge from 
jobs, discouragement, and finally the “ road.” 
The above findings have been fully paralleled by Mr. 
Glenn Johnson and Professor Eleanor Rowland, of Reed 
College, who tested 108 unemployed charity cases in Port- 
land, Oregon. Both of these investigators made use of the 
Stanford revision of the Binet scale, which is especially 
serviceable in distinguishing the upper-grade defectives 
from normals. 
It hardly needs to be emphasized that when charity 
organizations help the feeble-minded to float along in the 
social and industrial world, and to produce and rear 
children after their kind, a doubtful service is rendered. 
A little psychological research would aid the united chari- 
ties of any city to direct their expenditures into more profit- 
able channels than would otherwise be possible. 
Other uses of intelligence tests. Another important use
-P-A-G-E-39
  USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 19 
of intelligence tests is in the study of the factors which 
influence mental development. It is desirable that we should 
be able to guard the child against influences which affect 
mental development unfavorably; but as long as these in- 
fluences have not been sifted, weighed, and measured, we 
have nothing but conjecture on which to base our efforts 
in this direction. 
When we search the literature of child hygiene for 
reliable evidence as to the injurious effects upon mental 
ability of malnutrition, decayed teeth, obstructed breath- 
ing, reduced sleep, bad ventilation, insufficient exercise, 
etc., we are met by endless assertion painfully unsup- 
ported by demonstrated fact. We have, indeed, very little 
exact knowledge regarding the mental effects of any of 
the factors just mentioned. When standardized mental 
tests have come into more general use, such influences 
will be easy to detect wherever they are really present. 
Again, the most important question of heredity is that 
regarding the inheritance of intelligence; but this is a prob- 
lem which cannot be attacked at all without some accurate 
means of identifying the thing which is the object of study. 
Without the use of scales for measuring intelligence we 
can give no better answer as to the essential difference 
between a genius and a fool than is to be found in legend 
and fiction. 
Applying this to school children, it means that without 
such tests we cannot know to what extent a child’s mental 
performances are determined by environment and to what 
extent by heredity. Is the place of the so-called lower classes 
in the social and industrial scale the result of their inferior 
native endowment, or is their apparent inferiority merely 
a result of their inferior home and school training? Is 
genius more common among children of the educated 
classes than among the children of the ignorant and poor?  
-P-A-G-E-40
  20 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Are the inferior races really inferior, or are they merely 
unfortunate in their lack of opportunity to learn? 
Only intelligence tests can answer these questions and 
grade the raw material with which education works. 
, Without them we can never distinguish the results of our 
educational efforts with a given child from the influence of 
the child’s original endowment. Such tests would have 
told us, for example, whether the much-discussed “‘ wonder 
children,’ such as the Sidis and Wiener boys and the 
Stoner girl, owe their precocious intellectual prowess to 
superior training (as their parents believe) or to superior 
native ability. The supposed effects upon mental develop- 
ment of new methods of mind training, which are exploited 
so confidently from time to time (e.g., the Montessori 
method and the various systems of sensory and motor 
training for the feeble-minded), will have to be checked up 
by the same kind of scientific measurement. 
In all these fields intelligence tests are certain to play an 
ever-increasing rdle. With the exception of moral charac- 
ter, there is nothing as significant for a child’s future as his 
grade of intelligence. Even health itself is likely to have 
less\ influence in determining success in life. Although 
strength and swiftness have always had great survival value 
among the lower animals, these characteristics have long 
since lost their supremacy in man’s struggle for existence. 
For us the rule of brawn has been broken, and _intelli- 
gence has become the decisive factor in success. Schools, 
railroads, factories, and the largest commercial concerns 
may be successfully managed by persons who are physically 
weak or even sickly. One who has intelligence constantly 
measures opportunities against his own strength or weak- 
ness and adjusts himself to conditions by following those 
leads which promise most toward the realization of his 
individual possibilities.

USES OF INTELLIGENCE TESTS 21 
All classes of intellects, the weakest as well as the strong- 
est, will profit by the application of their talents to tasks 
which are consonant with their ability. \When we have 
learned the lessons which intelligence tests eae to teach, 
we shall no longer blame mentally defective workmen for 
their industrial inefficiency, punish weak-minded children 
because of their inability to learn, or imprison and hang 
mentally defective criminals because they lacked the in- 
telligence to appreciate the ordinary codes of social conduct.

CHAPTER II 
SOURCES OF ERROR IN JUDGING INTELLIGENCE 
Are intelligence tests superfluous? Binet tells us that 
he often encountered the criticism that intelligence tests 
are superfluous, and that in going to so much trouble to 
devise his measuring scale he was forcing an open door. 
Those who made this criticism believed that the observant 
teacher or parent is able to make an offhand estimate of a 
child’s intelligence which is accurate enough. “ Itisa stupid 
teacher,” said one, ‘‘ who needs a psychologist to tell her 
which pupils are not intelligent.”” Every one who uses in- 
telligence tests meets this attitude from time to time. ~ 
This should not be surprising or discouraging. It is 
only natural that those who are unfamiliar with the methods 
of psychology should occasionally question their validity 
or worth, just as there are many excellent people who do 
not “believe in” vaccination against typhoid and small 
pox, operations for appendicitis, etc. 
There is an additional reason why the applications of 
psychology have to overcome a good deal of conservatism 
and skepticism; namely, the fact that every one, whether 
psychologically trained or not, acquires in the ordinary 
experiences of life a certain degree of expertness in the 
observation and interpretation of mental traits. The 
possession of this little fund of practical working knowl- 
edge makes most people slow to admit any one’s claim to 
greater expertness. When the astronomer tells us the dis- 
tance to Jupiter, we accept his statement, because we
-P-A-G-E-43
  SOURCES OF ERROR IN JUDGING 23 
recognize that our ordinary experience affords no basis for 
judgment about such matters. But every one acquires more 
or less facility in distinguishing the coarser differences 
among people in intelligence, and this half-knowledge 
naturally generates a certain amount of resistance to the 
more refined method of tests. ‘ 
It should be evident, however, that we need more than 
the ability merely to distinguish a genius from a simple- 
ton, just as a physician needs something more than the 
ability to distinguish an athlete from a man dying of con- 
sumption. It is necessary to have a definite and accurate 
diagnosis, one which will differentiate more finely the many 
degrees and qualities of intelligence. Just as in the case of 
physical illness, we need to know not merely that the 
patient is sick, but also why he is sick, what organs are in- 
volved, what course the illness will run, and what physical 
work the patient can safely undertake, so in the case of a 
retarded child, we need to know the exact degree of intel- 
lectual deficiency, what mental functions are chiefly con- 
cerned in the defect, whether the deficiency is due to in- 
nate endowment, to physical illness, or to faults of educa- 
tion, and what lines of mental activity the child will be able 
to pursue with reasonable hope of success. In the diagnosis 
of a case of malnutrition, the up-to-date physician does not 
depend upon general symptoms, but instead makes a blood 
test to determine the exact number of red corpuscles per 
cubic millimeter of blood and the exact percentage of 
hemoglobin. He has learned that external appearances 
are often misleading. Similarly, every psychologist who is 
experienced in the mental examination of school children 
knows that his own or the teacher’s estimate of a child’s 
intelligence is subject to grave and frequent error. 
The necessity of standards. In thie first place, in order 
to judge an individual’s intelligence it is necessary to have  
-P-A-G-E-44
  w THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
in mind some standard as to what constitutes normal in- 
telligence. This the ordinary parent or teacher does not 
have. In the case of school children, for example, each pupil 
is judged with reference to the average intelligence of the 
class. But the teacher has no means of knowing whether the 
average for her class is above, equal to, or below that for 
children in general. Her standard may be too high, too low, 
vague, mechanical, or fragmentary. The same, of course, 
holds in the case of parents or any one else attempting to 
estimate intelligence on the basis of common observation. 
The intelligence of retarded children usually over- 
estimated. One of the most common errors made by the 
teacher is to overestimate the intelligence of the over-age 
pupil. This is because she fails to take account of age dif- 
ferences and estimates intelligence on the basis of the 
child’s school performance in the grade where he happens 
to be located. She tends to overlook the fact that quality 
of school work is no index of intelligence unless age is taken 
into account. The question should be, not, “ Is this child 
doing his school work well? ” but rather, “ In what school 
grade should a child of this age be able to do satisfactory 
work?” A high-grade imbecile may do average work in 
the first grade, and a high-grade moron average work in 
the third or fourth grade, provided only they are sufficiently 
over-age for the grade in question. 
Our experience in testing children for segregaticn in 
special classes has time and again brought this fallacy of 
teachers to our attention. We have often found one or more 
feeble-minded children in a class after the teacher had 
confidently asserted that there was not a single exception- 
ally dull child present. In every case where there has been 
opportunity to follow the later school progress of such a 
child the validity of the intelligence test has been fully 
confirmed.
-P-A-G-E-45
  
  SOURCES OF ERROR IN JUDGING 25 
The following are typical examples of the neglect of teach- 
ers to take the age factor into account when estimating 
the intelligence of the over-age child: — 
A. R. Girl, age 11; in low second grade. She was able to do the 
work of this grade, not well, but passably. The teacher’s judgment 
as to this child’s intelligence was “dull but not defective.” What 
the teacher overlooked was the fact that she had judged the child 
by a 7-year standard, and that, instead of only being able to do the 
work of the second grade indifferently, a child of this age should 
have been equal to the work of the fifth grade. In reality, A. R. is 
definitely feeble-minded. Although she is from a home of average 
culture, is 11 years old, and has attended school five years, she 
has barely the intelligence of the average child of six years. 
D.C. Boy, age 17; in fifth grade. His teacher knew that he was 
dull, but had not thought of him as belonging to the class of feeble- 
minded. She had judged this boy by the 11-year standard and 
had perhaps been further misled by his normal appearance and 
exceptionally satisfactory behavior. The Binet test quickly 
showed that he had a mental level of approximately 9 years. There 
is little probability that his comprehension will ever surpass that 
of the average 10-year-old. 
R. A. Boy, age 17; mental age 11; sitth grade; school work 
“nearly average”’; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “average.” Test 
plainly shows this child to be a high-grade moron, or border-liner 
at best. Had attended school regularly 11 years and had made 6 
grades.’ Teacher had compared child with his 12-year-old class- 
matés. 
H. A. Boy, age 14; mental age 9-6; low fourth grade; school work 
“inferior”? ; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “average.”’ The teacher 
blamed the inferior quality of school work to “bad home environ- 
ment.” As a matter of fact, the boy’s father is feeble-minded and 
the normality of the mother is questionable. An older brother is 
in a reform school. We are perfectly safe in predicting that this 
boy will not complete the eighth grade even if he attends school 
till he is 21 years of age. 
F.I. Boy, age 12-11; mental age 9-4; third grade; school work 
“average”; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “average”; social en- 
vironment “average”; health good and attendance regular. Intelli- 
gence and school success are what we should expect of an average 
9-year-old. 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
    26 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
D. A. Boy, age 12; mental age 9-2; third grade; school work “‘in- 
ferior”; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “average.” Teacher im- 
putes inferior school work to “absence from school and lack of 
interest in books”; we have yet to find a child with a mental age 
25 per cent below chronological age who was particularly inter- 
ested in books or enthusiastic about school. 
C. U. Girl, age 10; mental age 7-8; second grade; school work 
“average”; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “average.” Teacher 
blames adenoids and bad teeth for retardation. No doubt of 
child’s mental deficiency. 
P.I. Girl, age 8-10; mental age 6-7; has been in first grade 244 
years; school work “‘average”’; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “‘aver- 
age.” The mother and one brother of this girl are both feeble- 
minded. 
H. 0. Girl, age 7-10; mental age 5-2; first grade for 2 years; 
school work “‘inferior”’; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “average.” 
The teacher nevertheless adds, ‘This child is not normal, but her 
ability to respond to drill shows that she has intelligence.” It is 
of course true that even feeble-minded children of 5-year intelli- 
gence are able to profit a little from drill. Their weakness comes to 
light in their inability to perform higher types of mental activity. 
The intelligence of superior children usually underesti- 
mated. We have already mentioned the frequent failure of 
teachers and parents to recognize superior ability.! The fal- 
lacy here is again largely due to the neglect of the age factor, 
but the resulting error is in the opposite direction from that 
set forth above. The superior child is likely to be a year or 
two younger than the average child of his grade, and is ac- 
cordingly judged by a standard which is too high. The 
following are illustrations: — 
M. L. Girl, age 11-2; mental age “average adult” (16); sixth 
grade; school work “‘superior”; teacher’s estimate of intelligence 
“average.” Teacher credits superior school work to “unusual 
home advantages.”” Father a college professor. The teacher con- 
siders the child accelerated in school. In reality she ought to be in 
the second year of high school instead of in the sixth grade.

  SOURCES OF ERROR IN JUDGING QT 
H. A. Boy, age 11; mental age 14; sixth grade; school work “aver- 
age’’; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “average.” According to the 
supplementary information the boy is “wonderfully attentive,” 
“studious,” and possessed of “‘all-round ability.” The estimate of 
“average intelligence” was probably the result of comparing him 
with classmates who averaged about a year older. 
K. R. Girl, age 6-1; mental age 8-5; second grade; school work 
“‘average”’; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “superior’’; social en- 
vironment “average.” Is it not evident that a child from ordinary 
social environment, who does work of average quality in the second 
grade when barely 6 years of age, should be judged “very superior” 
rather than merely “superior” in intelligence? The intelligence 
quotient of this girl is 140, which is not reached by more than one 
child in two hundred. 
S. A. Boy, age 8-10; mental age 10-9; fourth grade; school work 
“average”; teacher’s estimate of intelligence “average.” ‘Teacher 
attributed school acceleration to “‘studiousness” and “delight in ©: 
school work.” It would be more reasonable to infer that these 
traits are indications of unusually superior intelligence. 
Other fallacies in the estimation of intelligence. An- 
other source of error in the teacher’s judgment comes from 
the difficulty in distinguishing genuine dullness from the 
mental condition which results sometimes from unfavorable 
social environment or lack of training. 
V. P. Boy, age 7. Had attended school one year and had 
profited very little from the instruction. He had learned to read 
very little, spoke chiefly in monosyllables, and seemed “queer.” The 
teacher suspected his intelligence and asked for a mental examina- 
tion. The Binet test showed that except for vocabulary, which 
was unusually low, there was practically no mental retardation. In- 
quiry disclosed the fact that the boy’s parents were uneducated 
deaf-mutes, and that the boy had associated little with other 
children. Four years later this boy was doing fairly well in school, 
though a year retarded because of his unfavorable home environ- 
ment. 
X.Y. Boy, age 10. Son of a successful business man, he was 
barely able to read in the second reader. The Binet test revealed 
an intelligence level which was absolutely normal. The boy was
-P-A-G-E-48
  28 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
removed to a special class where he could receive individual at- 
tention, and two years later was found doing good work in a regu- 
lar class of the fifth grade. His bad beginning seemed to have been 
due to an unfavorable attitude toward school work, due in turn to 
lack of discipline in the home, and to the fact that because of the 
father’s frequent change of business headquarters the boy had 
never attended one school longer than three months. 
/ Another source of error in judging intelligence from com- 
“mon observation is the tendency to overestimate the in- 
telligence of the sprightly, talkative, sanguine child, and to 
underestimate the intelligence of the child who is less 
emotional, reacts slowly, and talks little,, One occasion- 
ally finds a feeble-minded adult, perhaps of only 9- or 10- 
year intelligence, whose verbal fluency, mental liveliness, 
and self-confidence would mislead the offhand judgment of 
even the psychologist. One individual of this type, a bor- 
der-line case at best, was accustomed to harangue street 
audiences and had served as “ major ” in “ Kelly’s Army,” 
a horde of several hundred unemployed men who a few years 
ago organized and started to march from San Francisco to 
Washington. 
Binet’s questionnaire on teachers’ methods of judging 
intelligence.! Aroused by the skepticism so often shown 
toward his test method, Binet decided to make a little 
study of the methods by which teachers are accustomed to 
arrive at a judgment as to a child’s intelligence. Accord- 
ingly, through the codperation of the director of elementary 
education in Paris, he secured answers from a number of 
teachers to the following questions: — 
1. By what means do you judge the intelligence of your pupils? 
2. How often have you been deceived in your judgments ? 
About 40 replies were received. Most of the answers to 
the first question were vague, one-sided, “ verbal,” or 
1 See p. 169 ff. of reference 2, at end of this book
-P-A-G-E-49
    
SOURCES OF ERROR IN JUDGING 29 
bookish. Only a few showed much psychological dis- 
crimination as to what intelligence is and what its symp- 
toms are. There was a very general tendency to judge 
intelligence by success in one or more of the school studies. 
Some thought that ability to master arithmetic was a sure 
criterion. Others were influenced almost entirely by the 
pupil’s ability to read. One teacher said that the child who 
can “read so expressively as to make you feel the punc- 
tuation”’ is certainly intelligent, an observation which 
is rather good, as far as it goes. A few judged intelligence 
by the pupil’s knowledge of such subjects as history and 
geography, which, as Binet points out, is to confound in- 
telligence with the ability to memorize. “ Memory,” says 
Binet, is a “ great simulator of intelligence.” It is a wise 
teacher who is not deceived by it. Only a small minority 
mentioned resourcefulness in play, capacity to adjust to 
practical situations, or any other out-of-school criteria. 
Some suggested asking the pupil such questions as the 
following: — 
“Why do you love your parents?” “If it takes three persons 
seven hours to do a piece of work, would it take seven persons any 
longer?” “Which would you rather have, a fourth of a pie, or a 
half of a half?” “Which is heavier, a pound of feathers or a pound 
of lead?” “If you had twenty cents what would you do with it?” 
A great many based their judgment mainly on the gen- 
eral appearance of the face and eyes. An “active” or 
“passive” expression of the eyes was looked upon as es- 
pecially significant. One teacher thought that a mere 
“ glance of the eye ” was sufficient to display the grade of 
intelligence. If the eyes are penetrating, reflective, or show 
curiosity, the child must be intelligent; if they are heavy 
and expressionless, he must be dull. The mobility of coun- 
tenance came in for frequent mention, also the shape of 
the head.
-P-A-G-E-50
  30 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
No one will deny that intelligence displays itself to a 
greater or less extent in the features; but how, asks Binet, 
are we going to standardize a “ glance of the eye” or an 
“expression of curiosity ” so that it will serve as an exact 
measure of intelligence? 
The fact is, the more one sees of feeble-minded children, 
the less reliance one comes to place upon facial expression 
as a sign of intelligence. Some children who are only slightly 
backward have the general appearance of low-grade im- 
beciles. On the other hand, not a few who are distinctly 
feeble-minded are pretty and attractive. With many such 
children a ready smile takes the place of comprehension. 
If the smile is rather sweet and sympathetic, as is often 
the case, the observer is almost sure to be deceived. 
As regards the shape of the head, peculiar conformation 
of the ears, and other “ stigmata,” science long ago demon- 
strated that these are ordinarily of little or no significance. 
In reply to the second question, some teachers stated 
that they never made a mistake, while others admitted 
failure in one case out of three. Still others said, ‘ Once 
in ten years,” “ once in twenty years,” “ once in a thousand 
times,” ete. 
As Binet remarks, the answers to this question are not 
very enlightening. In the first place, the teacher as a rule 
loses sight of the pupil when he has passed from her care, 
and seldom has opportunity of finding out whether his 
later success belies her judgment or confirms it. Errors 
go undiscovered for the simple reason that there is no op- 
portunity to check them up. In the second place, her esti- 
mate is so rough that an error must be very great in order 
to have any meaning. If I say that a man is six feet and 
two inches tall, it is easy enough to apply a measuring 
stick and prove the correctness or incorrectness of my as- 
sertion. But if I say simply that the man is “ rather tall,”
-P-A-G-E-51
  SOURCES OF ERROR IN JUDGING 31 
r “very tall,” the error must be very extreme before we 
can expose it, particularly since the estimate can itself be 
checked up only by observation and not by controlled ex- 
periment. 
The teachers’ answers seem to justify three conclusions: — 
1. Teachers do not have a very definite idea of what 
constitutes intelligence. They tend to confuse it variously 
with capacity for memorizing, facility in reading, ability 
to master arithmetic, etc. On the whole, their standard 
is too academic. They fail to appreciate the one-sidedness 
of the school’s demands upon intelligence. 
In a quaintly humorous passage discussing this tendency, 
Binet characterizes the child in a class as dénaturé, a 
French word which we may translate (though rather too 
literally) as ‘“‘ denatured.” Too often this “ denatured ” 
child of the classroom is the only child the teacher knows. 
2. In judging intelligence teachers are too easily de- 
ceived by a sprightly attitude, a sympathetic expression, 
a glance of the eye, or a chance “ bump ” on the head. 
8. Although a few teachers seem to realize the many 
possibilities of error, the majority show rather undue con- 
fidence in the accuracy of their judgment. 
Binet’s experiment on how teachers test intelligence.’ 
Finally, Binet had three teachers come to his laboratory to 
judge the intelligence of children whom they had never 
seen before. Each spent an afternoon in the laboratory and 
examined five pupils. In each case the teacher was left 
free to arrive at a conclusion in her own way. Binet, who 
remained in the room and took notes, recounts with play- 
ful humor how the teachers were unavoidably compelled 
to resort to the much-abused test method, although their 
attempts at using it were sometimes, from the psycholo- 
gist’s point of view, amusingly clumsy. :

-P-A-G-E-52
  32 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
One teacher, for example, questioned the children about 
some canals and sluices which were in the vicinity, asking 
what their purpose was and how they worked. Another 
showed the children some pretty pictures, which she had 
brought with her for the purpose, and asked questions about 
them. Showing the picture of a garret, she asked how a 
garret differs from an ordinary room. One teacher asked 
whether in building a factory it was best to have the walls 
thick or thin. As King Edward had just died, another 
teacher questioned the children about the details of this 
event, in order to find out whether they were in the habit 
of reading the newspapers, or understood the things they 
heard others read. Other questions related to the names of 
the streets in the neighborhood, the road one should take 
to reach a certain point in the vicinity, etc. Binet notes 
that many of the questions were special, and were only 
applicable with the children of this particular school. 
The method of proposing the questions and judging the 
responses was also at fault. The teachers did not adhere 
consistently to any definite formula in giving a particular 
test to the different children. Instead, the questions were 
materially altered from time to time. One teacher scored 
the identical response differently for two children, giving 
one child more credit than the other because she had already 
judged his intelligence to be superior. In several cases the 
examination was needlessly delayed in order to instruct 
the child in what he did not know. 
The examination ended, quite properly for a teacher’s 
examination, with questions about history, literature, the 
metric system, etc., and with the recitation of a fable. 
A comparison of the results showed hardly any agree- 
ment among the estimates of the three teachers. When 
questioned about the standard that had been taken in ar- 
riving at their conclusions, one teacher said she had taken  
-P-A-G-E-53
    SOURCES OF ERROR IN JUDGING 33 
the answers of the first pupil as a point of departure, and 
that she had judged the other pupils by this one. Another 
judged all the children by a child of her acquaintance 
whom she knew to be intelligent. This was, of course, an 
unsafe method, because no one could say how the child 
taken as an ideal would have responded to the tests used 
with the five children. 
In summarizing the result of his little experiment, Binet 
points out that the teachers employed, as if by instinct, the 
very method which he himself recommends. In using it, 
however, they made numerous errors. Their questions were 
often needlessly long. Several were ‘‘ dilemma questions,” 
that is, answerable by yes or no. In such cases chance alone 
will cause fifty per cent of the answers to be correct. Some 
of the questions were merely tests of school knowledge. 
Others were entirely special, usable only with the children 
of this particular school on this particular day. Not all of 
the questions were put in the same terms, and a given re- 
sponse did not alwaysreceive the same score. When the chil- 
dren responded incorrectly or incompletely, they were often 
given help, but not always to the same extent. In other 
words, says Binet, it was evident that “ the teachers em- 
ployed very awkwardly a very excellent method.” 
The above remark is as pertinent as it is expressive. 
As the statement implies, the test method is but a refine- 
ment and standardization of the common-sense approach. 
Binet remarks that most people who inquire into his 
method of measuring intelligence do so expecting to find 
something very surprising and mysterious; and on seeing 
how much it resembles the methods which common sense 
employs in ordinary life, they heave a sigh of disappoint- 
ment and say, “Is that all?” Binet reminds us that the 
difference between the scientific and unscientific way of 
doing a thing is not necessarily a difference in the nature
-P-A-G-E-54
    34 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
of the method; it is often merely a difference in exactness. 
Science does the thing better, because it does it more 
accurately. 
It was of course not the purpose of Binet to cast a slur 
upon the good sense and judgment of teachers. The teach- 
ers who took part in the little experiment described above 
were Binet’s personal friends. The errors he points out in 
his entertaining and good-humored account of the experi- 
ment are inherent in the situation. They are the kind of 
errors which any person, however discriminating and ob- 
servant, is likely to make in estimating the intelligence of a 
subject without the use of standardized tests. 
It is the writer’s experience that the teacher’s estimate 
of a child’s intelligence is much more reliable than that of 
the average parent; more accurate even than that of the 
physician who has not had psychological training. 
Indeed, it is an exceptional school physician who is able 
to give any very valuable assistance to teachers in the 
classification of mentally exceptional children for special 
pedagogical treatment. 
This is only to be expected, for the physician has or- 
dinarily had much less instruction in psychology than the 
teacher, and of course infinitely less experience in judging 
the mental performances of children. Even if graduated 
from a first-rank medical school, the instruction he has 
received in the important subject of mental deficiency 
has probably been less adequate than that given to the 
students of a standard normal school. As a rule, the doctor 
has no equipment or special fitness which gives him any 
advantage over the teacher in acquiring facility in the use 
of intelligence tests. i 
As for parents, it would of course be unreasonable to 
expect from them a very accurate judgment regarding the 
mental peculiarities of their children. The difficulty is 
\ 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  
SOURCES OF ERROR IN JUDGING 35 
not simply that which comes from lack of special train- 
_ing. The presence of parental affection renders impartial 
judgment impossible. Still more serious are the effects of 
habituation to the child’s mental traits. As a result of 
such habituation the most intelligent parent tends to de- 
velop an unfortunate blindness to all sorts of abnormal- 
ities which exist in his own children. 
The only way of escape from the fallacies we have men- 
tioned lies in the use of some kind of refined psychological 
procedure. Binet testing is destined to become universally 
known and practiced in schools, prisons, reformatories, 
charity stations, orphan asylums, and even ordinary homes, 
for the same reason that Babcock testing has become uni- 
versal in dairying. Each is indispensable to its purpose.
-P-A-G-E-56
  
  CHAPTER III ‘ 
DESCRIPTION OF THE BINET-SIMON METHOD 
Essential nature of the scale. The Binet scale is made up 
of an extended series of tests in the nature of “ stunts,” 
or problems, success in which demands the exercise of in- 
telligence. As left by Binet, the scale consists of 54 tests, 
so graded in difficulty that the easiest lie well within the 
range of normal 3-year-old children, while the hardest tax 
the intelligence of the average adult. The problems are 
designed primarily to test native intelligence, not school 
knowledge or home training. They try to answer the ques- 
tion, “‘ How intelligent is this child?” How much the child 
has learned is of significance only in so far as it throws light 
on his ability to learn more. 
Binet fully appreciated the fact that intelligence is not 
homogeneous, that it has many aspects, and that no one 
kind of test will display it adequately. He therefore as- 
sembled for his intelligence scale tests of many different 
types, some of them designed to display differences of 
memory, others differences in power to reason, ability to 
compare, power of comprehension, time orientation, facil- 
ity in the use of number concepts, power to combine 
ideas into a meaningful whole, the maturity of appercep- 
tion, wealth of ideas, knowledge of common objects, ete. 
How the scale was derived. The tests were arranged in 
order of difficulty, as found by trying them upon some 
200 normal children of different ages from 3 to 15 years. 
It was found, for illustration, that a certain test was passed
-P-A-G-E-57
  THE BINET-SIMON METHOD 37 
by only a very small proportion of the younger children, 
say the 5-year-olds, and that the number passing this test 
increased rapidly in the succeeding years until by the age 
of 7 or 8 years, let us say, practically all the children were 
successful. If, in our supposed case, the test was passed by 
about two thirds to three fourths of the normal children 
aged 7 years, it was considered by Binet a test of 7-year 
intelligence. In like manner, a test passed by 65 to 75 per 
cent of the normal 9-year-olds was considered a test of 9- 
year intelligence, and so on. By trying out many different 
tests in this way it was possible to secure five tests to repre- 
sent each age from 3 to 10 years (excepting age 4, which has 
only four tests), five for age 12, five for 15, and five for 
adults, making 54 tests in all.

. Gives the main thought of a selection which he has heard read. or 69 2 
It should be emphasized that merely to name the tests 
in this way gives little idea of their nature and meaning, 
and tells nothing about Binet’s method of conducting the 
54 experiments. In order to use the tests intelligently it is 
necessary to acquaint one’s self thoroughly with the pur- 
pose of each test, its correct procedure, and the psychologi- 
cal interpretation of different types of response.! 
In fairness to Binet, it should also be borne in mind that 
the scale of tests was only a rough approximation to the 
ideal which the author had set himself to realize. Had his 
life been spared a few years longer, he would doubtless have 
carried the method much nearer perfection. 
How the scale is used. By means of the Binet tests we 
can judge the intelligence of a given individual by compari- 
son with standards of intellectual performance for normal 
children of different ages. In order to make the comparison 
it is only necessary to begin the examination of the subject 
at a point in the scale where all the tests are passed suc- 
cessfully, and to continue up the scale until no more suc- 
cesses are possible, Then we compare our subject’s per- 
formances with the standard for normal children of the 
same age, and note the amount of acceleration or retarda- 
tion. 
Let us suppose the subject being tested is 9 years of age. 
If he goes as far in the tests as normal 9-year-old. children 
ordinarily go, we can say that the child has a “ mental

interpretation of the individual tests.  
-P-A-G-E-60
  40 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
age” of 9 years, which in this case is normal (our child 
being 9 years ofage). If he goes only as far as normal ’ 
8-year-old children ordinarily go, we say that his “ mental 
age ” is 8 years. In like manner, a mentally defective child 
of 9 years may have a “ mental age ” of only 4 years, or a 
young genius of 9 years may have a mental age of 12 or 
13 years. 
Special characteristics of the Binet-Simon method. 
Psychologists had experimented with intelligence tests for 
at least twenty years before the Binet scale made its ap- 
pearance. The question naturally suggests itself why Binet 
should have been successful in a field where previous efforts 
had been for the most part futile. The answer to this ques- 
tion is found in three essential differences between Binet’s 
method and those formerly employed. 
1. The use of age standards. Binet was the first to utilize 
the idea of age standards, or norms, in the measurement of 
intelligence. It will be understood, of course, that Binet 
did not set out to invent tests of 10-year intelligence, 6- 
year intelligence, etc. Instead, as already explained, he 
began with a series of tests ranging from very easy to very 
difficult, and by trying these tests on children of different 
ages and noting the percentages of successes in the various 
years, he was able to locate them (approximately) in the 
years where they belonged. 
This plan has the great advantage of giving us standards 
which are easily grasped. To say, for illustration, that a 
given subject has a grade of intelligence equal to that of the 
average child of 8 years is a’ statement whose general im- 
port does not need to be explained. Previous investigators 
had worked with subjects the degree of whose intelligence 
was unknown, and with tests the difficulty of which was 
equally unknown. An immense amount of ingenuity was 
spent in devising tests which were used in such a way as to  
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE BINET-SIMON METHOD 41 
preclude any very meaningful interpretation of the re- 
sponses. at 
The Binet method enables us to characterize the in- 
telligence of a child in a far more definite way than had 
hitherto been possible. Current descriptive terms like 
“bright,” ‘ moderately bright,” “ dull,” *“ very dull,” 
* feeble-minded,” ete., have had no universally accepted 
meaning. A child who is designated by one person as 
“moderately bright ” may be called “very bright” by 
another person. The degree of intelligence which one calls 
** moderate dullness,” another may call “extreme dullness,” 
ete. But every one knows what is meant by the term 
8-year mentality, 4-year mentality, etc., even if he is not 
able to define these grades of intelligence in psychological 
terms; and by ascertaining experimentally what intellectual 
tasks children of different ages can perform, we are, of course, 
able to make our age standards as definite as we please. 
Why should a device so simple have waited so long for a 
discoverer? We do not know. It is of a class with many 
other unaccountable mysteries in the development of 
scientific method. Apparently the idea of an age-grade 
method, as this is called, did not come to Binet himself 
until he had experimented with intelligence tests for some 
fifteen years. At least his first provisional scale, published 
in 1905, was not made up according to the age-grade plan. 
It consisted merely of 30 tests, arranged roughly in order 
of difficulty.. Although Binet nowhere gives any account of 
the steps by which this crude and ungraded scale was trans- 
formed into the relatively complete age-grade scale of 1908, 
we can infer that the original and ingenious idea of utiliz- 
ing age norms was suggested by the data collected with the 
1905 scale. However the discovery was made, it ranks, per- 
haps, from the practical point of view, as the most important 
in all the history of psychology. 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
42 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
2. The kind of mental functions brought into play. In the 
second place, the Binet tests differ from most of the earlier 
attempts in that they are designed to test the higher and 
more complex mental processes, instead of the simpler and 
more elementary ones. Hence they set problems for the 
reasoning powers and ingenuity, provoke judgments about 
abstract matters, etc., instead of attempting to measure 
sensory discrimination, mere retentiveness, rapidity of 
reaction, and the like. Psychologists had generally con- 
sidered the higher processes too complex to be measured 
directly, and accordingly sought to get at them indirectly 
by correlating supposed intelligence with simpler processes 
which could readily be measured, such as reaction time, 
rapidity of tapping, discrimination of tones and colors, 
ete. While they were disputing over their contradictory 
findings in this line of exploration, Binet went directly to 
the point and succeeded where they had failed. 
It is now generally admitted by psychologists that higher 
intelligence is little concerned in such elementary processes 
as those mentioned above. Many of the animals have keen 
sensory discrimination. Feeble-minded children, unless of 
very low grade, do not differ very markedly from normal 
children in sensitivity of the skin, visual acuity, simple 
reaction time, type of imagery, etc. But in power of com- 
prehension, abstraction, and ability to direct thought, in 
the nature of the associative processes, in amount of | 
information possessed, and in spontaneity of attention, they 
differ enormously. 
8. Binet would test “general intelligence.” Finally, 
Binet’s success was largely due to his abandonment of the 
older “ faculty psychology” which, far from being defunct, 
had really given direction to most of the earlier work with 
mental tests. Where others had attempted to measure mem- 
ory, attention, sense discrimination, etc., as separate facul- 
 
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE BINET-SIMON METHOD 43 
ties or functions, Binet undertook to ascertain the general 
level of intelligence. Others had thought the task easier 
of accomplishment by measuring each division or aspect of 
intelligence separately, and summating the results. Binet, 
too, began in this way, and it was only after years of experi- 
mentation by the usual methods that he finally broke away 
from them and undertook, so to speak, to triangulate the 
height of his tower without first getting the dimensions of 
the individual stones which made it up. 
The assumption that it is easier to measure a part, or one 
aspect, of intelligence than all of it, is fallacious in that the 
parts are not separate parts and cannot be separated by 
any refinement of experiment. They are interwoven and 
intertwined. Each ramifies everywhere and appears in all 
other functions. The analogy of the stones of the tower does 
not really apply. Memory, for example, cannot be tested 
separately from attention, or sense-discrimination sepa- 
rately from the associative processes. After many vain at- 
tempts to disentangle the various intellective functions, 
Binet decided to test their combined functional capacity 
without any pretense of measuring the exact contribution 
of each to the total product. It is hardly too much to say 
that intelligence tests have been successful just to the extent 
to which they have been guided by this aim. 
Memory, attention, imagination, etc., are terms of 
“ structural psychology.” Binet’s psychology is dynamic. 
He conceives intelligence as the sum total of those thought 
processes which consist in mental adaptation. This adapta- 
tion is not explicable in terms of the old mental “ faculties.” 
No one of these can explain a single thought process, for 
such process always involves the participation of many 
functions whose separate réles are impossible to distin- 
guish accurately. Instead of measuring the intensity of 
various mental states (psycho-physics), it is more enlight- 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  44 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
ening to measure their combined effect on adaptation. Using 
a biological comparison, Binet says the old “ faculties ” 
correspond to the separate tissues of an animal or plant, 
while his own “scheme of thought” corresponds to the 
functioning organ itself. For Binet, psychology is the 
science of behavior. 
Binet’s conception of general intelligence. In devising 
tests of intelligence it is, of course, necessary to be guided 
by some assumption, or assumptions, regarding the nature 
of intelligence. To adopt any other course is to depend for 
success upon happy chance. 
However, it is impossible to arrive at a final definition of 
intelligence on the basis of a-priori considerations alone. 
To demand, as critics of the Binet method have sometimes 
done, that one who would measure intelligence should first 
present a complete definition of it, is quite unreasonable. 
As Stern points out, electrical currents were measured long 
before their nature was well understood. Similar illustra- 
tions could be drawn from the processes involved in chem- 
istry, physiology, and other sciences. In the case of _in- 
‘elligence it may be truthfully said that no adequate-def- nition can possibly be framed which is not based primarily 
“on ene tod eet ee y brought to light by the test method. The best th that can be done in advance of such 
“data is to make tentative assumptions as to the probable 
nature of intelligence, and then to subject these assumptions 
to tests which will show their correctness or incorrectness. 
New hypotheses can then be framed for further trial, and 
thus gradually we shall be led to a conception of intelli- 
gence which will be meaningful and in harmony with all 
the ascertainable facts 
Such was the method of Binet. Only those unacquainted 
with Binet’s more than fifteen years of labor preceding the 
publication of his intelligence scale would think of accus-
-P-A-G-E-65
  THE BINET-SIMON METHOD 45 
ing him of making no effort to analyze the mental proc- 
esses which his tests bring into play. It is true that many 
of Binet’s earlier assumptions proved untenable, and in 
this event he was always ready, with exceptional candor 
and intellectual plasticity, to acknowledge his error and to 
plan a new line of attack. 
Binet’s conception of intelligence emphasizes three char- 
acteristics of the thought process: (1) Its tendency to take 
and maintain a definite direction; (2) the capacity to 
make adaptations for the purpose of attaining a desired 
end; and (3) the power of auto-criticism.1 
How these three aspects of intelligence enter into the 
performances with various tests of the scale is set forth from 
time to time in our directions for giving and interpreting the 
individual tests.? An illustration which may be given here 
is that of the “ patience test,” or uniting the disarranged 
parts of a divided rectangle. As described by Binet, this 
operation has the following elements: “‘ (1) to keep in mind 
the end to be attained, that is to say, the figure to be 
formed; (2) to try different combinations under the influ- 
ence of this directing idea, which guides the efforts of the 
subject even though he may not be conscious of the fact; 
and (3) to judge the combination which has been made, to 
compare it with the model, and to decide whether it is the 
correct one.” 
Much the same processes are called for in many other of 
the Binet tests, particularly those of arranging weights, 
rearranging dissected sentences, drawing a diamond or 
square from copy, finding a sentence containing three given 
words, counting backwards, etc. 
1 See Binet and Simon: “L’intelligence des imbeciles,” in L’ Année Psy- 
chologique (1909), pp. 1-147. The last division of this article is devoted to 
a discussion of the essential nature of the higher thought processes, and is 
a wonderful example of that keen psychological analysis in which Binet 
was so gifted. 2 See especially pages 162 and 238, 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  46 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
However, an examination of the scale will show that the 
choice of tests was not guided entirely by any single for- 
mula as to the nature of intelligence. Binet’s approach was 
amany-sided one. The scale includes tests of time orienta- 
tion, of three or four kinds of memory, of apperception, of 
language comprehension,..of knowledge about.common.ob- 
jects, of free association, of number mastery, of construc- 
tive imagination, and of ability to compare.concepts, to 
see contradictions, to combine fragments into a unitary 
whole, to comprehend abstract terms, and to meet novel 
situations. 
Other conceptions of intelligence. It is interesting to 
compare Binet’s conception of intelligence with the defini- 
tions which have been offered by other psychologists. Ac- 
cording to Ebbinghaus, for example, the essence of intelli- 
gence lies in comprehending together in a unitary, meaning- 
ful whole, impressions and associations which are more or 
less independent, heterogeneous, or even partly contra- 
dictory. “ Intellectual ability consists in the elaboration of 
a whole into its worth and meaning by means of many- 
sided combination, correction, and completion of numerous 
kindred associations. . . . It is a combination activity.” 
Meumann offers a twofold definition. From the psy- 
chological point of view, intelligence is the power of in- 
dependent and creative elaboration of new products out of 
the material given by memory and the senses. From the 
practical point of view, it involves the ability to avoid 
errors, to surmount difficulties, and to adjust to environ- 
ment. 
_ Stern defines intelligence as “the general capacity of an 
individual consciously to adjust his thinking to new re- 
quirements: it is general adaptability to new problems and 
conditions of life.” 
Spearman, Hart, and others of the English school define
-P-A-G-E-67
  THE BINET-SIMON METHOD 47 
intelligence as a “ common central factor ” which partici- 
pates in all sorts of special mental activities. This factor is 
explained in terms of a psycho-physiological hypothesis of 
“ cortex energy,” “ cerebral plasticity,” etc. 
The above definitions are only to a slight extent con- 
tradictory or inharmonious. They differ mainly in point 
of view or in the location of the emphasis. Each expresses 
a part of the truth, and none all of it. It will be evident that 
the conception of Binet is broad enough to include the 
most important elements in each of the other definitions 
quoted. 
Guiding principles in choice and arrangement of tests. 
In choosing his tests Binet was guided by the conception of 
intelligence which we have set forth above. Tests were de- 
vised which would presumably bring into play the various 
mental processes thought to be concerned in intelligence, 
and then these tests were tried.out on normal children of 
different ages. If the percentage of passes for a given test 
increased but little or not at all in going from younger to 
older children this test was discarded. On the other hand, 
if the proportion of passes increased rapidly with age, and 
if children of a given age, who on other grounds were known 
to be bright, passed more frequently than children of the 
same age who were known to be dull, then the test was 
judged a satisfactory test of intelligence. As we have shown 
elsewhere, practically all of Binet’s tests fulfill these re- 
quirements reasonably well, a fact which bears eloquent 
testimony to the keen psychological insight of their author. 
In arranging the tests into a system Binet’s guiding prin- 
ciple was to find an arrangement of the tests which would 
cause an average child of any given age to test “at age”; 
that is, the average 5-year-old must show a mental age of 5 
years, the average 8-year-old a mental age of 8 years, etc. 
1 See p. 55.
-P-A-G-E-68
48 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
In order to secure this result Binet found that his data 
seemed to require the location of an individual test in that 
year where it was passed by about two thirds to three 
fourths of unselected children. 
It was in the assembling of the tests that the most serious 
faults of the scale had their origin. Further investigation 
has shown that a great many of the tests were misplaced 
as much as one year, and several of them two years. On 
the whole, the scale as Binet left it was decidedly too easy 
in the lower ranges, and too difficult in the upper. As a 
result, the average child of 5 years was caused to test at 
not far from 6 years, the average child of 12 years not far 
from 11. In the Stanford revision an effort has been made 
to correct this fault, along with certain other generally 
recognized imperfections. 
Some avowed limitations of the Binet tests. The Binet 
tests have often been criticized for their unfitness to perform 
certain services which in reality they were never meant to 
render. This is unfair. We cannot make a just evaluation 
of the scale without bearing in mind its avowed limita- 
tions. 
For example, the scale does not pretend to measure the 
entire mentality of the subject, but only general intelli- 
gence. There is no pretense of testing the emotions or the 
will beyond the extent to which these naturally display 
themselves in the tests of intelligence. The scale was not 
designed as a tool for the analysis of those emotional or 
volitional aberrations which are concerned in such mental 
disorders as hysteria, insanity, etc. These conditions do not 
present a progressive reduction of intelligence to the in- 
fantile level, and in most of them other factors besides in- 
telligence play an important rdle. Moreover, even in the 
normal individual the fruitfulness of intelligence, the direc- 
tion in which it shall be applied, and its methods of work
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE BINET-SIMON METHOD 49 
are to a certain extent determined by the extraneous fac- 
tors of emotion and volition. 
It should, nevertheless, be pointed out that defects of 
intelligence, in a large majority of cases, also involve dis- 
turbances of the emotional and volitional functions. We 
do not expect to find perfectly normal emotions or will 
power of average strength coupled with marked intellectual 
deficiency, and as a matter of fact such a combination is rare 
indeed. In the course of an examination with the Binet 
tests, the experienced clinical psychologist is able to gain 
considerable insight into the subject’s emotional and voli- 
tional equipment, even though the method was designed 
primarily for another purpose. 
A second misunderstanding can be avoided by remem- 
bering that the Binet scale does not pretend to bring to 
light the idiosyncrasies of special talent, but only to measure 
the general level of intelligence. It cannot be used for the 
discovery of exceptional ability in drawing, painting, music, 
mathematics, oratory, salesmanship, etc., because no ef- 
fort is made to explore the processes underlying these abil- 
ities. It can, therefore, never serve as a detailed chart 
for the vocational guidance of children, telling us which 
will succeed in business, which in art, which in medicine, 
etc. It is not a new kind of phrenology. At the same 
time, as we have already pointed out, i is capable of 
bounding roughly the vocational territory in which an indi- 
vidual’s intelligence will probably permit success, nothing else 
preventing. 
Tn the third place, it must not be supposed that the scale 
can be used as a complete pedagogical guide. Although 
intelligence tests furnish data of the greatest significance 
for pedagogical procedure, they do not suggest the appro- 
priate educational methods in detail. These will have to 
1 See p. 17. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  50 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
be worked out in a practical way for the various grades of 
intelligence, and at great cost of labor and patience. 
Finally, in arriving at an estimate of a subject’s grade of 
intelligence and his susceptibility to training, it would 
be a mistake to ignore the data obtainable from other 
sources. No competent psychologist, however ardent a 
supporter of the Binet method he might be, would recom- 
mend such a policy. Those who accept the method as all- 
sufficient are as much in error as those who consider it as 
no more important than any one of a dozen other ap- 
proaches. Standardized tests have already become and 
will remain by far the most reliable single method for grad- 
ing intelligence, but the results they furnish will always need 
to be interpreted in the light of supplementary information 
regarding the subject’s personal history, including medical 
record, accidents, play habits, industrial efficiency, social 
and moral traits, school success, home environment, etc. 
Without question, however. the improved Binet tests will 
contribute more than all other data combined to the end of 
enabling us to forecast a child’s possibilities of future im- 
provement, and this is the information which will aid 
most in the proper direction of his education.

  CHAPTER IV 
NATURE OF THE STANFORD REVISION AND EXTENSION 
Aurnoucs the Binet scale quickly demonstrated its value 
as an instrument for the classification of mentally-retarded 
and otherwise exceptional children, it had, nevertheless, 
several imperfections which greatly limited its usefulness. 
There was a dearth of tests at the higher mental levels, 
the procedure was so inadequately defined that needless 
disagreement came about in the interpretation of data, 
and so many of the tests were misplaced as to make the 
results of an examination more or less misleading, particu- 
larly in the case of very young subjects and those near the 
adult level. It was for the purpose of correcting these and 
certain other faults that the Stanford investigation was 
planned.1 * 
Sources of data. Our revision is the result of several 
years of work, and involved the examination of approxi- 
mately 2300 subjects, including 1700 normal children, 
1 The writer wishes to acknowledge his very great indebtedness to Miss 
Grace Lyman, Dr. George Ordahl, Dr. Louise Ellison Ordahl, Miss Neva 
Galbreath, Mr. Wilford Talbert, Dr. J. Harold Williams, Mr. Herbert E. 
Knollin, and Miss Irene Cuneo for their codperation in making the tests 
on which the Stanford revision is chiefly based. Without their loyal as- 
sistance the inyestigation could not have been carried through. 
Grateful acknowledgment is also made to the many public school teach- 
ers and principals for their generous and invaluable codperation in furnish- 
ing subjects for the tests, and in supplying, sometimes at considerable cost 
of labor, the supplementary information which was called for regarding 
the pupils tested. Their contribution was made in the interest of educa- 
tional science, and without expectation of personal benefits of any kind. 
‘Their professional spirit cannot be too highly commended

  52 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
200 defective and superior children, and more than 400 
adults. 
Tests of 400 of the 1700 normal children had been 
made by Childs and Terman in 1910-11, and of 300 chil- 
dren by Trost, Waddle, and Terman in 1911-12. For 
various reasons, however, the results of these tests did not 
furnish satisfactory data for a thoroughgoing revision of 
the scale. Accordingly a new investigation was undertaken, 
somewhat more extensive than the others, and more care- 
fully planned. Its main features may be described as fol- 
lows: — 
1. The first step was to assemble as nearly as possible 
all the results which had been secured for each test of the 
scale by all the workers of all countries. The result was a 
large sheet of tabulated data for each individual test, 
including percentages passing the test at various ages, 
conditions under which the results were secured, method of 
procedure, etc. After a comparative study of these data, 
and in the light of results we had ourselves secured, a 
provisional arrangement of the tests was prepared for 
try-out. 
2. In addition to the tests of the original Binet scale, 
40 additional tests were included for try-cut. This, it was 
expected, would make possible the elimination of some of 
the least satisfactory tests, and at the same time permit 
the addition of enough new ones to give at least six tests, 
instead of five, for each age group. 
8. A plan was then devised for securing subjects who 
should be as nearly as possible representative of the several 
ages. The method was to select a school in a community 
of average social status, a school attended by all or prac- 
tically all the children in the district where it was located. 
In order to get clear pictures of age differences the tests 
were confined to children who were within two months of a
-P-A-G-E-73
THE STANFORD REVISION 53 
birthday. To avoid accidental selection, all the children 
within two months of a birthday were tested, in whatever 
grade enrolled. Tests of foreign-born children, however, 
were eliminated in the treatment of results. There remained 
tests of approximately 1000 children, of whom 905 were 
between 5 and 14 years of age. 
4. The children’s responses were, for the most part, 
recorded verbatim. This made it possible to re-score the 
records according to any desired standard, and thus to 
fit a test more perfectly to the age level assigned it. 
5. Much attention was given to securing uniformity of 
procedure. A half-year was devoted to training the ex- 
aminers, and another half-year to the supervision of the 
testing. In the further interests of uniformity all the rec- 
ords were scored by one person (the writer). 
Method of arriving at a revision. The revision of the 
scale below the 14-year level was based almost entirely on 
the tests of the above-mentioned 1,000 unselected children. 
The guiding principle was to secure an arrangement of the 
tests and a standard of scoring which would cause the 
median mental age of the unselected children of each age 
group to coincide with the median chronological age. 
That is, a correct scale must cause the average child of 5 
years to test exactly at 5, the average child at 6 to test 
exactly at 6, etc. Or, to express the same fact in terms of 
intelligence quotient,! a correct scale must give a median 
intelligence quotient of unity, or 100 per cent, for unselected 
children of each age. 
If the median mental age resulting at any point from the 
provisional arrangement of tests was too high or too low, 
it was only necessary to change the location of certain of 
the tests, or to change the standard of scoring, until an 
1 The intelligence quotient (often designated as I Q) is the ratio of 
mental age to chronological age. (See pp. 65 ff. and 78 ff.)
-P-A-G-E-74
  
54 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
order of arrangement and a standard of passing were found 
which would throw the median mental age where it be- 
longed. We had already become convinced, for reasons too 
involved for presentation here, that no satisfactory revision 
of the Binet scale was possible on any theoretical considera- 
tions as to the percentage of passes which an individual 
test ought to show in a given year in order to be consid- 
ered standard for that year. 
As was to be expected, the first draft of the revision did 
not prove satisfactory. The scale was still too hard at 
some points, and too easy at others. In fact, three succes- 
sive revisions were necessary, involving three separate 
scorings of the data and as many tabulations of the 
mental ages, before the desired degree of accuracy was 
secured. As finally revised, the scale gives a median in- 
telligence quotient closely approximating 100 for the 
unselected children of each age from 4 to 14. 
Since our school children who were above 14 years and 
still in the grades were retarded left-overs, it was neces- 
sary to base the revision above this level on the tests of 
adults. These included 30 business men and 150 “ migrat- 
ing’ unemployed men tested by Mr. H. E. Knollin, 150 
adolescent delinquents tested by Mr. J. Harold Williams, 
and 50 high-school students tested by the writer. 
The extension of the scale in the upper range is such 
that ordinarily intelligent adults, little educated, test up 
to what is called the ‘“‘average adult” level. Adults whose 
intelligence is known from other sources to be superior are 
found to test well up toward the “ superior adult ” level, 
and this holds whether the subjects in question are well 
educated or practically unschooled. The almost entirely 
unschooled business men, in fact, tested fully as well as 
high-school juniors and seniors. 
Figure 1 shows the distribution of mental ages for 62

adults, including the 30 business men and the 32 high- 
school pupils who were over 16 years of age. It will be 
noted that the middle section of the graph represents the 
“ mental ages ” falling between 15 and 17. This is the range 
which we have designated as the “ average adult ” level. 
Those above 17 are called “ superior adults,” those between 
13 and 15, “ inferior adults.”’ Subjects much over 15 years 
of age who test in the neighborhood of 12 years may 
ordinarily be considered 
border-line cases. 
The following method 
was employed for deter- 
mining the validity of 
atest. The children of 
each age level were di- 
vided into three groups 
according to intelli- 
gence quotient, those 
testing below 90, those 
between 90 and 109, ‘Guiunwiiebn rein ben

telligence quotient of OF 62 NORMAL ADULTS 110 or above. The per- 
centages of passes on each individual test at or near that 
age level were then ascertained separately for these three 
groups. If a test fails to show a decidedly higher propor- 
tion of passes in the superior I Q group than in the inferior 
I Q group, it cannot be regarded as a satisfactory test of 
intelligence. On the other hand, a test which satisfies this 
criterion must be accepted as valid or the entire scale must 
be rejected. Henceforth it stands or falls with the scale as 
a whole. 
When tried out by this method, some of the tests which 
have been most criticized showed a high degree of relia-

bility; certain others which have been considered excellent 
proved to be so little correlated with intelligence that they 
had to be discarded. 
After making a few necessary eliminations, 90 tests re- 
mained, or 36 more than the number included in the Binet 
1911 scale. There are 6 at each age level from 3 to 10, 
8 at 12, 6 at 14, 6 at “ average adult,” 6 at “ superior adult,” 
and 16 alternative tests. The alternative tests, which are 
distributed among the different groups, are intended to 
be used only as substitutes when one or more of the regular 
tests have been rendered, by coaching or otherwise, un- 
desirable.1 
Of the 36 new tests, 27 were added and standardized 
in the various Stanford investigations. Two tests were 
borrowed from the Healy-Fernald series, one from Kuhl- 
mann, one was adapted from Bonser, and the remaining 
five were amplifications or adaptations of some of the 
earlier Binet tests.

Summary of changes. A comparison of the above list 
with either the Binet 1908 or 1911 series will reveal many 
changes. On the whole, it differs somewhat more from the 
Binet 1911 scale than from that of 1908. Thus, of the 49 
tests below the “adult” group in the 1911 scale, 2 are 
eliminated and 29 are relocated. Of these, 25 are moved. 
downward and 4 upward. The shifts are as follows: — 
Down 1 year, 18 
Down 2 years, 4 
Down 3 years, 2 
Down 6 years, 1 
Up l year, 3 
Up 2 years, 1 
Of the adult group in Binet’s 1911 series 1 is eliminated, 
2 are moved up to “ superior adult,” and 1 is moved up to 
14. Accordingly, of Binet’s entire 54 tests, we have elimi- 
nated 3 and relocated 32, leaving only 19 in the positions 
assigned them by Binet. The 8 eliminated are: repeating 
2 digits, resisting suggestion, and “‘ reversed triangle.” 
The revision is really more extensive than the above 
figures would suggest, since minor changes have been made 
in the scoring of a great many tests in order to make them 
fit better the locations assigned them. Throughout the 
scale the procedure and scoring have been worked over 
and made more definite with the idea of promoting uni- 
formity. This phase of the revision is perhaps more im-
-P-A-G-E-82
62 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
portant than the mere relocation of tests. Also, the addi- 
tion of numerous tests in the upper ranges of the scale 
affects very considerably the mental ages above the level 
of 10 or 11 years. 
Effects of the revision on the mental ages secured. The 
most important effect of the revision is to reduce the mental 
ages secured in the lower ranges of the scale, and to raise 
considerably the mental ages above 10 or 11 years. This 
difference also obtains, though to a somewhat smaller ex- 
tent, between the Stanford revision and those of Goddard 
and Kuhlmann. 
For example, of 104 adult individuals testing by the Stan- 
ford revision between 12 and 14 years, and who were there- 
fore somewhat above the level of feeble-mindedness as that 
term is usually defined, 50 per cent tested below 12 years by 
the Goddard revision. That the dull and border-line adults 
are so much more readily distinguished from the feeble- 
minded by the Stanford revision than by other Binet series 
is due as much to the addition of tests in the upper groups 
as to the relocation of existing tests. 
On the other hand, the Stanford revision causes young 
subjects to test lower than any other version of the Binet 
scale. At 5 or 6 years the mental ages secured by the Stan- 
ford revision average from 6 to 10 months lower than other 
revisions yield. 
The above differences are more significant than would at 
first appear. An error of 10 months in the mental age of a 
5-year-old is as serious as an error of 20 months in the case 
of a 10-year-old. Stating the error in terms of the intelli- 
gence quotient makes it more evident. Thus, an error of 
10 months in the mental age of a 5-year-old means an error 
of almost 15 per cent in the intelligence quotient. A scale 
which tests this much too low would cause the child with a 
true intelligence quotient of 75 (which ordinarily means
-P-A-G-E-83
  THE STANFORD REVISION 63 
feeble-mindedness or border-line intelligence) to test at 
90, or only slightly below normal. 
Three serious consequences came from the too great 
ease of the original Binet scale at the lower end, and its 
too great difficulty at the upper end: — 
1. In young subjects the higher grades of mental de- 
ficiency were overlooked, because the scale caused such 
subjects to test only a little below normal. 
2. The proportion of feeble-mindedness among adult 
subjects was greatly overestimated, because subjects who 
were really of the 12- or 13-year mental level could only 
earn a mental age of about 11 years. 
8. Confusion resulted in efforts to trace the mental 
growth of either feeble-minded or normal children. For 
example, by other versions of the Binet scale an average 
5-year-old will show an intelligence quotient probably not 
far from 110 or 115; at 9, an intelligence quotient of about 
100; and at 14, an intelligence quotient of about 85 or 90. 
By such a scale the true border-line case would test 
approximately as follows: — 
At age 5, 90 I Q (apparently not far below normal). 
At age 9, 75 I Q (border-line). 
At age 14, 65 I Q (moron deficiency). 
On the other hand, re-tests of children by the Stanford 
revision have been found to yield intelligence quotients 
almost identical with those secured from two to four years 
earlier by the same tests. Those who graded feeble-minded 
in the first test graded feeble-minded in the second test: 
the dull remained dull, the average remained average, the 
superior remained superior, and always in approximately 
the same degree.!

It is unnecessary to emphasize further the importance of 
having an intelligence scale which is equally accurate at all 
points. Absolute perfection in this respect is not claimed 
for the Stanford revision, but it is believed to be at least 
free from the more serious errors of other Binet arrange- 
ments,

CHAPTER V 
ANALYSIS OF 1000 INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS 
Aw extended account of the 1000 tests on which the 
Stanford revision is chiefly based has been presented in a 
separate monograph. This chapter will include only the 
briefest summary of some of those results of the investiga- 
tion which contribute to the intelligent use of the revi- 
sion. 
The distribution of intelligence. The question as to the 
manner in which intelligence is distributed is one of great 
practical as well as theoretical importance. One of the most 
vital questions which can be asked by any nation of any 
age is the following: “‘ How high is the average level of 
intelligence among our people, and how frequent are the 
various grades of ability above and below the average? ” 
With the development of standardized tests we are ap- 
proaching, for the first time in history, a possible answer 
to this question. 
Most of the earlier Binet studies, however, have thrown 
little light on the distribution of intelligence because of 
their failure to avoid the influence of accidental selection 
in choosing subjects for testing. The method of securing 
subjects for the Stanford revision makes our results on this 
point especially interesting.! It is believed that the sub- 
jects used for this investigation were as nearly representa- 
tive of average American-born children as it is possible to 
secure. 
1 See p. 52 ff. for method used to avoid accidental selection of subjects 
for the Stanford investigation.  
-P-A-G-E-86
  66 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
The intelligence quotients for these 1000 unselected chil- 
dren were calculated, and their distribution was plotted 
for the ages separately. The distribution was found fairly 
symmetrical at each age from 5 to 14. At 15 the range is on 
either side of 90 as a median, and at 16 on either side of 80 
asa median. That the 15- and 16-year-olds test low is due 
to the fact that these children are left-over retardates and 
are below average in intelligence. 
The I Q’s were then grouped in ranges of ten. In the 
middle group were thrown those from 96 to 105; the ascend- 
56-65 66-75 16-85 86-95 96-105. 106-115 116-125 126-135 136-145

ing groups including in order the I Q’s from 106 to 115, 
116 to 125, ete.; correspondingly with the descending 
groups. Figure 2 shows the distribution found by this 
grouping for the 905 children of ages 5 to 14 combined. 
The subjects above 14 are not included in this curve be- 
cause they are left-overs and not representative of their ages. 
The distribution for the ages combined is seen to be re- 
markably symmetrical. The symmetry for the separate 
ages was hardly less marked, considering that only 80 to 
120 children were tested at each age. In fact, the range, 
including the middle 50 per cent of I Q’s, was found 
practically constant from 5 to 14 years. The tendency is
-P-A-G-E-87
' INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS ANALYZED 67 
for the middle 50 per cent to fall (approximately) between 
93 and 108. 
Three important conclusions are justified by the above 
facts: — 
1. Since the frequency of the various grades of intelli- 
gence decreases gradually and at no point abruptly on 
each side of the median, it is evident that there is no defi- 
nite dividing line between normality and feeble-minded- 
ness, or between normality and genius. Psychologically, 
the mentally defective child does not belong to a distinct 
type, nor does the genius. There is no line of demarcation 
between either of these extremes and the so-called “ nor- 
mal” child. The number of mentally defective individuals 
in a population will depend upon the standard arbitrarily 
set up as to what constitutes mental deficiency. Similarly 
for genius. It is exactly as we should undertake to classify 
all people into the three groups: abnormally tall, normally 
tall, and abnormally short.! 
2. The common opinion that extreme deviations below 
the median are more frequent than extreme deviations above 
the median seems to have no foundation in fact. Among 
unselected school children, at least, for every child of 
any given degree of deficiency there is another child as 
far above the average I Q as the former is below. We 
have shown elsewhere the serious consequences of neglect 
of this fact? 
8. The traditional view that variability in mental traits 
becomes more marked during adolescence is here contra- 
dicted, as far as intelligence is concerned, for the distribu- 
tion of I Q’s is practically the same at each age from 5 to 
14. For example, 6-year-olds differ from one another fully 
as much as do 14-year-olds. 
1 See Chapter VI for discussion of the significance of various I Q’s. 
2 See p. 12 ff.  
-P-A-G-E-88
  68 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
The validity of the intelligence quotient. The facts 
presented above argue strongly for the validity of the I Q 
as an expression of a child’s intelligence status. This fol- 
lows necessarily from the similar nature of the distributions 
at the various ages. The inference is that a child’s I Q, 
as measured by this scale, remains relatively constant. 
Re-tests of the same children at intervals of two to five 
years support the inference. Children of superior intelli- 
gence do not seem to deteriorate as they get older, nor dull 
children to develop average intelligence. Knowing a child’s 
IQ, we can predict with a fair degree of accuracy the course 
of his later development. 
The mental age of a subject is meaningless if considered 
apart from chronological age. It is only the ratio of retarda- 
tion or acceleration to chronological age (that is, the I Q) 
which has significance. 
It follows also that if the I Q is a valid expression of in- 
telligence, as it seems to be, then the Binet-Simon “ age- 
grade method ”’ becomes transformed automatically into a 
“point-scale method,” if one wants to use it that way. 
As such it is superior to any other point scale that has 
been proposed, because it includes a larger number of 
tests and its points have definite meaning. 
Sex differences. The question as to the relative intelli- 
gence of the sexes is one of perennial interest and great social 
importance. The ancient hypothesis, the one which dates 
from the time when only men concerned themselves with 
scientific hypotheses, took for granted the superiority of 
the male. With the development of individual psychology, 
however, it was soon found that as far as the evidence of 
mental tests can be trusted the average intelligence of 
women and girls is as high as that of men and boys. 
1 For discussion of the supposed advantages of the “point-scale 
method,” see Yerkes and Bridges: A New Point Scale for Measuring 
Mental Ability. (Warwick and York, 1915.)

INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS ANALYZED 69 
If we accept this result we are then confronted with the 
difficult problem of finding an explanation for the fact that 
so few of those who have acquired eminence in the various 
intellectual fields have been women. Twoexplanations have 
been proposed: (1) That women become eminent less often 
than men simply for lack of opportunity and stimulus; 
and (2) that while the average intelligence of the sexes is the 
same, extreme variations may be more common in males.

It is pointed out that not only are there more eminent men 
than eminent women, but that statistics also show a pre- 
ponderance of males in institutions for the mentally de- 
fective. Accordingly it is often said that women are grouped 
closely about the average, while men show a wider range of 
distribution. 
Many hundreds of articles and books of popular or 
quasi-scientific nature have been written on one aspect 
or another of this question of sex difference in intelligence; 
but all such theoretical discussions taken together are worth 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
  70 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
less than the results of one good experiment. Let us see 
what our 1000 I Q’s have to offer toward a solution of the 
problem. 
1. When the I Q’s of the boys and girls were’ treated 
separately there was found a small but fairly constant 
superiority of the girls up to the age of 13 years. At 14, 
however, the curve for the girls dropped. below that for 
boys. This is shown in Figure 3. 
The supplementary data, including the teachers’ esti- 
mates of intelligence on a scale of five, the teachers’ judg- 
ments in regard to the quality of the school work, and rec- 
ords showing the age-grade distribution of the sexes, were 
all sifted for evidence as to the genuineness of the apparent 
superiority of the girls age for age. The results of all these 
lines of inquiry support the tests in suggesting that the 
superiority of the girls is probably real even up to and in- 
cluding age 14, the apparent superiority of the boys at 
this age being fully accounted for by the more frequent 
elimination of 14-year-old girls from the grades by promo- 
tion to the high school. 
2. However, the superiority of girls over boys is so slight 
(amounting at most ages to only 2 to 3 points in terms 
of I Q) that for practical purposes it would seem negligi- 
ble. This offers no support to the opinion expressed by 
Yerkes and Bridges that “at certain ages serious injus- 
tice will be done individuals by evaluating their scores 
in the light of norms which do not take account of sex 
differences.” 
8. Apart from the small superiority of girls, the dis- 
tribution of intelligence in the two sexes is not different. 
The supposed wider variation of boys is not found. Girls 
do not group themselves about the median more closely

than do boys. The range of I Q including the middle fifty 
per cent is approximately the same for the two sexes.! 
4, When the results for the individual tests were ex- 
amined, it was found that not many showed very extreme 
differences as to the per cent of boys and girls passing. In 
a few cases, however, the difference was rather marked. 
The boys were decidedly better in arithmetical reason- 
ing, giving differences between a president and a king, soly- 
ing the form board, making change, reversing hands of 
clock, finding similarities, and solving the “ induction test.” 
. The girls were superior in drawing designs from memory, 
zesthetic comparison, comparing objects from memory, an- 
swering the “comprehension questions,” repeating digits 
and sentences, tying a bow-knot, and finding rhymes. 
Accordingly, our data, which for the most part agree 
with the results of others, justify the conclusion that the 
intelligence of girls, at least up to 14 years, does not differ 
materially from that of boys either as regards the average 
level or the range of distribution. It may still be argued 
that the mental development of boys beyond the age of 
14 years lasts longer and extends farther than in the case 
of girls, but as a matter of fact this opinion receives lit- 
tle support from such tests as have been made on men 
and women college students. 
The fact that so few women have attained eminence 
may be due to wholly extraneous factors, the most impor- 
tant of which are the following: (1) The occupations in 
which it is possible to achieve eminence are for the most 
part only now beginning to open their doors to women. 
Women’s career has been largely that of home-making, 
1 For an extensive summary of other data on the variability of the 
sexes see the article by Leta S. Hollingworth, in The American Journal 
of Sociology (January, 1914), pp. 510-30. It is shown that the findings of 
others support the conclusions set forth above.
-P-A-G-E-92
  72 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
an occupation in which eminence, in the strict sense of 
the word, is impossible. (2) Even of the small number of 
women who embark upon a professional career, a majority 
marry and thereafter devote a fairly large proportion of 
their energy to bearing and rearing children. (3) Both the 
training given to girls and the general atmosphere in which 
they grow up are unfavorable to the inculcation of the pro- 
fessional point of view, and as a result women are not spurred 
on by deep-seated motives to constant and strenuous in- 
tellectual endeavor as men are. (4) It is also possible that 
the emotional traits of women are such as to favor the 
development of the sentiments at the expense of innate 
intellectual endowment. 
Intelligence of the different social classes. Of the 1000 
children, 492 were classified by their teachers according to 
social class into the following five groups: very inferior, in- 
ferior, average, superior, and very superior. A comparative 
study was then made of the distribution of I Q’s for these 
different groups.! 
The data may be summarized as follows: — 
1. The median I Q for children of the superior social class is 
about 7 points above, and that of the inferior social class about 
7 points below, the median I Q of the average social group. This 
means that by the age of 14 inferior class children are about one 
year below, and superior class children one year above, the median 
mental age for all classes taken together. 
2. That the children of the superior social classes make a better 
showing in the tests is probably due, for the most part, to a su- 
periority in original endowment. This conclusion is supported by 
five supplementary lines of evidence: (a) the teachers’ rankings 
of the children according to intelligence; (b) the age-grade pro- 
gress of the children; (c) the quality of the school work; (d) the 
comparison of older and younger children as regards the influence 
1 The results of this comparison have been set forth in detail in the 
monograph of source material and some of the conclusions have been set 
forth on p. 115 ff. of the present volume.

of social environment; and (e) the study of individual cases of 
bright and dull children in the same family. 
3. In order to facilitate comparison, it is advisable to express 
the intelligence of children of all social classes in terms of the same 
objective scale of intelligence. This scale should be based on the 
median for all classes taken together. 
4, As regards their responses to individual tests, our children 
of a given social class were not distinguishable from children of the 
same intelligence in any other social class. 
The relation of the I Q to the quality of the child’s 
school work. The school work of 504 children was graded 
by the teachers on a scale of five grades: very inferior, 
inferior, average, superior, and very superior. When this 
grouping was compared with that made on the basis of 
1 Q, fairly close agreement was found. However, in about 
one case out of ten there was rather serious disagreement; 
a child, for example, would be rated as doing average 
school work when his I Q would place him in the very 
inferior intelligence group. 
When the data were searched for explanations of such 
disagreements it was found that most of them were plainly 
due to the failure of teachers to take into account the age 
of the child when grading the quality of his school work. 
When allowance was made for this tendency there were no 
disagreements which justified any serious suspicion as to 
the accuracy of the intelligence scale. Minor disagree- 
ments may, of course, be disregarded, since the quality of 
school work depends in part on other factors than intelli- 
gence, such as industry, health, regularity of attendance, 
quality of instruction, etc. 
The relation between I Q and grade progress. This 
comparison, which was made for the entire 1000 children, 
showed a fairly high correlation, but also some astonishing 
disagreements. Nine-year intelligence was found all the

way from grade 1 to grade 7, inclusive; 10-year intelligence 
all the way from grade 2 to grade 7; and 12-year intelligence 
all the way from grade 3 to grade 8. Plainly the school’s 
efforts at grading fail to give homogeneous groups of chil- 
dren as regards mental ability. On the whole, the grade 
location of the children did not fit their mental ages much 
better than it did their chronological ages. 
When the data were examined, it was found that prac- 
tically every child whose grade failed to correspond fairly 
closely with his mental age was either exceptionally bright 
or exceptionally dull. Those who tested between 96 and 
105 I Q were never seriously misplaced in school. The 
very dull children, however, were usually located from one 
to three grades above where they belonged by mental age, 
and the duller the child the more serious, as a rule, was the 
misplacement. On the other hand, the very bright children 
were nearly always located from one to three grades below 
where they belonged by mental age, and the brighter the 
child the more serious the school’s mistake. The child of 
10-year mental age in the second grade, for example, is 
almost certain to be about 7 or 8 years old; the child of 10- 
year intelligence in the sixth grade is almost certain to be 
13 to 15 years of age. 
All this is due to one fact, and one alone: the school tends 
to promote children by age rather than ability. The bright 
children are held back, while the dull children are promoted 
beyond their mental ability. The retardation problem is 
exactly the reverse of what we have thought it to be. It 
is the bright children who are retarded, and the dull chil- 
dren who are accelerated. 
The remedy is to be sought in differentiated courses 
(special classes) for both kinds of mentally exceptional 
children. Just as many special classes are needed for su- 
perior children as for the inferior. The social consequences
-P-A-G-E-95
    
INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS ANALYZED 1 
of suitable educational advantages for children of superior 
ability would no doubt greatly exceed anything that could 
possibly result from the special instruction of dullards and 
border-line cases.1 
Special study of the I Q’s between 70 and 79 revealed the 
fact that a child of this grade of intelligence never does 
satisfactory work in the grade where he belongs by chrono- 
logical age. By the time he has attended school four or five 
years, such a child is usually found doing “ very inferior ” 
to “average”? work in a grade from two to four years 
below his age. 
On the other hand, the child with an I Q of 120 or above 
is almost never found below the grade for his chronological 
age, and occasionally he is one or two grades above. Wher- 
ever located, his work is always “ superior” or “ very 
superior,” and the evidence suggests strongly that it 
would probably remain so even if extra promotions were 
granted. 
Correlation between I Q and the teachers’ estimates of 
the children’s intelligence. By the Pearson formula the 
correlation found between the I Q’s and the teachers’ rank- 
ings on a scale of five was .48. This is about what others 
have found, and is both high enough and low enough to 
be significant. That it is moderately high in so far cor- 
roborates the tests. That it is not higher means that either 
the teachers or the tests have made a good many mis- 
takes. 
When the data were searched for evidence on this point, 
it was found, as we have shown in Chapter I, that the fault 
was plainly on the part of the teachers. The serious mis- 
takes were nearly all made with children who were either 
over age or under age for their grade, mostly the former. 
1 See Chapter VI for further discussion of the school progress possible to 
children of various I Q’s. 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
  6 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
In estimating children’s intelligence, just as in grading their 
school success, the teachers often failed to take account of 
the age factor. For example, the child whose mental age 
was, say, two years below normal, and who was enrolled in 
a class with children about two years younger than himself, 
was often graded “‘ average ”’ in intelligence. 
The tendency of teachers is to estimate a child’s intelli- 
gence according to the quality of his school work in the 
grade where he happens to be located. This results in over- 
estimating the intelligence of older, retarded children, 
and underestimating the intelligence of the younger, ad- 
vanced children. The disagreements between the tests and 
the teachers’ estimates are thus found, when analyzed, to 
confirm the validity of the test method rather than to 
bring it under suspicion. 
The validity of the individual tests. The validity of 
each test was checked up by measuring it against the scale 
as a whole in the manner described on p. 55. For example, 
if 10-year-old children having 11-year intelligence succeed 
with a given test decidedly better than 10-year-old chil- 
dren who have 9-year intelligence, then either this test 
must be accepted as valid or the scale as a whole must be 
rejected. Since we know, however, that the scale as a 
whole has at least a reasonably high degree of reliability, 
this method becomes a sure and ready means of judging the 
_ worth of a test. 
When the tests were tried out in this way it was found that 
some of those which have been most criticized have in real- 
ity a high correlation with intelligence. Among these are 
naming the days of the week, giving the value of stamps, 
counting thirteen pennies, giving differences between presi- 
dent and king, finding rhymes, giving age, distinguishing 
right and left, and interpretation of pictures. Others hav- 
ing a high reliability are the vocabulary tests, arithmetical
-P-A-G-E-97
  INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENTS ANALYZED 77 
reasoning, giving differences, copying a diamond, giving 
date, repeating digits in reverse order, interpretation of 
fables, the dissected sentence test, naming sixty words, 
finding omissions in pictures, and recognizing absurdities. 
Among the somewhat less satisfactory tests are the fol- 
lowing: repeating digits (direct order), naming coins, dis- 
tinguishing forenoon and afternoon, defining in terms of 
use, drawing designs from memory, and esthetic compari- 
son. Binet’s “line suggestion” test correlated so little 
with intelligence that it had to be thrown out. The same 
was also true of two of the new tests which we had added 
to the series for try-out. 
Tests showing a medium correlation with the scale as 
a whole include arranging weights, executing three com- 
missions, naming colors, giving number of fingers, describ- 
ing pictures, naming the months, making change, giving 
superior definitions, finding similarities, reading for mem- 
ories, reversing hands of clock, defining abstract words, 
problems of fact, bow-knot, induction test, and compre- 
hension questions. 
A test which makes a good showing on this criterion of 
agreement with the scale as a whole becomes immune to 
theoretical criticisms. Whatever it appears to be from 
mere inspection, it is a real measure of intelligence. Hence- 
forth it stands or falls with the scale as a whole. 
The reader will understand, of course, that no single 
test used alone will determine accurately the general level 
of intelligence. A great many tests are required; and for 
two reasons: (1) because intelligence has many aspects; 
and (2) in order to overcome the accidental influences of 
training or environment. If many tests are used no one of 
them need show more than a moderately high correlation 
with the scale as a whole. As stated by Binet, “ Let the 
tests be rough, if there are only enough of them.”

Frequency of different degrees of intelligence. Before 
we can interpret the results of an examination it is neces- 
sary to know how frequently an I Q of the size found occurs 
among unselected children. Our tests of 1000 unselected 
children enable us to answer this question with some degree 
of definiteness. A study of these 1000 I Q's s shows the fol- 
lowing significant facts: —

Classification of intelligence quotients. What do the 
above I Q’s imply in such terms as feeble-mindedness, 
border-line intelligence, dullness, normality, superior in- 
telligence, genius, etc.? When we use these terms two facts 
must be borne in mind: (1) That the boundary lines be- 
tween such groups are absolutely arbitrary, a matter of 
definition only; and (2) that the individuals comprising one 
of the groups do not make up a homogeneous type. 
Nevertheless, since terms like the above are convenient 
and will probably continue to be used, it is desirable to 
give them as much definiteness as possible. On the basis 
of the tests we have made, including many cases of all 
grades of intelligence, the following suggestions are offered 
for the classification of intelligence quotients: — 
IQ Classification 
Above 140 . . . . “Near” genius or genius. 
120-140 . . . . Very superior intelligence. 
110-120 . . . . Superior intelligence. 
90-110 . . . . Normal, or average, intelligence. 
80- 90 . . . . Dullness, rarely classifiable as feeble-mindedness. 
70- 80 . . . . Border-line deficiency, sometimes classifiable as dull- 
ness, often as feeble-mindedness. 
Below 70 . . . . Definite feeble-mindedness. 
Of the feeble-minded, those between 50 and 70 I Q in- 
clude most of the morons (high, middle, and low), those 
between 20 or 25 and 50 are ordinarily to be classed as 
imbeciles, and those below 20 or 25 as idiots. According 
to this classification the adult idiot would range up to about 
8-year intelligence as the limit, the adult imbecile would have 
a mental level between 3 and 7 years, and the adult moron 
would range from about 7-year to 11-year intelligence. 
It should be added, however, that the classification of 
I Q’s for the various sub-grades of feeble-mindedness is 
not very secure, for the reason that the exact curves of 
mental growth have not been worked out for such grades.
-P-A-G-E-100
  80 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
As far as the public schools are concerned this does not 
greatly matter, as they never enroll idiots and very rarely 
even the high-grade imbecile. School defectives are prac- 
tically all of the moron and border-line grades, and these 
it is important teachers should be able to recognize. The 
following discussions and illustrative cases will perhaps 
give a fairly definite idea of the significance of various grades 
of intelligence.1 
Feeble-mindedness (rarely above 75 I Q.) There are 
innumerable grades of mental deficiency ranging from 
somewhat below average intelligence to profound idiocy. 
In the literal sense every individual below the average is 
more or less mentally weak or feeble. Only a relatively 
small proportion of these, however, are technically known 
as feeble-minded. It is therefore necessary to set forth the 
criterion as to what constitutes feeble-mindedness in the 
commonly accepted sense of that word. 
The definition in most general use is the one framed by 
the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of London, 
and adopted by the English Royal Commission on Mental 
Deficiency. It is substantially as follows: — 
A feeble-minded person is one who is incapable, because 
of mental defect existing from birth or from an early age, 
(a) of competing on equal terms with his normal fellows; or 
(b) of managing himself or his affairs with ordinary prudence. 
Two things are to be noted in regard to this definition: 
In the first place, it is stated in terms of social and in- 
dustrial efficiency. Such efficiency, however, depends not 
merely on the degree of intelligence, but also on’ emotional, 
moral, physical, and social traits as well. This explains 
why some individuals with I Q somewhat below 75 can 
1 The clinical descriptions to be given are not complete and are designed 
merely to aid the examiner in understanding the significance of intelligence 
quotients found.
-P-A-G-E-101
  
  INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT SIGNIFICANCE 81 
hardly be classed as feeble-minded in the ordinary sense of 
the term, while others with I Q a little above 75 could 
hardly be classified in any other group. 
In the second place, the criterion set up by the definition 
is not very definite because of the vague meaning of the 
expression “ordinary prudence.” Even the expression 
“competing on equal terms” cannot be taken literally, 
else it would include also those who are merely dull. It 
is the second part of the definition that more nearly ex- 
presses the popular criterion, for as long as an individual 
manages his affairs in such a way as to be self-supporting, 
and in such a way as to avoid becoming a nuisance or burden 
to his fellowmen, he escapes the institutions for defectives 
and may pass for normal. 
The most serious defect of the definition comes from the 
lax interpretation of the term “ordinary prudence,” etc. 
The popular standard is so low that hundreds of thou- 
sands of high-grade defectives escape identification as such. 
Moreover, there are many grades of severity in social and 
industrial competition. For example, most of the members 
of such families as the Jukes, the Nams, the Hill Folk, and 
the Kallikaks are able to pass as normal in their own 
crude environment, but when compelled to compete with 
average American stock their deficiency becomes evident. 
It is therefore necessary to supplement the social criterion 
with a more strictly psychological one. 
For this purpose there is nothing else as significant as 
the 1Q. All who test below 70 I Q by the Stanford revision 
of the Binet-Simon scale should be considered feeble-minded, 
and it is an open question whether it would not be justifiable 
to consider 75 I Q as the lower limit of “ normal ”’ intelli- 
gerice. Certainly a large proportion falling between 70 and 
75 can hardly be classed as other than feeble-minded, even 
according to the social criterion.

grade. Still sullen, indifferent, and slow in grasping directions, and 
lacking in play interests. “No apperception of anything, but has 
mastered such mechanical things as reading (calling the words)

absurd, does not appreciate stories, slow at comprehending com- 
mands.” Is also described as “unruly, boisterous, disobedient, 
stubborn, and lacking sense of propriety. Tattles.” 
Three years later, at age of 15, was in a special class and was 
little if any improved. He had, however, learned the mechanics of 
reading and had mastered the number combinations. Deficiencies 
described as “‘of wide range.”’ Conduct, however, had improved. 
Was “working hard to get on.” 
A. C. must be considered definitely feeble-minded. 
  H. 8S. Boy, age 11; mental age 8-3; I Q approximately 75. At 8 
years tested at 6. Parents highly educated, father a scholar.

86 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Brother and sister of very superior intelligence. Started to school 
at 7, but was withdrawn because of lack of progress. Started again 
at 8 and is now doing poor work in the second grade. Weakly and 
nervous. Painfully aware of his inability to learn. During the test 
keeps saying, “I tried anyway,” “It’s all I can do if I try my best, 
ain’t it?” etc. Regarded defective by other children. Will prob- 
ably never be able to do work beyond the fourth or fifth grade and 
is not likely to develop above the 11-year level, if as high. 
e <7 Fic. 8.. DRAWING DESIGNS FROM MEMORY. H. S., AGE 11; 
MENTAL AGE 8-3 
I. 8. Boy, age 9-6; mental age 7; I Q 75. German parentage. 
Started to school at 6. Now in low second grade and unable to do 
the work. Health good. Inattentive, mentally slow and inert, 
easily distracted, speech is monotone. Equally poor in reading, 
writing, and numbers. I. S. is described as quiet, sullen, indifferent, 
lazy, and stubborn. Plays little. 
Three years later had advanced from low second to low fourth 
grade, but was as poor as ever in his school work. “Miscalls the 
simplest words.” Moral traits unsatisfactory. May reach sixth or 
seventh grade if he remains in school long enough. 
I. S. learned to walk at 2 years and to talk at 3. 
The above are cases of such marked deficiency that there 
could be no disagreement among competent judges in 
classifying them in the group of “ feeble-minded.” All 
are definitely institutional cases. It is a matter of record, 
however, that one of the cases, H. S., was diagnosed by a 
physician (without test) as ‘“‘ backward but not a defec- 
tive,” and with the added encouragement that “ the back-
-P-A-G-E-107
  INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT SIGNIFICANCE 87 
wardness will be outgrown.” Of course Yhe reverse is the 
case; the deficiency is becoming more and more apparent 
as the boy approaches the age where more is expected of 
him. 
In at least three of the above cases (S. M., I. S., and 
I. M.) the teachers had not identified the backwardness 
as feeble-mindedness. Not far from 2 children out of 100, 
or 20 out of 1000, in the average public school are as defec- 
tive as some of those just described. Teachers get so ac- 
customed to seeing a few of them in every group of 200 or 
300 pupils that they are likely to regard them as merely 
dull, — “ dreadfully dull,” of course, — but not defective. 
Children like these, for their own good and that of other 
pupils, should be kept out of the regular classes. They will 
rarely be equal to the work of the fifth grade, however long 
they attend school. They will make a little progress in a 
well-managed special class, but with the approach of adoles- 
cence, at latest, the State should take them into custodial 
care for its own protection. 
Border-line cases (usually between 70 and 80 I Q). 
The border-line cases are those which fall near the bound- 
ary between that grade of mental deficiency which will be 
generally recognized as such and the higher group usually 
classed as normal but dull. They are the doubtful cases, the 
ones we are always trying (rarely with success) to restore 
to normality. 
It must be emphasized, however, that this doubtful 
group is not marked off by definite I Q limits. Some chil- 
dren with I Q as high as 75 or even 80 will have to be 
classified as feeble-minded; some as low as 70 I Q may be 
so well endowed in other mental traits that they may 
manage as adults to get along fairly well in a simple en- 
vironment. The ability to compete with one’s fellows in 
the social and industrial world does not depend upon in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  88 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
telligence alone. Such factors as moral traits, industry, 
environment to be encountered, personal appearance, and 
influential relatives are also involved. Two children classi- 
fied above as feeble-minded had an I Q as high as 75. In 
these cases the emotional, moral, or physical qualities were 
so defective as to render a normal social life out of the ques- 
tion. This is occasionally true even with an I Q as high as 
80. Some of the border-line cases, with even less intelli- 
gence, may be so well endowed in other mental traits that 
they are capable of becoming dependable unskilled laborers, 
and of supporting a family after a fashion. 
Examples of border-line deficiency 
S.F. Girl, age 17; mental age 11-6; I Q approximately 72 (dis- 
regarding age above 16 years). Father intelligent; mother probably 
high-grade defective. Lives in a good 
home with aunt, who is a woman of 
good sense and skillful in her manage~ 
ment of the girl. S. F. has attended 
excellent schools for eleven years and 
has recently been promoted to the 
seventh grade. The teacher admits, 
however, that she cannot do the work 
of that grade, but says, “I have n’t 
the heart to let her fail in the sixth 
grade for the third time.” Shestudies 
very hard and says she wants to be- 
come a teacher! At the time the test 
Fic. 9, BALL AND FIELD TEST. Was made she was actually studying S$. F., AGE 17; MENTAL AGE 11-6 her books from two to three hours 
daily at home. The aunt, who is 
very intelligent, had never thought of this girl as feeble-minded, 
and had suffered much concern and humiliation because of her 
inability to teach her to conduct herself properly toward men and 
not to appropriate other people’s property. 
§. F. is ordinarily docile, but is subject to fits of anger and ob- 
stinacy. She finally determined to leave her home, threatening to 
take up with a man unless allowed to work elsewhere. Since then 
she has been tried out in several families, but after a little while in
-P-A-G-E-109
  INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT SIGNIFICANCE 89. 
a place she flies into a rage and leaves. She is a fairly capable 
houseworker when she tries. 
This young woman is feeble-minded and should be classed as 
such. She is listed here with the border-line cases simply for the 
reason that she belongs to a group whose mental deficiency is 
almost never recognized without the aid of a psychological test. 
Probably no physician could be found who would diagnose the case, 
on the basis of a medical examination alone, as one of feeble- 
mindedness. 
F. H. Boy, age 16-6; mental age 11-5; I Q approximately 72 
(disregarding age above 16 years). Tested for three successive years 
without change of more than four points in I Q. Father a laborer, 
dull, subject to fits of rage, and beats the boy. Mother not far from 
border-line. F. H. has always had the best of school advantages 
and has been promoted to the seventh grade. Is really about equal 
to fifth-grade work. Fairly rapid and accurate in number com- 
binations, but cannot solve arithmetical problems which require 
any reasoning. Reads with reasonable fluency, but with little un- 
derstanding. Appears exceedingly good-natured, but was once 
suspended from school for hurling bricks at a fellow pupil. Played 
a “joke” on another pupil by fastening a dangerous, sharp-pointed, 
steel paper-file in the pupil’s seat for him to sit down on. He is 
cruel, stubborn, and plays truant, but is fairly industrious when 
he gets a job as errand or delivery boy. Discharged once for taking 
money. 
F. H. is generally called “queer,” but is not ordinarily thought 
of as feeble-minded. His deficiency is real, however, and it is alto- 
gether doubtful whether he will be able to make a living and to 
keep out of trouble, though he is now (at age 20) employed as mes- 
senger boy for the Western Union at $30 per month. This is con- 
siderably less than pick-and-shovel men get in the community 
where he lives. Delinquents and criminals often belong to this level 
of intelligence. 
W. C. Boy, age 16-8; mental age 12; I Q 75 (disregarding age 
above 16 years). Father a college professor. All the other children 
in the family of unusually superior intelligence. When tested (four 
years ago) was trying to do seventh-grade work, but with little 
success. Wanted to leave school and learn farming, but father 
insisted on his getting the usual grammar-school and high-school
-P-A-G-E-110
    90 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
education. Made $25 one summer by raising vegetables on a vacant 
lot. In the four years since the test was made he has managed to 
get into high school. Teachers say that in spite of his best efforts he 
learns next to nothing, and they regard him as hopelessly dull. Is 
docile, lacks all aggressiveness, looks stupid, and has head circum- 
ference an inch below normal. 
Here is a most pitiful case of the overstimulated backward child 
in a superior family. Instead of nagging at the boy and urging 
him on to attempt things which are impossible to his inferior intel- 
ligence, his parents should take him out of school and put him at 
some kind of work which he could do. If the boy had been the 
son of a common laborer he would probably have left school early 
and have become a dependable and contented laborer. In a very 
simple environment he would probably not be considered defective. 
C. P. Boy, age 10-2; mental age 7-11; I Q 78. Portuguese boy, 
son of a skilled laborer. One of eleven children, most of whom have 
about this same grade of intelligence. Has attended school regu- 
larly for four years. Is in the third grade, but cannot do the work. 
Except for extreme stubbornness his social development is fairly 
normal. Capable in plays and games, but is regarded as impossible 
in his school work. Like his brother, M. P., the next case to be 
described, he will doubtless become a fairly reliable laborer at un- 
skill 2d work and will not be regarded, in his rather simple environ- 
ment, as a defective. From the psychological point of view, how- 
ever, his deficiency is real. He will probably never develop beyond 
the 11- or 12-year level or be able to do satisfactory school work 
beyond the fifth or sixth grade.

M.P. Boy, age 14; mental age 10-8; I Q'77. Has been tested four 
successive years, I Q being always between 75 and 80. Brother to 
C. P. above. In school nearly eight years and has been promoted 
to the fifth grade. At 16 was doing poor work in the sixth grade. 
Good school advantages, as the father has tried conscientiously to
-P-A-G-E-111
  INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT SIGNIFICANCE 91 
give his children “a good education.” Perfectly normal in appear- 
ance and in play activities and is liked by other children. Seems 
to be thoroughly dependable both in school and in his outside 
work. Will probably become an excellent laborer and will pass as 
perfectly normal, notwithstanding a grade of intelligence which 
will not develop above 11 or 12 years. 
What shall we say of cases like the last two which test 
at high-grade moronity or at border-line, but are well 
enough endowed in moral and 
personal traits to pass as normal 
in an uncomplicated social en- 
vironment? According to the 
classical definition of feeble- 
mindedness such _ individuals 
cannot be considered defectives. 
Hardly any one would think of 
them as institutional cases. 
Among laboring men and ser- 
vant girls there are thousands 
like them. They are the world’s SHAG oaa Av NAAa ee 
“hewers of wood and drawers 
of water.” And yet, as far as intelligence is concerned, the 
tests have told the truth. These boys are uneducable be- 
yond the merest rudiments of training. No amount of 
school instruction will ever make them intelligent voters 
or capable citizens in the true sense of the word. Judged 
psychologically they cannot be considered normal. 
It is interesting to note that M. P. and C. P. represent 
the level of intelligence which is very, very common among 
Spanish-Indian and Mexican families of the Southwest and 
also among negroes. ‘Their dullness seems to be racial, 
or at least inherent in the family stocks from which they 
come. The fact that one meets this type with such extra- 
ordinary frequency among Indians, Mexicans, and negroes
-P-A-G-E-112
  92 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
suggests quite forcibly that the whole question of racial 
differences in mental traits will have to be taken up anew 
and by experimental methods. The writer predicts that 
when this is done there will be discovered enormously sig- 
nificant racial differences in general intelligence, differ- 
ences which cannot be wiped out by any scheme of mental 
culture. 
Children of this group should be segregated in special 
classes and be given instruction which is concrete and prac- 
tical. They cannot master abstractions, but they can often 
be made efficient workers, able to look out for themselves. 
There is no possibility at present of convincing society 
that they should not be allowed to reproduce, although 
_ from a eugenic point of view they constitute a grave prob- 
lem because of their unusually prolific breeding. 
Dull normals (I Q usually 80 to 90). In this group are 
included those children who would not, according to any 
of the commonly accepted social standards, be considered 
feeble-minded, but who are nevertheless far enough below 
the actual average of intelligence among races of western 
European descent that they cannot make ordinary school 
progress or master other intellectual difficulties which 
average children are equal to. A few of this class test as 
low as 75 to 80 I Q, but the majority are not far from 85. 
The unmistakably normal children who go much below this 
(in California, at least) are usually Mexicans, Indians, or 
negroes. 
R. G. Negro boy, age 13-5; mental age 10-6; I Q approximately 
80. Normal in appearance and conduct, but very dull. Is attempt- 
ing fifth-grade work in a special class, but is failing. From a fairly 
good home and has had ordinary school advantages. In the exam- 
ination his intelligence is very even as far as it goes, but stops 
rather abruptly after the 10-year tests. Will unquestionably pass 
as normal among unskilled laborers, but his intelligence will never
-P-A-G-E-113
  INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT SIGNIFICANCE 93 
exceed the 12-year level and he is 
not likely to advance beyond the 
seventh grade, if as far. 
F. D. Boy, tested at age 10-2; I Q 
83, and again at 14-1; I Q. 79. 
Mental age in the first test was 8-6 
and in the second test 11. Son of a 
barber. Father dead; mother capa- 
ble; makes a good home, and cares 
for her children well. At 10 was 
doing unsatisfactory work in the * ea : ee 
fourth grade, and at 12 unsatisfac- er LON Aaa eae 
tory work in low sixth. Good- 
looking, normal in appearance and social development, and though 
occasionally obstinate is usually steady. Any one unacquainted 
with his poor school work and low I Q would consider him per- 
fectly normal. No physical or moral handicaps of any kind that 
could possibly account for his retardation. Is simply dull. Needs 
purely a vocational training, but may be able to complete the 
eighth grade with low marks by the age of 16 or 17. 
G. G. Girl, age 12-4; mental age 10-10; I Q 82. From average 
home. Excellent educational advantages and no physical handi- 
caps. At 12 years was doing very poor work in fifth grade. Appear- 
ance, play life, and attitude toward other children normal. Simply . 
dull. Will probably never go beyond the 12- or 13-year level 
and is not likely to get as far as the high school. 
Those testing 80 and 90 will usually be able to reach the 
eighth grade, but ordinarily only after from one to three or 
four failures. They are so very numerous (about 15 per 
cent of the school enrollment) that it is doubtful whether 
we can expect soon to have special classes enough to ac- 
commodate all. The most feasible solution is a differen- 
tiated course of study with parallel classes in which every 
child will be allowed to make the best progress of which 
he is capable, without incurring the risk of failure and non- 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  94 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
promotion. The so-called Mannheim system, or something 
similar to it, is what we need. 
Average intelligence (I Q 90 to 110). It is often said 
that the schools are made for the average child, but that 
“the average child does not exist.”” He does exist, and 
in very large numbers. About 60 per cent of all school 
children test between 90 and 110 I Q, and about 40 per 
cent between 95 and 105. That these children are average is 
attested by their school records as well as by their I Q’s. 
Our records show that, of more than 200 children below 
14 years of age and with I Q between 95 and 105, not one 
was making much more nor much less than average school 
progress. Four were two years retarded, but in each case 
this was due to late start, illness, or irregular attendance. 
Children who test close to 90, however, often fail to get 
along satisfactorily, while those testing near 110 are oc- 
casionally able to win an extra promotion. 
The children of this average group are seldom school 
problems, as far as ability to learn is concerned. Nor are 
they as likely to cause trouble in discipline as the dull 
and border-line cases. It is therefore hardly necessary to 
give illustrative cases here. 
The high school, however, does not fit their grade of in- 
telligence as well as the elementary and grammar schools. 
High schools probably enroll a disproportionate number of 
pupils in the I Q range above 100. That is, the average in- 
telligence among high-school pupils is above the average 
for the population in general. It is probably not far from 
110. College students are, of course, a still more selected 
group, perhaps coming chiefly from the range above 115. 
The child whose school marks are barely average in the ele- 
mentary grades, when measured against children in general, 
will ordinarily earn something less than average marks in 
high school, and perhaps excessively poor marks in college.
-P-A-G-E-115
  
INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT SIGNIFICANCE 95 
Superior intelligence (I Q 110 to 120). Children of this 
group ordinarily make higher marks and are capable of 
making somewhat more rapid progress than the strictly 
average child. Perhaps most of them could complete the 
eight grades in seven years as easily as the average child 
does in eight years. They are not usually the best scholars, 
but on a scale of excellent, good, fair, poor, and failure they 
will usually rank as good, though of course the degree of 
application is a factor. It is rare, however, to find a child 
of this level who is positively indolent in his school work or 
who dislikes school. In high school they are likely to win 
about the average mark. 
Intelligence of 110 to 120 I Q is approximately five times 
as common among children of superior social status as 
among children of inferior social status; the proportion 
among the former being about 24 per cent of all, and among 
the latter only 5 per cent of all. The group is made up 
largely of children of the fairly successful mercantile or 
professional classes. 
The total number of children between 110 and 120 is 
almost exactly the same as the number between 80 and 
90; namely, about 15 per cent. The distance between these 
two groups (say between 85 and 115) is as great as the 
distance between average intelligence and _border-line 
deficiency, and it would be absurd to suppose that 
they could be taught to best advantage in the same 
classes. As a matter of fact, pupils between 110 and 120 
are usually held back to the rate of progress which the 
average child can make. They are little encouraged to do 
their best. 
Very superior intelligence (I Q 120 to 140). Children of 
this group are better than somewhat above average. They 
are unusually superior. Not more than 3 out of 100 go as 
high as 125 1Q, and only about 1 out of 100 as high as 130.
-P-A-G-E-116
  96 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
In the schools of a city of average population only about 1 
child in 250 or 300 tests as high as 140 I Q. 
In a series of 476 unselected children there was not a 
single one reaching 120 whose social class was described 
as “below average.”! Of the children of superior so- 
cial status, about 10 per cent reached 120 or better. 
The 120-140 group is made up almost entirely of 
children whose parents belong to the professional or 
very successful business classes. The child of a skilled 
laborer belongs here occasionally, the child of a common 
laborer very rarely indeed. At least this is true in 
the smaller cities of California among populations made 
up of native-born Americans. In all probability it would 
not have been true in the earlier history of the coun- 
try when ordinary labor was more often than now per- 
formed by men of average intelligence, and it would 
probably not hold true now among certain immigrant 
populations of good stock, but limited social and educa- 
tional advantages. 
What can children of this grade of ability do in school? 
The question cannot be answered as satisfactorily as one 
could wish, for the simple reason that such children are 
rarely permitted to do what they can. What they do accom- 
plish is as follows: Of 54 children (of the 1000 unselected 
cases) falling in this group, 1214 per cent were advanced in 
the grades two years, approximately 54 per cent were ad- 
vanced one year, 28 per cent were in the grade where they 
belonged by chronological age, and three children, or 5144 
per cent, were actually retarded one year. But wherever 
located, such children rarely get anything but the highest 
marks, and the evidence goes to show that most of them 
could easily be prepared for high school by the’ age of 12 
1 In other investigations, however, we have found even brighter chil- 
dren from very inferior homes. See p. 117 for an example.
-P-A-G-E-117
    INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT SIGNIFICANCE 97 
years. Serious injury is done them by schools which believe 
in “ putting on the brakes.” 
The following are illustrations of children testing be- 
tween 130 and 145. Not all are taken from the 1000 un- 
selected tests. The writer has discovered several children 
of this grade as a result of lectures before teachers’ insti- 
tutes. It is his custom, in such lectures, to ask the teachers 
to bring in for a demonstration test the “ brightest child 
in the city” (or county, etc.). The I Q resulting from 
such a test is usually between 130 and 140, occasionally a 
little higher. 
Examples of very superior intelligence 
Margaret P. Age 8-10; mental age 11-1; I Q 130. Father only 
a skilled laborer (house painter), but a man of unusual intelligence 
and character for his social class. Home care above average. M. P. 
has attended school a little less than three years and is completing 
fourth grade. Marks all “excellent.” Health perfect. Social and 
moral traits of the very best. Is obedient, conscientious, and un- 
usually reliable for her age. Quiet and confident bearing, but no 
touch of vanity. 
M. P. is known to be related on her father’s side to John Wesley, 
and her maternal grandfather was a highly skilled mechanic and 
the inventor of an important train-coupling device used on all 
railroads. 
Although she is not yet 9 years old and is completing the fourth 
grade, she is still about a grade below where she belongs by mental 
age. She could no doubt easily be made ready for high school by 
the age of 12. 
J.R. Girl, age 12-9; mental age 16 (average adult); I Q approzi- 
mately 130. Daughter of a university professor. In first year of 
high school. From first grade up her marks have been nearly all of 
the A rank. For first semester of high school four of six grades 
were A, the others B. A wonderfully charming, delightful girl in 
every respect. Play life perfectly normal. 
J. R.’s parents have moved about a great deal and she has at- 
tended eight different schools. She is two years above grade in 
school, but of this gain only one-half grade was made in school;
-P-A-G-E-118
  98 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
the other grade and a half she gained in a little over a year by staying 
out of school and working a little each day under the instruction of her 
mother. But for this she would doubtless now be in the seventh 
grade instead of in high school. As it is she is at least a grade 
below where she belongs by mental age. Something better than 
an average college record may be safely predicted for J. R. 
E. B. Girl, age 7-9; mental age 10-2; I Q 130. E. B. was selected 
by the teachers of a small California city as the brightest school 
child in that city (school population about 500). Her parents are 
said to be unusually intelligent. E. 
B. is in the third grade, a year ad- 
vanced, but her mental level shows 
that she belongs in the fourth. The 
test was made as a demonstration 
test in the presence of about 150 
teachers, all of whom were charmed 
by her delightful personality and 
keen responses. No trace of vanity 
or queerness of any kind. Health 
excellent. E. B. ought to be ready 
for high school at 12; she will really 
Fra. 18. BALL AND FIELD Test. have the intelligence to do high- 
E. B, AGE 7-9; I Q 180 school work by 11. 
L. B. Girl, age 8-6; mental age 11-6; I Q 135. Tested nearly 
three years earlier, age 5-11; mental age 7-6; I Q 127. Daughter 
of a university professor. At age of 8-6 was doing very superior 
work in the fifth grade. Later, at age of 10-6, is in the seventh 
grade with all her marks excellent. Has two sisters who test almost 
as high, both completing the eighth grade at barely 12 years of age. 
L. B. looks rather delicate, and though a little nervous is ordinarily 
strong. We have known her since her early childhood. Like both 
her sisters, she is a favorite with young and old, as nearly perfection 
as the most charming little girl could be. 
R. S. Boy, age 6-5; mental age 9-6; I Q 148. When tested at 
age 5-2 he had a mental age of 7-6, I Q 142. Father a university 
professor. R. S. entered school at exactly 6 years of age, and at 
the present writing is 714 years old and is entering the third grade. 
Leads his class in school and takes delight in the work. Is normal
-P-A-G-E-119
  INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT SIGNIFICANCE 99 
in play life and social traits and is dependable and thoughtful be- 
yond his years. Should enter high school not later than 12; could 
probably be made ready a year earlier, but.as he is somewhat 
nervous this might not be wise. 
T.F. Boy, age 10-6; mental age 14; I Q 133. At 13-6 tested at 
“superior adult,” and had vocabulary of 13,000 (also “superior 
adult”). Son of a college professor. Did not go to school till age 
of 9 years and was not taught to read till 814. At this writing he 
is 1514 years old and is a senior in high school. He will complete 
the high-school course in three and one-half years with A to B 
marks, mostly A. Gets his hardest mathematics lessons in five to 
ten minutes. Science is his play. When he discovered Hodge’s 
Nature Study and Life at age of 11 years he literally slept with the 
book till he almost knew it by heart. Since age 12 he has given 
much time to magazines on mechanics and electricity. At 13 he 
installed a wireless apparatus without other aid than his electrical

derstanding of the principles underlying electrical applications. 
He is known by his playmates as “the boy with a hobby.” Stamp 
collections, butterfly and moth collections (over 70 different varie- 
ties), seashore collections, and wireless apparatus all show that 
the appellation is fully merited. Hechooses his hobbies and “rides” 
them entirely on his own initiative.

F. McA. Boy, age 10-3; mental age 14-6; I Q 142. Father a 
school principal. F. is leading his class of 24 pupils in the high 
seventh grade. Has received so many extra promotions only be- 
cause his father insisted that the teachers allow him to try the 
next grade. The dire consequences which they predicted have 
never followed. F. is perfectly healthy and one of the most attrac- 
tive lads the writer has ever seen. He has the normal play in- 
stincts, but when not at play he 
has the dignified bearing of a young 
prince, although without vanity. 
His vocabulary is 9000 (14 years), 
and his ability is remarkably even 
in all directions. F. should easily 
enter college by the age of 15. 
E. M. Boy, age 6-11; mental age

grade at 9 a.m. and had been pro- 
moted to the fourth grade by 3 p.m. of the same day! Has now 
attended school a half-year and is in the fifth grade, age 7 years, 
8 months. Father is on the faculty of a university. 
E. M. is as superior in personal and moral traits as in intelli- 
gence. Responsible, sturdy, playful, full of humor, loving, obedi- 
ent. Health is excellent. Has had no home instruction in school 
work. His progress has been perfectly natural. 
The above list of “‘ very superior” children includes 
only a few of those we have tested who belong to this grade 
of intelligence. Every child in the list is so interesting that 
it is hard to omit any. We have found all such children 
(with one or two exceptions not included here) so superior 
to average children in all sorts of mental and moral traits

that one is at a loss to understand how the popular super- 
stitions about the “ queerness” of bright children could 
have originated or survived. Nearly every child we have 
found with I Q above 140 is the kind one feels, before the 
test is over, one would like to adopt. If the crime of kid- 
naping could ever be forgiven it would be in the case of a 
child like one of these.

Genius and ‘‘ near” genius. Intelligence tests have not 
been in use long enough to enable us to define genius defi- 
nitely in terms of IQ. The following two cases are offered 
as among the highest test records of which the writer has 
personal knowledge. It is doubtful whether more than one 
child in 10,000 goes as high as either. One case has been 
reported, however, in which the I Q was not far from 200. 
Such a record, if reliable, is certainly phenomenal. 
E. F. Russian boy, age 8-5; mental age 13; IQ approximately 155. 
Mother is a university student apparently of very superior intelli-

is in the sixth grade and at the head of his class. Although about 
four grades advanced beyond his chronological age he is still one 
grade retarded! He could easily carry seventh-grade work. In all 
probability E. F. could be made ready for college by the age of 12 
years without injury to body or mind. His mother has taken the 
only sensible course; she has encouraged him without subjecting 
him to overstimulation.

E. F. was selected for the test as probably one of the brightest 
children in a city of a third of a million population. He may not 
be the brightest in that city, but he is one of the three or four most 
intelligent the writer has found after a good deal of searching. He 
is probably equaled by not more than one in several thousand un- 
selected children. How impatiently one waits to see the fruit of 
such a budding genius!

but by one of his graduate stu- 
dents. The record included the 
verbatim responses, so that it was 
easy to verify the scoring. There 
can be no doubt as to the substan- 
tial accuracy of the test. This I Q 
of 160 is the highest one in the 
Stanford University records. B. F. 
has excellent health, normal play 
interests, and is a favorite among 
his playfellows. Parents had not 
thought of him as especially re- 
Fic. 16. BALL AND FIELD. B. F, markable. He is only in the third 
AGE 7-8; MENTAL AGE 12-4; grade, and is therefore about three 
TQ 160 grades below his mental age. 
(This is a 12-year performance) 
It is especially noteworthy 
that not one of the children we have described with I Q 
above 130 has ever had any unusual amount or kind of 
home instruction. In most cases the parents were not 
aware of their very great superiority. Nor can we give the 
credit to the school or its methods. The school has in most 
cases been a deterrent to their progress, rather than a help. 
These children have been taught in classes with average 
and inferior children, like those described in the first 
part of this chapter. Their high I Q is only an index of 
their extraordinary cerebral endowment. This endowment 
is for life. There is not the remotest probability that any 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
BR NR ee ee a ee 
INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT SIGNIFICANCE 103 
of these children will deteriorate to the average level of 
intelligence with the onset of maturity. Such an event 
would be no less a miracle (barring insanity) than the de- 
velopment of an imbecile into a successful lawyer or 
physician. 
Is the I Q often misleading ? Do the cases described in 
this chapter give a reliable picture as to what one may 
expect of the various I Q levels? Does the I Q furnish any- 
thing like a reliable index of an individual’s general educa- 
tional possibilities and of his social worth? Are there not 
“feeble-minded geniuses,” and are there not children of 
exceptionally high I Q who are nevertheless fools? 
We have no hesitation in saying that there is not one 
ease in fifty in which there is any serious contradiction 
between the I Q and the child’s performances in and out of 
school. We cannot deny the existence of “ feeble-minded 
geniuses,” but after a good deal of search we have not found 
one. Occasionally, of course, one finds a feeble-minded per- 
son who is an expert penman, who draws skillfully, who 
plays a musical instrument tolerably well, or who handles 
number combinations with unusual rapidity; but these 
are not geniuses; they are not authors, artists, musicians, 
or mathematicians. 
As for exceptionally intelligent children who appear 
feeble-minded, we have found but one case, a boy of 10 
years with an I Q of about 125. This boy, whom we have 
tested several times and whose development we have fol- 
lowed for five years, was once diagnosed by a physician 
as feeble-minded. His behavior among other persons than 
his familiar associates is such as to give this impression. 
Nothing less than an entire chapter would be adequate for 
a description of this case, which is in reality one of dis- 
turbed emotional and social development with superior 
intelligence. 
   
-P-A-G-E-124
  
    104 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
It should be emphasized, however, that what we have 
said about the significance of various I Q’s holds only for 
the I Q’s secured by the use of the Stanford revision. As 
we have shown elsewhere (p. 62 ff.) the I Q yielded by other 
versions of the Binet tests are often so inaccurate as to be 
misleading. 
We have not found a single child who tested between 
70 and 80 I Q by the Stanford revision who was able to 
do satisfactory school work in the grade where he belonged 
by chronological age. Such children are usually from two 
to three grades retarded by the age of 12 years. On the 
other hand, the child with an I Q of 120 or above is almost 
never found below the grade for his chronological age, and 
occasionally he is one or two grades above. Wherever lo- 
cated, his school work is so superior as to suggest strongly 
the desirability of extra promotions. Those who test be- 
tween 96 and 105 are almost never more than one grade 
above or below where they belong by chronological age, 
and even the small displacement of one year is usually 
determined by illness, age of beginning school, etc.

CHAPTER VII 
RELIABILITY OF THE BINET-SIMON METHOD 
General value of the method. In a former chapter we have 
noted certain imperfections of the scale devised by Binet 
and Simon; namely, that many of the tests were not cor- 
rectly located, that the choice of tests was in a few cases 
unsatisfactory, that the directions for giving and scoring 
the tests were sometimes too indefinite, and that the upper 
and lower ranges of the scale especially stood in need of 
extensions and corrections. All of these faults have been 
quite generally admitted. The method itself, however, 
after being put to the test by psychologists of all countries 
and of all faiths, by the skeptical as well as the friendly, 
has amply demonstrated its value. The agreement on this 
point is as complete as it is regarding the scale’s imper- 
fections. 
The following quotations from prominent psychologists 
who have studied the method will serve to show how it is 
regarded by those most entitled to an opinion: — 
There can be no question about the fact that the Binet-Simon 
tests do not make half as frequent or half as great errors in the 
mental ages (of feeble-minded children) as are included in gradings 
based: on careful, prolonged general observation by experienced 
observers.! 
All of the different authors who have made these researches 
(with Binet’s method) are in a general way unanimous in recog- 
1 Dr. F. Kuhlmann: “The Binet-Simon Tests of Intelligence in Grading 
Feeble-Minded Children,” in Journal of Psycho-Asthenics (1912), p. 189.
-P-A-G-E-126
  106 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
nizing that the principle of the scale is extremely fortunate, and 
all believe that it offers the basis of a most useful method for the 
examination of intelligence. 
It serves as a relatively simple and speedy method of securing, 
by means accessible to every one, a true insight into the average 
level of ability of a child between 3 and 15 years of age.? 
That, despite the differences in race and language, despite the 
divergences in school organization and in methods of instruction, 
there should be so decided agreement in the reactions of the chil- 
dren — is, in my opinion, the best vindication of the principle of 
the tests that one could imagine, because this agreement demon- 
strates that the tests do actually reach and discover the general develop- 
mental conditions of intelligence (so far as these are operative in 
public-school children of the present cultural epoch), and not 
mere fragments of knowledge and attainments acquired by chance.* 
It is without doubt the most satisfactory and accurate method of 
determining a child’s intelligence that we have, and so far superior 
to everything else which has been proposed that as yet there is 
nothing else to be considered.4 
The value of the method lies both in the swiftness and 
the accuracy with which it works. One who knows how to 
apply the tests correctly and who is experienced in the psy- 
chological interpretation of responses can in forty minutes 
arrive at a more accurate judgment as to a subject’s in- 
telligence than would be possible without the tests after 
months or even years of close observation. The reasons for 
this have already been set forth.’ The difference is some- 
thing like that between measuring a person’s height with 
a yardstick and estimating it by guess. That this is not an 
unfair statement of the case is well shown by the follow-

ing candid confession by a psychologist who tested 200 juve- 
nile delinquents brought before Judge Lindsey’s court: — 
As a matter of interest I estimated the mental ages of 150 of my 
subjects before testing them. In 54 of the estimates the error was 
not more than one year in either direction; 70 of the subjects were 
estimated too high, the average error being 2 years and 7 months; 
26 of the subjects were estimated too low, the average error being 
2 years and 2 months. These figures would seem to imply that an 
estimate with nothing to support it is wholly unreliable, more especi- 
ally as many of the estimates were four or five years wide of the mark 
Criticisms of the Binet method have also been frequently 
voiced, but chiefly by persons who have had little experi- 
ence with it or by those whose scientific training hardly 
justifies an opinion. It cannot be too strongly emphasized 
that eminence in law, medicine, education, or any other 
profession does not of itself enable any one to pass 
judgment on the validity of a psychological method. 
Dependence of the scale’s reliability on the training of 
the examiner. On this point two radically different opin- 
ions have been urged. On the one hand, some have insisted 
that the results of a test made by other than a thoroughly 
trained psychologist are absolutely worthless. At the oppo- 
site extreme are a few who seem to think that any teacher 
or physician can secure perfectly valid results after a few 
hours’ acquaintance with the tests. 
The dispute is one which cannot be settled by the as- 
sertion of opinion, and, unfortunately, thoroughgoing in- 
vestigations have not yet been made as to the frequency 
and extent of errors made by untrained or partially trained 
examiners. The only study of this kind which has so far 
been reported is the following:—?

School Bulletin (1915), p. 192. (Italics inserted.)

The Training School Bulletin (1914), pp. 118-17.
-P-A-G-E-128
  108 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Dr. Kohs gives the results of tests made by 58 inex- 
perienced teachers who were taking a summer course in 
the Training School at Vineland. The class met three times 
a week for instruction in the use of the Binet scale. During 
the first week the students listened to three lectures by 
Dr. Goddard. : The second week was given over to demon- 
stration testing. Each student saw four children tested, 
and attended two discussion periods of an hour each. 
During the third, fourth, and fifth weeks each student 
tested one child per week, and observed the testing of two 
others. The student was allowed to carry the test through 
in his own way, but received criticism after it was finished. 
Twice a week Dr. Goddard spent an hour with the class, 
discussing experimental procedure. The subjects tested 
were feeble-minded children whose exact mental ages 
were already known, and for this reason it was possible to 
check up the accuracy of each student’s work. 
Kohs’s table of results for the trial testing of the 174 
children showed: — 
(1) That 50 per cent of the work was as exact as any 
one in the laboratory could make it; 
(2) That in an additional 38 per cent the results were 
within three fifths of a year of being exact; 
(8) That nearly 90 per cent of the work of the summer 
students was sufficiently accurate for all practical 
purposes; 
(4) That the records improved during the brief training 
so that during the third week only one test missed 
the real mental age by as much as a year. 
Since hardly any of these students had had any previous 
experience with the Binet tests, Dr. Kohs seems to be en- 
tirely justified in his conclusion that it is possible, in the
-P-A-G-E-129
    RELIABILITY OF THE METHOD 109 
brief period of six weeks, to teach people to use the tests 
with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 
What shall we say of the teacher or of the physician who 
has not even had this amount of instruction? The writer’s 
experience forces him to agree with Binet and with Dr. 
Goddard, that any one with intelligence enough to be a 
teacher, and who is willing to devote conscientious study 
to the mastery of the technique, can use the scale accurately 
enough to get a better idea of a child’s mental endowment 
than he could possibly get in any other way. It is necessary, 
however, for the untrained person to recognize his own lack 
of experience, and in no case would it be justifiable to 
base important action or scientific conclusions upon the 
results of the inexpert examiner. As Binet himself re- 
peatedly insisted, the method is not absolutely mechanical, 
and cannot be made so by elaboration of instructions. 
It is sometimes held that the examination and classifica- 
tion of backward children for special instruction should be 
carried out by the school physicians. The fact is, however, 
that there is nothing in the physician’s training to give 
him any advantage over the ordinary teacher in the use of 
the Binet tests. Because of her more intimate knowledge of 
children and because of her superior tact and adaptability, 
the average teacher is perhaps better equipped than the 
average physician to give intelligence tests. 
Finally, it should be emphasized that whatever the 
previous training or experience of the examiner may have 
been, his ability to adjust to the child’s personality and his 
willingness to follow conscientiously the directions for giv- 
ing the tests are important factors in his equipment. 
Influence of the subject’s attitude. One continually 
meets such queries as, ‘‘How do you know the subject 
did his best?’ ‘Possibly the child was nervous or 
frightened,” or, “‘ Perhaps incorrect answers were purposely
-P-A-G-E-130
  110 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
given.” All such objections may be disposed of by saying 
that the competent examiner can easily control the experi- 
ment in such a way that embarrassment is soon replaced by 
self-confidence, and in such a way that effort is kept at its 
maximum. As for mischievous deception, it would be a 
poor clinicist who could not recognize and deal with the 
little that is likely to arise. 
Cautions regarding embarrassment, fatigue, fright, ill- 
ness, etc., are given in Chapter IX. Most of the errors which 
have been reported along this line are such as can nearly 
always be avoided by ordinary prudence, coupled with a 
little power of observation.! We must not charge the mis- 
takes of untrained and indiscreet examiners against the 
validity of the method itself. 
It is possibly true that even if the examiner is tactful 
and prudent an unfavorable attitude on the part of the 
subject may occasionally affect the results of a test to some 
extent, but it ought not seriously to invalidate one examina- 
tion out of five hundred. The greatest danger is in the case 
of a young subject who has been recently arrested and 
brought before a court. Even here a little common sense 
and scientific insight should enable one to guard against a 
mistaken diagnosis. 
The influence of coaching. It might be supposed that 
after the intelligence scale had been used with a few pupils 
in a given school all of their fellows would soon be apprised 
of the nature of the tests, and so learn the correct responses. 
Experience shows, however, that there is little likelihood 
of such influence except in the case of a small minority of 
the tests. Experiments in the psychology of testimony have 
demonstrated that children’s ability to report upon a com- 
plex set of experiences is astonishingly weak. In testing 
1 See, for example, the rather ludicrous “errors” of the Binet method 
reported in The Psychological Clinic for 1915, pp. 140 ff. and 167 ff.
-P-A-G-E-131
  RELIABILITY OF THE METHOD 111 
with the Stanford revision a child is ordinarily given from 
twenty-four to thirty different tests, many of which are 
made up of three or more items. Of the total forty to fifty 
items the child is ordinarily able to report but few, and 
these not always correctly. 
Such tests as memory for sentences and digits, drawing 
the square and diamond, reproducing the designs from 
memory, comparing weights and lines, describing and in- 
terpreting pictures, esthetic comparison, vocabulary, dis- 
sected sentences, fables, reading for memories, finding 
differences and similarities, arithmetical reasoning, and the 
form-board test, are hardly subject to report at all. While 
almost any of the other tests might, theoretically, be com- 
municated, there is little danger that many of them will 
be. It is assumed, of course, that the examiner will take 
proper precautions to prevent any of his blanks or other 
materials from falling into the hands of those who are to 
be examined. 
The following tests are the ones most subject to the in- 
fluence of coaching: Ball and field, giving date, naming 
sixty words, finding rhymes, changing hands of clock, 
comprehension of physical relations, “induction test,” 
and “ ingenuity test.” 
In several instances we have interviewed children an 
hour or two after they had taken the examination, in order 
to find out how many of the tests they could recall. A boy 
of 4 years, after repeated questioning, could only say: 
“He showed me some pictures. He had a knife and a penny. 
He told me to shut the door.” A girl of 3 years could recall 
nothing whatever that was intelligible. 
An 8-year-old boy said: “ He made me tie a knot. He 
asked me about a ship and an auto. He wanted me to count 
backwards. He made me say over some things, numbers 
and things.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
    112. THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
A boy of 12 years said: “‘ He told me to say all the words 
I could think of. He said some foolish things and asked 
what was foolish [he could not repeat a single absurdity]. 
I had to put some blocks together. I had to do some 
problems in arithmetic [he could not repeat a single prob- 
lem]. He read some fables to me. [Asked about the fables 
he was able to recall only part of one, that of the fox and the 
crow.] He showed me the picture of a field and wanted to 
know how to find a ball.” 
It is evident from the above samples of report that the 
danger of coaching increases considerably with the age of 
the children concerned. With young subjects the danger is 
hardly present at all; with children of the upper-grammar 
grades, in the high school, and most of all in prisons and 
reformatories, it must be taken into account. Alternative 
tests may sometimes be used to advantage when there is 
evidence of coaching on any of the regular tests. It would 
be desirable to have two or three additional scales which 
could be used interchangeably with the Binet-Simon. 
Reliability of repeated tests. Will the same tests give 
consistent results when used repeatedly with the same sub- 
ject? In general we may say that they do. Something 
depends, however, on the age and intelligence of the sub- 
ject and on the time interval between the examinations. 
Goddard proves that feeble-minded individuals whose 
intelligence has reached its full development continue to 
test at exactly the same mental age by the Binet scale, 
year after year. In their case, familiarity with the tests 
does not in the least improve the responses. At each re- 
testing the responses given at previous examinations are 
repeated with only the most trivial variations. Of 352 
feeble-minded children tested at Vineland, three years in 
succession, 109 gave absolutely no variation, 232 showed a 
variation of not more than two fifths of a year, while 22
-P-A-G-E-133
  RELIABILITY OF THE METHOD 113 
gained as much as one year in the three tests. The latter, 
presumably, were younger children whose intelligence was 
still developing. 
Goddard has also tested 464 public-school children for 
three successive years. Approximately half of these showed 
normal progress or more in mental age, while most of the 
remainder showed somewhat less than normal progress. 
Bobertag’s retesting of 83 normal children after an in- 
terval of a year gave results entirely in harmony with 
those of Goddard. The reapplication of the tests showed 
absolutely no influence of familiarity, the correlation of 
the two tests being almost perfect (.95). Those who tested 
“at age” in the first test had advanced, on the average, 
exactly one year. Those who tested plus in the first test. 
advanced in the twelve months about a year and a quarter, 
as we should expect those to do whose mental development 
is accelerated. Correspondingly, those who tested minus 
at the first test advanced only about three fourths of a 
year in mental age during the interval.1 
Our own results with a mixed group of normal, su- 
perior, dull, and feeble-minded children agree fully with the 
above findings. In this case the two tests were separated 
by an interval of two to four years, and the correlation 
between their results was practically perfect. The average 
difference between the I Q obtained in the second test and 
that obtained in the first was only 4 per cent, and the great- 
est difference found was only 8 per cent.? 
The repetition of the test at shorter intervals will per- 
haps affect the result somewhat more, but the influence is 
much less than one might expect. The writer has tested, at

Psychol. (1912), p. 521 ff.

Measuring Intelligence. (Warwick and York, 1916.)
-P-A-G-E-134
  114 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
intervals of only a few days to a few weeks, 14 backward 
children of 12 to 18 years, and 8 normal children of 5 to 
13 years. The backward children showed an average im- 
provement in the second test of about two months in 
mental age, the normal children an average improvement of 
little more than three months. No child varied in the 
second test more than half a year from the mental age first 
secured. On the whole, normal children profit more from 
the experience of a previous test than do the backward 
and feeble-minded. 
Berry tested 45 normal children and 50 defectives with 
the Binet 1908 and 1911 scales at brief intervals. The 
author does not state which scale was applied first, but 
the mental ages secured by the two scales were practically 
the same when allowance was made for the slightly greater 
difficulty of the 1911 series of tests. 
We may conclude, therefore, that while it would proba- 
bly be desirable to have one or more additional scales for 
alternative use in testing the same children at very brief 
intervals, the same scale may be used for repeated tests 
at intervals of a year or more with little danger of serious 
inaccuracy. Moreover, results like those set forth above are 
important evidence as to the validity of the test method. 
Influence of social and educational advantages. The 
criticism has often been made that the responses to many 
of the tests are so much subject to the influence of school 
and home environment as seriously to invalidate the scale 
as a whole. Some of the tests most often named in this 
connection are the following: Giving age and sex; naming

noon; counting; making change; reading for memories;

It has in fact been found wherever comparisons have 
‘been made that children of superior social status yield a 
higher average mental age than children of the laboring 
classes. The results of Decroly and Degand and of Meu- 
mann, Stern, and Binet himself may be referred to in this 
connection. In the case of the Stanford investigation, 
also, it was found that when the unselected school children 
were grouped in three classes according to social status 
(superior, average, and inferior), the average I Q for the 
superior social group was 107, and that of the inferior social 
group 93. This is equivalent to a difference of one year in 
mental age with 7-year-olds, and to a difference of two 
years with 14-year-olds. 
However, the common opinion that the child from a cul- 
tured home does better in tests solely by reason of his su- 
perior home advantages is an entirely gratuitous assump- 
tion. Practically all of the investigations which have been 
made of the influence of nature and nurture on mental 
performance agree in attributing far more to original en- 
dowment than to environment. Common observation would 
itself suggest that the social class to which the family 
belongs depends less on chance than on the parents’ native 
qualities of intellect and character. 
The results of five separate and distinct lines of inquiry 
based on the Stanford data agree in supporting the conclu- 
sion that the children of successful and cultured parents test 
higher than children from wretched and ignorant homes 
for the simple reason that their heredity is better. The re- 
sults of this investigation are set forth in full elsewhere.

Scale of Intelligence. . (Warwick and York, 1916.)

  116 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
It would, of course, be going too far to deny all possibility 
of environmental conditions affecting the result of an in- 
telligence test. Certainly no one would expect that a child 
reared in a cage and denied all intercourse with other human 
beings could by any system of mental measurement test 
up to the level of normal children. There is, however, no 
reason to believe that ordinary differences in social en- 
vironment (apart from heredity), differences such as those 
obtaining among unselected children attending approxi- 
mately the same general type of school in a civilized 
community, affects to any great extent the validity of the 
scale. 
A crucial experiment would be to take a large number of 
very young children of the lower classes and, after placing 
them in the most favorable environment obtainable, to 
compare their later mental development with that of chil- 
dren born into the best homes. No extensive study of this 
kind has been made, but the writer has tested twenty or- 
phanage children who, for the most part, had come from 
very inferior homes. They had been in a well-conducted 
orphanage for from two to several years, and had enjoyed 
during that time the advantages of an excellent village 
school. Nevertheless, all but three tested below average, 
ranging from 75 to 901 Q. 
The impotence of school instruction to neutralize indi- 
vidual differences in native endowment will be evident to 
any one who follows the school career of backward chil- 
dren. The children who are seriously retarded in school 
are not normal, and cannot be made normal by any refine- 
ment of educational method. As a rule, the longer the 
inferior child attends school, the more evident his inferi- 
ority becomes. It would hardly be reasonable, therefore, 
to expect that a littie incidental instruction in the home 
would weigh very heavily against these same native differ-
-P-A-G-E-137
    RELIABILITY OF THE METHOD 117 
ences in endowment. Cases like the following show conclu- 
sively that it does not :— 
X is the son of unusually intelligent and well-educated parents. 
The home is everything one would expect of people of scholarly 
pursuits and cultivated tastes. But X has always been irresponsi- 
ble, troublesome, childish, and queer. He learned to walk at 2 
years, to talk at 3, and has always been delicate and nervous. 
When brought for examination he was 8 years old. He had twice 
attempted school work, but could accomplish nothing and was 
withdrawn. His play-life was not normal, and other children, 
younger than himself, abused and tormented him. The Binet 
tests gave an I Q of approximately 75; that is, the retardation 
amounted to about two years. The child was examined again 
three years later. At that time, after attending school two years, 
he had recently completed the first grade. This time the I Q was 
73. Strange to say, the mother is encouraged and hopeful because 
she sees that her boy is learning to read. She does not seem to real- 
ize that at his age he ought to be within three years of entering 
high school. 
The forty-minute test had told more about the mental ability 
of this boy than the intelligent mother had been able to learn in 
eleven years of daily and hourly observation. For X is feeble- 
minded; he will never complete the grammar school; he will never 
be an efficient worker or a responsible citizen. 
Let us change the picture. Z is a bright-eyed, dark-skinned girl 
of 9 years. She is dark-skinned because her father is a mixture of 
Indian and Spanish. The mother is of Irish descent. With her 
strangely mated parents and two brothers she lives in a dirty, 
cramped, and poorly furnished house in the country. The parents 
are illiterate, and the brothers are retarded and dull, though not 
feeble-minded. 
It is Z’s turn to be tested. I inquire the name. It is familiar, 
for I have already tested the two stupid brothers. I also know her 
ignorant parents and the miserable cabin in which she lives. The 
examination begins with the 8-year tests. The responses are 
quick and accurate. We proceed to the 9-year group. There is no 
failure, and there is but one minor error. Successes and failures 
alternate for a while until the latter prevail. Z has tested at 11 
years. In spite of her wretched home, she is mentally advanced 
nearly 25 per cent. By the vocabulary test she is credited with a
-P-A-G-E-138
oN ee ne ee 
118 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE | 
knowledge of nearly 6000 words, or nearly four times as many as | 
X, the boy of cultured home and scholarly parents, had learned by 
the age of 8 years. 
Five years have passed. When given the test, Z was in the 
fourth grade and, as we have already stated, 9 years of age. As 
a result of the test she was transferred to the fifth grade. Later 
she skipped again and at the age of 14 is a successful student in 
the second year of high school. To assay her intelligence and deter- 
mine its quality was a task of forty-five minutes. 
The above cases, each of which could: be paralleled by 
many others which we have found, will serve to illustrate 
the fact that exceptionally superior endowment is dis- 
coverable by the tests, however unfavorable the home from 
which it comes, and that inferior endowment cannot be 
normalized by all the advantages of the most cultured home. 
Quoting again from Stern, “‘ The tests actually reach and 
discover the general developmental conditions of intelli- 
gence, and not mere fragments of knowledge and attain- 
ments acquired by chance.”

CHAPTER VIII 
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 
Necessity of securing attention and effort. The child’s 
intelligence is to be judged by his success in the performance 
of certain tasks. These tasks may appear to the examiner 
to be very easy, indeed; but we must bear in mind that they 
are often anything but easy for the child. Real effort 
and attention are necessary for his success, and occasion- 
ally even his best efforts fall short of the desired result. 
If the tests are to display the child’s real intellectual ability 
it will be necessary, therefore, to avoid as nearly as possible 
every disturbing factor which would divide his attention 
or in any other way injure the quality of his responses. To 
insure this it will be necessary to consider somewhat in 
detail a number of factors which influence effort, such as 
degree of quiet, the nature of surroundings, presence or 
absence of others, means of gaining the child’s confidence, 
the avoidance of embarrassment, fatigue, etc. 
One should not expect, however, to secure an absolutely 
equal degree of attention from all subjects. The power to 
give sustained attention to a difficult task is characteris- 
tically weak in dull and feeble-minded children. What we 
should labor to secure is the maximum attention of which 
the child is capable, and if this is unsatisfactory without 
external cause, we are to regard the fact as symptomatic 
of inferior mental ability, not as an extenuating factor or 
an excuse for lack of success in the tests. 
Attention, of course, cannot be normal if any acute 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
  122 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
physical or mental disturbance is present. Toothache, 
headache, earache, nausea, fever, cold, etc., all render the 
test inadvisable. The same is true of mental anxiety or 
fear, as in the case of the child who has just been arrested 
and brought before the court. 
Quiet and seclusion. The tests should be conducted in a 
quiet room, located where the noises of the street and other 
outside distractions cannot enter. A reasonably small room 
is better than a very large one, because it is more homelike. 
The furnishings of the room should be simple. A table and 
two chairs are sufficient. If the room contains a number of 
unfamiliar objects, such as psychological apparatus, pic- 
tures on the walls, etc., the attention of the child is likely 
to be drawn away from the tasks which he is given to do. 
The halls and corridors which it is sometimes necessary to 
use in testing school children are usually noisy, cold, or 
otherwise objectionable, 
Presence of others. A still more disturbing influence is 
the presence of other persons. Generally speaking, if ac- 
curate results are to be secured it is not permissible to 
have any auditor, besides possibly an assistant to record 
the responses. Even the assistant, however quiet and unob- 
trusive, is sometimes a disturbing element. Though some- 
thing of a convenience, the assistant is by no means neces- 
sary, after the examiner has thoroughly mastered the pro- 
cedure of the tests and has acquired some skill in the use of 
abbreviations in recording the answers. If an assistant 
or any other person is present, he should be seated some- 
what behind the child, not too close, and should take no 
notice of the child either when he enters the room or at 
any time during the examination. 
At all events, the presence of parent, teacher, school 
principal, or governess is to be avoided. Contrary to what 
one might expect, these distract the child much more than
-P-A-G-E-143
  
INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 123 
a strange personality would do. Their critical attitude 
toward the child’s performance is very likely to cause em- 
barrassment. If the child is alone with the examiner, he 
is more at ease from the mere fact that he does not feel 
that there is a reputation to sustain. The praise so lavishly 
bestowed upon him by the friendly and sympathetic ex- 
aminer lends to the same effect. 
As Binet emphasizes, if the presence of others cannot be 
avoided, it is at least necessary to require of them absolute 
silence. Parents, and sometimes teachers, have an almost 
irrepressible tendency to interrupt the examination with 
excuses for the child’s failures and with disturbing explana- 
tions which are likely to aid the child in comprehending the 
required task. Without the least intention of doing so, 
they sometimes practically tell the child how to respond. 
Parents, especially, cannot refrain from scolding the child 
or showing impatience when his answers do not come up 
to expectation. This, of course, endangers the child’s 
success still further. 
The psychologist is not surprised at such conduct. It 
would be foolish to expect average parents, even apart 
from their bias in the particular case at hand, to adopt the 
scientific attitude of the trained examiner. Since we cannot 
in a few moments at our disposal make them over into 
psychologists, our only recourse is to deal with them by 
exclusion. 
This is not to say that it is impossible to test a child 
satisfactorily in the presence of others. If the examiner is 
experienced, and if the child is not timid, it is sometimes 
possible to make a successful test in the presence of quite 
a number of auditors, provided they remain silent, refrain 
from staring, and otherwise conduct themselves with dis- 
cretion. But not even the veteran examiner can always be 
sure of the outcome in demonstration testing.
-P-A-G-E-144
‘124 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Getting into “ rapport.’? The examiner’s first task is to 
win the confidence of the child and overcome his timidity. 
Unless rapport has first been established, the results of the 
first tests given are likely to be misleading. The time and 
effort necessary for accomplishing this are variable factors, 
depending upon the personality of both the examiner and 
the subject. In a majority of cases from three to five min- 
utes should be sufficient, but in a few cases somewhat 
more time is necessary. 
The writer has found that when a strange child is brought 
to the clinic for examination, it is advantageous to go out 
of doors with him for a little walk around the university 
buildings. It is usually possible to return from such a stroll 
in a few minutes, with the child chattering away as though 
to an old friend. Another approach is to begin by showing 
the child some interesting object, such as a toy, or a form- 
board, or pictures not used in the test. The only danger in 
this method is that the child is likely to find the object so 
interesting that he may not be willing to abandon it for the 
tests, or that his mind will keep reverting to it during the 
examination. 
Still another method is to give the child his seat as soon 
as he is ushered into the room, and, after a word of greeting, 
which must be spoken in a kindly tone but without gushi- 
ness, to open up a conversation about matters likely to be 
of interest. The weather, place of residence, pets, sports, 
games, toys, travels, current events, etc., are suitable topics 
if rightly employed. When the child has begun to express 
himself without timidity and it is clear that his confidence 
has been gained, one may proceed, as though in continu- 
ance of the conversation, to inquire the name, age, and 
school grade. The examiner notes these down in the ap- 
propriate blanks, rather unconcernedly, at the same time 
complimenting the child (unless it is clearly a case of serious 
   
-P-A-G-E-145
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 125 
retardation) on the fine progress he has made with his 
studies. 
Keeping the child encouraged. Nothing contributes 
more to a satisfactory rapport than praise of the child’s 
efforts. Under no circumstances should the examiner permit 
himself to show displeasure at a response, however absurd 
it may be. In general, the poorer the response, the better 
satisfied one should appear to be with it. An error is al- 
ways to be passed by without comment, unless it is pain- 
fully evident to the child himself, in which case the ex- 
aminer will do well to make some excuse for it; e.g., ‘ You 
are not quite old enough to answer questions like that one; 
but, never mind, you are doing beautifully,” ete. Ex- 
clamations like “ fine!” “ splendid!” etc., should be used 
lavishly. Almost any innocent deception is permissible 
which keeps the child interested, confident, and at his best 
level of effort. The examination should begin with tests 
that are fairly easy, in order to give the child a little 
experience with success before the more difficult tests are 
reached. 
The importance of tact. It goes without saying that chil- 
dren’s personalities are not so uniform and simple that we 
can adhere always to a single stereotyped procedure in 
working our way into their good graces. Suggestions like 
the above have their value, but, like rules of etiquette, , 
they must be supported by the tact which comes of intui- 
tion and cannot be taught. The address which flatters and 
pleases one child may excite disgust in another. The ex- 
aminer must scent the situation and adapt his method to 
it. One child is timid and embarrassed; another may think 
his mental powers are under suspicion and so react with 
sullen obstinacy; a third may be in an angry mood asa 
result of a recent playground quarrel. Situations like these 
are, of course, exceptional, but in any case it is necessary 
 
-P-A-G-E-146
    126 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
to create in the child a certain mood, or indefinable atti- 
tude of mind, before the test begins. 
Personality of the examiner. Doubtless there are persons 
so lacking in personal adaptability that success in this 
kind of work would be for them impossible. The wooden, 
mechanical, matter-of-fact and unresponsive personality 
is as much out of place in the psychological clinic as the 
traditional bull in the china shop. It would make an in- 
teresting study for some one to investigate, by exact meth- 
ods, the influence on test results of the personality of dif- 
ferent examiners who have been equally trained in the 
methods to be employed and who are equally conscientious 
in applying them according to rules. 
On the whole, differences of this kind are probably not 
very great among experienced and reasonably competent 
examiners. Adaptability grows with experience and with 
increase of self-confidence. After a few score tests there 
should be no serious failure from inability to get into rap- 
port with the child. Even in those rare cases where the child 
breaks down and cries from timidity, or perhaps refuses to 
answer out of embarrassment, the difficulty can be over- 
come by sufficient tact so that the examination may pro- 
ceed as though nothing had happened. 
If the examiner has the proper psychological and personal 
equipment, the testing of twenty or thirty children forms a 
fairly satisfactory apprenticeship. Without psychological 
training, no amount of experience will guarantee absolute 
accuracy of the results. 
The avoidance of fatigue. Against the validity of in- 
telligence tests it is often argued that the result of an ex- 
amination depends a great deal on the time of day when it 
is made, whether in the morning hours when the mind is at 
its best, or in the afternoon when it is supposedly fatigued. 
Although no very extensive investigation has been made of
-P-A-G-E-147
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 127 
this influence, there is no evidence that the ordinary fatigue 
incident to school work injures the child’s performance 
appreciably. Our tests of 1000 children showed no in- 
feriority of results secured from 1 to 4 P.M., as compared 
with tests made from 9 to 12 a.m. 
An explanation for this is not hard to find. Although 
school work causes fatigue, in the sense that a part of the 
child’s available supply of mental energy is used up, 
there is always a reserve of energy sufficient to carry the 
child through a thirty- to fifty-minute test. The fact that 
the required tasks are novel and interesting to a high degree 
insures that the reserve energy will really be brought into 
play. This principle, of course, has its natural limits. The 
examiner would avoid testing a child who was exhausted 
either from work or play, or a child who was noticeably 
sleepy. 
Duration of the examination. About the only danger of 
fatigue lies in making the examination too long. Young 
children show symptoms of weariness much more quickly 
than older children, and it is therefore fortunate that not 
so much time is needed for testing them. The following 
allowances of time will usually be found sufficient: — 
  Children 3-5 years old 25-30 minutes “ 68“ « “30-40. 
“ 912 “« « 40-50“ 
S 1886 cf. * 50-60 $ 
PCL el tee nee ee aes. aa hor ses 60-90“ 
_ This allowance ordinarily includes the time necessary 
for getting into rapport with the child, in addition to that 
actually consumed in the tests. But the examiner need not 
expect to hold fast to any schedule. Some subjects respond 
in a lively manner, others are exasperatingly slow. It is 
more often the mentally retarded child who answers slowly, 
but exceptions to this rule are not uncommon. One 8-year-
-P-A-G-E-148
128 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
  old boy examined by the writer answered so hesitatingly 
that it required two sittings of nearly an hour each to com- 
plete the test. The result, however, showed a mental age 
of 1114 years, or an I Q of 143. 
It is permissible to hurry the child by an occasional 
“that’s fine; now, quickly,” etc., but in doing this caution 
must be exercised, or the child’s mental process may be 
blocked. The appearance of nagging must be carefully 
avoided. If the test goes so slowly that it cannot be com- 
pleted in the above limits of time, it is usually best to stop 
and complete the examination at another time. When this 
is not possible, it is advisable to take a ten-minute inter- 
mission and a little walk out of doors. 
Time can be saved by having all the necessary materials 
close at hand and conveniently arranged. The coins should 
be kept in a separate purse, and the pictures, colors, stamps, 
and designs for drawing should be mounted on stiff card- 
board, which may be punched and kept in a notebook cover. 
The series of sentences, digits, comprehension questions, 
fables, etc., should either be mounted in similar fashion, 
cr else printed in full on the record sheets used in the tests. 
The latter is more convenient.! All other materials should 
be kept where they will not have to be hunted for. 
Besides saving valuable time, a little methodical fore- 
sight of this kind adds to the success of the test. If the child 
is kept waiting, the test loses its interest and attention 
1 Examiners will find it a great convenience to use the record booklet 
which has been specially devised for testing with the Stanford revision. It 
contains all the necessary printed material, including digits, sentences, ab- 
surdities, fables, the vocabulary list, the reading selection, the square and 
diamond for copying, etc., and in addition gives with each test the stand- 
ard for scoring. It is so arranged as to afford ample room for a verbatim 
record of all the child’s responses, and contains other features calculated 
to make testing easy and accurate. Regarding purchasing of supplies see 
p. 141. 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 129 
strays. See to it, if possible, that no lull occurs in the per- 
formance. 
Inexperienced examiners sometimes waste time foolishly 
by stopping to instruct the child on his failures. This is 
doubly bad, for besides losing time it makes the child con- 
scious of the imperfection of his responses and creates em- 
barrassment. Adhere to the purpose of the test, which is to 
ascertain the child’s intellectual level, not to instruct him. 
Desirable range of testing. There are two considerations 
here of equal importance. It is necessary to make the ex- 
amination thorough, but in the pursuit of thoroughness we 
must be careful not to produce fatigue or ennui. Unless 
there is reason to suspect mental retardation, it is usually 
best to begin with the group of tests just below the child’s 
age. However, if there is a failure in the tests of that group, 
it is necessary to go back and try all the tests of the pre- 
vious group. In like manner the examination should be 
carried up the scale, until a test group has been found in 
which all the tests are failed. 
It must be admitted, however, that because of time limita- 
tions and fatigue, it is not always practicable to adhere to 
this ideal of thoroughness. In testing normal children, little 
error will result if we go back no farther than the year which 
yielded only one failure, and if we stop with the year in 
which there was only one success. This is the lowest permis- 
sible limit of thoroughness. Defectives are more uneven 
mentally than normal children, and therefore scatter their 
successes and failures over a wider range. With such sub- 
jects it is absolutely imperative that the test be thorough. 
In the case of defectives it is sometimes necessary to be- 
gin with random testing, until a rough idea is gained of the 
mental level. But the skilled observer soon becomes able to 
utilize symptoms in the child’s conversation and conduct 
and to dispense with most of this preliminary exploration.   
 
-P-A-G-E-150
  130 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Order of giving the tests. The child’s efforts in the tests 
are sometimes markedly influenced by the order in which 
they are given. If language tests or memory tests are given 
first, the child is likely to be embarrassed. More suitable 
to begin with are those which test knowledge or judg- 
ment about objective things, such as the pictures, weights, 
stamps, bow-knot, colors, coins, counting pennies, number 
of fingers, right and left, time orientation, ball and field, 
paper-folding, etc. Tests like naming sixty words, finding 
rhymes, giving differences or similarities, making sentences, 
repeating sentences, and drawing are especially unsuitable 
because they tend to provoke self-consciousness. 
The tests as arranged in this revision are in the order 
which it is usually best to follow, but one should not hesi- 
tate to depart from the order given when it seems best in 
a given case to do so. It is necessary to be constantly alert 
so that when the child shows a tendency to balk at a given 
type of test, such as those of memory, language, numbers, 
drawing, “ comprehension,” ete., the work can be shifted 
to more agreeable tasks. When the child is at his ease 
again, it is usually possible to return to the troublesome 
tests with better success. In the case of 8-year-old D. C., 
who is a speech defective but otherwise above normal, it 
was quite impossible at the first sitting to give such tests 
as sentence-making, naming sixty words, reading, repeating 
sentences, giving definitions, etc.; at each test of this type 
the child’s voice broke and he was ready to cry, due, no 
doubt, to sensitiveness regarding his speech defect. Others 
do everything willingly except the drawing and copying. 
The younger children sometimes refuse to repeat the sen- 
tences or digits. In all such cases it is best to pass on to 
something else. After a few minutes the rejected task may 
be done willingly. 
Coaxing to be avoided. Although we should always
-P-A-G-E-151
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 131 
encourage the child to believe that he can answer cor- 
rectly, if he will only try, we must avoid the common 
practice of dragging out responses by too much urging and 
coaxing. The sympathies of the examiner tend to lead 
him into the habit of repeating and explaining the question 
if the child does not answer promptly. This is nearly always 
a mistake, for the question is one which should be under- 
stood. Besides, explanations and coaxing are too often 
equivalent to answering the question for the child. It is 
almost impossible to impress this danger sufficiently upon 
the untrained examiner. One who is not familiar with the 
psychology of suggestion may put the answer in the child’s 
mouth without suspecting what he is doing. 
Adhering to formula. It cannot be too strongly empha- 
sized that unless we follow a standardized procedure the 
tests lose their significance. The danger is chiefly that of 
unintentionally and unconsciously introducing variations 
which will affect the meaning of the test. One who has 
not had a thorough training in the methods of mental 
testing cannot appreciate how numerous are the opportu- 
nities for the unconscious transformation of a test. Many 
of these are pointed out in the description of the individ- 
ual tests, but it would be folly to undertake to warn the 
experimenter against every possible error of this kind. Some- 
times the omission or the addition of a single phrase in 
giving the test will alter materially the significance of the 
response. Only the trained psychologist can vary the for- | 
mula without risk of invalidating the result, and even he 
must be on his guard. All sorts of misunderstandings re- 
garding the correct placing of tests and regarding their 
accuracy or inaccuracy have come about through the failure 
of different investigators to follow the same procedure. 
One who would use the tests for any serious purpose, 
therefore, must study the procedure for each and every
-P-A-G-E-152
  132. THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
test until he knows it thoroughly. After that a consid- 
erable amount of practice is necessary before one learns to 
avoid slips. During the early stages of practice it is neces- 
sary to refer to the printed instructions frequently in order 
to check up errors before they have become habitual. 
The instructions hitherto available are at fault in not 
defining the procedure with sufficient definiteness, and it 
is the purpose of this volume to make good this deficiency 
as far as possible. 
It is too much, however, to suppose that the instructions 
can be made “ fool-proof.” With whatever definiteness 
they may be set forth, situations are sure to arise which 
the examiner cannot be formally prepared for. There is 
no limit to the multitude of misunderstandings possible. 
After testing hundreds of children one still finds new ex- 
amples of misapprehension. In a few such cases the in- 
struction may be repeated, if there is reason to think the 
child’s hearing was at fault or if some extraordinary dis- 
traction has occurred. But unless otherwise stated in the 
directions, the repetition of a question is ordinarily to be 
avoided. Supplementary explanations are hardly ever 
permissible. 
In short, numberless situations may arise in the use of a 
test which may injure the validity of the response, events 
which cannot always be dealt with by preconceived rule. 
Accordingly, although we must urge unceasingly the im- 
portance of following the standard procedure, it is not to 
be supposed that formulas are an adequate substitute 
either for scientific judgment or for common sense. 
Scoring. The exact method of scoring the individual 
tests is set forth in the following chapters. Reference to 
the record booklet for use in testing will show that the 
records are to be kept in detail. Each subdivision of a test 
should be scored separately, in order that the clinical pic-
-P-A-G-E-153
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 138 
ture may be as complete as possible. This helps in the final 
evaluation of the results. It makes much difference, for 
example, whether success in repeating six digits is earned by 
repeating all three correctly or only one; or whether the 
child’s lack of success with the absurdities is due to failure 
on two, three, four, or all of them. Time should be re- 
corded whenever called for in the record blanks. 
Recording responses. Plus and minus signs alone are 
not usually sufficient. Whenever possible the entire re- 
sponse should be recorded. If the test results are to be used 
by any other person than the examiner, this is absolutely 
essential. Any other standard of completeness opens the 
door to carelessness and inaccuracy. In nearly all the tests, 
except that of naming sixty words, the examiner will find 
it possible by the liberal use of abbreviations to record 
practically the entire response verbatim. In doing so, 
however, one must be careful to avoid keeping the child 
waiting. Occasionally it is necessary to leave off recording 
altogether because of the embarrassment sometimes aroused 
in the child by seeing his answer written down. The writer 
has met the latter difficulty several times. When for any 
reason it is not feasible to record anything more than score 
marks, success may be indicated by the sign +, failure by 
—, and half credit by 14. An exceptionally good response 
may be indicated by ++, and an exceptionally poor re- 
sponse by ——. If there is a slight doubt about a success 
or failure the sign ? may be added to the + or —. In 
general, however, score the response either -+ or —, avoid- 
ing half credit as far as it is possible to do so. 
If the entire response is not recorded it is necessary to 
record at least the score mark for each test when the test 
zs given. It must be borne in mind that the scoring is 
not a purely mechanical affair. Instead, the judgment of 
the examiner must come into play with every record made.  
-P-A-G-E-154
  134 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
If the scoring is delayed, there is not only the danger of 
forgetting a response, but the judgment is likely to be 
influenced by the subject’s responses to succeeding ques- 
tions. Our special record booklet contains wide margins, 
so that extended notes and observations regarding the 
child’s responses and behavior can be recorded as the test 
proceeds. 
Scattering of successes. It is sometimes a source of con- 
cern to the untrained examiner that the successes and fail- 
ures should be scattered over quite an extensive range of 
years. Why, it may be asked, should not a child who has 
10-year intelligence answer correctly all the tests up to and 
including group X, and fail on all the tests beyond? There 
are two reasons why such is almost never the case. In the 
first place, the intelligence of an individual is ordinarily 
not even. There are many different kinds of intelligence, 
and in some of these the subject is better endowed than 
in others. A second reason lies in the fact that no test can 
be purely and simply a test of native intelligence. Given 
a certain degree of intelligence, accidents of experience 
and training bring it about that this intelligence will work 
more successfully with some kinds of material than with 
others. For both of these reasons there results a scattering 
of successes and failures over three or four years. The 
subject fails first in one or two tests of a group, then in 
two or three tests of the following group, the number of 
failures increasing until there are no successes at all. 
Success “‘ tapers off ” from 100 per cent to 0. Once in a 
great while a child fails on several of the tests of a given 
year and succeeds with a majority of those in the next 
higher year. This is only an extreme instance of uneven 
intelligence or of specialized experience, and does not neces- 
sarily reflect upon the reliability of the tests for children 
in general. The method of calculation given above strikes
-P-A-G-E-155
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 135 
a kind of average and gives the general level of intelligence, 
which is essentially the thing we want to know. 
Supplementary considerations. It would be a mistake to 
suppose that any set of mental tests could be devised which 
would give us complete information about a child’s native 
intelligence. There are no tests which are absolutely pure 
tests of intelligence. All are influenced to a greater or less ' 
degree also by training and by social environment. For 
this reason, all the ascertainable facts bearing on such 
influences should be added to the record of the mental 
examination, and should be given due weight in reaching a 
final conclusion as to the level of intelligence. 
The following supplementary information should be 
gathered, when possible: — 
1. Social status (very superior, superior, average, inferior, or 
very inferior). 
2. The teacher’s estimate of the child’s intelligence (very su- 
perior, superior, average, inferior, or very inferior). 
8. School opportunities, including years of attendance, regu- 
larity, retardation or acceleration, etc. 
4. Quality of school work (very superior, superior, average, in- 
ferior, or very inferior). 
5. Physical handicaps, if any (adenoids, diseased tonsils, partial 
deafness, imperfect vision, malnutrition, etc.). 
In addition, the examiner will need to take account of 
the general attitude of the child during the examination. 
This is provided for in the record blanks under the heading 
“comments.” The comments should describe as fully as 
possible the conduct and attitude of the child during the 
examination, with emphasis upon such disturbing factors 
as fear, timidity, unwillingness to answer, overconfidence, 
carelessness, lack of attention, etc. Sometimes, also, it is 
desirable to verify the child’s age and to make record of 
the verification.
-P-A-G-E-156
  136 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Once more let it be urged that no degree of mechanical 
perfection of the tests can ever take the place of good 
judgment and psychological insight. Intelligence is too 
complicated to be weighed, like a bag of grain, by any one 
who can read figures. 
Alternative tests. The tests designated as “ alternative 
tests” are not intended for regular use. Inasmuch as they 
have been standardized and belong in the year group 
where they are placed, they may be used as substitute 
tests on certain occasions. Sometimes one of the regular 
tests is spoiled in giving it, or the requisite material for it 
may not be at hand. Sometimes there may be reason to 
suspect that the subject has become acquainted with some 
of the tests. In such cases it is a great convenience to have 
a few substitutes available. f 
It is necessary, however, to warn against a possible 
misuse of alternative tests. It is not permissible to count 
success in an alternative test as offsetting failure in a regular 
test. This would give the subject too much leeway of 
failure. There are very exceptional cases, however, when it 
is legitimate to break this rule; namely, when one of the 
regular tests would be obviously unfair to the subject being 
tested. In year X, for example, one of the three alternative 
tests should be substituted for the reading test (X, 4) in 
case we are testing a subject who has not had the equivalent 
of at least two years of school work. In year VIII, it would 
be permissible to substitute the alternative test of naming 
six coins, instead of the vocabulary test, in the case of a sub- 
ject who came from a home where English was not spoken. 
In VII, it would perhaps not be unfair to substitute the 
alternative test, in place of the test of copying a diamond, 
in the case of a subject who, because of timidity or em- 
barrassment, refused to attempt the diamond. But it 
would be going entirely too far to substitute an alter-  
-P-A-G-E-157
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 137 
native test in the place of every regular test which the 
subject responded to by silence. In the large majority of 
cases persistent silence deserves to be scored failure. 
Certain tests have been made alternatives because of 
their inferior value, some because the presence of other 
tests of similar nature in the same year rendered them less 
necessary. 
Finding mental age. As there are six tests in each age 
group from III to X, each test in this part of the scale 
counts 2 months toward mental age. There are eight tests 
in group XII, which, because of the omission of the 11- 
year group, have a combined value of 24 months, or 3 
months each. Similarly, each of the six tests in XIV has 
a value of 4 months (24 + 6 = 4). The tests of the “ aver- 
age adult” group are given a value of 5 months each, 
and those of the “ superior adult” group a value of 6 
months each. These values are in a sense arbitrary, but 
they are justified in the fact that they are such as 
to cause ordinary adults to test at the “average adult” 
level. 
The calculation of mental age is therefore simplicity 
itself. The rule is: (1) Credit the subject with all the tests 
below the point where the examination begins (remembering 
that the examination goes back until a year group has been 
found in which all the tests are passed); and (2) add to 
this basal credit 2 months for each test passed successfully 
up to and including year X, 3 months for each test passed 
in XII, 4 months for each test passed in XIV, 5 months 
for each success in “ average adult,” and 6 months for 
each success in “ superior adult.” 
For example, let us suppose that a child passes all the 
tests in VI, five of the six tests in VII, three in VIII, two 
in IX, and one in X. The total credit earned is as 
follows: —

One other point: If one or more tests of a year group have 
been omitted, as sometimes happens either from oversight 
or lack of time, the question arises how the tests which 
were given in such a year group should be evaluated. Sup- 
pose, for example, a subject has been given only four of 
the six tests in a given year, and that he passes two, or 
half of those given. In such a case the probability would 
be that had all six tests been given, three would have been 
passed; that is, one half of all. It is evident, therefore, that 
when a test has been omitted, a proportionately larger value 
should be assigned to each of those given. 
Tf all six tests are given in any year group below XII, 
each has a value of 2 months. If only four are given, each 
has a value of 3 months (12 + 4 = 8). If five tests only
-P-A-G-E-159
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 139 
are given, each has a value of 2.4 months (12 + 5 = 2.4). 
If in year group XII only six of the eight tests are given, 
each has a value of 4 months (24 + 6 = 4). If in the “aver- 
age adult ” group only five of the six tests are given, each 
has a value of 6 months instead of the usual 5 months. 
In this connection it will need to be remembered that the 
six “average adult” tests have a combined value of 30 
months (6 tests, 5 months each); also that the combined 
value of the six “superior adult” tests is 36 months 
(6 X 6 = 86). Accordingly, if only five of the six “ superior 
adult ” tests are given, the value of each is 36 + 5 = 7.2 
months. 
For example, let us suppose that a subject has been tested 
as follows: All the six tests in X were given and all were 
passed; only six of the eight in XII were given and five were 
passed; five of the six in XIV were given and three were 
passed; five of the six in “ average adult ” were given and 
one was passed; five were given in “ superior adult ” and 
no credit earned. The result would be as follows: —

The calculation of mental age is really simpler than 
our verbal illustrations make it appear. After the operation 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  140 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
  has been performed twenty or thirty times, it can be done 
in less than a half-minute without danger of error. 
The use of the intelligence quotient. As elsewhere ex- 
plained, the mental age alone does not tell us what we want 
to know about a child’s intelligence status. The significance , 
of a given number of years of retardation or acceleration 
depends upon the age of the child. A 3-year-old child who 
is retarded one year is ordinarily feeble-minded; a 10-year- , 
old retarded one year is only a little below normal. The 
child who at 3 years of age is retarded one year will prob- 
ably be retarded two years at the age of 6, three years at 
the age of 9, and four years at the age of 12. 
What we want to know, therefore, is the ratio existing 
between mental age and real age. This is the intelligence 
quotient, or I Q. To find it we simply divide mental age 
(expressed in years and months) by real age (also expressed 
in years and months). The process is easier if we express 
each age in terms of months alone before dividing. The 
division can, of course, be performed almost instantaneously 
and with much less danger of error by the use of a slide 
rule or a division table. One who has to calculate many 
intelligence quotients should by all means use some kind of 
mechanical help. 
How to find the I Q of adult subjects. Native intelli- 
gence, in so far as it can be measured by tests now avail- 
able, appears to improve but little after the age of 15 or 
16 years. It follows that in calculating the I Q of an adult 
subject, it will be necessary to disregard the years he has 
lived beyond the point where intelligence attains its final 
development. 
Although the location of this point is not exactly known, 
it will be sufficiently accurate for our purpose to assume 
its location at 16 years. Accordingly, any person over 16 
years of age, however old, is for purposes of calculating
-P-A-G-E-161
  INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING 141 
I Q considered to be just 16 years old. If a youth of 18 
and a man of 60 years both have a mental age of 12 years, 
the I Q in each case is 12 + 16, or .75. 
The significance of various values of the I Q is set forth 
elsewhere.! Here it need only be repeated that 100 1 Q 
means exactly average intelligence; that nearly all who are 
below 70 or 75 I Q are feeble-minded; and that the child of 
125 I Q is about as much above the average as the high- 
grade feeble-minded individual is below the average. For 
ordinary purposes all who fall between 95 and 105 I Q 
may be considered as average in intelligence. 
Material for use in testing. It is strongly recommended 
that in testing by the Stanford revision the regular Stan- 
ford record booklets be used. These are so arranged as to 
make testing accurate, rapid, and convenient. They contain 
square, diamond, round field, vocabulary list, fables, sen- 
tences, digits, and selections for memory tests, the reading 
selection barred for scoring, the dissected sentences, arith- 
metical problems, etc. One is required for each child tested.? 
1 See Chapter VI- 
2 Houghton Mifflin Company will supply all the printed material 
needed in the tests, including the lines for the forms for VI, 2, the four 
pictures for “enumeration,” “description,” and “interpretation,” the 
pictures for V, 3 and VI, 2, the colors, designs for X, 3, the code for 
Average Adult 6, and score cards for square, diamond, designs, and 
ball-and-field. 
This is all the material required for the use of the Stanford revision, 
except the five weights for IX, 2, and V, 1, and the Healy-Fernald Con- 
struction Puzzle for X. These may be purchased of C. H. Stoelting & 
Co., 3037 Carroll Avenue, Chicago. It is not necessary, however, to have 
the weights and the Construction Puzzle, as the presence of one or more 
alternative tests in each year makes it possible to substitute other tests 
instead of those requiring these materials. This saves considerable ex- 
pense. Apart from these, which may either be made at home (see pages 
278, 279) or dispensed with, the only necessary equipment for using the 
Stanford revision is a copy of this book with the accompanying set of 
printed matter, and the record booklets. The record booklets are supplied 
only in packages of 25.

CHAPTER IX 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR II 
Il, 1. Pointing to parts of the body 
Procedure. After getting the child’s attention, say: 
“ Show me your nose.” ‘‘ Put your finger on your nose.” 
Same with eyes, mouth, and hair. 
Tact is often necessary to overcome timidity. If two or 
three repetitions of the instruction fail to bring a response, 
point to the child’s chin or ear and say: “Is this your 
nose?” “ No?” “‘ Then where is your nose?’’ Sometimes, 
after one has tried two or three parts of the test without 
eliciting any response, the child may suddenly release his 
inhibitions and answer all the questions promptly. In 
case of persistent refusal to respond it is best not to harass 
the child for an answer, but to leave the test for a while 
and return to it later. This is a rule which applies generally 
throughout the scale. In the case of one exceptionally timid 
little girl, it was impossible to get any response by the 
usual procedure, but immediately when a doll was shown 
the child pointed willingly to its nose, eyes, mouth, and 
hair. The device was successful because it withdrew the 
child’s attention from herself and centered it upon some- 
thing objective. 
Scoring. Three responses out of four must be correct. 
Instead of pointing, the child sometimes responds by 
winking the eyes, opening the mouth, etc., which is counted 
as satisfactory. 
Remarks. Binet’s purpose in this test is to ascertain 
whether the subject is capable of comprehending simple 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  TEST NO. III, 2 143 
language. The ability to comprehend and use language is 
indeed one of the most reliable indications of the grade of 
mental development. The appreciation of gestures comes 
first, then the comprehension of language heard, next the 
ability to repeat words and sentences mechanically, and 
finally the ability to use language as a means of communica- 
tion. The present test, however, is not more strictly a test 
of language comprehension than the others of the 3-year 
group, and in any case it could not be said to mark the 
beginning of the power to comprehend spoken language. 
That is fairly well advanced by the age of 2 years. The 
test closely resembles III, 2 (naming familiar objects), 
and III, 3 (enumeration of objects in a picture), except 
that it brings in a personal element and gives some clue to 
the development of the sense of self. All the data agree in 
locating the test at year III. 
I, 2. Naming familiar objects 
Procedure. Use a key, a penny, a closed knife, a watch, 
and an ordinary lead pencil. The key should be the usual 
large-sized doorkey, not one of the Yale type. The penny 
should not be too new, for the freshly made, untarnished 
penny resembles very little the penny usually seen. Any 
ordinary pocket knife may be used, and it is to be shown 
unopened. The formula is, ‘“‘ What is this?” or, “ Tell me 
what this is.” 
Scoring. There must be at least three correct responses 
out of fwe. A response is not correct unless the object is 
named. It is not sufficient for the child merely to show that 
he knows its use. A child, for example, may take the pencil 
and begin to mark with it, or go to the door and insert the 
key in the lock, but this is not sufficient. At the same time 
we must not be too arbitrary about requiring a particular
-P-A-G-E-164
  
144 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE * 
name. “ Cent” or “ pennies ” for “penny” is satisfactory, 
but “money” is not. The watch is sometimes called 
“a clock ” or “a tick-tock,” and we shall perhaps not be 
too liberal if we score these responses plus. “‘ Pen” for 
“pencil,” however, is unsatisfactory. Substitute names for 
“key ” and “knife” are rarely given. Mispronunciations 
due to baby-talk are of course ignored. 
Remarks. The purpose of this test is to find out whether 
the child has made the association between familiar objects 
and their names. The mental processes necessary to enable 
the child to pass this test are very elementary, and yet, as 
far as they go, they are fundamental. Learning the names 
of objects frequently seen is a form of mental activity in 
which the normally endowed child of 2 to 4 years finds 
great satisfaction. Any marked retardation in making such 
associations is a grave indication of the lack of that spon- 
taneity which is so necessary for the development of the 
higher grades of intelligence. It would be entirely beside 
the point, therefore, to question the validity of the test on 
the ground that a given child may not have been taught 
the names of the objects used. Practically all children 3 
years old, however poor their environment, have made the 
acquaintance of at least three of the five objects, and if 
intelligence is normal they have learned their names as a 
result of spontaneous inquiry. 
Always use the list of objects here given, because it has 
been standardized. Any improvised selection would be 
sure to contain some objects either less or more familiar 
than those in the standardized list. Note also that three 
correct responses out of five are sufficient. If we required 
five correct answers out of six (like Kuhlmann), or three 
out of three (like Binet, Goddard, and Huey), the test would 
probably belong at the 4-year level. Binet states that this 
test is materially harder than that of naming objects in a
-P-A-G-E-165
    
TEST NO. I, 3 145 
picture, since in the latter the child selects from a number 
of objects in the picture those he knows best, while in 
the former test he must name the objects we have arbitrarily 
chosen. This difference does not hold, however, if we re- 
quire only three correct responses out of five for passing 
the test of naming objects, instead of Binet’s three out of 
three. All else being equal, it is of course easier to recognize 
and name a real object shown than it is to recognize and 
name it from a picture. 
Il, 3. Enumeration of objects in pictures 
Procedure. Use the three pictures designated as “Dutch 
Home,” “ River Scene,’ and “ Post-Office.” Say, “ Now 
I am going to show you a pretty picture.” Then, holding the 
first one before the child, close enough to permit distinct 
vision, say: “ Tell me what you see in this picture.” If there 
is no response, as sometimes happens, due to embarrass- 
ment or timidity, repeat the request in this form: “ Look 
at the picture and tell me everything you can see in it.” Tf 
there is still no response, say: “‘ Show me the . . .” (naming 
some object in the picture). Only one question of this type, 
however, is permissible. If the child answers correctly, 
say: “That is fine; now tell me everything you see in the 
picture.” From this point the responses nearly always fol- 
low without further coaxing. Indeed, if rapport has been 
properly cultivated before the test begins, the first ques- 
tion will ordinarily be sufficient. If the child names one or 
two things in a picture and then stops, urge him on by say- 
ing, “And what else?” Proceed with pictures b and c in 
the same manner. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the child enumerates as 
many as three objects in one picture spontaneously; that is, 
without intervening questions or urging. Anything better
-P-A-G-E-166
  1446 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
than enumeration (as description or interpretation) is also 
acceptable, but description is rarely encountered before 5 
years and interpretation rarely before 9 or 10.1 
Remarks. The purpose of the test in this year is to find 
out whether the sight of a familiar object in a picture pro- 
vokes recognition and calls up the appropriate name.? The 
average child of 3 or 4 years is in what Binet calls “ the 
identification stage ”; that is, familiar objects in a picture 
will be identified but not described, their relations to one 
another will not be grasped. 
In giving the test, always present the pictures in the same 
order, first Dutch Home, then River Scene, then Post- 
Office. The order of presentation will no doubt seem to the 
uninitiated too trivial a matter to insist upon, but a little 
experience teaches one that an apparently insignificant 
change in the procedure may exert a considerable influence 
upon the response. Some pictures tend more strongly than 
otkers to provoke a particular type of response. Some lend 
themselves especially to enumeration, others to description, 
others to interpretation. The pictures used in the Stan- 
ford revision have been selected from a number which have 
been tried because they are more uniform in this respect 
than most others in use. However, they are not without 
their differences, picture b, for example, tending more than 
the others to provoke description. 
There seems to be no disagreement as to the proper 
location of this test. 
I, 4. Giving sex 
Procedure. If the subject is a boy, the formula is: “ Are 
you a little boy or a little girl?” If a girl, “Are you

enumeration, description, and interpretation, see VII, 2, and XII, 7.
-P-A-G-E-167
  TEST NO. HI, 5 147 
a little girl or a little boy?” This variation in the formula 
is necessary because of the tendency in young children to 
repeat mechanically the last word of anything that is 
said to them. If there is no response, say: “Are you a 
little girl?” (if a boy); or, “Are you a little boy?” (if a 
girl). If the answer to the last question is “ no ”’ (or a shake 
of the head), we then say: “‘ Well, what are you? Are you 
a little boy or a little girl?” (or vice versa). 
Scoring. The response is satisfactory if it indicates that 
the child has really made the discrimination, but we must 
be cautious about accepting any other response than the 
direct answer, “ A little girl,” or, “ A little boy.” “ Yes” 
and “no” in response to the second question must be 
carefully checked up. 
Remarks. Binet and Goddard say that 3-year-olds can- 
not pass this test and that 4-year-olds almost never fail. 
We can accept the last part of this statement, but not the 
first part. Nearly all of our 3-year-old subjects succeed 
with it. 
The test probably has nothing to do with sex conscious- 
ness, as such. Success in it would seem to depend on the 
ability to discriminate between familiar class names which 
are in a certain degree related. 
I, 5. Giving the family name 
Procedure. The child is asked, “‘ What is your name?” 
If the answer, as often happens, includes only the first 
name (Walter, for example), say: “Yes, but what is your 
other name 2? Walter what?” If the child is silent, or if he 
only repeats the first name, say: “Is your name Walter 
. 2?” (giving a fictitious name, as Jones, Smith, etc.). 
This question nearly always brings the correct answer if 
it is known.
-P-A-G-E-168
  148. THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Scoring. Simply + or —. No attention is paid to faults 
of pronunciation. 
Remarks. There is unanimous agreement that this test 
belongs in the 3-year group. Although the child has not 
had as much opportunity to learn the family name as his 
first name, he is almost certain to have heard it more or 
less, and if his intelligence is normal the interest in self will 
ordinarily cause it to be remembered. 
The critic of the intelligence scale need not be unduly 
exercised over the fact that there may be an occasional 
child of 3 years who has never heard his family name. We 
have all read of such children, but they are so extremely rare 
that the chances of a given 3-year-old being unjustly penal- 
ized for this reason are practically negligible. In the second 
place, contingencies of this nature are throughout the scale 
consistently allowed for in the percentage of passes required 
for locating a test. Since (in the year groups below XIV) 
the individual tests are located at the age level where they 
are passed by 60 to 70 per cent of unselected children of 
that age, it follows that the child of average ability is 
expected to fail on about one third of the tests of his age 
group. The plan of the scale is such as to warrant this 
amount of leeway. But even granting the possibility that 
one subject out of a hundred or so may be unjustly penalized 
for lack of opportunity to acquire the knowledge which 
‘the test calls for, the injustice done does not greatly alter 
the result. A single test affects mental age only to the ex- 
tent of two months, and the chances of two such injustices 
occurring with the same child are very slight. Herein 
lies the advantage of a multiplicity of tests. No test con- 
sidered by itself is very dependable, but two dozen tests, 
properly arranged, are almost infinitely reliable.
-P-A-G-E-169
TEST NO. II, 6 149 
Ill, 6. Repeating six to seven syllables 
Procedure. Begin by saying: “ Can you say ‘mamma’ ? 
Now, say ‘ nice kitty.’”? Then ask the child to say, “I 
have a little dog.” Speak the sentence distinctly and with 
expression, but in a natural voice and not too slowly. If 
there is no response, the first sentence may be repeated two 
or three times. Then give the other two sentences: ‘‘ The 
dog runs after the cat,” and, “ In summer the sun is hot.” 
A great deal of tact is sometimes necessary to enlist the 
child’s codperation in this test. If he cannot be persuaded to 
try, the alternative test of three digits may be substituted. 
Scoring. The test is passed if at least one sentence is 
repeated without error after a single reading. “ Without 
error ” is to be taken literally; there must be no omission, 
insertion, or transposition of words. Ignore indistinctness 
of articulation and defects of pronunciation as long as they 
do not mutilate the sentence beyond easy recognition. 
Remarks. The test does not presuppose that the child 
should have the ability to make and use sentences like these 
for purposes of communication, or even that he should 
know the meaning of all the words they contain. Its purpose 
is to bring out the ability of the child to repeat a six-sylla- 
ble series of more or less familiar language sounds. As 
every one knows, the normal child of 2 or 3 years is con- 
stantly imitating the speech of those around him and finds 
this a great source of delight. Long practice in the semi- 
mechanical repetition of language sounds is necessary for 
the learning of speech coérdinations and is therefore an 
indispensable preliminary to the purposeful use of language. 
High-grade idiots and the lowest grade of imbeciles never ac- 
quire much facility in the repetition of language heard. The 
test gets at one of the simplest forms of mental integration. 
Binet says that children of 3 years never repeat sentences 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  150 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
of ten syllables. This is not strictly true, for six out of nine- 
teen 3-year-olds succeeded in doing so. All the data agree, 
however, that the average child of 3 years repeats only six 
to seven syllables correctly. 
III. Alternative test: repeating three digits 
Procedure. Use the following digits: 6-4-1, 3-5-2, 
8-3-7. Begin with two digits, as follows: “Listen; say 
4-2.” “Now, say 6-4-1.” “Now, say 3-5-2,” etc. Pro- 
nounce the digits in a distinct voice and with perfectly 
uniform emphasis at a rate just a little faster than one per 
second. Two per second, as recommended by Binet, is 
too rapid. 
Young subjects, because of their natural timidity in the 
presence of strangers, sometimes refuse to respond to this 
test. With subjects under 5 or 6 years of age it is sometimes 
necessary in such cases to re-read the first series of digits 
several times in order to secure a response. The response 
thus secured, however, is not counted in scoring, the pur- 
pose of the re-reading being merely to break the child’s 
silence. The second and third series may be read but once. 
With the digits tests above year IV the re-reading of a 
series is never permissible. 
Scoring. Passed if the child repeats correctly, after a 
single reading, one series out of the three series given. Not 
only must the correct digits be given, but the order also 
must be correct. 
Remarks. Others, on the basis of rather scanty data, 
have usually located this test at the 4-year level. Our re- 
sults show that with the procedure described above it is 
fully as easy as the test of repeating sentences of 6 to 
7 syllables. 
1 See p. 194 ff. for further discussion of the digits test.

CHAPTER X 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR IV 
IV, 1. Comparison of lines 
Procedure. Present the appropriate accompanying card 
with the lines in horizontal position. Point to the lines 
and say: “See these lines. Look closely and tell me which 
one is longer. Put your finger on the longest one.” We use 
the superlative as well as the comparative form of long 
because it is often more familiar to young subjects. If the 
child does not respond, say: “ Show me which line is the 
biggest.” Then withdraw the card, turn it about a few 
times, and present it again with the position of the two 
lines reversed, saying: “ Now show me the longest.” Turn 
the card again and make a third presentation. 
Scoring. All three comparisons must be made correctly; 
or if only two responses out of three are correct, all three 
pairs are again shown, just as before, and if there is no error 
this time, the test is passed. The standard, therefore, is 
three correct responses out of three, or five out of six. 
Sometimes the child points, but at no particular part of 
the card. In such cases it may be difficult to decide whether 
he has failed to comprehend and to make the discrimination 
or has only been careless in pointing. It is then necessary 
to repeat the experiment until the evidence is clear. 
Remarks. As noted by Binet, success in this test depends 
on the comprehension of the verbal directions rather than 
on actual discrimination of length. The child who would 
unerringly choose the larger of two pieces of candy might
-P-A-G-E-172
  
  152 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
fail on the comparison of lines. However, since the child 
must correctly compare the lines three times in succession, 
or at least in five out of six trials, willingness to attend 
also plays a part. The attention of the low-grade imbecile, 
or even of the normal child of 3 years, is not very obedient 
to the suggestions of the experimenter. It may be gained 
momentarily, but it is not easily held to the same task for 
more than a few seconds. Hence some children who per- 
fectly comprehend this task fail to make a succession of 
correct comparisons because they are unable or unwilling 
to bring to bear even the small amount of attention which 
is necessary. This does not in the least condone the fail- 
ure, for it is exactly in such voluntary control of mental 
processes that we find one of the most characteristic dif- 
ferences between bright and dull, or mature and immature 
subjects. 
There has been little disagreement as to the proper loca- 
tion of this test. 
IV, 2. Discrimination of forms 
Procedure. Use the forms supplied with this book. 
First, place the circle of the duplicate set at “XX,” and say: 
“ Show me one like this,” at the same time passing the 
finger around the circumference of the circle. If the 
child does not respond, say: “‘ Do you see all of these 
things 2”? (running the finger over the various forms); 
“And do you see this one?” (pointing again to the circle); 
“Now, find me another one just like this.” Use the square 
next, then the triangle, and the others in any order. 
Correct the child’s first error by saying: “No, find one 
just like this’’ (again passing the finger around the outline 
of the form at “X”). Make no comment on errors after 
the first one, proceeding at once with the next card, but
-P-A-G-E-173
  TEST NO. IV, 2 153 
each time the choice is correct encourage the child with 
a hearty “ That ’s good,” or something similar. 
Scoring. The test is passed if seven out of ten choices 
are correct, the first corrected error being counted. 
Remarks. In the test of discriminating forms, unlike 
the test of comparing lines, lack of success is less often due 
to inability to understand the task than to failure to dis- 
criminate. The test may be regarded as a variation of the 
form-board test. It displays the subject’s ability to com- 
pare and contrast successive visual perceptions of form. 
The accurate perception of even a fairly simple form requires 
the integration of a number of sensory elements into one 
whole. The forms used in this test have meaning. They 
are far from nonsense figures even for the (normal) child of 
4 years, who has, of course, never heard about “ triangles,” 
“ squares,” “ rectangles,” etc. The meaning present at this 
level of intelligence is probably a compound of such fac- 
tors as appreciation of symmetry and direction, and dis- 
crimination of quantity and number. 
Another element in success, especially in the latter part 
of the experiment, is the ability to make an attentive com- 
parison between the form shown and the others. The child 
may be satisfied to point to the first form his eye happens to 
fall upon. Far from being a legitimate excuse for failure, 
such an exhibition of inattention and of weakness of the 
critical faculty is symptomatic of a mental level below 4 
years. 
In addition to counting the number of errors made, it is 
interesting to note with what forms they occur. To match 
the circle with the ellipse or the octagon, for example, is 
a less serious error than to match it with the square or 
triangle. 
This test was devised and standardized by Dr. Fred 
Kuhlmann. It is inserted here without essential altera-
-P-A-G-E-174
  154 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
tion, except that the size recommended for the forms is 
slightly reduced and minor changes have been made in the 
wording of the directions. Our own results are favorable 
to the test and to the location assigned it by its author. 
IV, 3. Counting four pennies 
Procedure. Place four pennies in a horizontal row before 
the child. Say: “ See these pennies. Count them and tell 
me how many there are. Count them with your finger, this 
way” (pointing to the first one on the child’s left) — 
“ One” — “ Now, go ahead.” If the child simply gives the 
number (whether right or wrong) without pointing, say: 
“No; count them with your finger, this way,” starting him off 
as before. Have him count them aloud. 
Scoring. The test is passed only if the counting tallies 
with the pointing. It is not sufficient merely to state the 
correct number without pointing. 
Remarks. Contrary to what one might think, this is 
not to any great extent a test of “schooling.” Practically 
all children of this age have had opportunity to learn to 
count as far as four, and with norinal children the sponta- 
neous inter~st in number is such that very few 4-year-olds, 
even from inferior social environment, fail to pass the test. 
While success requires more than the ability to repeat 
the number names by rote, it does not presuppose any power 
of calculation or a mastery of the number concepts from 
one to four. Many children who will readily say, mechani- 
cally, “one, two, three, four,” when started off, are not 
able to pass the test. On the other hand, it is not expected 
that the child who passes will also necessarily understand 
that four is made up of two two’s, or four one’s, or three 
plus one, etc. 
Binet. Goddard, and Kuhlmann place this test in the
-P-A-G-E-175
  TEST NO. IV, 4 155 
5-year group, but three separate series of tests made for 
the Stanford revision, as well as nearly all the statistics 
available from other sources, show that it belongs at 4 
years. 
IV, 4. Copying a square 
Procedure. Place before the child a cardboard on which 
is drawn in heavy black lines a square about 114 inches 
on a side. Give the child a pencil and say: ‘‘ You see that 
(pointing to the square). I want you to make one just like 
it. Make it right here (showing where it is to be drawn). 
Go ahead. I know you can do it nicely.” 
Avoid such an expression as, “I want you to draw a 
figure like that.”” The child may not know the meaning of 
either draw or figure. Also, in pointing to the model, take 
care not to run the finger around the four sides. 
Children sometimes have a deep-seated aversion to draw- 
ing on request and a bit of tactful urging may be necessary. 
Experience and tact will enable the experimenter in all 
but the rarest cases to come out victorious in these little 
battles with balky wills. Give three trials, saying each time: 
“ Make it exactly like this,” pointing to model.. Make sure 
that the child is in an easy position and that the paper 
used is held so it cannot slip..— 
Scoring. The test is passed if at least one drawing out of 
the three is as good as those marked + on the score card. 
‘Young subjects usually reduce figures in drawing from copy, 
but size is wholly disregarded in scoring. It is of more im- 
portance that the right angles be fairly well preserved than 
that the lines should be straight or the corners entirely 
closed. The scoring of this test should be rather liberal. 
Remarks. After the three copies have been made say: 
1 No material is needed if the regular Stanford record blanks are used, 
as these all contain the square and diamond. 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
    156 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
“Which one do you like best ?”’ In this way we get an idea 
of the subject’s power of auto-criticism, a trait in which 
the mentally retarded are nearly always behind normal 
children of their own age. Normal children, when young, 
reveal the same weakness to a certain extent. It is especi- 
ally significant when the subject shows complete satisfac- 
tion with a very poor performance. 
Observe whether the child makes each part with careful 
effort, looking at the model from time to time, or whether 
the strokes are made in a haphazard way with only an in- 
itial glance at the original. The latter procedure is quite 
common with young or retarded subjects. Curiously enough, 
the first trial is more successful than either of the others, 
due perhaps to a waning of effort and attention. 
Note that pencil is used instead of pen and that only one 
success is necessary. Binet gives only one trial and requires 
pen. Goddard allows pencil, but permits only one trial. 
Kuhlmann requires pen and passes the child only when two 
trials out of three are successful. But these authors locate 
the test at 5 years. Our results show that nearly three 
fourths of 4-year-olds succeed with pencil in one out of 
three trials if the scoring is liberal. It makes a great deal 
of difference whether pen or pencil is used, and whether 
two successes are required or only one. No better illustra- 
tion could be given of the fact that without thoroughgoing 
standardization of procedure and scoring the best mental 
test may be misleading as to the degree of intelligence it 
indicates. 
Copying a square is one of three drawing tests used in 
the Binet scale, the others being the diamond (year VII), 
and the designs to be copied from memory (year X). 
These tests do not to any great extent test what is usually 
known as “‘ drawing ability.” Only the square and the dia- 
mond tests are strictly comparable with one another, the
-P-A-G-E-177
  TEST NO. IV, 5 157 
other having a psychologically different purpose. In none 
of them does success seem to depend very much on the 
amount of previous instruction in drawing. To copy a 
figure like a square or a diamond requires first of all .an 
appreciation of spacial relationships. The figure must be 
perceived as a whole, not simply as a group of meaningless 
lines. In the second place, success depends upon the ability 
to use the visual impression in guiding a rather complex 
set of motor codrdinations. The latter is perhaps the main 
difficulty, and is one which is not fully overcome, at least 
for complicated movements, until well toward adult life. 
It is interesting to compare the square and the diamond 
as to relative difficulty. They have the same number of 
lines and in each case the opposite sides are parallel; but 
whereas 4-year intelligence is equal to the task of copying a 
square, the diamond ordinarily requires 7-year intelligence. 
Probably no one could have foreseen that a change in the 
angles would add so much to the difficulty of the figure. 
It would be worth while to devise and standardize still 
more complicated figures. 
IV, 5. Comprehension, first degree 
Procedure. After getting the child’s attention, say: 
“ What must you do when you are sleepy?” If necessary the 
question may be repeated a number of times, using a per- 
suasive and encouraging tone of voice. No other form of 
question may be substituted. About twenty seconds may © 
be allowed for an answer, though as a rule subjects of 4 
or 5 years usually answer quite promptly or not at all. 
Proceed in the same way with the other two questions: 
“ What ought you to do when you are cold?” “‘What ought 
you to do when you are hungry ?” 
Scoring. There must be two correct responses out of
-P-A-G-E-178
158 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
three. No one form of answer is required. It is sufficient 
if the question is comprehended and given a reasonably 
sensible answer. The following are samples of correct re- 
sponses: — 
(a) “Go to bed.” ‘Go to sleep.” ‘Have my mother get me 
ready for bed.” “Lie still, not talk, and I’ll soon be asleep.” 
(6) “Put on a coat” (or “cloak,” “furs,” “wrap up,” etc.). 
“Build a fire.” “Run and I ’Il soon get warm.” “Get close 
to the stove.” “Go into the house,” or, “Go to bed,” may 
possibly deserve the score plus, though they are somewhat 
doubtful and are certainly inferior to the responses just 
given. 
(c) “Eat something.” ‘Drink some milk.” “Buy a lunch.” 
“Have my mamma spread some bread and butter,” etc. 
With the comprehension questions in this year it is 
nearly always easy to decide whether the response is ac- 
ceptable, failure being indicated usually either by silence 
or by an absurd or irrelevant answer. One 8-year-old boy 
who had less than 4-year intelligence answered all three 
questions by putting his finger on his eye and saying: 
“T’d do that.” “Have to cry” is a rather common in- 
correct response. 
Remarks. The purpose of these questions is to ascer- 
tain whether the child can comprehend the situations sug- 
gested and give a reasonably pertinent reply. The first 
requirement, of course, is to understand the language;° 
the second is to tell how the situation suggested should be 
met. 
The question may be raised whether a given child might 
not fail to answer the questions correctly and yet have the 
intelligence to do the appropriate thing if the real situation 
were present. This is at least conceivable, but since it 
would not be practicable to make the subject actually 
cold, sleepy, or hungry in order to observe his bebavior. 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
  TEST NO. IV, 6 159 
we must content ourselves with suggesting a situation to 
be imagined. It probably requires more intelligence to 
tell what one ought to do in a situation which has to be 
imagined than to do the right thing when the real situation 
is encountered. 
The comprehension questions of this year had not been 
standardized until the Stanford investigation of 1913-14. 
Questions a and b were suggested by Binet in 1905, while ¢ 
is new. They make an excellent test of 4-year intelligence. 
IV, 6. Repeating four digits 
Procedure. Say: “ Now, listen. I am going to say over 
some numbers and after I am through, I want you to say 
them exactly like I do. Listen closely and get them just 
right — 4-7-8-9.” Same with 2-8-5-4 and 7-2-6-1. 
The examiner should consume nearly four seconds in pro- 
nouncing each series, and should practice in advance until 
this speed can be closely approximated. If the child re- 
fuses to respond, the first series may be repeated as often 
as may be necessary to prove an attempt, but success with 
a series which has been re-read may not be counted. The 
second and third series may be pronounced but once. 
Scoring. Passed if the child repeats correctly, after 
a single reading, one series out of the three series given. 
The order must be correct. 
Remarks. The test of repeating four digits was not _ 
included by Binet in the scale and seems not to have been 
used by any of the Binet workers. It is passed by about 
three fourths of our 4-year-olds.
-P-A-G-E-180
  160 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
IV. Alternative test: repeating twelve to thirteen syllables 
The three sentences are: — 
(a) “The boy’s name is John. He is a very good boy.” 
(6) “When the train passes you will hear the whistle blow.” 
(c) “We are going to have a good time in the country.” 
Procedure. Get the child’s attention and say: “ Listen, 
say this: ‘ Where is kitty ?’”’ After the child responds, add: 
“ Now say this . . . ,” reading the first sentence in a natural 
voice, distinctly and with expression. If the child is too 
timid to respond, the first sentence may be re-read, but 
in this case the response is not counted. Re-reading is 
permissible only with the first sentence. 
Scoring. The test is passed if at least one sentence is 
repeated without error after a single reading. As in the 
alternative test of year III, we ignore ordinary indistinct- 
ness and defects of pronunciation due to imperfect language 
development, but the sentence must be repeated without 
addition, omission, or transposition of words. 
Remarks. Sentences of twelve syllables had not been 
standardized previous to the Stanford revision, but Binet 
locates memory for ten syllables at year V, and others 
have followed his example. Our own data show that even 
4-year-olds are usually able to repeat twelve syllables with 
the procedure here set forth.

CHAPTER XI 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR V 
V, 1. Comparison of weights 
Materials. It is necessary to have two weights, identical 
in shape, size, and appearance, weighing respectively 3 and 
15 grams.! If manufactured weights are not at hand, it 
is easy to make satisfactory substitutes by taking stiff 
cardboard pill-boxes, about 114 inches in diameter, and 
filling them with cotton and shot to the desired weight. 
The shot must be embedded in the center of the cotton so 
as to prevent rattling. After the box has been loaded to 
the exact weight, the lid should be glued on firmly. If one 
does not have access to laboratory scales, it is always possi- 
ble to secure the help of a druggist in the rather delicate 
task of weighing the boxes accurately. A set of pill-box 
weights will last through hundreds of tests, if handled care- 
fully, but they will not stand rough usage. The manu- 
factured blocks are more durable, and so more satisfactory 
in the long run. If the weights are not at hand, the alterna- . 
tive test may be substituted. 
Procedure. Place the 3- and 15-gram weights on the 
table before the child some two or three inches apart. 
Say: “ You see these blocks. They look just alike, but one 
of them is heavy and one is light. Try them and tell me which 
one is heavier.” If the child does not respond, repeat the 
1 The weights required for this test, and also for IX, 2, may be pur- 
chased of C. H. Stoelting & Co., 3037 Carroll Avenue, Chicago, Illinois.  
-P-A-G-E-182
162 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
instructions, saying this time, “Tell me which one is the 
heaviest.” (Many American children have heard only the 
superlative form of the adjective used in the comparison 
of two objects.) 
Sometimes the child merely points to one of the boxes or 
picks up one at random and hands it to the examiner, 
thinking he is asked to guess which is heaviest. We then 
say: ‘“‘ No, that is not the way. You must take the boxes in 
your hands and try them, like this”’ (illustrating by lifting 
with one hand, first one box and then the other, a few inches 
from the table). Most children of 5 years are then able to 
make the comparison correctly. Very young subjects, 
however, or older ones who are retarded, sometimes adopt 
the rather questionable method of lifting both weights in 
the same hand at once. This is always an unfavorable sign, 
especially if one of the blocks is placed in the hand on top 
of the other block. 
After the first trial, the weights are shuffled and again 
presented for comparison as before, this time with the posi- 
tions reversed. The third trial follows with the blocks in the 
same position as in the first trial. Some children have a 
tendency to stereotyped behavior, which in this test shows 
itself by choosing always the block on a certain side. Hence 
the necessity of alternating the positions.1 Reserve com- 
mendation until all three trials have been given. 
Scoring. The test is passed if two of the three comparisons 
are correct. If there is reason to suspect that the successful 
responses were due to lucky guesses, the test should be en- 
tirely repeated. 
Remarks. This test is decidedly more difficult than that 
of comparing lines (IV, 1). It is doubtful, however, if we 
can regard the difference as one due primarily to the rela- 
tive difficulty of visual discrimination and muscular dis- 
1 For discussion of “stereotypy” see p. 208, 
   
-P-A-G-E-183
TEST NO. V, 2 163 
crimination. In fact, the test with weights hardly taxes 
sensory discrimination at all when used with children of 
5-year intelligence. Success depends, in the first place, on 
the ability to understand the instructions; and in the second 
place, on the power to hold the instructions in mind long 
enough to guide the process of making the comparison. 
The test presupposes, in elementary form, a power which 
is operative in all the higher independent processes of 
thought, the power to neglect the manifold distractions of 
irrelevant sensations and ideas and to drive direct toward 
a goal. Here the goal is furnished by the instruction, 
“Try them and see which is heavier.” This must be held 
firmly enough in mind to control the steps necessary for 
making the comparison. Ideas of piling the blocks on top 
of one another, throwing them, etc., must be inhibited. 
Sometimes the low-grade imbecile starts off in a very 
promising way, then apparently forgets the instructions 
(loses sight of the goal), and begins to play with the boxes 
in a random way. His mental processes are not consecu- 
tive, stable, or controlled. He is blown about at the mercy 
of every gust of momentary interest. 
There is very general agreement in the assignment of 
this test to year V. 
V, 2. Naming colors 
Materials. Use saturated red, yellow, blue, and green 
papers, about 2 X 1 inch in size, pasted one half inch apart 
on white or gray cardboard. For sake of uniformity it is 
best to match the colors manufactured especially for this 
test.! 
Procedure. Point to the colors in the order, red, yellow, 
blue, green. Bring the finger close to the color designated, 
1 Printed cards showing these colors are included in the set of material 
furnished by the publishers of this book.  
-P-A-G-E-184
  164 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
in order that there may be no mistake as to which one is 
meant, and say: “ What is the name of that color ?”’ Do not 
say: “ What color is that?” or, “ What kind of a color is 
that ?”’ Such a formula might bring the answer, “ The first 
color ’’; or, “ A pretty color.” Still less would it do to say: 
\“* Show me the red,” “ Show me the yellow,” etc. This would 
make it an entirely different test, one that would probably 
be passed a year earlier than the Binet form of the ex- 
periment. Nor is it permissible, after a color has been mis- 
called, to return to it and again ask its name. 
Scoring. The test is passed only if all the colors are named 
correctly and without marked uncertainty. However, 
prefixing the adjective “ dark,” or “ light,” before the name 
of a color is overlooked. 
Remarks. Naming colors is not a test of color discrimi- 
nation, for that capacity is well developed years below 
the level at which this test is used. All 5-year-olds who are 
not color blind discriminate among the four primary colors 
here used as readily as adults do. As stated by Binet, it 
is a test of the “ verbalization of color perception.” It 
tells us whether the child has associated the names of the 
four primary colors with his perceptual imagery of those 
colors. 
The ability to make simple associations between a sense 
impression and a name is certainly present in normal chil- 
dren some time before the above color associations are 
actually made. Many objects of experience are cor- 
rectly named two or three years earlier, and it may seem at 
~first a little strange that color names are learned so late. 
But it must be remembered that the child does not have 
numerous opportunities to observe and hear the names of 
several colors at once, nor does the designation of colors by 
their names ordinarily have much practical value for the 
young child. When he finally learns their names, it is
-P-A-G-E-185
  TEST NO. V, 3 165 
more because of his spontaneous interest in the world of 
sense. Lack of such spontaneous interest is always an un- 
favorable sign, and it is not surprising, therefore, that 
imbecile intelligence has ordinarily never taken the trouble 
to associate colors with their names. Girls are somewhat 
' superior to boys in this test, due probably to a greater 
natural interest in colors. 
Binet originally placed this test in year VIII, changing 
it to year VII in the 1911 scale. Goddard places it in year 
VII, while Kuhlmann omits it altogether. With a single 
exception, all the actual statistics with normal children 
justify the location of the test in year V. Bobertag’s figures 
are the exception, opposed to which are Rowe, Winch, 
Dumville, Dougherty, Brigham, and all three of the Stan- 
ford investigations. 
The test is probably more subject to the influence of home 
environment than most of the other tests of the scale, 
and if the social status of the child is low, failure would not 
be especially significant until after the age of 6 years. On 
the whole it is an excellent test. 
V, 3. Esthetic comparison 
Use the three pairs of faces supplied with the printed 
forms. It goes without saying that improvised drawings 
may not be substituted for Binet’s until they have first 
been standardized. 
‘Procedure. Show the pairs in order from top to bottom. 
Say: “ Which of these two pictures is the prettiest?” Use 
both the comparative and the superlative forms of the ad- 
jective. Do not use the question, “ Which face is the uglier 
(ugliest)? ” unless there is some difficulty in getting the 
child to respond. It is not permitted, in case of an incorrect 
response, to give that part of the test again and to allow
-P-A-G-E-186
  166 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
the child a chance to correct his answer; or, in case this is 
done, we must consider only the original response in scoring. 
Scoring. The test is passed only if all three comparisons 
are made correctly. Any marked uncertainty is failure. 
Sometimes the child laughingly designates the ugly picture 
as the prettier, yet shows by his amused expression that he 
is probably conscious of its peculiarity or absurdity. In 
such cases “ pretty’ seems to be given the meaning of 
“funny ” or “‘ amusing.” Nevertheless, we score this re- 
sponse as failure, since it betokens a rather infantile toler- 
ance of ugliness. 
Remarks. From the psychological point of view this is 
a most interesting test. One might suppose that esthetic 
judgment would be relatively independent of intelligence. 
Certainly no one could have known in advance of experience 
that intellectual retardation would reveal itself in weak- 
ness of the esthetic sense about as unmistakably as in 
memory, practical judgment, or the comprehension of 
language. But such is the case. The development of the 
esthetic sense parallels general mental growth rather 
closely. The imbecile of 4-year intelligence, even though 
he may have lived forty years, has no more chance of pass- 
ing this test than any other test in year V. It would be 
profitable to devise and standardize a set of pictures of the 
same general type which would measure a less primitive 
stage of esthetic development. 
The present test was located by Binet in year VI and has 
been retained in that year in other revisions; but three 
separate Stanford investigations, as well as the statistics 
of Winch, Dumville, Brigham, Rowe, and Dougherty, 
warrant its location in year V.
-P-A-G-E-187
  
TEST NO. V, 4 167 
V, 4. Giving definitions in terms of use 
Procedure. Use the words: Chair, horse, fork, doll, 
pencil, and table. Say: “ You have seen a chair. You know 
what a chair is. Tell me, what is a chair ?”’ And so on with 
the other words, always in the order in which they are 
named above. 
Occasionally there is difficulty in getting a response, which 
is sometimes due merely to the child’s unwillingness to 
express his thoughts in sentences. The earlier tests require 
only words and phrases. In other cases silence is due to 
the rather indefinite form of the question. The child could 
answer, but is not quite sure what is expected of him. 
Whatever the cause, a little tactful urging is nearly always 
sufficient to bring a response. In this test we have not 
found the difficulty of overcoming silence nearly as great 
as others have stated it to be. In consecutive tests of 150 
5- and 6-year-old children we encountered unbreakable 
silence with 8 words out of the total 900 (150 X 6). This 
is less than 1 per cent. But tactful encouragement is some- 
times necessary, and it is best to take the precaution of 
not giving the test until rapport has been well established. 
The urging should take the following form: “ I’m sure 
you know what a... is. You have sena... Now, 
tell me, what isa... 2?” That is, we merely repeat the 
question with a word of encouragement and in a coaxing 
tone of voice. It would not at all do to introduce other 
questions, like, ““ What does a . . . look like?” or, “ What 
isa... for?” “What do people do witha... ?” 
Sometimes, instead of attempting a definition (of doll, 
for example), the child begins to talk in a more or less ir- 
relevant way, as, “I have a great big doll. Auntie gave it 
to me for Christmas,” etc. In such cases we repeat the ques- 
tion and say: “ Yes, but tell me; what is a doll?” This is  
-P-A-G-E-188
  168 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
usually sufficient to bring the little chatter-box back to 
the task. 
Unless it is absolutely necessary to give the child lavish en- 
couragement, it is best to withhold approval or disapproval 
until the test has been finished. If the first response is a 
poor one and we pronounce it “fine” or “ very good,” 
we tempt the child to persist in his low-grade type of defi- 
nition. By withholding comment until the last word 
has been defined, we give greater play to spontaneity and 
initiative. 
Scoring. As a rule, children of 5 and 6 years define an 
object in terms of use, stating what it does, what it is for, 
what people do with it, ete. Definitions by description, by 
telling what substance it is made of, and by giving the class 
to which it belongs are grouped together as “‘ definitions 
superior to use.” It is not before 8 years that two thirds of 
the children spontaneously give a large proportion of defi- 
nitions in terms superior to use. 
The test is passed in year V if four words out of the six 
are defined in terms of use (or better than use). The fol- 
lowing are examples of satisfactory responses: — 
Chair: “To sit on.” “You sit on it.” “It is made of wood and 
has legs and back,” etc. 
Horse: “To drive.” ‘‘To ride.” ‘What people drive.” “To 
pull the wagon.” “‘It is big and has four legs,” ete. 
Fork: “To eat with.” “To stick meat with.” “It is hard and 
has three sharp things,” etc. 
Doll: “To play with.” ‘What you dress and put to bed.” “To 
rock,” ete. 
Pencil: “To write with.” “To draw.” “They write with it.” 
“Tt is sharp and makes a black mark.” 
Table: “To eat on.”’ “What you put the dinner on.” “Where 
you write.” “It is made of wood and has legs.” 
Examples of failure are such responses as the following: 
“A chair is a chair”; “There is a chair”; or simply, 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  TEST NO. V, 5 169 
“There ” (pointing to a chair). We record such responses 
without pressing for a further definition. About the only 
other type of failure is silence. 
Remarks. It is not the purpose of this test to find out 
whether the child knows the meaning of the words he is 
asked to define. Words have purposely been chosen which 
are perfectly familiar to all normal children of 5 years. 
But with young children there is a difference between know- 
ing a word and giving a definition of it. Besides, we desire 
to find out how the child apperceives the word, or rather 
the object for which it stands; whether the thing is thought 
of in terms of use, appearance (shape, size, color, etc.), 
material composing it, or class relationships. 
This test, because it throws such interesting light on the 
maturity of the child’s apperceptive processes, is one of 
the most valuable of all. It is possible to differentiate at 
least a half-dozen degrees of excellence in definitions, ac- 
cording to the intellectual maturity of the subject. A 
volume, indeed, could be written on the development of 
word definitions and the growth of meanings; but we will 
postpone further discussion until VIII, 5. Our concern 
at present is to know that children of 5 years should at 
least be able to define four of these six words in terms of 
use. 
Binet placed the test in year VI, but our own figures 
and those of nearly all the other investigations indicate 
that it is better located in year V. 
V, 5. The game of patience 
Material. Prepare two rectangular cards, each 2 X 3 
inches, and divide one of them into two triangles by cut- 
ting it along one of its diagonals. 
Procedure. Place the uncut card on the table with one 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  170 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
of its longer sides to the child. By the side of this card, a 
little nearer the child and a few inches apart, lay the two 
halves of the divided rectangle with their hypothenuses 
turned from each other as follows: 
Then say to the child: “JZ want 
you to take these two pieces (touching 
the two triangles) and put them to- 
gether so they will look exactly like 
this”” (pointing to the uncut card), 
If the child hesitates, we repeat the instructions with a 
little urging. Say nothing about hurrying, as this is likely 
to cause confusion. Give three trials, of one minute each. 
If only one trial is given, success is too often a result of 
chance moves; but luck is not likely to bring two successes 
in three trials. If the first trial is a failure, move the cut 
halves back to their original position and say: “ No; 
put them together so they will look like this” (pointing to the 
uncut card). Make no other comment of approval or dis- 
approval. Disregard in silence the inquiring looks of the 
child who tries to read his success or failure in your face. 
If one of the pieces is turned over, the task becomes im- 
possible, and it is then necessary to turn the piece back to 
its original position and begin over, not counting this trial. 
Have the under side of the pieces marked so as to avoid the 
risk of presenting one of them to the child wrong side up. 
Scoring. There must be two successes in three trials. 
About the only difficulty in scoring is that of deciding what 
constitutes a trial. We count it a trial when the child 
brings the pieces together and (after few or many changes) 
leaves them in some position. Whether he succeeds after 
many moves, or leaves the pieces with approval in some 
absurd position, or gives up and says he cannot do it, his 
effort counts as one trial. A single trial may involve a 
number of unsuccessful changes of position in the two
-P-A-G-E-191
  TEST NO. V, 5 171 
cards, but these changes may not consume altogether more 
than one minute. 
Remarks. As aptly described by Binet, the operation has 
the following elements: “ (1) To keep in mind the end to 
be attained, that is to say, the figure to be formed. It is 
necessary to comprehend this end and not to lose sight of 
it. (2) To try different combinations under the influence 
of this directing idea, which guides the efforts of the child 
even though he be unconscious of the fact. (3) To judge 
the formed combination, compare it with the model, and 
decide whether it is the correct one.” 
It may be classed, therefore, as one of the many forms of 
the “ combination method.” Elements must be combined 
into some kind of whole under the guidance of a directing 
idea. In this respect it has something in common with the 
form-board test, the Ebbinghaus test, and the test with dis- 
sected sentences (XII, 4). Binet designates it a “ test of 
patience,” because success in it depends upon a certain 
willingness to persist in a line of action under the control 
of an idea. 
Not all failures in this test are equally significant. A 
bright child of 5 years sometimes fails, but usually not 
without many trial combinations which he rejects one after 
another as unsatisfactory. A dull child of the same age 
often stops after he has brought the pieces into any sort of 
juxtaposition, however absurd, and may be quite satisfied 
with his foolish effort. His mind is not fruitful and he lacks 
the power of auto-criticism. 
It would be well worth while to work out a new and 
somewhat more difficult “ test of patience,” but with special 
care to avoid the puzzling features of the usual games of 
anagrams. The one given us by Binet is rather easy for 
year V, though plainly somewhat too difficult for year IV.
-P-A-G-E-192
  172 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
V, 6. Three commissions 
Procedure. After getting up from the chair and moving 
with the child to the center of the room, say: “Now, I 
want you to do something for me. Here’s a key. I want 
you to put it on that chair over there; then I want you to 
shut (or open) that door, and then bring me the box which 
you see over there (pointing in turn to the objects designated). 
Do you understand? Be sure to get it right. First, put the 
key on the chair, then shut (open) the door, then bring me the 
box (again pointing). Go ahead.” Stress the words first 
and then so as to emphasize the order in which the commis- 
sions are to be executed. 
Give the commissions always in the above order. Do 
not repeat the instructions again or give any further aid 
whatever, even by the direction of the gaze. If the child 
stops or hesitates it is never permissible to say: “ What 
neat?’ Have the self-control to leave the child alone with 
his task. 
Scoring. All three commissions must be executed and in 
the proper order. Failure may result, therefore, either from 
leaving out one or more of the commands or from changing 
the order. The former is more often the case. 
Remarks. Success depends first on the ability to compre- 
hend the commands, and secondly, on the ability to hold 
them in mind. It is therefore a test of memory, though 
of a somewhat different kind from that involved in repeat- 
ing digits or sentences. It is an excellent test, for it throws 
light on a kind of intelligence which is demanded in all 
occupations and in everyday life. A more difficult test of 
the same type ought to be worked out for a higher age 
level. 
Binet originally located this test in year VI, but in 1911 
changed it to year VII. This is unfortunate, for the three
-P-A-G-E-193
  TEST NO. V, ALTERNATIVE 173 
Stanford investigations, as well as the statistics of all other 
investigators, show conclusively that it is easy enough for 
year V. 
V. Alternative test: giving age 
Procedure. The formula is simply, “‘ How old are you?” 
The child of this age is, of course, not expected to know the 
date of his birthday, but merely how many years old he is. 
Scoring. About the only danger in scoring is in the 
failure to verify the child’s response. Some children give 
an incorrect answer with perfect assurance, and it is 
therefore always necessary to verify. 
Remarks. Inability to give the age may or may not 
be significant. If the child has arrived at the age of 7 or 
8 years and has had anything like a normal social environ- 
ment, failure in the test is an extremely unfavorable sign. 
But if the child is an orphan or has grown up in neglect, 
ignorance of age has little significance for intelligence. 
About all we can say is that if a child gives his age cor- 
rectly, it is because he has had sufficient interest and in- 
telligence to remember verbal statements which have been 
made concerning him in his presence. He may even pass 
the test without attaching any definite meaning to the 
word “ year.” On the other hand, if he has lived seven or 
eight years in a normal environment, it is safe to assume 
that he has heard his age given many times, and failure to 
remember it would then indicate either a weak memory 
or a grave inferiority of spontaneous interests, or both. 
Normal children have a natural interest in the things they 
hear said about themselves, while the middle-grade im- 
becile of even 40 years may fail to remember his age, how- 
ever often he may have heard it stated. 
Binet placed the test in year VI of the 1908 series, but 
omitted it altogether in 1911. Kuhlmann and Goddard 
 
-P-A-G-E-194
  174 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
also omit it, perhaps wisely. Nevertheless, it is always in- 
teresting to give as a supplementary test. Children from 
good homes acquire the knowledge about a year earlier 
than those from less favorable surroundings. Unselected 
children of California ordinarily pass the test at 5 years.
-P-A-G-E-195
CHAPTER XII 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR VI 
VI, 1. Distinguishing right and left 
Procedure. Say to the child: “ Show me your right 
hand.” After this is responded to, say: “ Show me your 
left ear.” Then: “ Show me your right eye.” Stress the 
words left and ear rather strongly and equally; also right 
and eye. If there is one error, repeat the test, this time with 
left hand, right ear, and left eye. Carefully avoid giving 
any help by look of approval or disapproval, by glancing 
at the part of the body indicated, or by supplementary 
questions. 
Scoring. The test is passed if all three questions are an- 
swered correctly, or if, in case of one error, the three addi- 
tional questions are all answered correctly. The standard, 
therefore, ts three out of three, or five out of six. 
The chief danger of variation among different examiners 
in scoring comes from double responses. For example, the 
child may point first to one ear and then to the other. 
In all cases of double response, the rule is to count the 
second response and disregard the first. This holds whether 
the first response was wrong and the second right, or vice 
versa. 
Remarks. It is interesting to follow the child’s acquisi- 
tions of language distinctions relating to spacial orientation. 
Other distinctions of this type are those between up and 
down, above and below, near and far, before and behind,
-P-A-G-E-196
  
  176 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
etc. As Bobertag has pointed out, the child first masters 
such distinctions as up and down, above and below, before 
and behind, etc., and arrives at a knowledge of right and 
left rather tardily. 
How may we explain the late distinction of right and left 
as compared with up and down? At least four theories may 
be advanced: (1) Something depends on the frequency 
with which children have occasion to make the respective 
distinctions. (2) It may be explained on the supposition 
that kinesthetic sensations are more prominently involved 
in distinctions of up and down than in distinctions of right 
and left. It is certainly true that, in distinguishing the two 
sides of a thing, less bodily movement is ordinarily required 
than in distinctions of its upper and lower aspects. The 
former demands only a shift of the eyes, the latter often 
requires an upward or downward movement of the head. 
(3) It may be due to the fact that the appearance of an 
object is more affected by differences in vertical orientation 
than by those of horizontal orientation. We see an object 
now from one side, now from the other, and the two aspects 
easily blend, while the two aspects corresponding to above 
and below are not viewed in such rapid succession and so 
remain much more distinct from one another in the child’s 
mind. Or, (4), the difference may be mainly a matter of 
language. The child undoubtedly hears the words up 
and down much oftener than right and left, and thus learns 
their meaning earlier. Horizontal distinctions are commonly 
made in such terms as this side and that side, or merely by 
pointing, while in the case of vertical distinctions the words 
up and down are used constantly. This last explanation 
is a very plausible one, but it is very probable that other 
factors are also involved. 
The distinction between right and left has a certain in- 
herent and more or less mysterious difficulty. To convince
-P-A-G-E-197
  TEST NO. VI, 1 1% 
one’s self of this it is only necessary to try a little experi- 
ment on the first fifty persons one chances to meet. The 
experiment is as follows. Say: “I am going to ask you a 
question and I want you to answer it as quickly as you can.” 
Then ask: “ Which is your right hand?” About forty 
persons out of fifty will answer correctly without a second’s 
hesitation, several will require two or three seconds to 
respond, while a few, possibly four or five per cent, will 
grow confused and perhaps be unable to respond for five or 
ten seconds. Some very intelligent adults cannot possibly 
tell which is the right or left hand without first searching 
for a scar or some other distinguishing mark which is known 
to be on a particular hand. Others resort to incipient move- 
ments of writing, and since, of course, every one knows which 
hand he writes with, the writing movements automatically 
initiated give the desired clue. One bright little girl of 8 
years responded by trying to wink first one eye and then 
the other. Asked why she did this, she said she knew she 
could wink her left eye, but not her right! One who is 
resourceful enough to adopt such an ingenious method is: 
surely not less intelligent than the one who is able to respond. 
by a direct instead of an intermediate association. 
It seems that normal people never encounter a corre- 
sponding difficulty in distinguishing up and down. The 
writer has questioned several hundred without finding a 
single instance, whereas a great many have to employ 
some intermediate association in order to distinguish right 
and left. It is the “p’s and q’s” that children must be 
told to mind; not the “ p’s and b’s.” The former is a hori- 
zontal, the latter a vertical distinction. 
Considering the difficulty which normal adults some- 
times have in distinguishing right and left, is it fair to use 
this test as a measure of intelligence? We may answer in 
the affirmative. It is fair because normal adults, notwith-
-P-A-G-E-198
  178 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
standing momentary uncertainty, are invariably able to 
make the distinction, if not by direct association, then by 
an intermediate one. We overlook the momentary confu- 
sion and regard only the correctness of the response. 
Subjects who are below middle-grade imbecile, however 
long they have lived, seldom pass the test. 
This test found a place in year VI of Binet’s 1908 scale, 
but was shifted to year VII in the 1911 revision. The Stan- 
ford statistics, and all other available data, with the ex- 
ception of Bobertag’s, justify its retention in year VI. 
It is possible that the children of different nations do not 
have equal opportunity and stimulus for learning the dis- 
tinction between right and left, but the data show that as 
far as American and English children are concerned we 
have a right to expect this knowledge in children of 6 
years. 
VI, 2. Finding omissions in pictures 
Procedure. Show the pictures to the child one at a time 
in the order in which they are lettered, a, b, c, d. When 
the first picture is shown (that with the eye lacking), 
say: “ There is something wrong with this face. It is not 
all there. Part of it is left out. Look carefully and tell me 
what part of the face is not there.” Often the child gives 
an irrelevant answer; as, “The feet are gone,” “The 
stomach is not there,” etc. These statements are true, 
but they do not satisfy the requirements of the test, so 
we say: “ No; I am talking about the face. Look again 
and tell me what is left out of the face.” If the correct 
response does not follow, we point to the place where the 
eye should be and say: “‘ See, the eye is gone.” When picture 
6 is shown we say merely: “ What is left out of this face?” 
Likewise with picture c. For picture d we say: “ What 
is left out of this picture?” No help of any kind is given
-P-A-G-E-199
  TEST NO. VI, 2 179 
unless (if necessary) with the first picture. With the others 
we confine ourselves to the single question, and the answer 
should be given promptly, say within twenty to twenty- 
five seconds. 
Scoring. Passed if the omission is correctly pointed out 
in three out of four of the pictures. Certain minor errors 
we may overlook, such as “eyes” instead of “eye” for 
the first picture; “nose and one ear” instead of merely 
“nose” for the third; “ hands ” instead of “arms” for 
the fourth, etc. Errors like the following, however, count 
as failure: “ The other eye,” or “ The other ear” for the 
first or third; “‘ The ears ”’ for the fourth, ete. 2 
Remarks. The test is one of the two or three dozen forms 
of the so-called ‘‘ completion test,” all of which have it in 
common that from the given parts of a whole the missing 
parts are to be found. The whole to be completed may be a 
word, a sentence, a story, a picture, a group of pictures, 
an object, or in fact almost anything. Sometimes all the 
parts of the whole are given and only the arrangement or 
order is to be found, as in the test with dissected sentences. 
Further discussion of the completion test will be found 
in connection with test 4, year XII. For the present we 
will only observe that notwithstanding a certain similarity 
among the tests of this type, they do not all call into play 
the same mental processes. The factor most involved may 
be verbal language coherence, visual perception of form, 
the association of abstract ideas, etc. To pass Binet’s test 
with mutilated pictures requires, (1) that the parts of the 
picture be perceived as constituting a whole; and (2) that 
the idea of a human face or form be so easily and so clearly 
reproducible that it may act, even before it comes fully 
into consciousness, as a model or pattern, for the criticism 
of the picture shown. The younger the child, the less 
adequate, in this sense, is his perceptual familiarity with
-P-A-G-E-200
  180 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
common objects. In standardizing a series of “ absurd 
pictures,” the writer has found that normal children of 3 
years often see nothing wrong in a picture which shows a 
cat with two legs or a hen with four legs. Such children 
would, of course, never mistake a cat for a hen. Their 
trouble lies in the inability to call up in clear form a “ free 
idea ” of a cat or a hen for comparison with the perceptual 
presentation offered by the picture. Middle-grade imbeciles 
of adult age have much the same difficulty as normal 
children of 4 years in recognizing mutilations or absurdi- 
ties in pictures of familiar objects. 
Binet first placed this test in year VII, changing it to 
year VIII in the 1911 revision. In other revisions it has 
been retained in year VI, although all the available statis- 
tics except Bobertag’s warrant its location in year VI. 
VI, 3. Counting thirteen pennies 
Procedure. The procedure is the same as in the test of 
counting four pennies (year IV, test 3). If the first response 
contains only a minor error, such as the omission of a 
oumber in counting, failure to tally with the finger, etc., 
a second trial is given. 
Scoring. The test is passed if there is one success in two 
trials. Success requires that the counting should tally with 
the pointing. It is not sufficient merely to state the number 
of pennies without pointing, for unless the child points and 
counts aloud we cannot be sure that his correct answer 
may not be the joint result of two errors in opposite direc- 
tions and equal; for example, if one penny were skipped and 
another were counted twice the total result would still be 
correct, but the performance would not satisfy the 
requirements. 
Remarks. Does success in this test depend upon intelli-
-P-A-G-E-201
  
TEST NO. VI, 4 181 
gence or uponschooling? The answer is, intelligence mainly. 
There are possibly a few normal 6-year-old children who 
could not pass the test for lack of instruction, but children 
of this age usually have enough spontaneous interest in 
numbers to acquire facility in counting as far as 13 without 
formal teaching. Certainly, inability to do so by the age 
of 7 years is a suspicious sign unless the child’s environment 
has been extraordinarily unfavorable. On the other hand, 
feeble-minded adults of the 5-year level usually have to 
have a great deal of instruction before they acquire the 
ability to count 18, and many of them are hardly able to 
learn it at all. So much does our learning depend on original 
endowment. 
Binet originally placed this test in year VII, but moved 
it to year VI in 1911. All the statistics, without exception, 
show that this change was justified. Bobertag says that 
nearly all 7-year-olds who are not feeble-minded can 
pass it, a statement with which we can fully agree. 
VI, 4. Comprehension, second degree 
Procedure. The questions used in this year are: — 
(a) “What ’s the thing to do if tt is raining when you start to 
school ?”” 
(b) “What ’s the thing to do of you find that your house is on fire?” 
(c) “What ’s the thing to do if you are going some place and miss 
your train (car) ?” 
Note that the wording of the first part’ of the ques- 
tions is slightly different from that in year IV, test 5. 
If there is no response, or if the child looks puzzled, the 
question may be repeated once or twice. The form of the 
question must not under any circumstances be altered. 
Question 6, for example, would be materially changed if 
we should say: “ Suppose you were to come home from  
-P-A-G-E-202
  182 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
school and find that your house was burning up. What 
would you do?” The expression “burning up” would 
probably be much less likely to suggest calling a fireman 
than would the words “ on fire.” 
Scoring. Two out of three must be answered correctly. 
The harder the comprehension questions are, the greater 
the variety of answers and the greater the difficulty of 
scoring. Because of the difficulty many examiners find in 
scoring this test, we will list the most common satisfactory, 
unsatisfactory, and doubtful responses to each question. 
(a) If tt is raining when you start to school 
Satisfactory. ‘Take umbrella,” “Bring a parasol,” “Put on 
rubbers,” “ Wear an overcoat,” etc. This type of response occurred 
61 times out of 72 successes. “Have my father bring me” also 
counts plus. 
Unsatisfactory. “Go home,” “Stay at home,” “Stay in the 
house,” “Have the rainbow,” “Stay in school,” etc. “Stay at 
home” is the most common failure and might at first seem to the 
examiner to be a satisfactory response. As a matter of fact, this 
answer rests on a slight misunderstanding of the question, the 
import of which is that one is to go to school and it is raining. 
Doubtful. “Run” as an answer is a little more troublesome. It 
may reasonably be scored plus if it can be ascertained that the 
child is accustomed to meet the situation in this way. It is a com- 
mon response with children in those regions of the Southwest 
where rains are so infrequent that umbrellas are rarely used. 
“Bring my lunch” may be considered a satisfactory response in 
case the child is in the habit of so doing on rainy days. 
(b) If you find that your house is on fire 
Satisfactory. “Ring the fire alarm,” “Call the firemen,” “Call 
for help,” “Put water on it,” etc. 
Unsatisfactory. The most common failure, accounting for 
nearly half of all, is to suggest finding other shelter; e.g., ““Go to 
the hotel,” ‘Get another house,” “Stay with your friends,” 
“Build a new house,” etc. Others are: “Tell them you are sorry 
it burned down,” “Be careful and not let it burn again,” “Have 
it insured,” “Cry,” “Call the policeman,” etc.
-P-A-G-E-203
TEST NO. VI, 4 183 
Doubtful. Instead of suggesting measures to put out the fire, a 
good many children suggest mere escape or the saving of house- 
hold articles. Responses of this type are: “Jump out of the win- 
dows,” “Save yourself,” “Get out as fast as you can,” “Save the 
baby,” “Get my dolls and jewelry and hurry and get out.” These 
answers are about one seventh as frequent as the perfectly satis- 
factory ones, and the rule for scoring them is a matter of some 
importance. Under certain circumstances the logical thing to do 
would be to save one’s self or valuables without wasting time try- 
ing to call help. There may be no help in reach, or a fire which the 
child imagines may be too far along for help to be effective. In 
order to avoid the possibility of doing a subject an injustice, it may 
be desirable to score such answers plus. We must not be too 
arbitrary. 
(c) If you miss your train 
Satisfactory. The answer we expect is, “Wait for another,” 
“Take the next car,’ or something to that effect. This type of 
answer includes about 85 per cent of the responses which do not 
belong obviously in the unsatisfactory group. “Take a jitney” is 
a modern variation of this response which must be counted as 
satisfactory. 
Unsatisfactory. ‘These are endless. One continues to meet new 
examples of absurdity, however many children one has tested. 
The possibilities are literally inexhaustible, but the following are 
among the most common: “ Wait for it to come back,” “Have to 
walk,” “Be mad,” “Don’t swear,” “Run and try to catch it,” 
“Try to jump on,” “Don’t go to that place,” “Go to the next sta- 
tion,” etc. 
_ Doubtful. The main doubtful response is, “‘Go home again,” 
“Come back next day and catch another,” etc. In small or isolated 
towns having only one or two trains per day, this is the logical 
thing to do, and in such cases the score is plus. Fortunately, only 
about one answer in ten gives rise to any difference of opinion 
among even partly trained examiners. 
Remarks. The three comprehension questions of this 
group were all suggested by Binet in 1905. Only one of 
them, however, “ What would you do if you were going 
some place and missed your train? ” was incorporated in 
the 1908 or 1911 series, and this was used in year X with 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  184 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
seven others much harder. The other two remained un- 
standardized previous to the Stanford investigation. 
VI, 5. Naming four coins 
Procedure. Show a nickel, a penny, a quarter, and a 
dime, asking each time: “‘ What is that ?”’ If the child mis- 
understands and answers, ‘“‘ Money,” or “A piece of 
money,” we say: “Yes, but what do you call that piece of 
money ?”’ Show the coins always in the order given above. 
Scoring. The test is passed if three of the four questions 
are correctly answered. Any correct designation of a coin 
is satisfactory, including provincialisms like “ two bits ” 
for the 25-cent piece, ete. If the child changes his response 
for a coin, we count the second answer and ignore the first. 
No supplementary questions are permissible. 
Remarks. Some of the critics of the Binet scale regard 
this test as of little value, because, they say, the ability to 
identify pieces of money depends entirely on instruction 
or other accidents of environment. The figures show, 
however, that it is not greatly influenced by differences of 
social environment, although children from poor homes do 
slightly better with it than those from homes of wealth 
and culture. The fact seems to be that practically all chil- 
dren by the age of 6 years have had opportunity to learn 
the names of the smaller coins, and if they have failed to 
learn them it betokens a lack of that spontaneity of interest 
in things which we have mentioned so often as a fundamental 
presupposition of intelligence. It is by no means a test of 
mere mechanical memory. 
This test was given a place in year VII of Binet’s 1908 
scale, the coins used being the 1-sou, 2-sous, 10-sous, and 
1 For general discussion of the comprehension questions as a test, see 
p. 158.  
-P-A-G-E-205
TEST NO. VI, 6 185 
5-franc pieces. It was omitted from the Binet 1911 re- 
vision and also from that of Goddard. Kuhlmann retains 
it in year VII. Others, however, have required all four 
coins to be correctly named, and when this standard is 
used the test is difficult enough for year VII. Germany 
has six coins up to and including the 1-mark piece, all of 
which could be named by 76 per cent of Bobertag’s 7-year- 
olds. With the coins and the standard of scoring used in 
the Stanford revision the test belongs well in year VI. 
VI, 6. Repeating sixteen to eighteen syllables 
The sentences are: — 
(a) “We are having a fine time. We found a little mouse in the 
trap.” 
(b) “Walter had a fine time on his vacation. He went fishing every 
day.” 
(c) “We will go out for a long walk. Please give me my pretty 
straw hat.” 
Procedure. The instructions should be given as follows: 
“Now, listen. I am going to say something and after I am 
through I want you to say it over just like I do. Understand ? 
Listen carefully and be sure to say exactly what I say.” 
Then read the first sentence rather slowly, in a distinct 
voice, and with expression. If the response is not too bad, 
praise the child’s efforts. Then proceed with the second and 
third sentences, prefacing each with an exhortation to 
“say exactly what I say.” 
In this year and in the memory-for-sentences test of 
later years it is not permissible to re-read even the first 
sentence. The only reason for allowing a repetition of one 
of the sentences in the earlier test of this kind was to 
overcome the child’s timidity. With children of 6 years or 
upward we seldom encounter the timidity which some- 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  186. THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
times makes it so hard to secure responses in some of the 
tests of the earlier years. 
Scoring. The test is passed if at least one sentence out 
of three is repeated without error, or if two are repeated 
with not more than one error each. A single omission, 
insertion, or transposition counts as an error. Faults of 
pronunciation are of course overlooked. It is not sufficient 
that the thought be reproduced intact; the exact language 
must be repeated. The responses should be recorded ver- 
batim. This is easily done if record blanks used for scoring 
have the sentences printed in full. 
Remarks. In this test and in later tests of memory for 
sentences, it is interesting to ask after each response: 
“Did you get it right?” As in the tests with digits, it is 
an unfavorable sign when the child is perfectly satisfied 
with a very poor response. 
It is evident that tests of this type give opportunity for 
different degrees of failure. To repeat only a half or a 
third of each sentence is much more serious than to make 
but one error in each sentence (one word omitted, inserted, 
or misplaced). It would be possible to use the same sen- 
tences at three or four different age levels, by setting the 
appropriate standard for success at each age. If the stand- 
ard is one sentence out of three repeated with no more 
than two errors, the test belongs in year V. If we require 
two absolutely correct responses out of three, the test 
belongs at about year VII. The shifting standard is ren- 
dered unnecessary, however, by the use of other-tests of the 
same kind, easier ones in the lower years and more difficult 
ones in the upper. 
Sentences of sixteen syllables found a place in Binet’s 
1908 scale and were correctly located in year VI, but later 
revisions, including that of Binet, have omitted the test. 
 
-P-A-G-E-207
  
TEST NO. VI, ALTERNATIVE 187 
VI. Alternative test: forenoon and afternoon 
Procedure. If it is morning, ask: “Js i morning or 
afternoon ?” If it is afternoon, put the question in the re- 
verse form, “Is it afternoon or morning ?”” This precaution 
is necessary because of the tendency of some children to 
choose always the latter of two alternatives. Do not cross- 
question the child or give any suggestion that might afford 
a clue as to the correct answer. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the correct response is 
given with apparent assurance. If the child says he is not 
sure but thinks it forenoon (or afternoon, as the case may 
be), we score the response a failure even if the answer hap- 
pens to be correct. However, this type of response is not 
often encountered. 
Remarks. It is interesting to follow the child’s develop- 
ment with regard to orientation in time. This develop- 
ment proceeds much more slowly than we are wont to 
assume. Certain distinctions with regard to space, as up 
and down, come much earlier. As Binet remarks, schools 
sometimes try to teach the events of national history to 
children whose time orientation is so rudimentary that they 
do not even know morning from afternoon! 
The test has two rather serious faults: (1) It gives too 
much play to chance, for since only two alternatives are 
offered, guesses alone would give about fifty per cent of 
correct responses. (2) We cannot be sure that the verbal 
distinction between forenoon and afternoon always cor- 
responds to the actual temporal discrimination between 
the two divisions of the day. It is possible that the temporal 
discrimination precedes the formation of the correct verbal 
association. 
This test was included in the year VI group of the 1908 
scale, but was omitted from the 1911 revision. Nearly all
-P-A-G-E-208
  
188 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
the data except Bobertag’s show that it is rather easy for 
year VI, though too difficult for year V. Bobertag’s 
figures would place the test in year VII. Possibly the cor- 
responding German words are not as easy to learn as our 
morning and afternoon.
-P-A-G-E-209
  
CHAPTER XIII 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR VII 
VII, 1. Giving the number of fingers 
Procedure. ‘“‘ How many fingers have you on one hand?” 
“How many on the other hand?” “ How many on both 
hands together?” If the child begins to count in response 
to any of the questions, say: “‘ No, don’t count. Tell me 
without counting.” Then repeat the question. 
Scoring. Passed if all three questions are answered cor- 
rectly and promptly without the necessity of counting. 
Some subjects do not understand the question to include 
the thumbs. We disregard this if the number of fingers 
exclusive of thumbs is given correctly. 
Remarks. Like the two tests of counting pennies, this 
one, also, throws light on the child’s spontaneous interest 
in numbers. However, the mental processes it calls into 
play are a little less simple than those required for mere 
counting. If the child is able to give the number of fingers, 
it is ordinarily because he has previously counted them and 
has remembered the result. The memory would hardly be 
retained but for a certain interest in numbers as such. 
Middle-grade imbeciles of even adult age seldom remember 
how many fingers they have, however often they may have 
been told. They are not able to form accurate concepts of 
other than the simplest number relationships, and numbers 
have little interest or meaning for them. 
Binet gave this test a place in year VII of the 1908 series, 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  199 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
but omitted it in the 1911 revision. Goddard omits it, 
while Kuhlmann retains it in year VII, where, according to 
our own figures, it unmistakably belongs. Bobertag finds it 
rather easy for year VII, though too difficult for year VI. 
Our data prove that this test fulfills the requirements of 
a good test. It shows arapid but even rise from year V to 
year VIII in the per cent passing, the agreement among 
the different testers is extraordinarily close, and it is rela- 
tively little influenced by training and social environment. 
For these reasons, and because it is so easy to give and 
score with uniformity, it well deserves a place in the scale. 
VII, 2. Description of pictures 
Procedure. Use the same pictures as in III, 3, presenting 
them always in the following order: Dutch Home, River 
Scene, Post-Office. The formula for the test in this year is 
somewhat different from that of year III. Say: “ What 
is this picture about ? What is this a picture of?” Use the 
double question, and follow the formula exactly. It would 
ruin the test to say: “Tell me everything you see in this 
picture,” for this form of question tends to provoke the 
enumeration response even with intelligent children of 
this age. 
When there is no response, the question may be repeated 
as often as is necessary to break the silence. 
Scoring. The test is passed if two of the three pictures 
are described or interpreted. Interpretation, however, is 
seldom encountered at this age. Often the response con- 
sists of a mixture of enumeration and description. The rule 
is that the reaction to a picture should not be scored plus 
unless it is made up chiefly of description (or interpreta- 
tion). 
Study of the following samples of satisfactory responses
-P-A-G-E-211
TEST NO. VU, 2 191 
will give a fairly definite idea of the requirements for satis- 
factory description: — 
Picture (a): satisfactory responses 
“The little girl is crying. The mother is looking at her and 
there is a little kitten on the floor.” 
“The mother is watching the baby, and the cat is looking at a 
hole in the floor, and there is a lamp and a table so I guess it’s a 
dining room.” 
“The little girl has wooden shoes. Her mother is sitting in a 
chair and has a funny cap on her head. The cat is sitting on the 
floor and there is a basket by the mother and a table with some- 
thing on it.” 
“Tt’s about Holland. The little Dutch girl is crying and the 
mother is sitting down.” 
“A little Dutch girl and her mother and that’s a kitten, and 
the little girl has her hand up as if she was doing something to her 
forehead. She has shoes that curve up in front.” 
“Dutch lady, and the little baby does n’t want to come to her 
mother and the cat is looking for some mice.” 
“The mother is sitting down and the little one has her hands 
up over her eyes. There’s a pail by the mother and a chair with 
some clothes on it and a table with dishes. And here’s a lamp and 
here’s some curtains.” 
Picture (b): satisfactory responses 
“Some people in a boat. The water is high and if they don’t 
look out the boat will tip over.” 
“Some Indians and a lady and man. They are in a boat on the 
river and the boat is about to upset, and there are some dead 
trees going to fall.” 
“There’s a lot of water coming up to drown the people. There 
are two people in the boat and the boat is sinking.” 
“There’s some people sailing in a canoe and the woman is 
leaning over on the man because she is afraid.” 
“There’s an Indian and some white people in the boat. I sup- 
pose they are out for a ride in a canoe.” 
“Picture about some man and lady in a canoe and going down 
to the sea.” 
“They are taking a boat ride on the ocean and the water is up 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  192 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
so high that one of them is scared. Here are some trees and two of 
them are going to fall down. Here’s a little place or bridge you can 
stand on. The man is touching this one’s head and this one has 
his hand on the cover.” 
“The water is splashing all over. There’s trees on this bank and 
there’s a rock and some trees falling down. The people have a 
blanket over them.” 
Picture (c): satisfactory responses 
“A man selling eggs and two men reading the paper together 
and two men watching.” 
““A few men reading a newspaper and one has a basket of eggs 
and this one has been fishing.” 
““There’s a man with a basket of eggs and another is reading the 
paper and a woman is hanging out clothes. There’s a house near.” 
““There’s a man trying to read the paper and the others want to 
read it too. Here’s a lady walking up to the barn. There are 
houses over there and one man has a basket.” 
“‘There’s a big brick house and five men by it and a man with a 
basket of eggs and a post-office sign and a lady going home.” 
“They are all looking at the paper. He is looking over the other 
man’s shoulder and this one is looking at the back of the paper. 
There’s a woman cleaning up her back yard and some coops for 
hens.” 
““A man reading a paper, a man with eggs, a woman and a tree 
and another house. That man has an apron on. This is the post- 
office.” 
Unsatisfactory responses are those made up entirely or 
mainly of enumeration. A phrase or two of description 
intermingled with a larger amount of enumeration counts 
minus. Sometimes the description is satisfactory as far 
as it goes, but is exceedingly brief. In such cases a little 
tactful urging (“‘Go ahead,” etc.) will extend the response 
sufficiently to reveal its true character. 
Remarks. Description is better than enumeration be- 
cause it involves putting the elements of a picture to- 
gether in a simple way or noting their qualities. This 
requires a higher type of mental association (combinative 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  TEST NO. VII, 3 193 
power) than mere enumeration. An unusually complete 
description indicates relative wealth of mental content and 
facility of association. 
Binet placed this test in year VII, and it seems to have 
been retained in this location in all revisions except Bober- 
tag’s. However, the statistics of various workers show much 
disagreement. Lack of agreement is easily accounted for by 
the fact that different investigators have used different 
series of pictures and doubtless also different standards for 
success. The pictures used by Binet have little action or 
detail and are therefore rather difficult for description. On 
the other hand, the Jingleman-Jack pictures used by Kuhl- 
mann represent such familiar situations and have so much 
action that even 5- or 6-year intelligence seldom fails with 
them. The pictures we employ belong without question 
in year VII. 
No better proof than the above could be found to show 
how ability of a given kind does not make its appearance 
suddenly. There is no one time in the life of even a single 
child when the power to describe pictures suddenly de- 
velops. On the contrary, pictures of a certain type will 
ordinarily provoke description, rather than enumeration, 
as early as 5 or 6 years; others not before 7 or 8 years, 
or even later. 
VU, 3. Repeating five digits 
Procedure. Use: 3-1-7-5-9; 4-2-3-8-5; 9-8-1-7-6. 
Tell the child to listen and to say after you just what you 
say. Then read the first series of digits at a slightly faster 
rate than one per second, in a distinct voice, and with per- 
fectly uniform emphasis. Avoid rhythm. 
In previous tests with digits, it was permissible to re- 
read the first series if the child refused to respond. In 
this year, and in the digits tests of later years, this is not
-P-A-G-E-214
  194 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
permissible. Warning is not given as to the number of 
digits to be repeated. Before reading each series, get the 
child’s attention. Do not stare at the child during the 
response, as this is disconcerting. Look aside or at the 
record sheet. 
Scoring. Passed if the child repeats correctly, after a 
single reading, one series out of the three series given. The 
order must be correct. 
Remarks. Psychologically the repetition of digits differs 
from the repetition of sentences mainly in the fact that 
digits have less meaning (fewer associations) than the words 
of a sentence. It is because they are not as well knit together 
in meaning that three digits tax the memory as much as 
six syllables making up a sentence. 
Testing auditory memory for digits is one of the oldest 
of intelligence tests. It is easy to give and lends itself well 
to exact quantitative standardization. Its value has been 
questioned, however, on two grounds: (1) That it is not 
a test of pure memory, but depends largely on attention; 
and (2) that the results are too much influenced by the 
child’s type of imagery. As to the first objection, it is 
true that more than one mental function is brought into 
play by the test. The same may be said of every other test 
in the Binet scale and for that matter of any test that 
could be devised. It is impossible to isolate any function 
for separate testing. In fact, the functions called memory, 
attention, perception, judgment, etc., never operate in 
isolation. There are no separate and special “‘ faculties ” 
corresponding to such terms, which are merely convenient 
names for characterizing mental processes of various types. 
In any test it is “ general ability ” which is operative, per- 
haps now chiefly in remembering, at another time chiefly 
in sensory discrimination, again in reasoning, etc. 
The second objection, that the test is largely invalidated
-P-A-G-E-215
TEST NO. VU, 3 195 
by the existence of imagery types, is not borne out by the 
facts. Experiments have shown that pure imagery types are 
exceedingly rare, and that children, especially, are charac- 
terized by “‘ mixed ” imagery. There are probably few sub- 
jects so lacking in auditory imagery as to be placed at a 
serious disadvantage in this test. 
Lengthening a series by the addition of a single digit 
adds greatly to the difficulty. While four digits can usually 
be repeated by children of 4 years, five digits belong in 
year VII and six in year X. 
It is always interesting to note the type of errors made. 
The most common error is to omit one or more of the digits, 
usually in the first part of the series. If the child’s ability 
is decidedly below the test he may give only the last two 
or three out of the five or six heard. Substitutions are also 
quite frequent, and if so many substitutions are made as 
to give a series quite unlike that which the child has heard, 
it is an unfavorable sign, indicating weakness of the critical 
sense which is so often found with low-level intelligence. 
In case of extreme weakness of the power of auto-criticism, 
the child in response to the series 9-8—1—7-6-, may say 
1-2-3-4-5-6, or perhaps merely a couple of digits like 8-6, 
and still express complete satisfaction with his absurd re- 
sponse. After each series, therefore, the examiner should 
say, “Was it right?” ! Very young subjects, however, 
have a tendency to answer “yes” to any question of this 
type, and it is therefore best not to call for criticism of a 
performance below the age of 6 or 7 years. 
Digit series of a given length are not always of equal dif- 
ficulty, and for this reason it is never wise to use series 
improvised at the moment of the experiment. We must 
avoid especially series of regularly ascending or descending 
1 “Was it wrong?” is not an equivalent question and should not be 
used. 3 
   
-P-A-G-E-216
  196 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
value, the repetition at regular intervals of a particular 
digit, and all other peculiarities of arrangement which would 
favor the grouping of the digits for easier retention. 
It remains to mention two or three further cautions in 
regard to procedure. It is best to begin with a series about 
one digit below the child’s expected ability. If the child 
has a probable intelligence of about 6 or 7 years, we should 
begin with four digits; in case of probable 10-year intelli- 
gence we begin with five digits, etc. On the other hand, we 
should avoid beginning too far down, because then the re- 
sult is too much complicated by the effects of practice and 
fatigue. 
It is not necessary, and often it is not expedient, to give 
the digits tests of all the different years in succession; that 
is, without other tests intervening. While this may be per- 
missible with older children, in young children the power 
of sustained attention is so weak that no single kind of test 
should occupy more than two or three minutes. Children 
below 6 or 7 years should ordinarily be given the tests 
in the order in which they are listed in the record booklet. 
In his 1911 revision of the scale Binet unfortunately 
shifted this test from year VII to year VIII. Goddard fol- 
lows his example, but Kuhlmann retains it in year VII. 
The data from more than a dozen leading investigations 
in America, England, and Germany agree in showing that 
the test should remain in year VII. 
VII, 4. Tying a bow-knot 
Procedure. Prepare a shoestring tied in a bow-knot 
around a stick. The knot should be an ordinary “ double 
bow,” with wings not over three or four inches long. Make 
this ready in advance of the experiment and show the child 
only the completed knot.
-P-A-G-E-217
  
TEST NO. VII, 4 197 
Place the model before the subject with the wings pointing 
to the right and left, and say: “You know what kind of 
knot this is, don’t you? It is a bow-knot. I want you to 
take this other piece of string and tie the same kind of knot 
around my finger.” At the same time give the child a piece 
of shoestring, of the same length as that which is tied around 
the stick, and hold out a finger pointed toward the child 
and in convenient position for the operation. It is better 
to have the subject tie the string around the examiner’s 
finger than around a pencil or other object because the latter 
often falls out of the string and is otherwise awkward to 
handle. 
Some children who assert that they do not know how to 
tie a bow-knot are sometimes nevertheless successful when 
urged to try. It is always necessary, therefore, to secure 
an actual trial. 
Scoring. The test is passed if a double bow-knot (both 
ends folded in) is made in not more than a minute. A single 
bow-knot (only one end folded in) counts half credit, be- 
cause children are often accustomed to use the single bow 
altogether. The usual plain common knot, which precedes 
the bow-knot proper, must not be omitted if the response 
is to count as satisfactory, for without this preliminary 
plain knot a bow-knot will not hold and is of no value. To 
be satisfactory the knot should also be drawn up reason- 
ably close, not left gaping. 
Remarks. This test, which had not before been stand- 
ardized, was suggested to the writer by the late Dr. Huey, 
who in a conversation once remarked upon the frequent 
inability of feeble-minded adults to perform the little motor 
tasks which are universally learned by normal persons in 
childhood. The test was therefore incorporated in the 
Stanford trial series of 1913-14 and tried with 370 non- 
selected children within two months of the 6th, 7th, 8th,

198 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
or 9th birthday. It was expected that the test would prob- 
ably be found to belong at about the 8-year level, but it 
proved to be easy enough for year VII, where 69 per cent 
of the children passed it. Only 35 per cent of the 6-year- 
olds succeeded, but after that age the per cent passing in- 
creased rapidly to 94 per cent at 9 years. 
This little experiment, simple as it is, seems to fulfill 
reasonably well the requirements of a good test. The main 
objection which might be brought against it is that it is 
much subject to the influence of training. If this were true 
in any marked degree, the mentally retarded children of 
7-year intelligence should be expected to succeed better 
with it than mentally advanced children of the same 
mental level, since the former would have had at least two 
or three years more in which to learn the task. A com- 
parison of the two groups, however, shows no great dif- 
ference. The factor of age, apart from mental age, affects 
the results so little that it is evident we have here a real 
test of intelligence. 
It would, of course, be easy to imagine a child of 7 
years who had not had reasonable opportunity to make the 
acquaintance of bow-knots or to learn to tie them. But such 
children are seldom encountered in the ages above 6 or 7. 
Of 68 7-year-olds who were asked whether they had ever 
seen a bow-knot (“a knot like that’) only two replied 
in the negative. It cannot be denied, however, that specific 
instruction and special stimulus to practice do play a 
certain part. This is suggested by the fact that girls excel 
the boys somewhat at each age, doubtless because bow- 
knots play a larger réle in feminine apparel. Social status 
affects the results in only a moderate degree, though it 
might be supposed that poor ragamuffins, on the one hand, 
and children of the very rich, on the other, would both 
make a poor showing in this test; the former because of
-P-A-G-E-219
  
TEST NO. VU, 5 199 
their scanty apparel, the latter because they sometimes 
have servants to dress them. 
The following are probably the chief factors determining 
success with this test: (1) Interest in common objective 
things; (2) ability to form permanent associative connec- 
tions between successive motor codrdinations (memory 
for a series of acts); and (8) skill in the acquisition of 
voluntary motor control. The last factor is probably much , 
less important than the other two. Motor awkwardness 
often prolongs the time from the usual ten or fifteen seconds 
to thirty or forty seconds, but it is rarely a cause of a fail- 
ure. The important thing is to be able to reproduce the 
appropriate succession of acts, acts which nearly all chil- 
dren of 7 years, under the joint stimulus of example and 
spontaneous interest, have before performed or tried to 
perform. 
VU, 5. Giving differences from memory 
Procedure. Say: “ What is the difference between a fly 
and a butterfly ?”’ If the child does not seem to understand, 
say: “You know flies, do you not? You have seen flies ? 
And you know the butterflies! Now, tell me the difference 
between a fly and a butterfly.” Proceed in the same way 
with stone and egg, and wood and glass. A little coaxing is 
sometimes necessary to secure a response, but supplemen- 
tary questions and suggestions of every kind are to be 
avoided. For example, it would not be permissible for the 
examiner to say: “‘ Which is larger, a fly or a butterfly?” 
This would give the child his cue and he would immediately 
answer, “ A butterfly.” The child must be left to find a 
difference by himself. Sometimes a difference is given, 
but without any indication as to its direction, as, for ex- 
ample, “ One is bigger than the other ” (for fly and butter- 
fly). It is then permissible to ask: “ Which is bigger ? ”
-P-A-G-E-220
  200 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Scoring. Passed if a real difference is given in two out of 
three comparisons. It is not necessary, however, that an 
essential difference be given; the difference may be trivial, 
only it must be a real one. The following are samples of 
satisfactory and unsatisfactory responses: — 
Fly and butterfly 
Satisfactory. ‘Butterfly is larger.” ‘Butterfly has bigger 
wings.” “Fly is black and a butterfly is not.” “‘Butterfly is yellow 
(or white, ete.) and fly is black.” “Fly bites you and butterfly 
don’t.” “Butterfly has powder on its wings, fly does not.” “Fly 
flies straighter.” “Butterfly is outdoors and a fly is in the house.” 
“Flies are more dangerous to our health.” “Flies have n’t any- 
thing to sip honey with.” ‘Butterfly does n’t live as long as a fly.” 
“Butterfly comes from a caterpillar.” 
Sometimes a double contrast is meant, but not fully expressed; 
as, “‘A fly is small and a butterfly is pretty.” Here the thought is 
probably correct, only the language is awkward. 
Of 102 correct responses, 70 were in terms of size, or size plus 
color or form; 12 were in terms of both form and color; 6 in terms of 
color alone; and the rest scattered among such responses as those 
mentioned above. 
Unsatisfactory. These are mostly misstatements of facts; as: 
“Fly is bigger.” “Fly has legs and butterfly has n’t.” “Butterfly 
has no feet and fly has.” ‘“‘Butterfly makes butter.” “ Fly is a fly 
and a butterfly is not.’ Failures due to misstatement of fact are 
of endless variety. If an indefinite response is given, like “The 
fly is different,” or “They don’t look alike,’ we ask, “How is it 
different ?”’ or, “Why don’t they look alike?” It is satisfactory if the 
child then gives a correct answer. 
Stone and egg 
Satisfactory. ‘Stone is harder.” “Egg is softer.” “Egg breaks 
easier.” “Egg breaks and stone doesn’t.” “Stone is heavier.” 
“Egg is white and stone is not.” “Egg has a shell and stone does 
not.” “Eggs have a white and a yellow in them.” “You put eggs 
in a pudding.” “An egg is rounder than a stone.” We may also 
accept statements which are only qualifiedly true; as, “You can 
break an egg, but not a stone.” Likewise double but incomplete  
-P-A-G-E-221
  
TEST NO. VII, 5 201 
comparisons are satisfactory; as, “An egg you fry and a stone you 
throw,” “A stone is tough and an egg you eat,” etc. 
A little over three fourths of the comparisons made by children 
of 6, '7, and 8 years are in terms of hardness. The other responses 
are widely scattered. 
Unsatisfactory. “A stone is bigger (or smaller) than an egg.” 
“*A stone is square and an egg is round.” “ An egg is yellow anda 
stone is white.” “Stones are red (or black, etc.) and eggs are 
white.” “An egg is to eat and a stone is to plant.” “An egg is 
round and a stone is sometimes round.” 
It will be noted that the above responses are partly true and 
partly false. The error they contain renders them unacceptable. 
Most of the failures are due to misstatements as to size, shape, or 
color, but occasionally one meets a bizarre answer. 
Wood and glass 
Satisfactory. “Glass breaks easier than wood.” “Glass breaks 
and wood does not.”’ “Wood is stronger than glass.” “Glass you 
can see through and wood you can’t.” “Glass cuts you and wood 
does n’t.” “You get splinters from wood and you don’t from glass.” 
“Glass melts and wood does n’t.” “Wood burns and glass 
does n’t.” “Wood has bark and glass has n’t.”” “Wood grows and 
glass does n’t.” “Glass is heavier than wood.” “Glass glistens in 
the sun and wood does not.” 
An incomplete double comparison is also counted satisfactory; 
as, “Wood you can burn and glass you can see through.” 
Unsatisfactory. “Wood is black and glass is white.” (Color 
differences are always unsatisfactory in this comparison unless 
transparency is also mentioned.) “Glass is square and wood is 
round.” “Glass is bigger than wood” (or vice versa). ‘‘ Wood is ob- 
long ‘and glass is square.” ‘Glass is thin and wood is thick.” 
“Wood is made out of trees and glass out of windows.” “There is 
no glass in wood.” 
The two most frequent types of failures are misstatements re- 
garding color and thickness. The other failures are widely scattered. 
Remarks. The test is one which all the critics agree in 
commending, largely because it is so little influenced by 
ordinary school experience. Its excellence lies mainly, 
however, in the fact that it throws light upon the character
-P-A-G-E-222
  202 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
of the child’s higher thought processes, for thinking means 
essentially the association of ideas on the basis of differ- 
ences or similarities. Nearly all thought processes, from 
the most complex to the very simplest, involve to a greater 
or less degree one or the other of these two types of associa- 
tion. They are involved in the simple judgments made by 
children, in the appreciation of puns, in mechanical inven- 
tions, in the creation of poetry, in the scientific classifica- 
tion of natural phenomena, and in the origination of the 
hypotheses of science or philosophy. 
The ability to note differences precedes somewhat the 
ability to note resemblances, though the contrary has some- 
times been asserted by logician-psychologists. The diffi- 
culty of the test is greatly increased by the fact that the 
objects to be compared are not present to the senses, 
which means that the free ideas must be called up for 
comparison and contrast. Failure may result either from 
weakness in the power of ideational representation of ob- 
jects, or from the inadequacy of the associations themselves, 
or from both. Probably both factors are usually involved. 
Intellectual development is especially evident in in- 
creased ability to note essential differences and likenesses, 
as contrasted with those which are trivial, superficial, and 
accidental. To distinguish an egg from a stone on the basis 
of one being organic, the other inorganic matter requires 
far higher intelligence than to distinguish them on the 
basis of shape, color, fragibility, etc. It is not till well 
toward the adult stage that the ability to give very essen- 
tial likenesses and differences becomes prominent, and when 
we get a comparison of this type from a child of 7 or 8 
years it is a very favorable sign. 
It would be well worth while to standardize a new test 
of this kind for use in the upper years and especially adapted 
to display the ability to give essential likenesses and dif-  
-P-A-G-E-223
TEST NO. VI, 5 208 
ferences. At year VII we must accept as satisfactory any 
real difference. 
One point remains. In the tests of giving differences and 
similarities, it is well to make note of any tendency to 
stereotypy, by which is meant the mechanical reappearance 
of the same idea, or element, in successive responses. For 
example, the child begins by comparing fly and butterfly 
on the basis of size; as, “‘ A butterfly is bigger than a fly.” 
So far, this is quite satisfactory; but the child with a ten- 
dency to stereotypy finds himself unable to get away 
from the dominating idea of size and continues to make it 
the basis of the other comparisons: “A stone is larger 
than an egg,” “ Wood is larger than glass,” etc. In case of 
stereotypy in all three responses, we should have to score 
the total response failure even though the idea employed 
happened to fit all three parts of the question. As a rule 
it is encountered only with very young children or with 
older children who are mentally retarded. It is therefore 
an unfavorable sign. 
Although this test has been universally used in year VIII, 
all the available statistics, with the exception of Bobertag’s 
and Bloch’s, indicate that it is decidedly too easy for that 
year. Binet himself says that nearly all 7-year-olds pass 
it. Goddard finds 97 per cent passing at year VIII, and 
Dougherty 90 per cent at year VI. With the standard of 
scoring given in the present revision, and with the substitu- 
tion of stone and egg instead of the more difficult paper 
and cloth, the test is unquestionably easy enough for 
year VII.
-P-A-G-E-224
  204 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
VII, 6. Copying a diamond 
Procedure. On a white cardboard draw in heavy black 
lines a diamond with the longer diagonal three inches and 
the shorter diagonal an inch and a half. The specially 
prepared record booklet contains the diamond as well as 
many other conveniences. 
Place the model before the child with the longer diagonal 
pointing directly toward him, and giving him pen and ink 
and paper, say: ‘“‘ I want you to draw one exactly like this.” 
Give three trials, saying each time: “ Make it exactly like 
this one.” In repeating the above formula, merely point to 
the model; do not pass the fingers around its edge. 
Unlike the test of copying a square in year IV, there is 
seldom any difficulty in getting the child to try this one. By 
the age of 7 the child has grown much less timid and has 
become more accustomed to the use of writing materials. 
Note whether the child draws each part carefully, look- 
ing at the model from time to time, or whether the strokes 
are made in a more or less haphazard manner with only an 
initial glance at the original. 
After each trial, say to the child: “Is it good?” And 
after the three copies have been made say: ‘‘ Which one is 
the best ?’’ Retarded children are sometimes entirely satis- 
fied with the most nondescript drawings imaginable, but 
they are more likely correctly to pick out the best of three 
than to render a correct judgment about the worth of each 
drawing separately. 
Scoring. The test is passed if two of the three drawings 
are at least as good as those marked satisfactory on the 
score card. The diamond should be drawn approximately 
in the correct position, and the diagonals must not be re- 
versed. Disregard departures from the model with respect 
+o size.
-P-A-G-E-225
  TEST NO. VU, ALTERNATIVE 1 205 
Remarks. The test is a good one. Age and training, 
apart from intelligence, affect it only moderately. There 
are few adult imbeciles of 6-year intelligence who are able 
to pass it, while but few subjects who have reached the 
8-year level fail on it. 
This test was located in year VII of the 1908 scale, but. 
was shifted to year VI in Binet’s 1911 revision. The change 
was without justification, for Binet expressly states, both 
in 1908 and 1911, that only half of the 6-year-olds succeed 
with it. The large majority of investigations have given 
too low a proportion of successes at 6 years to warrant its 
location at that age, particularly if pen is required instead 
of pencil. Location at year VI would be warranted only 
on the condition that the use of pencil be permitted and 
only one success required in three trials. 
VII, Alternative test 1: naming the days of the week 
Procedure. Say: “You know the days of the week, do 
you not ? Name the days of the week for me.”” Sometimes the 
child begins by naming various annual holidays, as Christ- 
mas, Fourth of July, ete. Perhaps he has not comprehended 
the task; at any rate, we give him one more trial by stop- 
ping him and saying: “No; that is not what I mean. I 
want you to name the days of the week.’’ No supplementary 
questions are permissible, and we must be careful not to 
show approval or disapproval in our looks as the child is 
giving his response. 
If the days have been named in correct order, we check 
up the response to see whether the real order of days is 
known or whether the names have only been repeated me- 
chanically. This is done by asking the following questions: 
1 For further discussion of drawing tests, see V, 1, and X, 3.  
-P-A-G-E-226
  206 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
“What day comes before Tuesday?” ‘What day comes 
before Thursday?” ‘‘ What day comes before Friday?” 
Scoring. The test is passed if, within fifteen seconds, the 
days of the week are all named in correct order, and if the 
child succeeds in at least two of the three check questions. 
We disregard the point of beginning. 
Remarks. The test has been criticized as too depend- 
ent on rote memory. Bobertag says a child may pass it 
without having any adequate conception of “ week,” “ yes- 
terday,” “ day before yesterday,” etc. This criticism holds 
if the test is given according to the older procedure, but 
does not apply with the procedure above recommended. 
The “ checking-up ” questions enable us at once to dis- 
tinguish responses that are given by rote from those which 
rest upon actual knowledge. 
The test has been shown to be much more influenced by 
age, apart from intelligence, than most other tests of the 
scale. Notwithstanding this fault, it seems desirable to 
keep the test, at least as an alternative, because it forms 
one of a group which may be designated as tests of time 
orientation. The others of this group are: “ Distinguishing 
forenoon and afternoon” (VI), “Giving the date” and 
“Naming the months” (IX). It would be well if we had 
even more of this type, for interest in the passing of time 
and in the names of time divisions is closely correlated 
with intelligence. One reason for the inferiority of the dull 
and feeble-minded in tests of this type is that their mental 
“associations are weaker and less numerous. The greater 
poverty of their associations brings it about that their 
remembered experiences are less definitely located in 
time with reference to other events. 
The test was located in year IX of the 1908 scale, but 
was omitted from the 1911 revision. Kuhlmann also omits 
it, while Goddard places it in year VIII. The statistics
-P-A-G-E-227
  TEST NO. VII, ALTERNATIVE 2 207 
from every American investigation, however, warrant its 
location in year VII. It may be located in year VIII only 
on the condition that the child be required to name the 
days backwards, and that within a rather low time limit. 
VII, Alternative test 2: repeating three digits reversed 
Procedure. The digits used are: 2-8-3; 4-2-7; 5-9-6. 
The test should be given after, but not immediately after, 
the tests of repeating digits forwards. 
Say to the child: “‘ Listen carefully. I am going to read 
some numbers again, but this time I want you to say them 
backwards. For example, if I should say 1-2-8, you would 
say 3-2-1. Do you understand?” When it is evident that 
the child has grasped the instructions, say: ‘“‘ Ready now; 
listen carefully, and be sure to say the numbers backwards.” 
Then read the series at the same rate and in the same 
manner as in the other digits tests. It is not permissible to 
re-read any of the series. 
If the first series is repeated forwards instead of back- 
wards, the instructions must be repeated. Before each 
series exhort the child to listen carefully and to be sure to 
repeat the numbers backwards. 
Scoring. The test is passed if one series out of three is 
repeated backwards without error. 
Remarks. The test of repeating digits backwards was 
suggested by Bobertag in 1911, but appears not to have 
been used or standardized previous to the Stanford inves-- 
tigation. 
It is very much harder to repeat a series of digits back- 
wards than in the direct order. Five digits can be given 
in the direct order at year VII, and six at year X. Revers- 
ing the order places three digits in year VII, four in year 
X, five in year XII, and six in “average adult.” Even  
-P-A-G-E-228
    208 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
intelligent adults sometimes have difficulty in repeating 
six digits backwards, once in three trials. 
As a test of intelligence this test is better than that of 
repeating digits in the direct order. It is less mechanical 
and makes a much heavier demand on attention. The digits 
must be so firmly fixated in memory that they can be held 
there long enough to be told off, one by one, backwards. 
Feeble-minded children find this test especially difficult, 
perhaps mainly because of its element of novelty. School 
children are often asked to write numbers dictated by the 
teacher, and even the very dull acquire a certain proficiency 
in doing so; but the test of repeating digits backwards re- 
quires a certain facility in adjusting to a new task, exactly 
the sort of thing in which the feeble-minded are so markedly 
deficient. 
As a rule the response consumes much more time than 
in the other digits test. This is particularly true when the 
series to be repeated backwards contains four or more 
digits. The chance of success is greatly increased if the sub- 
ject first thinks the series through two or three times in 
the direct order before attempting the reverse order. The 
subject who responds immediately is likely to begin cor- 
rectly, but to give the first part of the original series in the 
direct order. For example, 6-5-2-8 is given 8-2-6-5. 
Sometimes the child gives one or two numbers and then 
stops, having completely lost the rest of the series in the 
stress of adjusting to the novel and relatively difficult 
task of beginning with the final digit. In such cases the 
feeble-minded are prone to fill in with any numbers they 
may happen to think of. A good method for the subject 
is to break the series up into groups and to give each 
group separately. Thus, 6-5-2-8 is given 8-2 (pause) 5-6. 
As a rule only the more intelligent subjects adopt this 
method. One 12-year-old girl attending high school was
-P-A-G-E-229
  TEST NO. VII, ALTERNATIVE 2 209 
able to repeat eight digits backwards by the aid of this 
device. 
It would be well worth while to investigate the relation 
of this test to imagery type. Such a study would have to 
make use of adult subjects trained in introspection. It 
would seem that success might be favored by the ability 
to translate the auditory impression into visual imagery, 
so that the remembered numbers could be read off as from 
a book; but this may or may not be the case. At any rate, 
success seems to depend largely upon the ability to ma- 
nipulate mental imagery. 
The degree of certainty as to the correctness of the re- 
sponse is usually much less than in repeating digits forwards.

CHAPTER XIV 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR VIII 
VIII, 1. The ball-and-field test (Score 2, inferior plan) 
Procedure. Draw a circle about two and one half inches 
in diameter, leaving a small gap in the side next the child. 
Say: “Let us suppose that your baseball has been lost in 
this round field. You have no idea what part of the field it 
is in. You don’t know what direction it came from, how 
it got there, or with what force it came. All you know is 
that the ball is lost somewhere in the field. Now, take this 
pencil and mark out a path to show me how you would hunt 
for the ball so as to be sure not to miss it. Begin at the gate 
and show me what path you would take.” + 
Give the instructions always as worded above. Avoid 
using an expression like, “ Show me how you would walk 
around in the field’; the word around might suggest a cir- 
cular path. 
Sometimes the child merely points or tells how he would 
go. It is then necessary to say: “No; you must mark out 
your path with the pencil so I can see it plainly.” Other 
children trace a path only a little way and stop, saying: 
“Here it is.’ We then say: “But suppose you have not 
found it yet. Which direction would you go next?” In this 
way the child must be kept tracing a path until it is evident 
whether any plan governs his procedure. 
Scoring. The performances secured with this test are

conveniently classified into four groups, representing pro- 
gressively higher types. The first two types represent fail- 
ures; the third is satisfactory at year VIII, the fourth at 
year XII. They may be described as follows: — 
Type a (failure). The child fails to comprehend the instructions 
and either does nothing at all or else, perhaps, takes the pencil and 
makes a few random strokes which could not be said to constitute 
a search. 
Type b (also failure). The child comprehends the instructions 
and carries out a search, but without any definite plan. Absence 
of plan is evidenced by the crossing and re-crossing of paths, or 
by “breaks.” A break means that the pencil is lifted up and set 
down in another part of the field. Sometimes only two or three 
fragments of paths are drawn, but more usually the field is pretty 
well filled up with random meanderings which cross each other 
again and again. Other illustrations of type b are: A single straight 
or curved line going direct to the ball, short haphazard dashes or 
curves, bare suggestion of a fan or spiral. 
Type c (satisfactory at year VIII). A successful performance at 
year VIII is characterized by the presence of a plan, but one ill- 
adapted to the purpose. That some forethought is exercised is 
evidenced, (1) by fewer crossings, (2) by a tendency either to make 
the lines more or less parallel or else to give them some kind of 
symmetry, and (3) by fewer breaks. The possibilities of type ¢ are 
almost unlimited, and one is continually meeting new forms. We 
have distinguished more than twenty of these, the most common of 
which may be described as follows: — 
1. Very rough or zigzag circles or similarly imperfect spirals. 
2. Segments of curves joined in a more or less symmetrical 
fashion. 
8. Lines going back and forth across the field, joined at the 
ends and not intended to be parallel. 
4. The “wheel plan,’”’ showing lines radiating from near the 
center of the field toward the circumference. 
5. The “fan plan,” showing a number of lines radiating (usu- 
ally) from the gate and spreading out over the field. 
6. “Fan ellipses” or “fan spirals” radiating from the gate like 
the lines just described.
-P-A-G-E-232
  212. THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
7. The “leaf plan,” “rib plan,” or “tree plan,” with lines 
branching off from a trunk line like ribs, veins of a leaf, or 
branches of a tree. 
8. Parallel lines which cross at right angles and mark off the 
field like a checkerboard. 
9. Paths making one or more fairly symmetrical geometrical 
figures, like a square, a diamond, a star, a hexagon, etc. 
10. A combination of two or more of the above plans. 
Type d (satisfactory at year XII). Performances of this type 
meet perfectly, or almost perfectly, the logical requirements of 
the problem. The paths are almost or quite parallel, and there 
are no intersections or breaks. The possibilities of type d are fewer 
and embrace chiefly the following: — 
1. A spiral, perfect or almost perfect, and beginning either at 
the gate or at the center of the field. 
2. Concentric circles. 
3. Transverse lines, parallel or almost so, and joined at the ends. 
Up to about 4 years most children failed entirely to com- 
prehend the task. By the age of 6 years the task is usually 
understood, but the search is conducted without plan. Type 
c is not attained by two thirds before the mental level of 
8 years, and score 3 ordinarily not until 11 or 12 years. 
Grading presents some difficulties because of occasional 
border-line performances which have a value almost mid- 
way between types b and c or between c and d. Frequent 
reference to the scoring card will enable the examiner, 
after a little experience, to score nearly all the doubtful 
performances satisfactorily. 
Remarks. The ball-and-field problem may be called a 
test of practical judgment. Unlike a majority of the other 
tests, it gives the subject a chance to show how well he 
can meet the demands of a real, rather than an imagined, 
situation. Tests like this, involving practical adjustments, 
are valuable in rounding out the scale, which, as left by 
Binet, placed rather excessive emphasis on abstract rea-
-P-A-G-E-233
  TEST NO. VIII, 2 213 
soning and the comprehension of language. The test re- 
quires little time and always arouses the child’s interest. 
Our analysis of the responses of nearly 1500 subjects 
shows that improvement with increasing mental age is 
steady and fairly rapid. Occasionally, however, one meets 
a high-grade performance with children of 6 or 7 years, and 
a low-grade performance with adults of average intelli- 
gence. Like all the other tests of the scale, it is unreliable 
when used alone. 
VIII, 2. Counting backwards from 20 to 1 
Procedure. Say to the child: “You can count backwards, 
can you not? I want you to count backwards for me from 
20 to 1. Go ahead.” In the great majority of cases this is 
sufficient; the child comprehends the task and begins. 
If he does not comprehend, and is silent, or starts in, 
perhaps, to count forwards from 1 or 20, say: “No; I 
want you to count backwards from 20 to 1, like this: 20-19- 
18, and clear on down to 1. Now, go ahead.” 
Insist upon the child trying it even though he asserts 
he cannot do it. In many such cases an effort is crowned 
with success. Say nothing about hurrying, as this confuses 
some subjects. Prompting is not permissible. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the child counts from 20 
to 1 in not over forty seconds and with not more than a single 
error (one omission or one transposition). Errors which 
the child spontaneously corrects are not counted as errors. 
Remarks. The statistics on this test agree remarkably 
well. It is plainly too easy for year IX, and no one has 
found it easy enough for year VII. The main lack of uni- 
formity has been in the adherence to a time limit. Binet 
required that the task be completed in twenty seconds, and. 
Goddard and most others adhere rather strictly to this rule.
-P-A-G-E-234
  214 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Kuhlmann, however, allows thirty seconds if there is no 
error and twenty seconds if one error is committed. We 
agree with Bobertag that owing to the nature of this test 
we should not be pedantic about the time. While a major- 
ity of children who are able to count backwards do the task 
in twenty seconds, there are some intelligent but deliberate 
subjects who require as much as thirty-five or forty seconds. 
If the counting is done with assurance and without stum- 
bling, there is no reason why we should not allow even forty 
seconds. Beyond this, however, our generosity should not 
go, because of the chance it would give for the use of special 
devices such as counting forwards each time to the next 
number wanted. 
It may be said that counting backwards is a test of school- 
ing, and to a certain extent this is true. It is reasonable to 
suppose that special training would enable the child to 
pass the test a little earlier than he would otherwise be 
able to do, though it is doubtful whether many children 
below 7 years of age have had enough of such training to 
influence the performance very materially. On the other 
hand, when the child has reached an intelligence level of 
8 or at most 9 years, he is ordinarily able to count from 
20 to 1 whether he has ever tried it before or not. 
What psychological factors are involved in this test? 
It presupposes, in the first place, the ability to count from 
1 to 20. But this alone does not guarantee success in 
counting backwards. Something more is required than a 
mere rote memory for the number names in their order 
from 1 up to 20. The quantitative relationships of the 
numbers must also be apprehended if the task is to be per- 
formed smoothly without a great deal of special training. 
In addition to being reasonably secure in his knowledge of 
the number relationships involved, the child must be able 
to give sustained attention until the task is completed. °
-P-A-G-E-235
  
TEST NO. VII, 3 215 
His mental processes must be dominated by the guiding 
idea, “ count backwards.” Associations which do not har- 
monize with this aim, or which fail to further it, must be 
inhibited. Even momentary relaxation of attention means 
a loss of directive force in the guiding idea and the domi- 
nance of better known associations which may be suggested 
by the task, but are out of harmony with it. Thus, if a child 
momentarily loses sight of the end after counting back- 
wards successfully from 20 to 14, he is likely to be over- 
powered by the law of habit and begin counting forwards, 
1415-16-17, etc. We may regard the test, therefore, as a 
test of attention, or prolonged thought control. The ability 
to exercise unbroken vigilance for a period of twenty or 
thirty seconds is rarely found below the level of 7- or 8- 
year intelligence. 
VIII, 3. Comprehension, third degree 
The questions for this year are: — 
(a) “What ’s the thing for you to do when you have broken some- 
thing which belongs to some one else?” 
(b) “What ’s the thing for. you to do when you ‘notice on your way 
to school that you are in danger of being tardy ?” 
(c) “What ’s the thing for you to do if a playmate hits you without 
meaning to do it?” 
The procedure is the same as in previous comprehension 
questions. Each question may be repeated once or twice, 
but its form must not be changed. No explanations are 
permissible. 
Scoring : — 
Question a (If you have broken something) 
Satisfactory responses are those suggesting either restitution or 
apology, or both. Confession is not satisfactory unless accom- 
1 See IV, 5, and VI, 4.  
-P-A-G-E-236
  216 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
panied by apology. The following are satisfactory: “Buy a new 
one.” “Pay for it.” “Give them something instead of it.” “Have 
my father mend it.” “Apologize.” ‘Tell them I’m sorry, that I 
did not mean to break it,” ete. Of 92 correct answers, 76 suggested 
restitution, while 16 suggested apology, or apology and restitution. 
Unsatisfactory. ‘“‘Tell them I did it.” “Go tell my mother.” 
“Feel sorry.” “Be ashamed.” “Pick it up,” etc. Mere confession 
accounts for over 20 per cent of all failures. 
Question b (In danger of being tardy) 
Satisfactory. The expected response is, “Hurry,” “‘ Walk faster,” 
or something to that effect. One bright city boy said he would take 
a car. Of the answers not obviously incorrect, nearly 95 per cent 
suggest hurrying. The rule ordinarily recommended is to grade all 
other responses minus. But this rule is too sweeping to be followed 
blindly. One who would use intelligence tests must learn to dis- 
criminate. “I would go back home and not go to school that day” 
is a good answer in those cases (fortunately rare) in which children 
are forbidden by the teacher to enter the schoolroom if tardy. 
“Go back home and get mother to write an excuse” would be 
good policy if by so doing the child might escape the danger of 
incurring an extreme penalty. When teachers inflict absurd pen- 
alties for unexcused tardiness, it is the part of wisdom for children 
to incur no risks! When such a response is given, it is well to in- 
quire into the school’s method of dealing with tardiness and to 
score the response accordingly. 
Unsatisfactory. “Go to the principal.” “Tell the teacher I 
could n’t help it.” “Have to get an excuse.”’ “Go to school any- 
way.” “Get punished.” “Not do it again.” “Not play hooky.” 
“Start earlier next time,” etc. 
Lack of success results oftenest from failure to get the exact 
shade of meaning conveyed by the question. It is implied, of 
course, that something is to be done at once to avoid tardiness; 
but the subject of dull comprehension may suggest a suitable 
thing to do in case tardiness has been incurred. Hence the re- 
sponse, “I would go to the principal and explain.” Answers of 
this type are always unsatisfactory. 
Question ¢ (Playmate hits you) 
Satisfactory responses are only those which suggest either excus- 
ing or overlooking the act. These ideas are variously expressed as
-P-A-G-E-237
  
TEST NO. VIII, 4 217 
follows: “I would excuse him” (about half of all the correct an- 
swers). “I would say ‘yes’ if he asked my pardon.” “TI would say 
it was all right.” “I would take it for a joke.” “I would just be 
nice to him.” “I would go right on playing.” “I would take it 
kind-hearted.” “I would not fight or run and tell on him.” “TI 
would not blame him for it.” ‘Ask him to be more careful,” ete. 
Unsatisfactory responses are all those not of the above two types; 
as: “I would hit them back.” “I would not hit them back, but I 
would get even some other way.” “Tell them not to do it again.” 
“Tell them to ‘cut it out.’” “Tell him it’s a wrong thing to do.” 
“Make him excuse himself.” ‘‘ Make him say he’s sorry.” “Would 
not play with him.” “Tell my mamma.” “I would ask him why 
he did it.” “He ’d say ‘excuse me’ and I ’d say ‘thank you.’” 
“He should excuse me.” “He is supposed to say ‘excuse me.’” 
Remarks. All three comprehension questions of this year 
were used by Binet, Goddard, Huey, and others in year X; 
two of them in the “ easy series” and one in the “ hard 
series.” The Stanford data show that they belong at the 
8-year level on the standard of scoring above set forth. 
The three differ little among themselves in difficulty, 
but all of them are decidedly easier than the other five 
used by Binet. It would be absurd to go on using the com- 
prehension questions as Binet bunched them, eight together, 
ranging in difficulty from one which is easy enough for 6- 
year intelligence (“ What ’s the thing to do if you miss your 
train? ’’) to one which is hard for the 12-year level (“‘ Why 
is a bad act done when one is angry more excusable than 
the same act done when one is not angry? ”’). 
VIII, 4. Giving similarities; two things 
Procedure. Say to the child: “J am going to name two 
things which are alike in some way, and I want you to tell me 
how they are alike. Wood and coal: in what way are they 
alike?” Proceed in the same manner with: —  
-P-A-G-E-238
  218 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
An apple and a peach. 
Iron and silver. 
A ship and an automobile. 
After the first pair the formula may be abbreviated to 
“In what way are...and... alike?” It is often 
necessary to insist a little if the child is silent or says he 
does not know, but in doing this we must avoid supplemen- 
tary questions and suggestions. In giving the first pair, 
for example, it would not be permissible to ask such addi- 
tional questions as, “ What do you use wood for? What do 
you ‘use coal for? And now, how are wood and coal alike?” 
This is really putting the answer in the child’s mouth. It 
is only permissible to repeat the original question in a per- 
suasive tone of voice, and perhaps to add: “I’m sure you 
can tell me how... and... are alike,” or something to 
that effect. 
A very common mistake which the child makes is to give 
differences instead of similarities. This tendency is particu- 
larly strong if test 5, year VII (giving differences), has 
been given earlier in the sitting, but it happens often enough 
in other cases also to suggest that finding differences is, to 
a much greater extent than finding similarities, the child’s 
preferred method of making a comparison. When a dif- 
ference is given, instead of a similarity, we say: “No, 
I want you to tell me how they are alike. In what way are 
. and... alike?” Unless the child is of rather low 
intelligence level this is sufficient, but the mentally retarded 
sometimes continue to give differences persistently in 
spite of repeated admonitions, or if they cease to do so for 
one or two comparisons, they are likely to repeat the mis- 
take in the latter part of the test. 
Scoring. The test is passed if a likeness is given in two 
out of four comparisons. We accept as satisfactory any real 
likeness, whether fundamental or superficial, though, of
-P-A-G-E-239
  TEST NO. VII, 4 219 
course, the more essential the resemblance, the better indica- 
tion it is of intelligence. The following are samples of satis- 
factory and unsatisfactory answers: — ! 
(a) Wood and coal 
Satisfactory. “Both burn.” “Both keep you warm.” “Both 
are used for fuel.” “Both are vegetable matter.” “‘Both come 
from the ground.” “Can use them both for running engines.” 
“Both hard.” “Both heavy.” “Both cost money.” 
Of 80 correct answers, 64, or 80 per cent, referred in one way or 
another to combustibility. 
Unsatisfactory. Most frequent is the persistent giving of a dif- 
ference instead of a similarity. This accounts for a little over half 
of all the failures. About half of the remainder are cases of in- 
ability to give any response. Incorrect statements with regard to 
color are rather common. Sample failures of this type are: “Both 
are black,” or “Both the same color.” Other failures are: “Both 
are dirty on the outside;” “You can’t break them;” “Coal burns 
better;” “Wood is lighter than coal,” etc. 
(b) An apple and a peach 
Satisfactory. “Both are round.” “Both the same shape.” 
“They are about the same color.” “Both nearly always have 
some red on them.” “Both good to eat.” “Can make pies of both 
of them.” “Both can be cooked.” “Both mellow when they are 
ripe.” “Both have a stem” (or seeds, skin, etc.). ‘Both come 
from trees.” ‘‘Can be dried in the same way.”’ “Both are fruits.” 
“Both green (in color) when they are not ripe.” 
Of 82 correct answers, 25 per cent mention color; 25 per cent, 
form; 22 per cent, edibility; 20 per cent, having stem, seed, or skin; 
and 5 per cent, that both grow on trees. 
Unsatisfactory. ‘‘Both taste the same.” “Both have a lot of 
seeds.” “Both have a fuzzy skin.” “An apple is bigger than a 
peach.” ‘One is red and one is white,” etc. 
Again, over 50 per cent of the failures are due to giving differ- 
ences, and about 18 per cent to silence.

writer is indebted to Miss Grace Lyman.
-P-A-G-E-240
  220 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
(c) Iron and silver 
Satisfactory. “Both are metals” (or mineral). ‘Both come out 
of the ground.” “Both cost money.” “Both are heavy.” “Both 
are hard.” “Both can be melted.” “Both can be bent.” “Both 
used for utensils.” ‘‘ You manufacture things out of both of them.” 
“Both can be polished.” 
These are named most frequently in the following order: 
(1) hardness, (2) origin from the ground, (3) heaviness, (4) use in 
making things. 
Unsatisfactory. “Both thin” (or thick). “Sometimes they are 
the same shape.” “Both the same color.” “A little silver and lots 
of iron weigh the same.” “Both made by the same company.” 
“They rust the same.” ‘You can’t eat them” (!) 1 
Of 60 failures, 32 were due to giving differences and 14 to silence 
or unwillingness to hazard a reply. 
(d) A ship and an automobile 
Satisfactory. “Both means of travel.” “Both go.” ‘You ride 
in them.” “Both take you fast.” “They both use fuel.” “Both 
run by machinery.” “‘ Both have a steering gear.” ‘‘ Both have en- 
gines in them.” “Both have wood in them.” “Both can be 
wrecked.” “Both break if they hit a rock.” 
About 45 per cent of the answers are in terms of running or 
travel, 37 per cent in terms of machinery or structure, the rest scat- 
tered. 
Unsatisfactory. “Both black” (or some other color). “Both 
very big.” “They are made alike.” “Both run on wheels.” “Ship 
is for the water and automobile for the land.” “Ship goes on water 
and an automobile sometimes goes in water.” “An auto can go 
faster.” “Ship is run by coal and automobile by gasoline.” 
Of 51 failures, 32 were due to giving differences and 14 to failure 
to reply. 
Remarks. The test of finding similarities was first used 
by Binet in 1905. Our results show that it is fully as satis- 
factory as the test of giving differences. The test reveals in 
1 One is here reminded of the puzzling conundrum, “Why is a brick 
like an elephant?” The answer being, “ Because neither can climb a tree!” 
A response of this type states a fact, but because of its bizarre nature 
should hardly be counted satisfactory.
-P-A-G-E-241
TEST NO. VUI, 5 221 
a most interesting way one of the fundamental weaknesses 
of the feeble mind. Young normal children, say of 7 or 8 
years, often fail to pass, but it is the feeble-minded who 
give the greatest number of absurd answers and who also 
find greatest difficulty in resisting the tendency to give 
differences.1 
VIII, 5. Giving definitions superior to use 
Procedure. The words for this year are balloon, tiger, 
football, and soldier. Ask simply: “‘ What is a balloon?” 
etc. 
If it appears that any of the words are not familiar to 
the child, substitution may be made from the following: 
automobile, battle-ship, potato, store. 
Make no comments on the responses until all the words 
have been given. In case of silence or hesitation in answer- 
ing, the question may be repeated with a little encourage- 
ment; but supplementary questions are never in order, 
Ordinarily there is no difficulty in securing a response to 
the definition test of this year. The trouble comes in seor- 
ing the response. 
Scoring. The test is passed if two of the four words are 
defined in terms superior to use. “‘ Superior to use” in- 
cludes chiefly: (a) Definitions which describe the object 
or tell something of its nature (form, size, color, appearance, 
etc.); (b) definitions which give the substance or the ma- 
terials or parts composing it; and (c) those which tell what 
class the object belongs to or what relation it bears to other 
classes of objects. 
It is possible to distinguish different grades of definitions 
in each of the above classes. A definition by description 
(type a) may be brief and partial, mentioning only one or 
1 For further discussion of the processes involved, see VII, 5.  
-P-A-G-E-242
  222 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
two qualities or characteristics, or it may be relatively 
rich and complete. Likewise with definitions of type }. 
Classificatory definitions (type c) are of particularly un. 
even value, the lowest order being those which subsume 
the object to be defined under a remote class and give few 
if any characteristics to distinguish it from other members 
of the same class; as, for example, “ A football is a thing 
you can have fun with,” or, “‘ A soldier is a person.” The 
best classificatory definitions are those which subsume the 
object under the next higher class and give the more es- 
sential traits (perhaps a number of them) which distinguish 
the object from others of the class named; as, for example, 
“A tiger is a large animal like a cat; it lives in the jungle and 
eats men and other animals,” or, “ A soldier is a man who 
goes to war.’”’ These shades of distinction give interesting 
and valuable clues to the maturity and richness of the ap- 
perceptive processes, but for purposes of scoring it is neces- 
sary merely to decide whether the definition is given in 
terms superior to use. 
The following are samples of satisfactory definitions, 
those for each word being arranged roughly in the order of 
their value from excellent to barely passing: — ‘ 
(a) Balloon 
Satisfactory. “A balloon is a means of traveling through the air.”” 
“Tt is a kind of airship, made of cloth and filled with air so it can 
go up.” “It is big and made of cloth. It has gas in it and carries 
people up in a basket that’s fastened on to the bottom.” “It is a 
thing you hold by a string and it goes up.” “It is like a big bag 
with air in it.” “It is a big thing that goes up.” 
Unsatisfactory. “To go up in the air.” “What you go up in.” 
“When you go up.” “‘They go up in it.” “It’s full of gas.” “To 
carry you up.” “A balloon is a balloon,” etc. “It is big.” “They 
go up,” etc.
-P-A-G-E-243
TEST NO. VIII, 5 223 
(6) Tiger 
Satisfactory. “It is a wild animal of the cat family.” “It is an 
animal that’s a cousin to the lion.” “It is an animal that lives in 
the jungle.” “It is a wild animal.” “It looks like a big cat.” “It 
lives in the woods and eats flesh.”’ “Something that eats people.” 
Unsatisfactory. “To eat you up.” “To kill people.” “To travel 
in the circus.’ “What eats people.” “It is a tiger,” ete. “You 
run from it,”’ ete.    (c) Football 
Satisfactory. “It is a leather bag filled with air and made for 
kicking.” “It is a ball you kick.” “It is a thing you play with.” 
“Tt is made of leather and is stuffed with air.” “It is a thing you 
kick.” “It is brown and filled with air.” “It is a thing shaped 
like a watermelon.” 
Unsatisfactory: ‘To kick.” “To play with.” ‘What they play 
with.” “Boys play with it.” “It’s filled with air.” “It is a foot- 
ball.” “It is a basket ball.” “It is round.” “You kick it.” 
(d) Soldier 
Satisfactory. ““A man who goes to war.” “A brave man.” “A 
man that walks up and down and carries a gun.”” “It is a man who 
minds his captain and stands still and walks straight.” “It is a 
man who goes to war and shoots.” “It isa man who stands straight 
and marches.” 
Unsatisfactory. “To shoot.” “To go to war.” “It is a soldier.” 
“A soldier that marches.” “He fights.” ‘He shoots.” “What 
fights,” etc. “When you march and shoot.” 
Silence accounts for only a small proportion of the fail- 
ures with children of 8, 9, and 10 years. 
Remarks. The “ use definitions ” sometimes given at this 
age are usually of slightly better quality than those given 
in year V. Younger children more often use the infinitive 
form, “ to play with” (doll), “ to drive ” (horse), “ to eat 
on” (table), etc. Use definitions of this year more often 
begin with “they,” or “ what”; as, “they go up in it ” 
(balloon), “ they kick it ” (football), ete. 
Why, it may be asked, is the use definition regarded as 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  
  224 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
inferior to the descriptive or the classificatory definition? 
Is not the use to which an object may be put the most es- 
sential thing about it, for the child at least? Is it not more 
important to know that a fork is to eat with than to be 
able to name the material it is made of? Is not the use pri- 
mary and does it not determine most of the physical charac- 
teristics of the object? 
The above questions may sound reasonable, but they are 
based on poor psychology. We must rest our case upon the 
facts. The first lesson which the student of child psychology 
must learn is that it is unsafe to set up criteria of intelli- 
gence, of maturity, or of any other mental trait on the basis 
of theoretical considerations. Experiment teaches that nor- 
mal children of 5 or 6 years, also older feeble-minded persons 
of the 5-year intelligence level, define objects in terms of 
use; also that normal children of 8 or 9 years and older 
feeble-minded persons of this mental level have for the 
most part developed beyond the stage of use definitions 
into the descriptive or classificatory stage. An ounce of 
fact is worth a ton of theory. 
The test has usually been located in year IX, with the 
requirement of three successes out of five trials and with 
somewhat more rigid scoring of the individual definitions. 
When only two successes are required in four trials, and 
when scored leniently, the test belongs at the 8-year level. 
VII, 6. Vocabulary; twenty definitions, 3600 words 
Procedure. Use the list of words given in the record 
booklet. Say to the child: “ I want to find out how many 
words you know. Listen; and when I say a word you tell 
me what it means.” If the child can read, give him a printed 
copy of the word list and let him look at each word as you 
pronounce it.
-P-A-G-E-245
  
TEST NO. VIII, 6 225 
The words are arranged approximately (though not 
exactly) in the order of their difficulty, and it is best to 
begin with the easier words and proceed to the harder. 
With children under 9 or 10 years, begin with the first. 
Apparently normal children of 10 years may safely be cred- 
ited with the first ten words without being asked to define 
them. Apparently normal children of 12 may begin with 
word 16, and 15-year-olds with word 21. Except with sub- 
jects of almost adult intelligence there is no need to give 
the last ten or fifteen words, as these are almost never cor- 
rectly defined by school children. A safe rule to follow is to 
continue until eight or ten successive words have been missed 
and to score the remainder minus without giving them. 
The formula is as follows: “ What is an orange?” 
“What is a bonfire?” “ Roar; what does roar mean?” 
“Gown; what is a gown?” “ What does tap mean?” 
“What does scorch mean?” ‘ What is a puddle?” ete. 
Some children at first show a little hesitation about an- 
swering, thinking that a strictly formal definition is ex- 
pected. In such cases a little encouragement is necessary; 
as: ‘© You know what a bonfire is. You have seen a bonfire. 
Now, what is a bonfire?” If the child still hesitates, say: 
“ Just tell me in your own words; say it any way you please. 
All I want is to find out whether you know what a bonfire 
is.” Do not torture the child, however, by undue insist- 
ence. If he persists in his refusal to define a word which 
he would ordinarily be expected to know, it is better to 
pass on to the next one and to return to the troublesome 
word later. Above all, avoid helping the child by illustrat- 
ing the use of a word in a sentence. Adhere strictly to the 
formula given above. If the definition as given does not 
make it clear whether the child has the correct idea, say: 
“ Explain,” or, “I don’t understand; explain what you 
mean.”  
-P-A-G-E-246
  226 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Encourage the child frequently by saying: “ That ’s 
fine. You are doing beautifully. You know lots of words,” 
etc. Never tell the child his definition is not correct, and 
never ask for a different definition. 
Avoid saying anything which would suggest a model 
form of definition, as the type of definition which the child 
spontaneously chooses throws interesting light on the degree 
of maturity of the apperceptive processes. Record all 
definitions verbatim if possible, or at least those which 
are exceptionally good, poor, or doubtful. 
Scoring. Credit a response in full if it gives one correct 
meaning for the word, regardless of whether that meaning 
is the most common one, and regardless of whether it is 
the original or a derived meaning. Occasionally half credit 
may be given, but this should be avoided as far as possible. 
To find the entire vocabulary, multiply the number of 
words known by 180. (This list is made up of 100 words 
selected by rule from a dictionary containing 18,000 words.) 
Thus, the child who defines 20 words correctly has a vocabu- 
lary of 20 X 180 = 3600 words; 50 correct definitions would 
mean a vocabulary of 9000 words, ete. The following are 
the standards for different years, as determined by the 
vocabulary reached by 60 to 65 per cent of the subjects of 
the various mental levels: —

Superior adult ..... 75 words . vocabulary 13,500 
Although the form of the definition § is significant, it is 
not taken into consideration in scoring. The test is in- 
tended to explore the range of ideas rather than the evolu- 
tion of thought forms. When it is evident that the child 
has one fairly correct meaning for a word, he is given full
-P-A-G-E-247
  
TEST NO. VIII, 6 227 
credit for it, however poorly the definition may have been 
stated. 
While there is naturally some difficulty now and then in 
deciding whether a given definition is correct, this hap- 
pens much less frequently than one would expect. In order 
to get a definite idea of the extent of error due to the in- 
dividual differences among examiners, we have had the 
definitions of 25 subjects graded independently by 10 dif- 
ferent persons. The result showed an average difference 
below 3 in the number of definitions scored plus. Since 
these subjects attempted on an average about 60 words, 
the average number of doubtful definitions per subject was 
Selow 5 per cent of the number attempted. 
An idea of the degree of leniency to be exercised may be 
had from the following examples of definitions, which are 
mostly of low grade, but acceptable unless otherwise indi- 
cated: — 
1. Orange. “An orange is to eat.” “It is yellow and grows on a 
tree.” (Both full credit.) 
2. Bonfire. “You burn it outdoors.” “You burn some leaves 
or things.” “It’s a big fire.” (All full credit.) 
8. Roar. “A lion roars.” ‘You holler loud.” (Full credit.) 
4. Gown. “To sleep in.” “It’s a nightie.” “It’s a nice gown 
that ladies wear.” (All full credit.) 
7. Puddle. “You splash in it.” “It’s just a puddle of water.” 
(Both full credit.) 
9. Straw. “It grows in the field.” “It means wheat-straw.” 
“The horses eat it.” (All full credit.) 
10. Rule. “The teacher makes rules.” “It means you can’t do 
something.” “You make marks with it,” ie., a ruler, often 
called a rule by school children. (All full credit.) 
11. Afloat. “To float on the water.” “A ship floats.” (Both full 
credit.) 
12. Eyelash. If the child says, “It’s over the eye,” tell him to 
point to it, as often the word is confused with eyebrow. 
14. Copper, “It’s a penny.” “It means some copper wire.” 
(Both full credit.)

strong.” (Both full credit.) 
17. Guitar. “You play on it.” (Full credit.)

what kind of apple that would be. For full credit the answer 
must be “soft,” “mushy,” etc. 
19. Pork. If the answer is “meat,” ask what animal it comes 
from. Half credit if wrong animal is named. 
21. Plumbing. “You fix pipes.” (Full credit.)

California,” say: “Yes; but what does ‘southern’ mean?” 
Do not credit unless explanation is forthcoming. 
26. Noticeable. “You notice a thing.” (Full credit.) 
29, Civil. “Civil War.” (Failure unless explained.) “It means

“Lots of money,” etc.; i.e., if the word is confused with 
treasure.

  TEST NO. VHI, 6 229 
It is seen from the above examples that a very liberal 
standard has been used. Leniency in judging definitions is 
necessary because the child’s power of expression lags far- 
ther behind his understanding than is true of adults, and 
also because for the young subject the word has a rela- 
tively less unitary existence. 
Remarks. Our vocabulary test was derived by selecting 
the last word of every sixth column in a dictionary con- 
taining approximately 18,000 words, presumably the 18,- 
000 most common words in the language. The test is based 
on the assumption that 100 words selected according to 
some arbitrary rule will be a large enough sampling to 
afford a fairly reliable index of a subject’s entire vocabu- 
lary. Rather extensive experimentation with this list and 
others chosen in a similar manner has proved that the 
assumption is justified. Tests of the same 75 individuals 
with five different vocabulary tests of this type showed 
that the average difference between two tests of the same 
person was less than 5 per cent. This means that any one 
of the five tests used is reliable enough for all practical 
purposes. It is of no special importance that a given child’s 
vocabulary is 8000 rather than 7600; the significance 
lies in the fact that it is approximately 8000 and not 4000, 
12,000, or some other widely different number. 
It may seem to the reader almost incredible that so small 
a sampling of words would give a reliable index of an 
individual’s vocabulary. That it does so is due to the opera- 
tion of the ordinary laws of chance. It is analogous to pre- 
dicting the results of an election when only a small propor- 
tion of the ballots have been counted. If it is known that a 
ballot box contains 600 votes, and if when only 30 have 
been counted it is found that they are divided between two 
candidates in the proportion of 20 and 10, it is safe to pre- 
dict that a complete count will give the two candidates
-P-A-G-E-250
230 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
approximately 400 and 200 respectively.1 In 1914 about 
1,000,000 votes were cast for governor in California, and 
when only 10,000 votes had been counted, or a hundredth 
of all, it was announced and conceded that Governor John- 
son had been reélected by about 150,000 plurality. The 
completed count gave him 188,505 plurality. The error 
was less than 4 per cent of the total vote. 
The vocabulary test has a far higher value than any 
other single test of the scale. Used with children of English- 
speaking parents (with children whose home language is 
not English it is of course unreliable), it probably has a 
higher value than any three other tests in the scale. Our 
statistics show that in a large majority of cases the vo- 
cabulary test alone will give us an intelligence quotient 
within 10 per cent of that secured by the entire scale. Out 
of hundreds of English-speaking children we have not 
found one testing significantly above age who had a signifi- 
cantly low vocabulary; and correspondingly, those who 
test much below age never have a high vocabulary. 
Occasionally, however, a subject tests somewhat higher 
or lower in vocabulary than the mental age would lead us 
to expect. This is often the case with dull children in cul- 
tured homes and with very intelligent children whose home 
environment has not stimulated language development. 
But even in these cases we are not seriously misled, for the 
dull child of fortunate home surroundings shows his dullness 
in the quality of his definitions if not in their quantity; 
while the bright child of illiterate parents shows his intelli- 
gence in the aptness and accuracy of his definitions. 
We have not worked out a satisfactory method of scor- 
ing the quality of definitions in our vocabulary test, but 
these differences will be readily observed by the trained 
examiner. Definitions in terms of use and definitions which

TEST NO. VII, ALTERNATIVE 2 231 
are slightly inaccurate or hazy are quite characteristic of 
the lower mental ages. Children of the lower mental age 
have also a tendency to venture wild guesses at words 
they do not know. This is especially characteristic of re- 
tarded subjects and is another example of their weakness of 
auto-criticism. One feeble-minded boy of 12 years, with a 
mental age of 8 years, glibly and confidently gave defini- 
tions for every one of the hundred words. About 70 of the 
definitions were pure nonsense. 
This vocabulary test was arranged and partially stand- 
ardized by Mr. H. G. Childs and the writer in 1911. Many 
experiments since then have proved its value as a test of 
intelligence. 
VIII, Alternative test 1: naming six coins 
Procedure is exactly as in VI, 5 (naming four coins). 
The dollar should be shown before the half-dollar. 
Scoring. All six coins must be correctly named. If a re- 
sponse is changed the rule is to count the second answer 
and ignore the first. 
Remarks. Binet used nine pieces and required knowledge 
of all at year X (1908), but at year IX in the 1911 revi- 
sion. Most other workers have used the same method, 
with the test located in either year IX or year X. 
VIII, Alternative test 2: writing from dictation 
Procedure. Give the child pen, ink, and paper, place 
him in a comfortable position for writing, and say: “ J 
want you to write something for me as nicely as you can. 
Write these words: ‘ See the little boy.’ Be sure to write it 
all: ‘ See the little boy.’” 
Do not dictate the words separately, but give the sen- 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  232 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
tence as a whole. Further repetition of the sentence is not 
permissible, as ability to remember what has been dictated 
is a part of the test. Copy, of course, must not be shown. 
Scoring. Passed if the sentence is written legibly enough 
to be easily recognized, and if no word has been omitted. 
Ordinary mistakes of spelling are disregarded. The rule is 
that the mistake in spelling must not mutilate the word 
beyond easy recognition. The performance may be graded 
by the use of Thorndike’s handwriting scale. The hand- 
writing of 8-year-old children who have been in school not 
less than one year or more than two usually falls between 
quality 7 and quality 9 on this scale, but we shall, perhaps, 
not be too liberal if we consider a performance satisfactory 
which does not grade below quality 6, provided it is not 
seriously mutilated by errors, omissions, etc.! 
Remarks. This test found a place in year VIII of Binet’s 
1908 scale, but has been omitted from all the other re- 
visions, including Binet’s own. Bobertag did not even 
regard the test as worthy of a trial. The universal criticism 
has been that it is a test of schooling rather than of intelli- 
gence. That the performance depends, in a certain sense, 
upon special instruction is self-evident. Without such 
instruction no child of 8 years, however intelligent, would 
be able to pass the test. Nature does not give us a conven- 
tionalized language, either written or spoken. It must be 
acquired. It is also true that a high-grade feeble-minded 
child, say 8 years of age and of 6-year intelligence, is some- 
times (though not always) able to pass the test after two 
years of school instruction. It is exceedingly improbable, 
however, that a feeble-minded subject with less than 6- 
year intelligence will ever be able to pass this test, how- 
ever long he remains in school. 
1 See scoring card for samples of satisfactory and unsatisfactory per- 
formances.
-P-A-G-E-253
  TEST NO. VIII, ALTERNATIVE 2 233 
The conclusions to be drawn from these facts are as fol- 
lows: (1) Inability to pass the test should not be counted 
against the child unless it is known that he has had at least 
a full year of the usual school instruction. (2) Ability to 
pass the test after only two years of school instruction is 
almost certain proof that the child has reached a mental 
level of at least 6 years. (3) Failure to pass the test must 
be regarded as a grave symptom in the case of the child 9 
or more years of age who is known to have attended school 
as much as two years. (4) For mental levels higher than 8 
years the test has hardly any diagnostic value, since feeble- 
minded persons of 8- or 9-year intelligence can usually be 
taught to write quite legibly. 
Tf the limitations above set forth are kept in mind, the 
test is by no means without value, and is always worth 
giving as a supplementary test. Learning to write simple 
sentences from dictation is no mean accomplishment. It 
demands, in the first place, a fairly complete mastery of 
rather difficult muscular codrdinations. Moreover, these 
codrdinations must be firmly associated with the corre- 
sponding letters and words, for if the writing codrdinations 
are not fairly automatic, so much attention will be required 
to carry them out that the child will not be able to remember 
what he has been told to write. The necessity of remem- 
bering the passage acts as a distraction, and writing from 
dictation is therefore a more difficult task than writing 
from copy.  
-P-A-G-E-254
  CHAPTER XV 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR IX 
IX, 1. Giving the date 
Procedure. Ask the following questions in order: — 
(a) “What day of the week is it to-day?” 
(b) “What month is it?” (c) “What day of the month is it?” 
(d) “What year is it?” 
If the child misunderstands and gives the day of the 
month for the day of the week, or vice versa, we merely re- 
peat the question with suitable emphasis, but give no other 
help. 
Scoring. An error of three days in either direction is al- 
lowed for c, but a, b, and d must all be given correctly. If 
the child makes an error and spontaneously corrects it, the 
change is allowed, but corrections must not be called for or 
suggested. 
Remarks. Binet originally located this test in year IX, 
but unfortunately moved it to year VIII in the 1911 re- 
vision. Kuhlmann, Goddard, and Huey all retain it in year 
IX, where, according to our own data, it unquestionably 
belongs. With the exception of Binet’s 1911 results, the 
statistics for the test are in remarkably close agreement 
for children in France, Germany, England, and Eastern 
and Western United States. It seems that practically 
all children in civilized countries have ample opportunity 
to learn the divisions of the year, month, and week, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
  TEST NO. IX, 1 885 
to become oriented with respect to these divisions. Special 
instruction is doubtless capable of hastening time orienta- 
tion to a certain degree, but not greatly. Binet tells of a 
French école maternelle attended by children 4 to 6 years 
of age, where instruction was given daily in regard to the 
date, and yet not a single one of the children was able to 
pass this test. This is a beautiful illustration of the futility 
of precocious teaching. In spite of well-meant instruction, 
it is not until the age of 8 or 9 years that children have 
enough comprehension of time periods, and sufficient in- 
terest in them, to keep very close track of the date. Fail- 
ure to pass the test at the age of 10 or 11 years is a decidedly 
unfavorable sign, unless the error is very slight. 
The fact that normal adults are occasionally unable to 
give the day of the month is no argument against the valid- 
ity of the test, since the system of tests is so constructed 
as to allow for accidental failures on any particular test. 
As a matter of fact, very nearly 100 per cent of normal 12- 
year-old children pass this test. 
The unavoidable fault of the test is its lack of uniform- 
ity in difficulty at different dates. It is easier for school 
children to give the day of the week on Monday or Friday 
than on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Mistakes in 
giving the day of the month are less likely to occur at the 
beginning or end of the month than at any other time, 
while mistakes in naming the month are most likely to 
occur then. 
It is interesting to compare the four parts of this test in 
regard to difficulty. Binet and Bobertag both state that 
ability to name the year comes last, but they give no 
figures. Our own data show that the four parts of the test 
are of almost exactly the same difficulty and that this is 
true at all ages. 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
    236 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
IX, 2. Arranging five weights 
Use the five weights, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 grams. Be sure 
that the weights are identical in appearance. The weights 
may be made as described under V, 1, or they may be pur- 
chased of C. H. Stoelting & Co., Chicago, Illinois. If no 
weights are at hand one of the alternative tests may be 
substituted. 
Procedure. Place the five boxes on the table in an ir- 
regular group before the child and say: “ See these boxes. 
They all look alike, don’t they? But they are not alike. Some 
of them are heavy, some are not quite so heavy, and some are 
still lighter. No two weigh the same. Now, I want you to 
find the heaviest one and place it here. Then find the one that 
is just a little lighter and put it here. Then put the neat 
lighter one here, and the next lighter one here, and the lightest 
of all at this end (pointing each time at the appropriate 
spot). Do you understand ?”” Whatever the child answers, 
in order to make sure that he does understand, we repeat 
the instructions thus: “ Remember now, that no two weights 
are the same. Find the heaviest one and put it here, the next 
heaviest here, and lighter, lighter, until you have the very 
lightest here. Ready; go ahead.” 
It is best to follow very closely the formula here given, 
otherwise there is danger of stating the directions so ab- 
stractly that the subject could not comprehend them. A 
formula like “J want you to arrange the blocks in a gradually 
decreasing series according to weight ” would be Greek to 
most children of 10 years. 
If the subject still seems at a loss to know what to do, 
the instructions may be again repeated. But no further 
help of any kind may be given. Do not tell the subject 
to take the blocks one at a time in the hand and try 
them, and do not illustrate by hefting the blocks your-
-P-A-G-E-257
  
TEST NO. IX, 2 237 
self. It is a part of the test to let the subject find his own 
method. 
Give three trials, shuffling the boxes after each. Do not 
repeat the instructions before the second and third trials 
unless the subject has used an absurd procedure in the 
previous trial. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the blocks are arranged in 
the correct order twice out of three trials. Always record 
the order of arrangement and note the number and extent 
of displacement. Obviously an arrangement like 12-6- 
15-3-9 is very much more serious than one like 15—12-6- 
9-3, but we require that two trials be absolutely without 
error. 
Scoring is facilitated if the blocks are marked on the 
bottom so that they may be easily identified. It is then 
necessary to exercise some care to see that the subject does 
not examine the bottom of the blocks for a clue as to the 
correct order. 
Remarks. Binet originally located this test in year IX, 
but in his 1911 revision changed it to year VIII. Other 
revisions have retained it in year IX. The correct location 
depends upon the weights used and upon the procedure 
and scoring. Kuhlmann uses weights of 3, 9, 18, 27, 36, 
and 45 grams, and this probably makes the test easier. 
Bobertag tried two sets of boxes, one set being of larger 
dimensions than the other. The larger gave decidedly the 
more errors. If we require only one success in three trials 
the test could be located a year or two lower in the scale, 
while three successes as a standard would require that it 
be moved upward possibly as much as two years. 
Much depends also on whether the child is left to find 
his own method, and on this there has been much difference 
of procedure. Kuhlmann, Bobertag, and Wallin illustrate 
the correct method of making the comparison by first heft-  
-P-A-G-E-258
  
288 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
ing and arranging the weights while the subject looks on. 
We prefer to keep the test in its original form, and with the 
procedure and scoring we have used it is well located in 
year IX. 
Wallin carries his assistance still further by saying, after 
the first block has been placed, “‘ Now, find the heaviest of 
the four,” and after the second has been placed, “ Now, 
find the heaviest of the three,” etc. Finally, when the ar- 
rangement has been made, he tells the subject to try them 
again to make sure the order is correct, allowing the sub- 
ject to make whatever changes he thinks necessary. This 
procedure robs the test of its most valuable features. The 
experiment was not devised primarily as a test of sensory 
discrimination, for it has long been recognized that in- 
dividuals who have developed as far as the 9- or 10-year 
level of intelligence are ordinarily but little below normal 
in sensory capacity. 
Psychologically, the test resembles that of comparing 
weights in V, 1. Success depends, in the first place, upon 
the correct comprehension of the task and the setting of a 
goal to be attained; secondly, upon the choice of a suitable 
method for realizing the goal; and finally, upon the ability 
to keep the end clearly in consciousness until all the steps 
necessary for its attainment have been gone through. 
Elementary as are the processes involved, they represent 
the prototype of all purposeful behavior. The statesman, 
the lawyer, the teacher, the physician, the carpenter, all 
in their own way and with their own materials, are con- 
tinually engaged in setting goals, choosing means, and 
inhibiting the multitudinous appeals of irrelevant and dis- 
tracting ideas. 
In this experiment the subject may fail in any one of the 
three requirements of the test or in all of them. (1) He 
may not comprehend the instructions and so be unable to 
 
-P-A-G-E-259
  TEST NO. IX, 2 239 
set the goal. (2) Though understanding what is expected 
of him, he may adopt an absurd method of carrying out the 
task. Or (3) he may lose sight of the end and begin to play 
with the blocks, stacking them on top of one another, build- 
ing trains, tossing them about, etc. Sometimes the guid- 
ing idea is not completely lost, but is weakened or rendered 
only partially operative. In such a case the subject may 
compare some of the blocks carefully, place others with- 
out trying them at all, but continue in his half-rational, 
half-irrational procedure until all the blocks have been 
arranged. 
It is essential, therefore, to supplement the mere record 
of success or failure by jotting down a brief but accurate 
description of the performance. Note any hesitation or in- 
ability to grasp the instructions. Note especially any ab- 
surd procedure, such as placing all the blocks without 
hefting any of them, comparing only some of them, hold- 
ing them up and shaking them, hefting two at once in the 
same hand, etc. The ideal method, of course, is to try all 
the blocks carefully before placing any of them, then to 
make a tentative arrangement, and finally, to correct this 
tentative arrangement by means of individual comparisons. 
A slight departure from this method does not always bring 
failure, but it renders success less probable. As a rule it 
is only the very intelligent children of 10 years who think 
to test out their first arrangement by making a final and 
additional trial of each block in turn. Contrary to what 
might be supposed, success is slightly favored by hefting 
the blocks successively with one hand rather than by 
taking one in each hand for simultaneous comparison, but 
as the child cannot be expected to know this, we must re- 
gard the two methods as equally logical. 
The test of arranging weights has met universal praise. 
Its special advantage is that it tests the subject’s intelli
-P-A-G-E-260
  240 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
gence in the manipulation of things rather than his capacity 
for dealing with abstractions. It tests his ability to do 
something rather than his ability to express himself in 
language. It throws light upon certain factors of motor 
adaptation and practical judgment which play a great 
part in the everyday life of the average human being. 
It depends as little upon school, perhaps, as any other test 
of the scale, and it is readily usable with children of all 
nations without danger of being materially altered in trans- 
lation. Moreover, it is always an interesting test for the 
child. Bobertag goes so far as to say that any 8- or 9-year 
child who passes this test cannot possibly be feeble-minded. 
This may be true; but the converse is hardly the case; that 
is, the failure of older children is by no means certain proof 
of mental retardation. The same observation, however, 
applies equally well to many other of the Binet tests, some 
of which correlate more closely with true mental age than 
this one. A rather considerable fraction of normal 12-year- 
olds fail on it, and it is in fact somewhat less dependable 
than certain other tests if we wish to differentiate between 
9-year and 11-year intelligence. But it is a test we could ill 
afford to eliminate.! 
IX, 3. Making change 
Procedure. Ask the following questions in the order here 
given: — 
(a) “If I were to buy 4 cents worth of candy and should give the 
storekeeper 10 cents, how much money would I get back?” 
(b) “If I bought 12 cents worth and gave the storekeeper 15 cents, 
how much would I get back?” 
(c) “If I bought 4 cents worth and gave the storekeeper 25 cents, 
how much would I get back?” 
1 Compare with V, 1.
-P-A-G-E-261
TEST NO. IX, 3 Al 
Coins are not used, and the subject is not allowed the 
help of pencil and paper. If the subject forgets the state- 
ment of the problem, it is permissible to repeat it once, 
but only once. The response should be made in ten a 
fifteen seconds for each problem. 
Scoring. The test is passed if two out of three problems 
are answered correctly in the allotted time. In case two 
answers are given to a problem, we follow the usual rule of 
counting the second and ignoring the first. 
Remarks. Problems of this nature, when thoroughly 
standardized, are extremely valuable as tests of intelli- 
gence. The difficulty of the test, as we have used it, does 
not lie in the subtraction of 4 from 10, 12 from 15, ete. 
Such subtractions, when given as problems in subtraction, 
are readily solved by practically all normal 8-year-olds who 
have attended school as much as two years. The problems 
of the test have a twofold difficulty: (1) The statement of 
the problem must be comprehended and held in mind until 
the solution has been arrived at; (2) the problem is so stated 
that the subject must himself select the fundamental 
operation which applies. The latter difficulty is somewhat 
the greater of the two, addition sometimes being employed 
instead of subtraction. 
It is just such difficulties as this that prove so perplex- 
ing to the feeble-minded. High-grade defectives, although 
they require more than the usual amount of drill and are 
likely to make occasional errors, are nevertheless capable 
of learning to add, subtract, multiply, and divide fairly 
well. Their main trouble comes in deciding which of these 
operations a given problem calls for. They can master 
routine, but as regards initiative, judgment, and power to 
reason they are little educable. The psychology and peda- 
gogy of mental deficiency is epitomized in this statement. 
There has been little disagreement as to the proper loca-
-P-A-G-E-262
  242 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
tion of the test of making change, but various procedures 
have been employed. Coins have generally been employed, 
in which case the subject is actually allowed to make the 
change. Most other revisions have also given only a single 
problem, usually 4 cents out of 20 cents, or 4 out of 25, or 
9 out of 25. It is evident that these are not all of equal 
difficulty. There is general agreement, however, that normal 
children of 9 years should be able to make simple change.

Say: “‘ You know what a sentence is, of course. A sentence

way. 
Note that the subject is not shown the three words 
written down, and that the reply is to be given orally. 
If the subject does not understand what is wanted, the 
instruction may be repeated, but it is not permissible to 
illustrate what a sentence is by giving one. There must be 
no preliminary practice.

TEST NO. IX, 5 243 
A curious misunderstanding which is sometimes encoun- 
tered comes from assuming that the sentence must be con- 
structed entirely of the three words given. If it appears 
that the subject is stumbling over this difficulty, we ex- 
plain: “ The three words must be put with some other words 
so that all of them together will make a sentence.” 
Nothing is said about hurrying, but if a sentence is not 
given within one minute the rule is to count that part of 
the test a failure and to proceed to the next trio of words. 
Give only one trial for each part of the test. 
Do not specially caution the child to avoid giving more 
than one sentence, as this is implied in the formula used and 
should be understood. 
Scoring. The test is passed if two of the three sentences 
are satisfactory. In order to be satisfactory a sentence 
must fulfill the following requirements: (1) It must either 
be a simple sentence, or, if compound, must not contain 
more than two distinct ideas; and (2) it must not express 
an absurdity. 
Slight changes in one or more of the key words are dis- 
regarded, as river for rivers, etc. 
The scoring is difficult enough to justify rather extensive 
illustration. 
(a) Boy, ball, river 
Satisfactory. An analysis of 128 satisfactory responses gave the 
following classification: — 
(1) Simple sentence containing a simple subject and a simple 
predicate; as: “The boy threw his ball into the river.” 
“The boy lost his ball in the river.” “The boy’s ball fell 
into the river.” “The boy swam into the river after his 
ball,” etc. This group contains 76 per cent of the correct 
responses. 
(2) A sentence with a simple subject and a compound predicate; 
as: “A boy went to the river and took his ball with him.” 
About 8 per cent of all were of this type. 
(8) A complex sentence containing a relative clause (2 per cent  
-P-A-G-E-264
  
244 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
only); as: “The boy ran after his ball which was rodling 
toward the river.” 
(4) A compound sentence containing two independent clauses 
(about 14 per cent); as: “The boy had a ball and he lost it 
in the river.” 
Unsatisfactory. The failures fall into four chief groups: — 
(1) Sentences with three clauses (or else three separate sen- 
tences). 
(2) Sentences containing an absurdity. 
(8) Sentences which omit one of the key words. 
(4) Silence, due ordinarily to inability to comprehend the task. 
Group 1 includes 78 per cent of the failures; group 2, about 12 
per cent; and group 3 and 4 about 5 per cent each. Samples of 
group 1 are: “There was a boy, and he bought a ball, and it fell 
into the river.” “I saw a boy, and he had a ball, and he was play- 
ing by the river.” Illustration of an absurd sentence, “The boy 
was swimming in the river and he was playing ball.” 
(b) Work, money, men 
Satisfactory: — 
(1) Sentence with a simple subject and simple predicate (in- 
cluding 75 per cent of 116 satisfactory responses); as: “Men 
work for their money.” ‘Men get money for their work,” 
ete. 
(2) A complex sentence with a relative clause (12 per cent of 
correct answers); as: “Men who work earn much money.” 
“Tt is easy for men to earn money if they are willing to 
work,” etc. 
(3) A compound sentence with two independent, codrdinate 
clauses (13 per cent) ; as: ‘Men work and they earn money.” 
“Some men have money and they do not work.” 
Unsatisfactory: — 
(1) Three clauses; as: “I know a man and he has money, and 
he works at the store.” 
(2) Sentences which are absurd or meaningless; as: “Men work 
with their money.” 
(3) Omission of one of the words. 
(4) Inability to respond.
-P-A-G-E-265
  TEST NO. IX, 5 WAS 
(c) Desert, rivers, lakes 
Satisfactory: — 
{1) Sentences with a simple subject and a simple predicate 
(including 84 per cent of 126 correct answers); as: “There 
are no rivers or lakes in the desert.” “The desert has one 
river and one lake,”’ ete. 
(2) A complex sentence with a relative clause (only 2 per cent); 
as: “In the desert there was a river which flowed into a 
lake.” 
(3) A compound sentence with two independent, codrdinate 
clauses (11 per cent); as: “‘ We went to the desert, and it had 
no rivers or lakes.” 
(4) A compound, complex sentence (3 per cent of all); as: 
“There was a desert, and near by there was a river that 
emptied into a lake.” 
Unsatisfactory: — 
(1) Sentences with three clauses (40 per cent of all failures); 
as: “A desert is dry, rivers are long, lakes are rough.” 
(2) Sentences containing an absurdity (12 per cent of the fail- 
ures); as: “The desert, river, and lakes are filled with swim- 
ming boys.” “The lake went through the desert and the 
river.” “‘There was a desert and rivers and lakes in the 
forest.” “The desert is full of rivers and lakes.” 
(3) Omission of one of the words (40 per cent of the failures). 
(4) Inability to respond (8 per cent). 
Remarks. The test of constructing a sentence containing 
given words was first used by Masselon and is known as 
“the Masselon experiment.” Meumann, who used it in a 
rather extended experiment,! finds it a good test of intelli- 
gence and a reliable index as to the richness, definiteness, 
and maturity of the associative processes. As Meumann 
shows, it is instructive to study the qualitative differences 
between the responses of bright and dull children, apart 
from questions of sentence structure. These differences are

der Kombinationsmethoden,” in Zeitschrift fiir Pdadagogische Psychologie 
und Experimentelle Pédagogik (1912), pp. 145-63.
-P-A-G-E-266
   
246 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
especially discernible in (a) the logical qualities of the asso- 
ciations, and (6) the definiteness of statement. As regards 
(a), bright children are much more likely to use the given 
words as keystones in the construction of a sentence which 
would be logically suggested by them. For example, 
donkey, blows, suggest some such sentence as, “ The donkey 
receives blows because he is lazy.”’ In like manner we have 
found that the words work, money, men usually suggest 
to the more intelligent children a sentence like “‘ Men work 
for their money ”’ (or “ because they need money,” etc.), 
while the dull child is more likely to give some such sen- 
tence as “‘ The men have work and they don’t have much 
money.” That is, the sentence of the dull child, even 
though correct in structure and free enough from outright 
absurdity to satisfy the standard of scoring which we have 
set forth, is likely to express ideas which are more or less 
nondescript, ideas not logically suggested by the set of 
words given. 
The experiment is one of the many forms of the “ com- 
pletion test,” or “ the combination method.” As we have 
already noted, the power to combine more or less separate 
and isolated elements into a logical whole is one of the most 
essential features of intelligence. The ability to do so in a 
given case depends, in the first place, upon the number and 
logical quality of the associations which have previously 
been made with each of the given elements separately, and 
in the second place, upon the readiness with which these 
ideational stores yield up the particular associations neces- 
sary for weaving the given words into some kind of unity. 
The child must pass from what is given to what is not given 
but merely suggested. This requires a certain amount of 
invention. Scattered fragments must be conceived as the 
skeleton of a thought, and this skeleton, or partial skeleton, 
must be assembled and made whole. The task is analogous
-P-A-G-E-267
TEST NO. IX, 5 247 
to that which confronts the palsontologist, who is able to 
reconstruct, with a high degree of certainty, the entire 
skeleton of an extinct animal from the evidence furnished 
by three or four fragments of bones. It is no wonder, there- 
fore, that subjects whose ideational stores are scanty, and 
whose associations are based upon accidental rather than 
logical connections, find the test one of peculiar difficulty. 
Invention thrives in a different soil. 
Binet located this test in year X. Goddard and Kuhl- 
mann assign it the same location, though their actual statis- 
tics agree closely with our own. Our procedure makes the 
test somewhat easier than that of Binet, who gave only one 
trial and used the somewhat more difficult words Paris, 
river, fortune. Others have generally followed the Binet 
procedure, merely substituting for Paris the name of a 
city better known to the subject. Binet’s requirement of a 
written response also makes the test harder. 
Perhaps the greatest obstacle to uniformity in the use of 
the test comes from the difficulty of scoring, particularly 
in deciding whether the sentence contains enough absurdity 
to disqualify it, and whether it expresses three separate 
ideas or only two. It is hoped that the rather large variety 
of sample responses which we have given will reduce these 
difficulties to a minimum. 
An additional word is necessary in regard to what con- 
stitutes an absurdity in (6). A sentence like “ There are 
some rivers and lakes in the desert ” is not an absurdity in 
certain parts of Western United States. In Professor 
Ordahl’s tests at Reno, Nevada, many children whose in- 
telligence was altogether above suspicion gave this reply. 
The statement is, indeed, perfectly true for the semi-arid 
region in the vicinity of Reno known as “the desert.” 
On the other hand, such sentences as “ The desert is full 
pf rivers and lakes,” or “ There are forty rivers and lakes
-P-A-G-E-268
  248 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
in the desert,” can hardly be considered satisfactory. 
Similar difficulties are presented by (c), though not so fre- 
quently. “‘ Men who work do not have money ” expresses, 
unfortunately, more truth than nonsense. 
IX, 6. Finding rhymes 
Procedure. Say to the child: ‘“‘ You know what a rhyme 
is, of course. A rhyme is a word that sounds like another 
word. Two words rhyme if they end in the same sound. 
Understand ?”’ Whether the child says he understands or 
not, we proceed to illustrate what a rhyme is, as follows: 
“ Take the two words ‘ hat’ and ‘ cat.’ They sound alike and 
so they make a rhyme. ‘ Hat,’ ‘ rat,’ ‘ cat,’ ‘ bat’ all rhyme 
with one another.” 
That is, we first explain what a rhyme is and then we 
give an illustration. A large majority of American children 
who have reached the age of 9 years understand perfectly 
what a rhyme is, without any illustration. A few, however, 
think they understand, but do not; and in order to insure 
that all are given equal advantage it is necessary never to 
omit the illustration. 
After the illustration say: “Now, I am going to give you 
a word and you will have one minute to find as many words 
as you can that rhyme with it. The word is ‘day.’ Name all 
the words you can think of that rhyme with ‘ day.’ ” 
If the child fails with the first word, before giving the 
second we repeat the explanation and give sample rhymes 
for day; otherwise we proceed without further explanation 
to mill and spring, saying, “Now, you have another minute 
to name all the words you can think of that rhyme with ‘ mill,’ ”’ 
etc. Apart from the mention of “ one minute ” say nothing 
to suggest hurrying, as this tends to throw some children 
into mental confusion.
-P-A-G-E-269
TEST NO. IX, 6 249 
Scoring. Passed if in two out of the three parts of the 
experiment the child finds three words which rhyme with 
the word given, the time limit for each series being one 
minute. Note that in each case there must be three words 
in addition to the word given. These must be real words, 
not meaningless syllables or made-up words. However, we 
should be liberal enough to accept such words as ding 
(from “ ding-dong ”) for spring, Jill ( see “ Jack and Jill”) 
for mill, Fay (girl’s name) for day, etc. 
Remarks. At first thought it would seem that the de- 
mands made by this test upon intelligence could not 
be very great. Sound associations between words may be 
contrasted unfavorably with associations like those of 
cause and effect, part to whole, whole to part, opposites, 
etc. But when we pass from a-priori considerations to an 
examination of the actual data, we find that the giving of 
rhymes is closely correlated with general intelligence. 
The 9-year-olds who test at or above 10 years nearly 
always do well in finding rhymes, while 9-year-olds who test 
as low as 8 years seldom pass. When a test thus shows high 
eorrelation with the scale as a whole, we must either accept 
the test as valid or reject the scale altogether. While the 
feeble-minded do not do as well in this test as normal chil- 
dren of corresponding mental age, the percentage of suc- 
cesses for them rises rapidly between mental age 8 and 
mental age 10 or 11. 
Closer psychological analysis of the processes involved 
will show why this is true. To find rhymes for a given 
word means that one must hunt out verbal associations 
under the direction of a guiding idea. Every word has in- 
numerable associations and many of these tend, in greater 
or less degree, to be aroused when the stimulus word is 
given. In order to succeed with the test, however, it is 
necessary to inhibit all associations which are not relevant
-P-A-G-E-270
  250 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
to the desired end. The directing idea must be held se 
firmly in mind that it will really direct the thought asso- 
ciations. Besides acting to inhibit the irrelevant, it mus, 
create a sort of magnetic stress (to borrow a figure from 
physics) which will give dominance to those associative 
tendencies pointing in the right direction. Even the feeble. 
minded child of imbecile grade has in his vocabulary a 
great many words which rhyme with day, mill, and spring. 
He fails on the test because his verbal associations cannot 
be subjugated to the influence of a directing idea. The end 
to be attained does not dominate consciousness sufficiently 
to create more than a faint stress. Instead of a single mag- 
netic pole there is a conflict of forces. The result is either 
chaos or partial success. Mill may suggest hill, and then 
perhaps the directing idea becomes suddenly inoperative 
and the child gives mountain, valley, or some other irrele- 
vant association. The lack of associations, however, is a 
more frequent cause of failure than inability to inhibit the 
irrelevant. 
If any one supposes that finding rhymes does not draw 
upon the higher mental powers, let him try the experiment 
upon himself in various stages of mental efficiency, say at 9 
A.M., when mentally refreshed by a good night of sleep and 
again when fatigued and sleepy. Poets questioned by Galton 
on this point all testified to the greater difficulty of finding 
rhymes when mentally fatigued. In this and in many other 
respects the mental activities of the fatigued or sleepy in- 
dividual approach the type of mentation which is normal 
to the feeble-minded. 
It is important to note that adults make a less favorable 
showing in this test than normal children of corresponding 
mental age, Mr. Knollin’s “ hoboes” of 12-year intelli- 
gence doing hardly as well as school children of 10-year 
intelligence. Those who are habitually employed in school

TEST NO. IX, ALTERNATIVE 1 251 
exercises probably acquire an adeptness in verbal associa- 
tions which is later gradually lost in the preoccupations of 
real life. 
There has been more disagreement as to the proper loca- 
tion of this test than of any other test of the Binet scale. 
Binet placed it in year XII of the 1908 scale, but shifted 
it to year XV in 1911. Kuhlmann retains it in year XII, 
while Goddard drops it down to year XI. However, when 
we examine the actual statistics for normal children we do 
not find very marked disagreement, and such disagreement 
as is present can be largely accounted for by variations 
in procedure and by differing conclusions drawn from 
identical data. In the first place, Binet gave but one trial. 
This, of course, makes the test much harder than when 
three trials are given and only two successes are required. 
To make one trial equal in difficulty to three trials we 
should perhaps need to demand only two rhymes, instead 
of three, in the one trial. In the second place, the word 
used by Binet (obeissance) is much harder than one-syllable 
words like day, mill, and spring. Finally, the wide shift 
of the test from year XII to year XV was not justified 
by the statistics of Binet himself, and the figures of Kuhl- 
mann and Goddard are really in exceptionally close agree- 
ment with our own, notwithstanding the fact that Goddard 
vequired three successes instead of two. In four series of 
tests, considered together, we have found 62 per cent 
passing at year IX, 81 per cent at year X, 83 per cent at 
year XI, and 94 per cent at year XII. 
IX, Alternative test 1: naming the months 
Procedure. Simply ask the subject to “name all the 
months of the year.” Do not start him off by naming one 
month; give no look of approval or disapproval as the  
-P-A-G-E-272
  252 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
months are being named, and make no suggestions or com- 
ments of any kind. 
When the months have been named, we “ check up ” 
the performance by asking: ‘“‘ What month comes before 
April?” “ What month comes before July?” “What 
month comes before November?” 
Scoring. Passed if the months are named in about fifteen 
or twenty seconds with no more than one error of omission 
repetition, or displacement, and if two out of the three 
check questions are answered correctly. Disregard place 
of beginning. 
Remarks. Some are inclined to consider this test of 
little value, because of its supposed dependence on acci- 
dental training. With this opinion we cannot fully agree. 
The arguments already given in favor of the retention of 
naming the days of the week (year VII), apply equally well 
in the present case. It has been shown, however, that age, 
apart from intelligence, does have some effect on the ability 
to name the months. Defective adults of 9-year intelli- 
gence do about as well with it as normal children of 10- 
year intelligence. 
The test appears in year X of Binet’s 1908 scale and in 
year IX of the 1911 revision. Goddard places it correctly 
in year IX, while Kuhlmann and Bobertag have omitted 
it. 
IX, Alternative test 2: counting the value of stamps 
Procedure. Place before the subject a cardboard on which 
are pasted three 1-cent and three 2-cent stamps arranged 
as follows: 111222. Be sure to lay the card so that the 
stamps will be right side up for the child. Say: “ You 
know, of course, how much a stamp like this costs (pointing 
to a l-cent stamp). And you know how much one like this
-P-A-G-E-273
  
TEST NO. IX, ALTERNATIVE 2 253 
costs (pointing to a 2-cent stamp). Now, how much money 
would it take to buy all these stamps? ” 
Do not tell the individual values of the stamps if these 
are not known, for it is a part of the test to ascertain whether 
the child’s spontaneous curiosity has led him to find out 
and remember their values. If the individual values are 
known, but the first answer is wrong, a second trial may 
be given. In such cases, however, it is necessary to be on 
guard against guessing. 
If the child merely names an incorrect sum without saying 
anything to indicate how he arrived at his answer, it is well 
to tell him to figure it up aloud. “ Tell me how you got it.” 
Scoring. Passed if the correct value is given in not over 
fifteen seconds. 
Remarks. The value of this test may be questioned on 
two grounds: (1) That it has an ambiguous significance, 
since failure to pass it may result either from incorrect 
addition or from lack of knowledge of the individual values 
of the stamps; (2) that familiarity with stamps and their 
values is so much a matter of accident and special instruc- 
tion that the test is not fair. 
Both criticisms are in a measure valid. The first, how- 
ever, applies equally well to a great many useful intelli- 
gence tests. In fact, it is only a minority in which success 
depends on but one factor. The other criticism has less 
weight than would at first appear. While it is, of course, 
not impossible for an intelligent child to arrive at the age 
of 9 years without having had reasonable opportunity to 
learn the cost of the common postage stamps, the fact is 
that a large majority have had the opportunity and that 
most of those of normal intelligence have taken advantage 
of it. It is necessary once more to emphasize the fact that 
in its method of locating a test the Binet system makes 
ample allowance for “ accidental ” failures.
-P-A-G-E-274
  254 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Like the tests of naming coins, repeating the names of 
the days of the week or the months of the year, giving 
the date, tying a bow-knot, distinguishing right and left, 
naming the colors, etc., this one also throws light on the 
child’s spontaneous interest in common objects. It is 
mainly the children of deficient intellectual curiosity who 
do not take the trouble to learn these things at some- 
where near the expected age. 
The test was located in year VIII of the Binet scale. 
However, Binet used coins, three single and three double 
sous. Since we do not have either a half-cent or a 2-cent 
coin, it has been necessary to substitute postage stamps. 
This changes the nature of the test and makes it much 
harder. It becomes less a test of ability to do a simple sum, 
and more a test of knowledge as to the value of the stamps 
used. That the test is easy enough for year VIII when it 
can be given in the original form is indicated by all the 
French, German, and English statistics available, but four 
separate series of Stanford tests agree in finding it too 
hard for year VIII when stamps are substituted and the 
test is carried out according to the procedure described 
above.

  CHAPTER XVI 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR X 
X, 1. Vocabulary (thirty definitions, 5400 words) 
Procedure and scoring as in VIII, 6. At year X, thirty 
words should be correctly defined. 
X, 2. Detecting absurdities 
Procedure. Say to the child: “I am going to read a 
sentence which has something foolish in it, some nonsense. I 
want you to listen carefully and tell me what is foolish about 
a.” Then read the sentences, rather slowly and in a 
matter-of-fact voice, saying after each: “ What is foolish 
about that?’ The sentences used are the following: — 
(a) “A man said: ‘I know a road from my house to the city which 
ts downhill all the way to the city and downhill all the way back 
home.’” 
(b) “An engineer said that the more cars he had on his train the 
faster he could go.” 
(c) “Yesterday the police found the body of a girl cut into eighteen 
preces. They believe that she killed herself.” 
(d) There was a railroad accident yesterday, but it was not very 
serious. Only forty-eight people were killed.” 
(e) “A bicycle rider, being thrown from his bicycle in an accident, 
struck his head against a stone and was instantly killed. They 
picked him up and carried him to the hospital, and they do not 
think he will get well again.” 
Each should ordinarily be answered within thirty sec- 
onds. If the child is silent, the sentence should be re-
-P-A-G-E-276
f

256 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
peated; but no other questions or suggestions of any kind 
are permissible. Such questions as “Could the road be 
downhill both ways?” or, “ Do you think the girl could have 
killed herself? ’’ would, of course, put the answer in the 
child’s mouth. It is even best to avoid laughing as the 
sentence is read. 
Owing to the child’s limited power of expression it is 
not always easy to judge from the answer given whether 
the absurdity has really been detected or not. In such 
cases ask him to explain himself, using some such formula 
as: “I am not sure I know what you mean. Explain what 
you mean. Tell me what is foolish in the sentence I read.” 
This usually brings a reply the correctness or incorrectness 
of which is more apparent, while at the same time the for- 
mula is so general that it affords no hint as to the correct 
answer. Additional questions must be used with extreme 
caution. 
Scoring. Passed if the absurdity is detected in four out 
of the fwe statements. The following are samples of satis- 
factory and unsatisfactory answers :— 
(a) The road downhill 
Satisfactory. “If it was downhill to the city it would be uphill 
coming back.” “It can’t be downhill both directions.” ‘That 
could not be.” “That is foolish. (Explain.) Because it must be 
uphill one way or the other.” ‘That would be a funny road. 
(Explain.) No road can be like that. It can’t be downhill both 
ways.” 
Unsatisfactory. “Perhaps he took a little different road coming 
back.” “TI guess it is a very crooked road.” “Coming back he 
goes around the hill.’ “The man lives down in a valley.” “The 
road was made that way so it would be easy.” “Just a road. I 
don’t see anything foolish.” “He should say, ‘a road which goes.’” 
(6) What the engineer said 
Satisfuctory. “If he has more cars he will go slower.” “It is 
the other way. If he wants to go faster he must n’t have so many r  
-P-A-G-E-277
TEST NO. X, 2 257 
ears.” “The man did n’t mean what he said, or else it was a slip 
of the tongue.” “‘That’s the way it would be if he was going down- 
hill.” ‘Foolish, because the cars don’t help pull the train.” “He 
ought to say slower, not faster.” 
Unsatisfactory. “A long train is nicer.” “The engine pulls 
harder if the train has lots of cars.” “That’s all right. I suppose 
he likes a big train.” ‘‘ Nothing foolish; when I went to the city I 
saw a train that had lots of cars and it was going awfully fast.” 
“He should have said, ‘the faster I can run.’” 
(c) The girl who was thought to have killed herself 
Satisfactory. “She could not have cut herself into eighteen 
pieces.” “She would have been dead before that.” “She might 
have cut two or three pieces off, but she could n’t do the rest.” 
(Laughing) “‘ Well, she may have killed herself; but if she did it’s a 
sure thing that some one else came along after and chopped her 
up.” “That policeman must have been a fool. (Explain.) To 
think that she could chop herself into eighteen pieces.” 
Unsatisfactory. “Think that she killed herself; they know she 
did.” “They can’t be sure. Some one may have killed her.” 
“Tt was a foolish girl to kill herself.” “How can they tell who 
killed her?” “No girl would kill herself unless she was crazy.” 
“Tt ought to read: “They think that she committed suicide.’” 
(d) The railroad accident 
Satisfactory. “That was very serious.” “TI should like to know 
what you would call a serious accident!” ‘You could say it was 
not serious if two or three people were killed, but forty-eight, — 
that is serious.” 
Unsatisfactory. “Tt was a foolish mistake that made the acci- 
dent.”’ “They could n’t help it. It was an accident.” “It might 
have been worse.” “Nothing foolish; it’s just sad.” 
(e) The bicycle rider 
Satisfactory. “How could he get well after he was already 
killed?” “Why, he’s already dead.” ‘No use to take a dead man 
to the hospital.” “They ought to have taken him to a grave- 
yard!” 
Unsatisfactory. ‘Foolish to fall off of a bicycle. He should have 
known how to ride.” ‘“‘They ought to have carried him home. 
*
-P-A-G-E-278
258 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
(Why?) So his folks could get a doctor.” ‘He should have been 
more careful.” “Maybe they can cure him if he is n’t hurt very 
bad.” ‘“There’s nothing foolish in that.” 
Remarks. The detection of absurdities is one of the most 
ingenious and serviceable tests of the entire scale. It is 
little influenced by schooling, and it comes nearer than any 
other to being a test of that species of mother-wit which 
we call common sense. Like the “‘ comprehension ques- 
tions,” it may be called a test of judgment, using this term 
in the colloquial and not in the logical sense. The stupid 
person, whether depicted in literature, proverb, or the 
ephemeral joke column, is always (and justly, it would 
seem) characterized by a huge tolerance for absurd contra- 
dictions and by a blunt sensitivity for the fine points of a 
joke. Intellectual discrimination and judgment are in- 
ferior. The ideas do not cross-light each other, but remain 
relatively isolated. Hence, the most absurd contradictions 
are swallowed, so.to speak, without arousing the protest of 
the critical faculty. The latter, indeed, is only a name for 
the tendency of intellectually irreconcilable elements to 
clash. If there is no clash, if the elements remain apart, 
it goes without saying that there will be no power of 
criticism. 
The critical faculty begins its development in the early 
years and strengthens pari passu with the growing wealth 
of inter-associations among ideas; but in the average child 
it is not until the age of about 10 years that it becomes 
equal to tasks like those presented in this test. Eight-year 
intelligence hardly ever scores more than two or three cor- 
rect answers out of five. By 12, the critical ability has so 
far developed that the test is nearly always passed. It is 
an invaluable test for the higher grades of mental deficiency. 
As a test of the critical powers Binet first used “ trap 
questions ”’; as, for example, “Is snow red or black?”
-P-A-G-E-279
  TEST NO. X, 2 : 259 
The results were disappointing, for it was found that owing 
to timidity, deference, and suggestibility normal children 
often failed on such questions. Deference is more marked 
in normal than in feeble-minded children, and it is because 
of the influence of this trait that it is necessary always to 
forewarn the subject that the sentence to be given contains 
nonsense. 
Binet located the test in year XI of the 1908 scale, but 
changed it to year X in 1911. Goddard and Kuhlmann 
retain it in year XI. The large majority of the statistics, 
including those of Goddard and Kuhlmann, warrant the 
location of the test in year X. Not all have used the same 
absurdities, and these have not been worded uniformly. 
Most have required three successes out of five, but Bober- 
tag and Kuhlmann require three out of four; Bobertag’s 
procedure is also different in that he does not forewarn 
the child that an absurdity is to follow. 
The present form of the test is the result of three suc- 
cessive refinements. It will be noted that we have made two 
substitutions in Binet’s list of absurdities. Those omitted 
from the original scale are: “I have three brothers — Paul, 
Ernest, and myself,” and, “If I were going to commit 
suicide I would not choose Friday, because Friday is an 
unlucky day and would bring me misfortune.” The last 
has a puzzling feature which makes it much too hard for 
year X, and the other is objectionable with children who 
are accustomed to hear a foreign language in which the 
form of expression used in the absurdity is idiomatically 
correct. 
The two we have substituted for these objectionable ab- 
surdities are, “The road downhill” and ‘“ What the en- 
gineer said.” The five we have used, though of nearly equal 
difficulty, are here listed in the order from easiest to hard- 
est. Our series as a whole is slightly easier than Binet’s.

X, 3. Drawing designs from memory 
Procedure. Use the designs shown on the accompany- 
ing printed form. If copies are used they must be exact 
in size and shape. Before showing the card say: “ This 
card has two drawings on it. I am going to show them to 
you for ten seconds, then I will take the card away and let you 
draw from memory what you have seen. Examine both draw- 
ings carefully and remember that you have only ten seconds.” 
Provide pencil and paper and then show the card for 
ten seconds, holding it at right angles to the child’s line of 
vision and with the designs in the position given in the 
plate. Have the child draw the designs immediately after 
they are removed from sight. 
Scoring. The test is passed if one of the designs is re 
produced correctly and the other about half correctly. “ Cor- 
rectly” means that the essential plan of the design has 
been grasped and reproduced. Ordinary irregularities due to 
lack of motor skill or to hasty execution are disregarded. 
“Half correctly ”? means that some essential part of the 
design has been omitted or misplaced, or that parts have 
been added. 
The sample reproductions shown on the scoring card 
will serve as a guide. It will be noted that an inverted 
design, or one whose right and left sides have been trans- 
posed, is counted only half correct, however perfect it may 
be in other respects; also that design b is counted only half 
correct if the inner rectangle is not located off center. 
Remarks. Binet states that the main factors involved in 
success are “ attention, visual memory, and a little analy- 
sis.” The power of rapid analysis would seem to be the 
most important, for if the designs are analyzed they may 
be reproduced from a verbal memory of the analysis. With- 
out some analysis it would hardly be possible to remember 
 
-P-A-G-E-281
  TEST NO. X, 3 261 
the designs at all, as one of them contains thirteen lines 
and the other twelve. The memory span for unrelated 
objects is far too limited to permit us to grasp and retain 
that number of unrelated impressions. Success is possible 
only by grouping the lines according to their relationships, 
so that several of them are given a unitary value and remem- 
bered as one. In this manner, the design to the right, which 
is composed of twelve lines, may be reduced to four ele- 
ments: (1) The outer rectangle; (2) the inner rectangle; 
(3) the off-center position of the inner rectangle; and (4) 
the joining of the angles. Of course the child does not or- 
dinarily make an analysis as explicit as this; but analysis 
of some kind, even though it be unconscious, is necessary 
to success. 
Ability to pass the test indicates the presence, in a cer- 
tain definite amount, of the tendency for the contents of 
consciousness to fuse into a meaningful whole. Failure in- 
dicates that the elements have maintained their unitary 
character or have fused inadequately. It is seen, therefore, 
that the test has a close kinship with the test of memory 
for sentences. The latter, also, permits the fusion or group- 
ing of impressions according to meaning, with the result 
that five or six times as many meaningful syllables as non- 
sense syllables or digits can be retained. 
Binet had many more failures on design a than on de- 
sign b. This was probably due to the fact that he showed 
the designs with our 6 to the left. A majority of subjects, 
probably because of the influence of reading habits, ex. 
amine first the figure to the left, and because of the short 
time allowed for the inspection are unable to devote much 
time to the design at the right. We have placed the design 
of greater intrinsic difficulty at the left, with the result 
that the failures are almost equally divided between the 
two.

  262 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Binet used this test in his unstandardized series of 1905, 
omitted it in 1908, but included it in the 1911 revision, 
locating it in year X. Except for Goddard, who recom- 
mends year XI, there is rather general agreement that the 
test belongs at year X. Our own data show that it may be 
placed either at year X or year XI, according as the grading 
is rigid or lenient. 
X, 4. Reading for eight memories 
Material. We use Binet’s selection, slightly adapted, as 
follows: — 
New York, September 5th. A fire last night burned three houses 
near the center of the city. It took some time to put it out. The loss was 
fifty thousand dollars, and seventeen families lost their homes. In sav- 
tng a girl, who was asleep t in bed, a fireman was burned on the hands. 
The copy of the selection used by the subject should be 
printed in heavy type and should not contain the bars 
dividing it into memories. The Stanford record booklet 
contains the selection in two forms, one suitable for 
use in scoring, the other in heavy type to be read by the 
subject. 
Procedure. Hand the selection to the subject, who should 
be seated comfortably in a good light, and say: “ I want 
you to read this for me as nicely as you can.” The subject 
must read aloud. 
Pronounce all the words which the subject is unable to 
make out, not allowing more than five seconds’ hesitation 
in such a case. 
Record all errors made in reading the selection, and the 
exact time. By “error” is meant the omission, substitu- 
tion, transposition, or mispronunciation of one word. 
The subject is not warned in advance that he will be 
asked to report what he has read, but as soon as he has
-P-A-G-E-283
  
TEST NO. X, 4 263 
finished reading, put the selection out of sight and say: 
“Very well done. Now, I want you to tell me what you 
read. Begin at the first and tell everything you can remember.” 
After the subject has repeated everything he can recall and 
has stopped, say: ‘“‘ And what else? Can you remember any 
more of it?’ Give no other aid of any kind. It is of course 
not permissible, when the child stops, to prompt him with 
such questions as, “And what neat? Where were the houses 
burned? What happened to the fireman?” etc. The report 
must be spontaneous. 
Now and then, though not often, a subject hesitates or 
even refuses to try, saying he is unable to do it. Perhaps 
he has misunderstood the request and thinks he is expected 
to repeat the selection word for word, as in the tests of 
memory for sentences. We urge a little and repeat: “ Tell 
me in your own words all you can remember of it.” Others 
misunderstand in a different way, and thinking they are 
expected to tell merely what the story is about, they say: 
“Tt was about some houses that burned.” In such cases we 
repeat the instructions with special emphasis on the words 
all you can remember. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the selection is read in 
thirty-five seconds with not more than two errors, and if the 
report contains at least eight ‘‘ memories.” By underscoring 
the memories correctly reproduced, and by interlineations 
to show serious departures from the text, the record can 
be made complete with a minimum of trouble. 
The main difficulty in scoring is to decide whether a 
memory has been reproduced correctly enough to be 
counted. Absolutely literal reproduction is not expected. 
The rule is to count all memories whose thought is repro- 
duced with only minor changes in the wording. “It took 
quite a while” instead of “it took some time” is satis- 
factory; likewise, “got burnt” for ‘was burned”;
-P-A-G-E-284
  264 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
“‘ who was sleeping ”’ for “‘ who was asleep ”; “ are home- 
less ” for “ fost their homes ”; “ in the middle ” for “ near 
the center ”’; “a big fire” for “‘ a fire,”’ etc. 
Memories as badly mutilated as the following, however, 
are not counted: “ A lot of buildings ” for “‘ three houses; ” 
“a man” for “a fireman”; “‘ who was sick” for “‘ who 
was asleep”; etc. Occasionally we may give half credit, 
as in the case of ‘‘ was seventeen thousand dollars” for 
““was fifty thousand dollars”; “and fifteen families” for 
“ and seventeen families,” etc. 
Remarks. Are we warranted in using at all as a measure 
of intelligence a test which depends as much on instruc- 
tion as this one does? Many are inclined to answer this ques- 
tion in the negative. The test has been omitted from the 
revisions of Goddard, Kuhlmann, and Binet himself. As 
regards Binet’s earlier test of reading for two memories, in 
year VIII, there could hardly be any difference of opinion. 
The ability to read at that age depends so much on the ac- 
cident of environment that the test is meaningless unless 
we know all about the conditions which have surrounded the 
child. 
The use of the test in year X, however, is a very different 
matter. There are comparatively few children of that age 
who will fail to pass it for lack of the requisite school in- 
struction. Children of 10 years who have attended school 
with reasonable regularity for three years are practically 
always able to read the selection in thirty-five seconds and 
_ without over two mistakes unless they are retarded almost 
to the border-line of mental deficiency. Of our 10-year- 
olds who failed to meet the test, only a fourth did so be- 
cause of inability to meet the reading requirements as 
regards time or mistakes. The remaining failures were 
caused by inadequate report, and most of these subjects 
were of the distinctly retarded group.
-P-A-G-E-285
TEST NO. X, 4 265 
We may conclude, therefore, that given anything ap- 
proaching normal educational advantages, the test is really 
a measure of intelligence. Used with due caution, it is per- 
haps as valuable as any other test in the scale. It is only 
necessary, in case of failure, to ascertain the facts regard- 
ing the child’s educational opportunities. Even this pre- 
caution is superfluous in case the subject tests as low as 8 
years by the remainder of the scale. A safe rule is to omit 
the test from the calculation of mental age if the subject 
has not attended school the equivalent of two or three 
years. 
It has been contended by some that tests in which suc- 
cess depends upon language mastery cannot be real tests of 
intelligence. By such critics language tests have been set 
over against intelligence tests as contrasting opposites. It 
is easy to show, however, that this view is superficial and 
psychologically unsound. Every one who has an acquaint- 
ance with the facts of mental growth knows that language 
mastery of some degree is the sine qua non of conceptual 
thinking. Language growth, in fact, mirrors the entire 
mental development. There are few more reliable indica- 
tions of a subject’s stage of intellectual maturity than his 
mastery of language. 
The rate of reading, for example, is a measure of the rate 
of association. Letters become associated together in cer- 
tain combinations making words, words into word groups 
and sentences. Recognition is for the most part an asso- 
ciative process. Rapid and accurate association will mean 
ready recognition of the printed form. Since language units 
(whether letters, words, or word groups) have more or less 
preferred associations according to their habitual arrange- 
ment into larger units, it comes about that in the normal 
mind under normal conditions these preferred sequences 
arouse the apperceptive complex necessary to make a run-  
-P-A-G-E-286
266 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
ning recognition rapid and easy. It is reasonable to suppose 
that in the subnormal mind the habitual common associa- 
tions are less firmly fixed, thus diminishing the effective- 
ness of the ever-changing apperceptive expectancy. Read- 
ing is, therefore, largely dependent on what James calls 
the “fringe of consciousness ” and the “ consciousness of 
meaning.” In reading connected matter, every unit is big 
with a mass of tendencies. The smaller and more isolated 
the unit, the greater is the number of possibilities. Every 
added unit acts as a modifier limiting the number of ten- 
dencies, until we have finally, in case of a large mental unit, 
a fairly manageable whole. When the most logical and 
suitable of these associations arise easily from subcon- 
sciousness to consciousness, recognition is made easy, 
and their doing so will depend on whether the habitual 
relations of the elements have left permanent traces in the 
mind. 
The reading of the subnormal subject bears a close anal- 
ogy to the reading of nonsense matter by the normal person. 
It has been ascertained by experiment that such reading 
requires about twice as much time as the reading of con- 
nected matter. This is true for the reason that out of thou- 
sands of associations possible with each word, no particular 
association is favored. The apperceptive expectancy, prac- 
tically nil in the reading of nonsense material, must be 
decidedly deficient in all poor reading. 
Furthermore, in the case of the ordinary reader there is 
a feeling of rightness or wrongness about the thought se- 
quences. That less intelligent subjects have this sense of 
fitness to a much less degree is evidenced by their passing 
over words so mutilated in pronunciation as to deprive 
them of all meaning. The transposition of letters and words, 
and the failure to observe marks of punctuation, point to 
the same thing. In other words, all the reading of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  TEST NO. X, 4 267 
stupid subject is with material which to him is more or 
less nonsensical.! 
A little observation will convince one that mentally re- 
tarded subjects, even when they possess a reasonable degree 
of fluency in recognizing printed words, do not sense shades 
of meaning. Their reading is by small units. Words and 
phrases do not fuse into one mental content, but remain 
relatively unconnected. The expression is monotonous and. 
the voice has more of the unnatural “ schoolroom ” pitch. 
They read more slowly, more often misplace the emphasis, 
and miscall more words. In short, one who has psychological 
insight and is acquainted with reading standards can easily 
detect the symptoms of intellectual inferiority by hearing 
a dull subject read a brief selection. 
The giving of memories is also significant. Feeble-minded 
adults who have been well schooled are sometimes able to 
read the words of the text fairly fiuently, but are usually 
anable to give more than a scanty report of what has been 
read. The scope of attention has been exhausted in the 
mere recognition and pronouncing of words. In general, 
the greater the mechanical difficulties which a subject en- 
counters, the less adequate is his report of memories. 
The test has, however, one real fault. School children 
have a certain advantage in it over older persons of the 
same mental age whose school experience is less recent. 
Adult subjects tend to give their report in less literal form. 
It is necessary, therefore, to give credit for the reproduction 
of the ideas of the passage rather than for strictly literal 
““ memories.” 
The selection we have used is, with minor changes, the 
same as Binet’s. His selection was divided into nineteen 
memories. The one here given has twenty-one memories.

Seminary, September, 1906, p. 340 ff.  
-P-A-G-E-288
  268 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Binet used the test both in year VIII and year IX, requir- 
ing two memories at year VIII and six memories at year 
IX. When we require eight memories, as we have done, 
the test becomes difficult enough for non-selected school 
children of 10 years. Location in year X seems preferable, 
because it insures that the child will almost certainly have 
had the schooling requisite for learning to read a selection 
of this difficulty, even if he has started to school at a later 
age than is customary. Naturally, placing the test higher 
in the scale makes it more a test of report and less a test 
of ability to recognize and pronounce printed words. 
X, 5. Comprehension, fourth degree 
The questions for this year are: — 
(a) “What ought you to say when some one asks your opinion 
about a person you don’t know very well?” 
(b) “What ought you to do before undertaking (beginning) some- 
thing very important?” 
(c) “Why should we judge a person more by his actions than by his 
words?” 
The procedure is the same as for the previous compre- 
hension tests. Each question may be repeated, but its 
form must not be changed. It is not permissible to make 
any explanation whatever as to the meaning of the ques- 
tion, except to substitute beginning for undertaking when 
(b) seems not to be comprehended. 
Scoring. Two out of the three questions must be answered 
satisfactorily. Study of the following classified responses 
should make scoring fairly easy in most cases: — 
(a) When some one asks your opinion 
Satisfactory. “I would say I don’t know him very well” (42 
per cent of the correct answers). ‘Tell him what I know and no 
more” (34 per cent of correct answers). “I would say that I’d  
-P-A-G-E-289
  TEST NO. X, 5 269 
rather not express any opinion about him” (20 per cent of the 
correct answers). ‘Tell him to ask some one else.” “I would not 
express any opinion.” 
Unsatisfactory. Unsatisfactory responses are due either to fail- 
ure to grasp the import of the question, or to inability to suggest 
the appropriate action demanded by the situation. 
The latter form of failure is the more common; e.g.: “I’d say 
they are nice.” “Say you like them.” “Say what I think.” “Say 
it’s none of their business.” “Tell them I mind my own business.” 
“Say I would get acquainted with them.” “Say that I don’t talk 
about people.” “Say I did n’t know how he looked.” “Tell them 
you ought not to say such things; you might get into trouble.” 
“T would n’t say anything.” “I would try to answer.” “Say I 
did not know his name,” ete. 
The following are samples of failure due to mistaking the im- 
port of the question: “I’d say, ‘How do you do?’” “Say, ‘I’m 
glad to meet you.’” 
(b) Before undertaking something important 
Satisfactory responses fall into the following classes: — 
(1) Brief statement of preliminary consideration; as: “Think 
about it.” “Look it over.” “Plan it all out.” “Make your 
plans.” “Stop and think,” ete. 
(2) Special emphasis on preliminary preparation and correct 
procedure; as: “Find out the best way to do it.” “Find 
out what it is.” ‘Get everything ready.” “Do every little 
thing that would help you.” “Get all the details you can.” 
“Take your time and figure it out,” etc. 
(3) Asking help; as: “‘Ask some one to help you who knows all 
about it.” “Pray, if you are a Christian.” “Ask advice,” 
ete. 
(4) Preliminary testing of ability, self-analysis, etc.; as: “Try 
something easier first.” “Practice and make sure I could do 
it.” “Learn how to do it,” ete. 
(5) Consider the wisdom or propriety of doing it: “Think 
whether it would be best to do it.” “See whether it would 
be possible.” 
About 65 per cent of the correct responses belong either to group 
(1) or (2), about 20 per cent to group (3), and most of the remain- 
der to group (4).

  THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Unsatisfactory responses are of the following types: — 
qd) 
2) Due to mistaking the import of the question; e.g.: “Ask for 
it.” “Ought to say please.” “Ask whose it is.” Replies of 
this kind can be nearly all eliminated by repeating the ques- 
tion, using beginning instead of undertaking. 
Replies more or less absurd or irrelevant; as: “Promise to 
do your best.” “ Wash your face and hands.” “Get a lot of 
insurance.” “Dress up and take a walk.” “Tell your name.” 
“Know whether it’s correct.” “Begin at the beginning.” 
“Say you will do it.” “See if it’s a fake.” “Go to school a 
long time.”’ “Pass an examination.” “Do what is right.” 
“Add up and see how much it will cost.” “Say I would do 
it.” “Just start doing it.” “Go away.” “Consult a doc- 
tor.” “See if you have time,” etc. 
(c) Why we should judge a person more by his actions than 
by his words 
Satisfactory responses fall into the following classes: — 
qd) 
(2) 
(3) 
(4) Words and deeds both mentioned and contrasted in relia- 
bility; as: “Actions speak louder than words” (this in 8 per 
cent of successes). ‘You can tell more by his actions than 
by his words.” “He might talk nice and do bad things.” 
“Sometimes people say things and don’t do them.” “It’s 
not what you say but what you do that counts.” “Talk is 
cheap; when he does a thing you can believe it.” ‘People 
don’t do everything they say.” “A man might steal but 
talk like a nice man.” Over 45 per cent of all correct re- 
sponses belong to group (1). 
Acts stressed without mention of words; as: “You can tell 
by his actions whether he is good or not.” “If he acts nice 
he is nice.” “Actions show for themselves.” Group (2) 
contains about 25 per cent of the correct responses. 
Emphasis on unreliability of words; as: “You can’t tell by 
his words, he might lie or boast.” “Because you can’t 
always believe what people say.” (Group (3) contains 15 
per cent of the correct responses. 
Responses which state that a man’s deeds are sometimes 
better than his words; as: “He might talk ugly and still not 
do bad things.’ “Some really kind-hearted people scold 
and swear.” “A man’s words may be worse than his deeds,”
-P-A-G-E-291
  TEST NO. X, 5 Q71 
etc. Group (4) contains over 10 per cent of the correct 
responses. 
Unsatisfactory responses are usually due to inability to compre- 
hend the meaning of the question. If there is complete lack of 
comprehension the result is either silence or a totally irrelevant 
response. If there is partial comprehension of the question the 
response may be partially relevant, but fail to make the expected 
distinction. 
The following are sample failures: “‘ You could tell by his words 
that he was educated.” “It shows he is polite if he acts nice.” 
“Sometimes people are n’t polite.” ‘Actions show who he might 
be.” “Acts may be foolish.” “Words ain’t right.” “A man 
might be dumb.” “A fellow don’t know what he says.” “Some 
people can talk, but don’t have control of themselves.”’ “You can 
tell by his acts whether he goes with bad people.” ‘If he does n’t 
act right you know he won’t talk right.”” “Actions show if he has 
manners.” “Might get embarrassed and not talk good.” “He 
may not know how to express his thoughts.”’ “He might be a rich 
man but a poor talker.” ‘“‘He might say the wrong thing and after- 
wards be sorry for it,” ete. (The last four are nearer correct than 
the others, but they fall just short of expressing the essential 
contrast.) 
Remarks. For discussion of the comprehension ques- 
tions as a test of intelligence, see page 158. 
Binet used eight questions, three ‘‘ easy ”’ and five “‘ dif- 
ficult,” and required that five out of eight be answered cor- 
rectly in year X. The eight were as follows: — 
(1) What to do when you have missed your train. 
(2) When you have been struck by a playmate, etc. 
(3) When you have broken something, etc. 
(4) When about to be late for school. 
(5) When about to undertake something important. 
(6) Why excuse a bad act committed in anger more readily 
than a bad act committed without anger. 
(7) What to do if some one asks your opinion, etc. 
(8) Why can you judge a person better by his actions, etc. 
As we have shown, questions 1, 2, 3, and 4 are much too 
easy for year X. Question 6 is hard enough for year XII.

We have omitted it because it was not needed and is not 
entirely satisfactory. 
X, 6. Naming sixty words 
Procedure. Say: “Now, I want to see how many different 
words you can name in three minutes. When I say ready, 
you must begin and name the words as fast as you can, and 
I will count them. Do you understand? Be sure to do your 
very best, and remember that just any words will do, like 
* clouds,’ * dog,’ * chair,’ “ happy’ — Ready; go ahead!” 
The instructions may be repeated if the subject does 
not understand what is wanted. As a rule the task is com- 
prehended instantly and entered into with great zest. 
Do not stare at the child, and do not say anything as the 
test proceeds unless there is a pause of fifteen seconds. 
In this event say: “Go ahead, as fast as you can. Any 
words will do.” Repeat this urging after every pause of 
fifteen seconds. 
Some subjects, usually rather intelligent ones, hit upon 
the device of counting or putting words together in sen- 
tences. We then break in with: “ Counting (or sentences, 
as the case may be) not allowed. You must name separate 
words. Go ahead.” 
Record the individual words if possible, and mark the 
end of each half-minute. If the words are named so rapidly 
that they cannot be taken down, it is easy to keep the count 
by making a pencil stroke for each word. If the latter 
method is employed, repeated words may be indicated by 
making a cross instead of a single stroke. Always make 
record of repetitions. 
Scoring. The test is passed if sixty words, exclusive of 
repetitions, are named in three minutes. It is not allow- 
able to accept twenty words in one minute or forty words
-P-A-G-E-293
  TEST NO. X, 6 273 
in two minutes as an equivalent of the expected score. 
Only real words are counted. 
Remarks. Scoring, as we have seen, takes account only 
of the number of words. It is instructive, however, to note 
the kind of words given. Some subjects, more often those 
of the 8- or 9-year intelligence level, give mainly isolated, 
detached words. As well stated by Binet, “ Little children 
exhaust an idea in naming it. They say, for example, hat, 
and then pass on to another word without noticing that 
hats differ in color, in form, have various parts, different 
uses and accessories, and that in enumerating all these they 
could find a large number of words.” 
Others quickly take advantage of such relationships 
and name many parts of an object before leaving it, or 
name a number of other objects belonging to the same class. 
Hat, for example, suggests cap, hood, coat, shirt, shoes, 
stockings, etc. Pencil suggests book, slate, paper, desk, 
ink, map, school-yard, teacher, etc. Responses of this type 
may be made up of ten or a dozen plainly distinct word 
groups. 
Another type of response consists in naming only ob- 
jects present, or words which present objects immediately 
suggest. It is unfortunate that this occurs, since rooms in 
which testing is done vary so much with respect to furnish- 
ings. The subject who chooses this method is obviously 
handicapped if the room is relatively bare. One way to 
avoid this influence is to have all subjects name the words 
with eyes closed, but the distraction thus caused is some- 
times rather disturbing. It is perhaps best for the present 
to adhere to the original procedure, and to follow the rule 
of making tests in a room containing few furnishings in 
addition to the necessary table and chairs. 
A fourth type of response is that including a large pro- 
portion of unusual or abstract words. This is the best of
-P-A-G-E-294
  274 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
all, and is hardly ever found except with subjects who are 
above the 11-year intelligence level. 
It goes without saying that a response need not belong 
entirely to any one of the above types. Most responses, in 
fact, are characterized by a mixture of two or three of the 
types, one of them perhaps being dominant. 
Though not without its shortcomings, the test is interest- 
ing and valuable. Success in it does not, as one might sup- 
pose, depend solely upon the size of the vocabulary. Even 
8-year-olds ordinarily know the meaning of more than 3000 
words, and by 10 years the vocabulary usually exceeds 
5000 words, or eighty times as many as the child is expected 
to name in three minutes. The main factors in success are 
two, (1) richness and variety of previously made associa- 
tions with common words; and (2) the readiness of these 
associations to reinstate themselves. The young or the re- 
tarded subject fishes in the ocean of his vocabulary with 
a single hook, so to speak. He brings up each time only one 
word. The subject endowed with superior intelligence 
employs a net (the idea of a class, for example) and brings 
up a half-dozen words or more. The latter accomplishes a 
greater amount and with less effort; but it requires intelli- 
gence and will power to avoid wasting time with detached 
words. 
One is again and again astonished at the poverty of asso- 
ciations which this test discloses with retarded subjects. 
For twenty or thirty seconds such children may be unable 
to think of a single word. It would be interesting if at such 
periods we could get a glimpse into the subject’s conscious- 
ness. There must be some kind of mental content, but it 
seems too vague to be crystallized in words. The ready asso- 
ciation of thoughts with definite words connotes a relatively 
high degree of intellectual advancement. Language forms 
are the short-hand of thought; without facile command of
-P-A-G-E-295
  TEST NO. X, 6 275 
language, thinking is vague, clumsy, and ineffective. Con- 
versely, vague mental content entails language shortage. 
Occasionally a child of 11- or 12- year intelligence will 
make a poor showing in this test. When this happens it is 
usually due either to excessive embarrassment or to a 
strange persistence in running down all the words of a 
given class before launching out upon a new series. Occa- 
sionally, too, an intelligent subject wastes time in thinking 
up a beautiful list of big or unusual words. As stated by 
Bobertag, success is favored by a certain amount of “ in- 
tellectual nonchalance,” a willingness to ignore sense and 
a readiness to break away from a train of associations as 
soon as the “point of diminishing returns” has been 
reached. This doubtless explains why adults sometimes 
make such a surprisingly poor showing in the test. They 
have less “ intellectual nonchalance”’ than children, are 
less willing to subordinate such considerations as complete- 
ness and logical connection to the demands of speed. 
Knollin’s unemployed men of 12- to 13-year intelligence 
succeeded no better than school children of the 10-year 
level. 
We do not believe, however, that this fault is serious 
enough to warrant the elimination of the test. The fact is 
that in a large majority of cases the score which it yields 
agrees fairly closely with the result of the scale as a whole. 
Subjects more than a year or two below the mental age of 
10 years seldom succeed. Those more than a year or two 
above the 10-year level seldom fail. 
There is another reason why the test should be retained. 
it often has significance beyond that which appears in the 
mere number of words given. The naming of unusual and 
abstract words is an instance of this. An unusually large 
number of repetitions has symptomatic significance in the 
other direction. It indicates a tendency to mental stereo-
-P-A-G-E-296
276 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
typy, so frequently encountered in testing the feeble-minded. 
The proportion of repetitions made by normal children of 
the 10- or 11-year intelligence level rarely exceeds 2 or 
8 per cent of the total number of words named; those of 
older retarded children of the same level occasionally reach 
6 or 8 per cent. 
It is conceivable, of course, that a more satisfactory 
test of this general nature could be devised; such, for 
example, as having the subject name all the words he can 
of a given class (four-footed animals, things to eat, articles 
of household furniture, trees, birds, etc.). The main ob- 
jection to this form of the test is that the performance 
would in all probability be more influenced by environment 
and formal instruction than is the case with the test of 
naming sixty words. 
One other matter remains to be mentioned; namely, the 
relative number of words named in the half-minute periods. 
As would be expected, the rate of naming words decreases 
as the test proceeds. In the case of the 10-year-olds, we 
find the average number of words for the six successive 
half-minutes to be as follows: — 
18, 1214, 1044, 9, 814, 7. 
Some subjects maintain an almost constant rate through- 
out the test, others rapidly exhaust themselves, while a very 
few make a bad beginning and improve as they go. As a 
tule it is only the very intelligent who improve after the 
first half-minute. On the other hand, mentally retarded 
subjects and very young normals exhaust themselves so 
quickly that only a few words are named in the last min- 
ute. 
Binet first located this test in year XI, but shifted it to 
year XII in 1911. Goddard and Kuhlmann retain it in 
year XI, though Goddard’s statistics suggest year X as the
-P-A-G-E-297
  TEST NO. X, ALTERNATIVE 2 Q77 
proper location, and Kuhlmann’s even suggest year IX. 
Kuhlmann, however, accepts fifty words as satisfactory in 
case the response contains a considerable proportion of 
abstract or unusual words. All the American statistics ex- 
cept Rowe’s agree in showing that the test is easy enough 
for year X. 
X, Alternative test 1: repeating six digits 
The digit series used are 3—7-4-8-5-9; and 5-2-1-7-4-6. 
The procedure and scoring are the same as in VII, 3, 
except that only two trials are given, one of which must be 
correct. The test is somewhat too easy for year 10 when 
three trials are given. 
The test of repeating six digits did not appear in the 
Binet scale and seems not to have been standardized until 
inserted in the Stanford series. 
X, Alternative test 2: repeating twenty to twenty-two 
syllables 
The sentences for this year are: — 
(a) “The apple tree makes a cool, pleasant shade on the ground 
where the children are playing.” 
(b) “It is nearly half-past one o'clock; the house is very quiet and 
the cat has gone to sleep.” 
(c) “In summer the days are very warm and fine; in winter it 
snows and I am cold.” 
Procedure and scoring exactly as in VI, 6. 
Remarks. It is interesting to note that five years of 
mental growth are required to pass from the ability to 
repeat sixteen or eighteen syllables (year VI) to the ability 
to repeat twenty or twenty-two syllables. Similarly in 
memory for digits. Five digits are almost as easy at year
-P-A-G-E-298
  278 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
VII as six at year X. Two explanations are available: 
(1) The increased difficulty may be accounted for by a 
relatively slow growth of memory power after the age of 
6 or 7 years; or (2) the increase in difficulty may be real} 
expressing an inner law as to the behavior of the memory 
span in dealing with material of increasing length. Both 
factors are probably involved. 
This is another of the Stanford additions to the scale. 
Average children of 10 years ordinarily pass it, but older, 
retarded children of 10-year mental age make a poorer 
showing. In the case of mentally retarded adults, especially, 
the verbal memory is less exact than that of school chil- 
dren of the same mental age. 
X, Alternative test 3: construction puzzle A 
(Healy and Fernald) 
Material. Use the form-board pictured. on page 279. 
This may be purchased of C. H. Stoelting & Co., Chicago, 
Illinois. A home-made one will do as well if care is taken 
to get the dimensions exact. Quarter-inch wood should be 
used. The inside of the frame should be 3 X 4 inches, 
and the dimensions of the blocks should be as follows: 
1%6 X 331 X 1431 X 23431 X 14; 14% X 2 
Procedure. Place the frame on the table before the sub- 
ject, the short side nearest him. The blocks are placed in | 
an irregular position on the side of the frame away from 
the subject. Take care that the board with the blocks in 
place is not exposed to view in advance of the experiment. 
Say: “I want you to put these blocks in this frame so 
that all the space will be filled wp. If you do it rightly they 
will all fit in and there will be no space left over. Go ahead.” 
Do not tell the subject to see how quickly he can do it. 
Say nothing that would even suggest hurrying, for this

TEST NO. X, ALTERNTIVE 3 279 
tends to call forth the trial-and-error procedure even with 
intelligent subjects. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the child succeeds in fit- 
ting the blocks into place three times in a total time of 
five minutes for the three trials.
-P-A-G-E-300
  280 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
The method of procedure is fully as important as the 
time, but is not so easily scored in quantitative terms. 
Nevertheless, the examiner should always take observa- 
tions on the method employed, noting especially any ten- 
dency to make and to repeat moves which lead to obvious 
impossibilities; ie., moves which leave a space obviously 
unfitted to any of the remaining pieces. Some subjects re- 
peat an absurd move many times over; others make an 
absurd move, but promptly correct it; others, and these 
are usually the bright ones, look far enough ahead to avoid 
error altogether. 
Remarks. This test was devised by Professor Freeman, 
was adapted slightly by Healy and Fernald, and was first 
standardized by Dr. Kuhlmann. Miss Gertrude Hall has 
also standardized it, but on a different procedure from 
that described above.! 
The test has a lower correlation with intelligence than 
most of the other tests of the scale. Many bright children 
of 10-year intelligence adopt the trial-and-error method and 
have little success, while retarded older children of only 
8-year intelligence sometimes succeed. Age, apart from 
intelligence, seems to play an important part in determining 
the nature of the performance. A favorable feature of the 
test, however, is the fact that it makes no demand on lan- 
guage ability and that it brings into play an aspect of in- 
telligence which is relatively neglected by the remainder 
of the scale. For this reason it is at least worth keeping as 
an alternative test.

CHAPTER XVII 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR XII 
XII, 1. Vocabulary (forty definitions, 7200 words) 
Procedure and scoring as in previous vocabulary tests.! 
In this case forty words must be defined. 
XII, 2. Defining abstract words 
Procedure. The words to be defined are pity, revenge, 
charity, envy, and justice. The formula is, “What is pity? 
What do we mean by pity? ” and so on with the other words. 
If the meaning of the response is not clear, ask the subject 
to explain what he means. If the definition is in terms of 
the word itself, as “‘ Pity means to pity someone,” “ Re- 
venge is to take revenge,” etc., it is then necessary to say: 
“ Yes, but what does it mean to pity some one?” or, ““ What 
does it mean to take revenge?” etc. Only supplementary 
questions of this kind are permissible. 
Scoring. The test is passed if three of the five words are 
satisfactorily defined. The definition need not be strictly 
logical nor the language elegant. It is sufficient if the defi- 
nition shows that the meaning of the word is known. Defi- 
nitions which define by means of an illustration are ac- 
ceptable. The following are samples of satisfactory and 
unsatisfactory responses: — 
1 See VIII, 6. 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  
  982 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
(a) Pity 
Satisfactory. “To be sorry for some one.” “To feel compassion.” 
“To have sympathy for a person.”’ “To feel bad for some one.” 
“Tt means you help a person out and don’t like to have him suffer.” 
“To have a feeling for people when they are treated wrong.” “If 
anybody gets hurt real bad you pity them.” “It’s when you feel 
sorry for a tramp and give him something to eat.” “If some one 
is in trouble and you know how it feels to be in that condition, you 
pity him.” “You see something that’s wrong and have your feel- 
ing aroused.” 
Of 130 correct responses, 85, or 65 per cent, defined pity as “to 
feel sorry for some one,” or words to that effect. Less than 10 per 
cent defined by means of illustration. 
Unsatisfactory. “To think of the poor.” “To be good to others.” 
“To help.” “It means sorrow.” “Mercy.” “To cheer people up.” 
“Tt means ‘What a pity!’” “To be ashamed.” “To be sick or 
poor.” “It’s when you break something.” 
Apart from inability to reply, which accounts for nearly one 
fourth of the failures, there is no predominant type of unsatis- 
factory response. 
(b) Revenge 
Satisfactory. “To get even with some one.” “To get back on 
him.” “To do something to the one who has done something to 
you.” “To hurt them back.” “To pay it back,” or “Do something 
back.” “To do something mean in return.” “To square up with 
a person.” “When somebody slaps you, you slap back.” “You 
kill a person if he does something to you.” 
The expression “to get even” was found in 42 per cent of 120 
correct answers; “to pay it back,” or “To do something back,” in 
20 per cent; “To get back on him,” in 17 per cent. About 8 per 
-cent were illustrations. 
Unsatisfactory. “To be mad.” “You try to hurt them.” “To 
fight.” “You hate a person.” “To kill them.” “It means hate- 
ful.” “To try again.” “To think evil of some one.” “To hate 
some one who has done you wrong.” “To let a person off.” “To 
go away from something.” 
Inability to reply accounts for a little over 40 per cent of the 
failures.
-P-A-G-E-303
  
TEST NO. XII, 2 283 
(c) Charity 
Satisfactory. ‘To give to the poor.” “To help those who are 
needy.” “It is charity if you are poor and somebody helps you.” 
“To give to somebody without pay.” 
Of 110 correct replies, 72 per cent were worded substantially 
like the first or second given above. 
Unsatisfactory. “A person who helps the poor.” “A place where 
poor people get food and things.” “It is a good life.” “To be 
happy.” “To be poor.” “Charity is being treated good.” “It is 
to be charitable.” “Charity is selling something that is not worth 
much.” “It means to be good” or “to be kind.” 
When the last named response is given, we should say: “ Explain 
what you mean.” If this brings an amplification of the response to 
“Tt means to do things for the poor,” or the equivalent, the score 
is plus. “Charity means love” is also minus if the statement can- 
not be further explained and is merely rote memory of the passage 
in the 13th chapter of 1st Corinthians. Simply “To help” or “To 
give” is unsatisfactory. Half of the failures are due to inability to 
reply. 
(d) Envy 
Satisfactory. “You envy some one who has something you 
want.” “It’s the way you feel when you see some one with some- 
thing nicer than you have.” “It’s when a poor girl sees a rich girl 
with nice dresses and things.” ‘You hate some one because 
they’ve got something you want.” “Jealousy” (satisfactory if 
subject can explain what jealousy means; otherwise it is minus). 
“Tt’s when you see a person better off than you are.” 
Nearly three fourths of the correct responses say in substance, 
“You envy a person who has something you want.” Most of the 
others are concrete illustrations. 
Unsatisfactory. “To hate some one,” or simply “To hate.” 
“You don’t like ’em.”’ “Bad feeling toward any one.” “To be a 
great man or woman.” “Not to be nice to people.” “What we do 
to our enemies.” 
Inability to respond accounts for 55 per cent of the failures. > 
(e) Justice 
Satisfactory. “To give people what they deserve.” “It means 
that everybody is treated the same way, whether he is rich or 
poor.” “It’s what you get when you go to court.” “If one does
-P-A-G-E-304
  
284 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
something and gets punished, that’s justice.” “To do the square 
thing.” “To give everybody his dues.” ‘Let every one have 
what’s coming to him.” “To do the right thing by any one.” 
“If two people do the same thing and they let one go without pun- 
ishing, that is not justice.” 
Approximately 38 per cent of 102 correct responses referred to 
treating everybody the same way; 25 per cent to “doing the 
square thing”; 12 per cent were concrete illustrations; and 4 per 
cent were definitions of what justice is not. 
Unsatisfactory. “It means to have peace.” “It is where they 
have court.” ‘It’s the Courthouse.”’ “To be honest.’ “Where 
one is just” (minus, unless further explained). “To do right” 
(minus, unless in explaining right the subject gives a definition of 
justice). 
It is very necessary, in case of such answers as “Justice is to 
do right,” “To be just,” ete., that the subject be urged to explain 
further what he means. “To do right” includes nearly 12 per 
cent of all answers, and is given by the very brightest children. 
Most of these are able, when urged, to complete the definition in a 
satisfactory manner. 
Remarks. The reader may be surprised that the ability 
to define common abstract words should develop so late. 
Most children who have had anything like ordinary home 
or school environment have doubtless heard all of these 
words countless times before the age of 12 years. Never- 
theless, the statistics from the test show unmistakably that 
before this age such words have but limited and vague 
meaning. Other vocabulary studies confirm this fact so 
completely that we may say there is hardly any trait in 
which 12- to 14- year intelligence more uniformly excels 
that of the 9- or 10- year level. 
This is readily understandable when we consider the 
nature of abstract meanings and the intellectual processes 
by which we arrive at them. Unlike such words as tree, 
house, etc., the ideas they contain are not the immediate 
result of perceptual processes, in which even childish in- 
telligence is adept, but are a refined and secondary prod-
-P-A-G-E-305
TEST NO. XII, 2 285 
uct of relationships between other ideas. They require the 
logical processes of comparison, abstraction, and genera- 
lization. One cannot see justice, for example, but one is 
often confronted with situations in which justice or injus- 
tice is an element; and given a certain degree of abstrac- 
tion and generalization, out of such situations the idea of 
justice will gradually be evolved. 
The formation and use of abstract ideas, of one kind or 
another, represent, par excellence, the “higher thought 
processes.” It is not without significance that delinquents 
who test near the border-line of mental deficiency show 
such inferior ability in arriving at correct generalizations 
regarding matters of social and moral relationships. We 
cannot expect a mind of defective generalizing ability to 
form very definite or correct notions about justice, law, 
fairness, ownership rights, etc.; and if the ideas themselves 
are not fairly clear, the rules of conduct based upon them 
cannot make a very powerful appeal.1 
Binet used the words charity, justice, and kindness, and 
required two successes. In the 1911 revision he shifted 
the test from year XI to year XII, where it more nearly 
belongs. Goddard also places it in year XII and uses Binet’s 
words, translating bonté, however, as goodness instead of 
kindness. Kuhlmann retains the test in year XI and adds 
bravery and revenge, requiring three correct definitions out 
of five. Bobertag uses pity, envy, and justice, requires two 
correct definitions, and finds the test just hard enough for 
year XII. 
After using the words goodness and kindness in two 
series of tests, we have discarded them as objectionable in 
that they give rise to so many doubtful definitions. Even 
intelligent children often say: “ Goodness means to do some- 
thing good,” “ Kindness means to be kind to some one,” 
1 See also p. 298 ff. 
 
-P-A-G-E-306
  286 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
etc. These definitions in a circle occur less than half as 
often with pity, revenge, and envy, which are also superior 
to charity and justice in this respect. 
The relative difficulty of our five words is indicated by 
the order in which we have listed them in the test (ie., 
beginning with the easiest and ending with the hardest). 
On the standard of three correct definitions, these words 
fit very accurately in year XII. 
XII, 3. The ball-and-field test (superior plan) 
Procedure, as in year VIII, test 1. 
Scoring. Score 3 (or superior plan) is required for pass- 
ing in year XII.1 
XII, 4. Dissected sentences 
The following disarranged sentences are used: — 
FOR THE STARTED AN WE COUNTRY EARLY AT HOUR 
TO ASKED PAPER MY TEACHER CORRECT I MY 
A DEFENDS DOG GOOD HIS BRAVELY MASTER 
These should be printed in type like that used above. 
The Stanford record booklet contains the sentences in 
convenient form. 
It is not permissible to substitute written words or printed 
script, as that would make the test harder. All the words 
should be printed in caps in order that no clue shall be 
given as to the first word in a sentence. For a similar reason 
the period is omitted. 
Procedure. Say: “‘ Here is a sentence that has the words 
all mixed up so that they don’t make any sense. If the words

TEST NO. XII, 4 287 
were changed around in the right order they would make a 
good sentence. Look carefully and see if you can tell me how 
the sentence ought to read.” 
Give the sentences in the order in which they are listed 
in the record booklet. Do not tell the subject to see how 
quickly he can do it, because with this test any suggestion 
of hurrying is likely to produce a kind of mental paralysis. 
If the subject has no success with the first sentence in one 
minute, read it off correctly for him, somewhat slowly, and 
pointing to each word as it is spoken. Then proceed to the 
second and third, allowing one minute for each. 
Give no further help. It is not permissible, in case an in- 
correct response is given, to ask the subject to try again, 
or to say: “ Are you sure that is right?” “Are you sure you 
have not left out any words?” etc. Instead, maintain ab- 
solute silence. However, the subject is permitted to make 
as many changes in his response as he sees fit, provided he 
makes them spontaneously and within the allotted time. 
Record the entire response. 
Once in a great while the subject misunderstands the 
task and thinks the only requirement is to use all the 
words given, and that it is permitted to add as many other 
words as he likes. It is then necessary to repeat the in- 
structions and to allow a new trial. 
Scoring. Two sentences out of three must be correctly 
given within the minute allotted to each. It is understood, 
of course, that if the first sentence has to be read for the 
subject, both the other responses must be given correctly. 
A sentence is not counted correct if a single word is 
omitted, altered, or inserted, or if the order given fails to 
make perfect sense. 
Certain responses are not absolutely ieooeraety but are 
‘ objectionable as regards sentence structure, or else fail to 
give the exact meaning intended. These are given half

Remarks. This is an excellent test. It involves no knowl- 
edge which may not be presupposed at the age in which 
it is given, and success therefore depends very little on 
experience. The worst that can be urged against it is that 
it may possibly be influenced to a certain extent by the 
amount of reading the subject has done. But this has not 
been demonstrated. At any rate, the test satisfies the most 
important requirement of a test of intelligence; namely, 
the percentage of successes increases rapidly and steadily 
from the lower to the higher levels of mental age. 
This experiment can be regarded as a variation of the 
completion test. Binet tells us, in fact, that it was directly 
suggested by the experiment of Ebbinghaus. As will 
readily be observed, however, it differs to a certain extent 
from the Ebbinghaus completion test. Ebbinghaus omits 
parts of a sentence and requires the subject to supply the 
omissions. In this test we give all the parts and require the 
formation of a sentence by rearrangement. The two experi- 
ments are psychologically similar in that they require the 
subject to relate given fragments into a meaningful whole. 
Success depends upon the ability of intelligence to utilize 
hints, or clues, and this in turn depends on the logical 
integrity of the associative processes. All but the highest 
grade of the feeble-minded fail with this test. 
This test is found in year XI of Binet’s 1908 series and 
in year XII of his 1911 revision. Goddard and Kuhlmann 
retain it in the original location. That it is better placed 
in year XII is indicated by all the available statistics with 
normal children, except those of Goddard. With this ex- 
ception, the results of various investigators for year XII 
are in remarkably close agreement, as the following figures 
will show: —

This agreement is noteworthy considering that no two 
experiments seem to have used exactly the same arrange- 
ment of words, and that some have presented the words of 
a sentence in a single line, others in two or three lines. A 
single line would appear to be somewhat easier. 
XII, 5. Interpretation of fables (score 4) 
The following fables are used: — 
(a) Hercules and the Wagoner 
A man was driving along a country road, when the wheels suddenly 
sank in a deep rut. The man did nothing but look at the wagon and 
call loudly to Hercules to come and help him. Hercules came up, 
looked at the man, and said: “‘ Put your shoulder to the wheel, my man, 
and whip up your oxen.” Then he went away and left the driver. 
(6) The Milkmaid and her Plans 
A milkmaid was carrying her pail of milk on her head, and was 
thinking to herself thus: “The money for this milk will buy 4 hens; 
the hens will lay at least 100 eggs; the eggs will produce at least 75 
chicks; and with the money which the chicks will bring I can buy a new 
dress to wear instead of the ragged one I have on.” At this moment she 
looked down at herself, trying to think how she would look in her new 
dress; but as she did so the pail of milk slipped from her head and 
dashed upon the ground. Thus all her imaginary schemes perished in

(c) The Fox and the Crow 
A crow, having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held it in 
her beak. A fox, seeing her, wished to secure the meat, and spoke to the 
crow thus: “How handsome you are! and I have heard that the beauty 
of your voice is equal to that of your form and feathers. Will you not 
sing for me, so that I may judge whether this is true?”’ The crow was 
so pleased that she opened her mouth to sing and dropped the meat, 
which the fox immediately ate. 
(d) The Farmer and the Stork 
A farmer set some traps to catch cranes which had been eating his 
seed. With them he caught a stork. The stork, which had not really 
been stealing, begged the farmer to spare his life, saying that he was a 
bird of excellent character, that he was not at all like the cranes, and 
that the farmer should have pity on him. But the farmer said: “I have 
caught you with these robbers, and you will have to die with them.” 
(e) The Miller, His Son, and the Donkey 
A miller and his son were driving their donkey to a neighboring 
town to sell him. They had not gone far when a child saw them and 
cried out: “What fools those fellows are to be trudging along on foot 
when one of them might be riding.” The old man, hearing this, made 
his son get on the donkey, while he himself walked. Soon, they came 
upon some men. “ Look,” said one of them, “see that lazy boy riding 
while his old father has to walk.” On hearing this, the miller made his 
son get off, and he climbed on the donkey himself. Farther on they met 
a company of women, who shouted out: “Why, you lazy old fellow, to 
ride along so comfortably while your poor boy there can hardly keep 
pace by the side of you!” And so the good-natured miller took his boy 
up behind him and both of them rode. As they came to the town a citi- 
zen said to them, “Why, you cruel fellows! You two are better able to 
carry the poor little donkey than he is to carry you.” “Very well,” said 
the miller, “we will try.” So both of them jumped to the ground, got 
some ropes, tied the donkey’s legs to a pole and tried to carry him. 
But as they crossed the bridge the donkey became frightened, kicked 
loose and fell into the stream. 
Procedure. Present the fables in the order in which they 
are given above. The method is to say to the subject: 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
   
   292 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
“ You know what a fable is? You have heard fables?” 
Whatever the answer, proceed to explain a fable as fol- 
lows: “A fable, you know, is a litile story, and is meant to 
teach us a lesson. Now, I am going to read a fable to you. 
Listen carefully, and when I am through I will ask you to 
tell me what lesson the fable teaches us. Ready; listen.” 
After reading the fable, say: ‘‘ What lesson does that teach 
us?” Record the response verbatim and proceed with the 
next as follows: ‘“‘ Here is another. Listen again and tell 
me what lesson this fable teaches us,’ etc. 
As far as possible, avoid comment or commendation until 
all the fables have been given. If the first answer is of an 
inferior type and we express too much satisfaction with it, 
we thereby encourage the subject to continue in his error. 
On the other hand, never express dissatisfaction with a 
response, however absurd or malapropos it may be. Many 
subjects are anxious to know how well they are doing and 
continually ask, “‘ Did I get that one right?” It is sufficient 
to say, “ You are getting along nicely,” or something to 
that effect. Offer no comments, suggestions, or questions 
which might put the subject on the right track. This much 
self-control is necessary if we would make the conditions 
of the test uniform for all subjects. 
The only occasion when a supplementary question is 
permissible is in case of a response whose meaning is not 
clear. Even then we must be cautious and restrict ourselves 
to some such question as, ““What do you mean?” or, “ Ea- 
plain; I don’t quite understand what you mean.” The scor- 
ing of fables is somewhat difficult at best, and this addi- 
tional question is often sufficient to place the response very 
definitely in the right or wrong column. 
Scoring. Give score 2, i.e., 2 points, for a correct answer, 
and 1 for an answer which deserves half credit. The test 
is passed in year XII if 4 points are earned; that is, if two 
   
-P-A-G-E-313
  TEST NO. XII, 5 293 
responses are correct or if one is correct and two deserve 
half credit. 
Score 2 means that the fable has been correctly inter- 
preted and that the lesson it teaches has been stated in 
general terms. 
There are two types of response which may be given half 
credit. They include (1) the interpretations which are 
stated in general terms and are fairly plausible, but are 
not exactly correct; and (2) those which are perfectly correct 
as to substance, but are not generalized. 
We overlook ordinary faults of expression and regard 
merely the essential meaning of the response. 
The only way to explain the method is by giving copious 
illustrations. If the following sample responses are carefully 
studied, a reasonable degree of expertness in scoring fables 
may be acquired with only a limited amount of actual 
practice. The sampling may appear to the reader needlessly 
prolix, but experience has taught us that in giving direc- 
tions for the scoring of tests error always lies on the side of 
taking too much for granted. 
(a) Hercules and the Wagoner 
Full credit; score 2. “God helps those who help themselves.” 
“Do not depend on others.” “Help yourself before calling for 
help.” “It teaches that we should rely upon ourselves.” 
The following are not quite so good, but are nevertheless con- 
sidered satisfactory: “We should always try, even if it looks hard 
and we think we can’t do it.” ‘When in trouble try to get out of 
it yourself.” “We’ve got to do things without help.”’ “Not to be 
lazy.” 
Half credit; score 1. This is most often given for the response 
which contains the correct idea, but states it in terms of the con- 
crete situation, e.g.: “The man ought to have tried himself first.” 
“Hercules wanted to teach the man to help himself.” “The 
driver was too much inclined to depend on others.” “The man 
was too lazy. He should not have called for help until he had
-P-A-G-E-314
  294 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
tried to get out by himself.” “To get out and try instead of 
watching.” 
Unsatisfactory; score 0. Failures are mainly of five varieties: 
(1) generalized interpretations which entirely miss the point; 
(2) crude interpretations which not only miss the point, but are 
also stated in terms of the concrete situation; (3) irrelevant or 
incoherent temarks; (4) efforts to repeat the story; and (5) in- 
ability to respond. 
Sample failures of type (1), entirely incorrect generalizations: 
“Teaches us to look where we are going.” “Not to ask for any- 
thing when there is no one to help.” “To help those who are in 
trouble.” “Teaches us to be polite.” “How to help others.” 
“Not to be cruel to horses.” “Always to do what people tell you” 
(or “obey orders,” etc.). “Not to be foolish” (or stupid, etc.). 
“Tf you would have a thing well done, do it yourself.” 
Failures of type (2), crude interpretations stated in concrete 
terms: “How to get out of the mud.” “Not to get stuck in the 
mud.” “To carry a stick along to pry yourself out if you get into 
a mud-hole.” ‘To help any one who is stuck in the mud.” 
“Taught Hercules to help the horses along and not whip them too 
hard.” “Not to be mean like Hercules.” 
Failures of type (3), irrelevant responses: “It was foolish not to 
thank him.” “He should have helped the driver.” ‘Hercules was 
mean.” “If any one helps himself the horses will try.” ‘The 
driver should have done what Hercvles told him.” “He wanted 
the man to help the oxen.” 
Type (4): Efforts to repeat the story. 
Type (5): Inability to respond. 
(6) The Maid and the Eggs 
Full credit; score 2. “Teaches us not to build air-castles.” 
“Don’t count your chickens before they are hatched.” ‘Not to 
plan too far ahead.” Slightly inferior, but still acceptable: “Never 
make too many plans.” “Don’t count on the second thing till you 
have done the first.” 
Half credit; score 1. “Tt teaches us not to have our minds on 
the future when we carry milk on the head.” “Shewas building air- 
castles and so lost her milk.” “She was planning too far ahead.” 
The responses just given are examples of fairly correct inter- 
pretations in non-generalized terms. The following are examples of 
generalized interpretations which fall below the accuracy required
-P-A-G-E-315

for full credit: ‘“Never make plans.” ‘‘Not to be too proud.” “To 
keep our mind on what we are doing.” “Don’t cross a bridge till 
you come to it.”” “Don’t count your eggs before they are hatched.” 
“Not to be wanting things; learn to wait.” “Not to imagine; go 
ahead and do it.” 
Unsatisfactory; score 0. Type (1), entirely incorrect generaliza- 
tion: “That money does not buy everything.” “Not to be greedy.” 
“Not to be selfish.” “Not to waste things.” “Not to take risks 
like that.” “Not to think about clothes.” “Count your chickens 
before they are hatched.” 
Type (2), very crude interpretations stated in concrete terms: 
“Not to carry milk on the head.” “Teaches her to watch and not 
throw down her head.” ‘To carry her head straight.” ‘Not to 
spill milk.” “To keep your chickens and you will make more 
money.” 
Type (3), irrelevant responses: “She wanted the money.” 
“Teaches us to read and write” (18-year-old of 8-year intelligence). 
“About a girl who was selling some milk.” 
Type (4), effort to repeat the story. 
Type (5), inability to respond. 
(c) The Fox and the Crow 
Full credit; score 2. “Teaches us not to listen to flattery.” 
“Don’t let yourself be flattered.” “It is not safe to believe people 
who flatter us.” ‘We had better look out for people who brag on 
uss 
Half credit; score 1. Correct idea in concrete terms: “The crow 
was so proud of herself that she lost all she had.” “The crow 
listened to flattery and got left.”” ‘Not to be proud and let people 
think you can sing when you can’t.” “If anybody brags on you 
don’t sing or do what he tells you.” 
Pertinent but somewhat inferior generalizations: “Not to be too 
proud.” “Pride goes before a fall.” “To be on our guard against 
people who are our enemies.” ‘Not to do everything people tell 
you.” “Don’t trust every slick fellow you meet.” 
Unsatisfactory; score 0. Type (1), incorrect generalization: “Not 
to go with people you don’t know.” “Not to be selfish.” “To 
share your food.” “‘ Look before you leap.” “‘ Not to listen to evil.” 
“Not to steal.” “Teaches honesty.” “Not to covet.” “Think for 
yourself.”” “Teaches wisdom.” “Never listen to advice.” “Never 
let any one get ahead of you.” “To figure out what they are going

your beauty.” “To swallow it before you sing.” “To be on your 
watch when you have food in your mouth.” 
Type (8), irrelevant responses: ‘“‘The fox was greedy.” “The 
fox was slicker than what the crow was.” “The crow ought not to 
have opened her mouth.” “The crow should just have shaken her 
head.’ “It served the crow right for stealing the meat.” ‘The 
fox wanted the meat and just told the crow that to get it.” ‘‘Fool- 
ishness.” “Guess that’s where the old fox got his name — ‘Old 
Foxy’ — Don’t teach us anything.” 
Type (4), efforts to repeat the story.

Remarks. The fable test, or the “ test of generalization,” 
as it may aptly be named, was used by the writer in a study 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
  298 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
of the intellectual processes of bright and dull boys in 1905, 
and was further standardized by the writer and Mr. Childs 
in 1911.” It has proved its worth in a number of investiga- 
tions. It has been necessary, however, to simplify the rather 
elaborate method of scoring which was proposed in 1911, 
not because of any logical fault of the method, but because 
of the difficulty in teaching examiners to use the system 
correctly. The method explained above is somewhat coarser, 
but it has the advantage of being much easier to learn. 
The generalization test presents for interpretation situa- 
tions which are closely paralleled in the everyday social 
experience of human beings. It tests the subject’s ability 
to understand motives underlying acts or attitudes. It 
gives a clue to the status of the social consciousness. 
This is highly important in the diagnosis of the upper range 
of mental defectiveness. The criterion of the subnormal’s 
fitness for life outside an institution is his ability to under- 
stand social relations and to adjust himself to them. Fail- 
ure of a subnormal to meet this criterion may lead him to 
break common conventions, and to appear disrespectful, 
sulky, stubborn, or in some other way queer and exceptional. 
He is likely to be misunderstood, because he so easily mis- 
understands others. The skein of human motives is too 
complex for his limited intelligence to untangle. 
Ethnological studies have shown in an interesting way the 
social origin of the moral judgment. The rectitude of the 
moral life, therefore, depends on the accuracy of the social 
judgment. It would be interesting to know what propor- 
tion of offenders have transgressed moral codes because of 
continued failure to grasp the essential lessons presented by 
human situations.

For the intelligent child even the common incidents of 
life carry an endless succession of lessons in right conduct. 
On the average school playground not an hour passes with- 
out some happening which is fraught with a moral hint to 
those who have intelligence enough to generalize the situa- 
tion. A boy plays unfairly and is barred from the game. 
One bullies his weaker companion and arouses the anger and 
scorn of all his fellows. Another vents his braggadocio and 
feels at once the withering scorn of those who listen. 
Laziness, selfishness, meanness, dishonesty, ingratitude, 
inconstancy, inordinate pride, and the countless other 
faults all have their social penalties. The child of normal 
intelligence sees the point, draws the appropriate lesson 
and (provided emotions and will are also normal) applies 
it more or less effectively as a guide to his own conduct. 
To the feeble-minded child, all but lacking in the power of 
abstraction and generalization, the situation conveys no 
such lesson. It is but a muddle of concrete events without 
general significance; or even if its meaning is vaguely appre- 
hended, the powers of inhibition are insufficient to guaran- 
tee that right action will follow. 
It is for this reason that the generalization test is so 
valuable in the mental examinations of delinquents. It 
presents a moral situation, imagined, to be sure, but none 
the less real to the individual of normal comprehension. 
It tells us quickly whether the subject tested is able to 
see beyond the incidents of the given situation and to grasp 
their wider relations — whether he is able to generalize the 
concrete. 
The following responses made by feeble-minded delin- 
quents from 16 to 21 years of age demonstrate sufficiently 
their inability to comprehend the moral situation: — 
Hercules and the Wagoner. “Teaches you to look where you are 
going.” “Not to help any one who is stuck in the mud.” “Not 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
3800 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
to whip oxen.” “Teaches that Hercules was mean.” “Teaches 
us to carry a stick along to pry the wheels out.” 
The Fox and the Crow. “Not to sing when eating.” ‘To keep 
away from strangers.” ‘To swallow it before you sing.” “Not to 
be stingy.” “Not to listen to evil.” ‘The fox was wiser than the 
crow.” “Not to be selfish with food.” “Not to do two things at 
once.” “To hang on to what you’ve got.” 
The Farmer and the Stork. “Teaches the stork to look where he 
steps.” “Not to be cruel like the farmer.” “Not to tell lies.” “Not 
to butt into other people’s things.” “To be kind to birds.” 
“Teaches us how to get rid of troublesome people.” “Never go 
with anything else.” 
The following are the responses of an 18-year-old delin- 
quent (intelligence level 10 years) to the five fables: — 
Maid and Eggs. ‘“‘She was thinking about getting the dress and 
spilled the milk. Teaches selfishness.” 
Hercules and the Wagoner. “He wanted to help the oxen out.” 
Fox and Crow. “Guess that’s where the fox got his name — 
“Old Foxy.’ Don’t teach us anything.” 
Farmer and Stork. “Try and help the stork out of the field.” 
Miller, Son, and Donkey. “They was all big fools and mean to 
the donkey.” 
One does not require very profound psychological in- 
sight to see that a person of this degree of comprehension 
is not promising material for moral education. His weak- 
ness in the ability to generalize a moral situation is not due 
to lack of instruction, but is inherent in the nature of his 
mental processes, all of which have the infantile quality of 
average 9- or 10-year intelligence. Well-instructed normal 
children of 10 years ordinarily succeed no better. The 
ability to draw the correct lesson from a social situation is 
little developed below the mental level of 12 or 13 years. 
The test is also valuable because it throws light on the 
subject’s ability to appreciate the finer shades of meaning. 
The mentally retarded often show marked inferiority in this 
 
-P-A-G-E-321
  TEST NO. XII, 6 301 
respect. They sense, perhaps, in a general way the trend of 
the story, but they fail to comprehend much that to us 
seems clearly expressed. They do not get what is left for 
the reader to infer, because they are insensible to the thought 
.fringes. It is these which give meaning to the fable. The 
dull subject may be able to image the objects and activi- 
ties described, but taken in the rough such imagery gets 
him nowhere. 
Finally, the test is almost free from the danger of coach- 
ing. The subject who has been given a number of fables 
along with twenty-five or thirty other tests can as a rule 
give only hazy and inaccurate testimony as to what he 
has been put through. Moreover, we have found that, even 
if a subject has previously heard a fable, that fact does not 
materially increase his chances of giving a correct interpre- 
tation. If the situation depicted in the fable is beyond the 
subject’s power of comprehension even explicit instruction 
has little effect upon the quality of the response. 
Incidentally, this observation raises the question whether 
the use of proverbs, mottoes, fables, poetry, etc., in the 
moral instruction of children may not often be futile be- 
cause the material is not fitted to the child’s power of com- 
prehension. Much of the school’s instruction in history 
and literature has a moral purpose, but there is reason to 
suspect that in this field schools often make precocious at- 
tempts in “ generalizing ” exercises.

  302 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
XII, 7. Interpretation of pictures 
Procedure. Use the same pictures as in III, 1, and VII, 
2, and the additional picture d. Present in the same order. 
The formula to begin with is identical with that in VII. 
2: “ Tell me what this picture is about. What is this a pic- 
ture of?” This formula is chosen because it does not sug- 
gest specifically either description or interpretation, and is 
therefore adapted to show the child’s spontaneous or natu- 
ral mode of apperception. However, in case, this formula 
fails to bring spontaneous interpretation for three of the 
four pictures, we then return to those pictures on which 
the subject has failed and give a second trial with the for- 
mula: “ Explain this picture.” A good many subjects who 
failed to interpret the pictures spontaneously do so with- 
out difficulty when the more specific formula is used. 
If the response is so brief as to be difficult to classify, 
the subject should be urged to amplify by some such in- 
junction as “Go ahead,” or “ Explain what you mean.” 
One more caution. It is necessary to refrain from voic- 
ing a single word of commendation or approval until all 
the pictures have been responded to. A moment’s thought 
will reveal the absolute necessity of adhering to this rule. 
Often a subject will begin by giving an inferior type of 
response (description, say) to the first picture, but with the 
second picture adjusts better to the task and responds satis- 
factorily. If in such a case the first (unsatisfactory) re- 
sponse were greeted with an approving “ That’s fine, you 
are doing splendidly,” the likelihood of any improvement 
taking place as the test proceeds would be greatly lessened. 
Scoring. Three pictures out of four must be satisfactorily 
interpreted. ‘“‘ Satisfactorily ” means that the interpreta- 
tion given should be reasonably plausible; not necessarily 
the exact one the artist had in mind, yet not absurd. The 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  TEST NO. XI, 7 303 
following classified responses will serve as a fairly secure 
guide for scoring: — 
(a) Dutch Home 
Satisfactory. “Child has spilled something and is getting a 
scolding.” “The baby has hurt herself and the mother is com- 
forting her.” ‘The baby is crying because she is hungry and the 
mother has nothing to give her.” “The little girl has been naughty 
and is about to be punished.” “The baby is crying because she 
does not like her dinner.” ‘“There’s bread on the table and the 
mother won’t let the little girl have it and so she is crying.” “The 
baby is begging for something and is crying because her mamma 
won’t give it to her.” “It’s a poor family. The father is dead and 
they don’t have enough to eat.” 
Unsatisfactory. ‘The baby is crying and the mother is looking 
at her ” (description). “It’s in Holland, and there’s a little girl 
crying, and a mamma, and there’s a dish on the table” (mainly 
description). “The mother is teaching the child to walk” (absurd 
interpretation). 
(b) River Scene 
Satisfactory. “‘Man and lady eloping to get married and an 
Indian to row for them.” “I think it represents a honeymoon 
trip.” “In frontier days and a man and his wife have been captured 
by the Indians.” “It’s a perilous journey and they have engaged 
the Indian to row for them.” 
Unsatisfactory. “They are shooting the rapids.” “An Indian 
rowing a man and his wife down the river” (mainly description). 
“A storm at sea” (absurd interpretation). “Indians have rescued 
a couple from a shipwreck.” ‘They have been up the river and 
are riding down the rapids.” 
The following responses are somewhat doubtful, but should 
probably be scored minus: “People going out hunting and have 
Indian for a guide.” “The man has rescued the woman from the 
Indians.” “It’s a camping trip.” 
(c) Post-Office 
Satisfactory. “It’s a lot of old farmers. They have come to the 
post-office to get the paper, which only comes once a week, and 
they are all happy.” “There’s something funny in the paper about 
one of the men and they are all laughing about it.” “They are  
-P-A-G-E-324
  304 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
reading about the price of eggs, and they look very happy so I 
guess the price has gone up.” “It’s a bunch of country politicians 
reading the election news.” 
Unsatisfactory. “A man has just come out of the post-office 
and is reading to his friends.” “It’s a little country town and they 
are looking at the paper.” “‘A man is reading the paper and the 
others are looking on and laughing.” “Some men are reading a 
paper and laughing, and the other man has brought some eggs to 
market, and it’s in a little country town.” (All the above are 
mainly description.) 
Responses like the following are somewhat better, but hardly 
satisfactory: “They are reading something funny in the paper.” 
“They are reading the ads.” “They are laughing about something 
in the newspaper,” etc. 
(d) Colonial Home 
Satisfactory. ‘They are lovers and have quarreled.”’ “The man 
has to go away for a long time, maybe to war, and she is afraid 
he won’t return.” “He has proposed and she has rejected him, 
and she is crying because she hated to disappoint him.” ‘The 
woman is crying because her husband is angry and leaving 
her.” “The man is a messenger and has brought the woman bad 
news.” 
Unsatisfactory. “The husband is leaving and the dog is looking 
at the lady.” “It’s a picture to show how people dressed in 
colonial times.” ‘‘The lady is crying and the man is trying to 
comfort her.” “The man is going away. The woman is angry 
because he is going. The dog has a ball in its mouth and looks 
happy, and the man looks sad.” 
Such responses as the following are doubtful, but rather minus 
than plus: “A picture of George Washington’s home.” “They 
have lost their money and they are sad” (gratuitous interpreta- 
tion). “The man has struck the woman.” 
Doubt sometimes arises as to the proper scoring of imaginative 
or gratuitous interpretations. The following are samples of such: 
(a) “The little girl is crying because she wants a new dress and the 
mother is telling her she can have one when Christmas comes if 
she will be good.” (6) “The man and woman have gone up the river 
to visit some friends and an Indian guide is bringing them home.” 
(c) “Some old Rubes are reading about a circus that’s going to 
come.” (d) “Napoleon leaving his wife.”
-P-A-G-E-325
  ‘TEST NO. XI, 7 805 
Sometimes these imaginative responses are given by 
very bright subjects, under the impression that they are 
asked to “make up” a story based on the picture. We 
may score them plus, provided they are not too much out 
of harmony with the situation and actions represented in 
the picture. Interpretations so gratuitous as to have little 
or no bearing upon the scene depicted should be scored 
minus. 
Remarks. The test of picture interpretation has been 
variously located from 12 to 15 years. It cannot be too 
strongly emphasized that everything depends on the na- 
ture of the pictures used, the form in which the question 
is put, and the standard for scoring. The Jingleman-Jack 
pictures used by Kuhlmann are as easy to interpret at 
10 years as the Stanford pictures at 12. Spontaneous in- 
terpretation (‘‘ What is this a picture of?” or ““ What do 
you see in this picture? ”) comes no more readily at 14 
years than provoked interpretation (“Explain this pic- 
ture’) at 12. The standard of scoring is no less important. 
If with the Stanford pictures we require three satisfactory 
responses out of four, the test belongs at the 12-year level, 
but the standard of two correct out of four can be met a 
year or two earlier. 
Even after we have agreed upon a given series of pictures, 
the formula for giving the test, and upon the requisite 
number of passes, there remains still the question as to the 
proper degree of liberality in deciding what constitutes 
interpretation. There is no single point in mental develop- 
ment where the “ability to interpret pictures” sweeps 
in with a rush. Like the development of most other abili- 
ties, it comes by slow degrees, beginning even as early as 
6 years. 
The question is, therefore, to decide whether a given re- 
sponse contains as much and as good interpretation as
-P-A-G-E-326
  806 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
we have a right to expect at the age level where the test 
has been placed. It is imperative for any one who would 
use the scale correctly to acquaint himself thoroughly 
with the procedure and standards described above. 
XI, 8. Giving similarities, three things 
Procedure. The procedure is the same as in VIII, 4, 
but with the following words: — 
(a) Snake, cow, sparrow. 
(b) Book, teacher, newspaper. 
(c) Wool, cotton, leather. 
(d) Knife-blade, penny, piece of wire. 
(e) Rose, potato, tree. 
As before, a little tactful urging is occasionally neces- 
sary in order to secure a response. 
Scoring. Three satisfactory responses out of five are neces- 
sary for success. Any real similarity is acceptable, whether 
fundamental or superficial, although the giving of fun- 
damental likenesses is especially symptomatic of good 
intelligence. 
Failures may be classified under four heads: (1) Leaving 
one of the words out of consideration; (2) giving a difference 
instead of a similarity; (3) giving a similarity that is not 
real or that is too bizarre or far-fetched; and (4) inability 
to respond. Types (1), (3), and (4) are almost equally 
numerous, while type (2) is not often encountered at this 
level of intelligence. 
This test provokes doubtful responses somewhat oftener 
than the earlier test of giving similarities. Those giving 
greatest difficulty are the indefinite statements like “ All 
are useful,” “‘ All are made of the same material,” etc. 
Fortunately, in most of these dies an additional question 
is sufficient to determine whether the subject has in mind  
-P-A-G-E-327
  
TEST. NO. XI, 8 307 
a real similarity. Questions suitable for this purpose are: 
“ Explain what you mean,” “‘ In what respect are they all 
useful? ” ‘‘ What material do you mean?” etc. Of course 
it is only permissible to make use of supplementary ques- 
tions of this kind when they are necessary in order to clarify 
"a response which has already been made. 
While the amateur examiner is likely to have more or 
less trouble in deciding upon scores, this difficulty rapidly 
disappears with experience. The following samples of satis- 
factory and unsatisfactory responses will serve as a fairly 
adequate guide in dealing with doubtful cases: — 
(a) Snake, cow, sparrow 
Satisfactory. “All are animals” (or creatures, etc.). ‘All live 
on the land.” “All have blood” (or flesh, bones, eyes, skin, etc.). 
“All move about.” “All breathe air.” “All are useful” (plus only 
if subject can give a use which they have in common). “All have 
a little intelligence” (or sense, instinct, etc.). 
Unsatisfactory. “All have legs.” “All are dangerous.” “All 
feed on grain” (or grass, etc.). “All are much afraid of man.” “All 
frighten you.” “All are warm-blooded.” “All get about the same 
way.” “All walk on the ground.” “All can bite.” ‘All holler.” 
“All drink water.” “A snake crawls, a cow walks, and a sparrow 
flies” (or some other difference). ‘They are not alike.” 
(b) Book, teacher, newspaper 
Satisfactory. “Allteach.” ‘You learn from all.” “All give you 
information.” “All help you get an education.” “All are your 
good friends” (plus if subject can explain how). “All are useful” 
(plus if subject can explain how). 
Unsatisfactory. “All tell you the news.” “A teacher writes, 
and a book and newspaper have writing.” “They are not alike.” 
“All read.” “All use the alphabet.” 
(c) Wool, cotton, leather 
Satisfactory. “All used for clothing.” ‘We wear them all.” 
“All grow” (plus if subject can explain). “All have to be sent ta 
the factory to be made into things.” “All are useful” (plus ‘if
-P-A-G-E-328
  308 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
subject can give a use which all have in common). “All are valu- 
able” (plus if explained). 
Unsatisfactory. “All come from plants.” “All grow on animals.” 
“All came off the top of something.” “All are things.” “They are 
pretty.” “All spell alike.” “All are furry” (or soft, hard, etc.). 
(d) Knife-blade, penny, piece of wire 
Satisfactory. “All are made from minerals” (or metals). “All 
come from mines.” “All are hard material.” 
Unsatisfactory. “All are made of steel” (or copper, iron, ete.). 
“All are made of the same metal.” “All cut.” “All bend easily.” 
“All are used in building a house.” “All are worthless.” “All are 
useful in fixing things.” “All have an end.” “They are small.” 
“All weigh the same.” “Can get them all at a hardware store.” 
“You can buy things with all of them.” “You buy them with 
money.” “One is sharp, one is round, and one is long” (or some 
other difference). 
Such answers as “All are found in a boy’s pocket,” or “Boys 
like them,” are not altogether bad, but hardly deserve to be called 
satisfactory. “All are useful’’ is minus unless the subject can give 
a use which they have in common, which in this case he is not 
likely to do. Bizarre uses are also minus; as, “All are good for a 
watch fob,” “‘Can use all for paper weights,” etc. 
(e) Rose, potato, tree 
Satisfactory. “All are plants.” “All grow from the ground.” 
** All have leaves”’ (or roots, etc.). “All have to be planted.” “All 
are parts of nature.” “All have colors.” 
Unsatisfactory. “All are pretty.” “All bear fruit.” “All have 
pretty flowers.” “All grow on bushes.” “All are valuable” (or 
useful). “They grow close to a house.” “All are ornamental.” 
“All are shrubbery.” 
Remarks. The words of each series lend themselves read- 
ily to classification into a next higher class. This is the best 
type of response, but with most of the series it accounts for 
less than two thirds of the successes among subjects of 
12-year intelligence. The proportion is less than one third 
for subjects of 10-year intelligence and nearly three fourths 
at the 14-year level. It would be possible and very desir-

able to devise and standardize an additional test of this 
kind, but requiring the giving of an essential resemblance 
or classificatory similarity. 
For discussion of the psychological factors involved in 
the similarities test, see VII, 5.

  CHAPTER XVIII 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR YEAR XIV. 
XIV, 1. Vocabulary (fifty definitions, 9000 words) 
Procedure and Scoring, as in VIII, X, and XII. At 
year XIV fifty words must be correctly defined. 
XIV, 2. Induction test: finding a rule 
Procedure. Provide six sheets of thin blank paper, say 
81% X 11 inches. Take the first sheet, and telling the sub- 
ject to watch what you do, fold it once, and in the middle 
of the folded edge tear out or cut out a small notch; then 
ask the subject to tell you how many holes there will be in 
the paper when it is unfolded. The correct answer, one, is 
nearly always given without hesitation. But whatever the 
answer, unfold the paper and hold it up broadside for the 
subject’s inspection. Next, take another sheet, fold it 
once as before and say: “Now, when we folded it this way 
and tore out a piece, you remember it made one hole in the 
paper. This time we will give the paper another fold and 
see how many holes we shall have.”” Then proceed to fold 
the paper again, this time in the other direction, and tear 
out a piece from the folded side and ask how many holes 
there will be when the paper is unfolded. After recording the 
answer, unfold the paper, hold it yp before the subject so 
as to let him see the result. The answer is often incorrect 
and the unfolded sheet is greeted with an exclamation of
-P-A-G-E-331
  
TEST NO. XIV, 2 311 
surprise. The governing principle is seldom made out at 
this stage of the experiment. But regardless of the cor- 
rectness or incorrectness of the first and second answers, 
proceed with the third sheet. Fold it once and say: “ When 
we folded it this way there was one hole.” Then fold it again 
and say: “And when we folded it this way there were two 
holes.” At this point fold the paper a third time and say: 
“Now, I am folding it again. How many holes will it have 
this time when I unfold it?’ Record the answer and again 
unfold the paper while the subject looks on. 
Continue in the same manner with sheets four, five, and 
six, adding one fold each time. In folding each sheet recap- 
itulate the results with the previous sheets, saying (with the 
sixth, for example): “ When we folded it this way there was 
one hole, when we folded it again there were two, when we 
folded it again there were four, when we folded it again there 
were eight, when we folded it again there were sixteen; now, 
tell me how many holes there will be if we fold it once more.” 
In the recapitulation avoid the expression “ When we folded 
it once, twice, three times,” etc., as this often leads the sub- 
ject to double the numeral heard instead of doubling the 
number of holes in the previously folded sheet. After the 
answer is given, do not fail to unfold the paper and let the 
subject view the result. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the rule is grasped by the 
time the sixth sheet is reached; that is, the subject may 
pass after five incorrect responses, provided the sixth is 
correct and the governing rule can then be given. It is 
not permissible to ask for the rule until all six parts of the 
experiment have been given. Nothing must be said which 
could even suggest the operation of a rule. Often, however, 
the subject grasps the principle after two or three steps and 
gives it spontaneously. In this case it is unnecessary to 
proceed with the remaining steps. 
   
-P-A-G-E-332
  312 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Remarks. This test was first used by the writer in a 
comparative study of the intellectual processes of bright 
and dull boys in 1905, but it was not standardized until 
1914. Rather extensive data indicate that it is a genuine 
test of intelligence. Of 14-year-old school children testing 
between 96 and 105 I Q, 59 per cent passed this test; of 
14-year-olds testing below 96 I Q, 41 per cent passed; 
of those testing above 105, 71 per cent passed. That is, 
the test agrees well with the results obtained by the scale 
as a whole. Of “average adults” only 10 per cent fail; 
and of “ superior adults,” fewer than 5 per cent. As a rule, 
the higher the grade of intelligence, the fewer the steps 
necessary for grasping the rule. Of the superior adults, only 
35 per cent fail to get the rule as early as the end of the 
fourth step. 
The test is little affected by schooling, and apart from 
differences in intelligence it is little influenced by age. 
Other advantages of the test are the keen interest it always 
arouses and its independence of language ability. It has 
been used successfully with immigrant subjects who had 
been in this country but a few months. 
We have named the experiment an “ induction test.” 
It might be supposed that the solution would ordinarily be 
arrived at by deduction, or by an a-priori logical analysis 
of the principle involved. This, however, is rarely the case. 
Not one average adult out of ten reasons out the situation 
in this purely logical manner. It is ordinarily only after 
one or more mistakes have been made and have been ex- 
posed by the examiner holding up the unfolded paper to 
view that the correct principle is grasped. In the absence 
of deductive reasoning the subject must note that each un- 
folded sheet contains twice as many holes as the previous 
one, and must infer that folding the paper again will 
again double the number. The ability tested is the ability ‘
-P-A-G-E-333
TEST NO. XIV, 3 313 
to generalize from particulars where the common element 
of the particulars can be discerned only by the selective 
action of attention, in this case attention to the fact that 
each number is the double of its predecessor. 
XIV, 3. Giving differences between a president 
and a king 
Procedure. Say: “‘ There are three main differences be- 
tween a president and a king; what are they?” If the subject 
stops after one difference is given, we urge him on, if possi- 
ble, until three are given. 
Scoring. The three differences relate to power, tenure, 
and manner of accession. Only these differences are con- 
sidered correct, and the successful response must include 
at least two of the three. We disregard crudities of expres- 
sion and note merely whether the subject has the essential 
idea. As regards power, for example, any of the following 
responses are satisfactory: “‘ The king is absolute and the 
president is not.” ‘‘ The king rules by himself, but the presi- 
dent rules with the help of the people.” “‘ Kings can have 
things their own way more than presidents can,” etc. 
It may be objected that the reverse of this is sometimes 
true, that the king of to-day often has less power than the 
average president. Sometimes subjects mention this fact, 
and when they do we credit them with this part of the test. 
As a matter of fact, however, this answer is seldom given. 
Sometimes the subject does not stop until he has given 
a half-dozen or more differences, and in such cases the 
first three differences may be trivial and some of the later 
ones essential. The question then arises whether we should 
disregard the errors and pass the subject on his later cor- 
rect responses. The rule in such cases is to ask the subject 
to pick out the “ three main differences.”
-P-A-G-E-334
  314 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Sometimes accession and tenure are given in the form of a 
single contrast, as: “The president is elected, but the 
king inherits his throne and rules for life.” This answer 
entitles the subject to credit for both accession and tenure, 
the contrast as regards tenure being plainly implied. 
Unsatisfactory contrasts are of many kinds and are often 
amusing. Some of the most common are the following: — 
“A king wears a crown.” “A king has jewels.” “A king sits on 
a throne.” (‘‘A king sets on a thorn” as one feeble-minded boy 
put it!) “A king lives in a palace.” ‘A king has courtiers.” “A 
king is very dignified.” “A king dresses up more.” “A president 
has less pomp and ceremony.” “A president is more ready to re- 
ceive the people.” “A king sits on a chair all the time and a presi- 
dent does not.” “No differences; it’s just names.” “A president 
does not give titles.” “A king has a larger salary.” “A king has 
royal blood.” ‘A king is in more danger.” “They have a different 
title.” “A king is more cruel.” “Kings have people beheaded.” 
“*A king rules in a monarchy and a president in a republic.” “A 
king rules in a foreign country.” “A president is elected and a 
king fights for his office.” ‘‘A president appoints governors and a 
king does not.” “A president lets the lawyers make the laws.” 
“Everybody works for a king.” 
It is surprising to see how often trivial differences like 
the above are given. About thirty “ average adults ” out 
of a hundred, including high-school students, give at least 
one unsatisfactory contrast. 
The test has been criticized as depending too much on 
schooling. The criticism is to a certain extent valid when 
the test is used with young subjects, say of 10 or 12 years. 
It is not valid, however, if the use of the test is confined to 
older subjects. With the latter, it is not a test of knowledge, 
but of the discriminative capacity to deal with knowledge 
already in the possession of the subject. It would be diffi- 
cult to find an adult, not actually feeble-minded, who is 
ignorant of the facts called for: That the king inherits his
-P-A-G-E-335
  TEST NO. XIV, 4 315 
throne, while the president is elected; that the tenure of 
the king is for life, and that of the president for a term of 
years; that kings ordinarily have, or are supposed to have, 
more power. Even the relatively stupid adult knows this; 
but he also knows that kings are different from presidents 
in having crowns, thrones, palaces, robes, courtiers, larger 
pay, etc., and he makes no discrimination as regards the 
relative importance of these differences. 
The test is psychologically related to that of giving dif- 
ferences in year VIII and to the two tests of finding similari- 
ties; but it differs from these in requiring a comparison 
based on fundamental rather than accidental distinctions. 
The idea is good and should be worked out in additional 
tests of the same type. 
The test first appeared in the Binet revised scale of 1911. 
Kuhlmann omits it, and besides our own there are few statis- 
tics bearing on it. Our results show that if two essential 
differences are required, the test belongs where we have 
placed it, but that if only one essential difference is required, 
the test is easy enough for year XII. 
XIV, 4. Problem questions 
Procedure. Say to the subject: “ Listen, and see if you 
can understand what I read.” Then read the following 
three problems, rather slowly and with expression, pausing 
after each long enough for the subject to find an answer: — 
(a) A man who was walking in the woods near a city stopped sud- 
denly, very much frightened, and then ran to the nearest police- 
man, saying that he had just seen hanging from the limb of a 
treea... a what?” 
(b) “My neighbor has been having queer visitors. First a doctor 
came to his house, then a lawyer, then a minister (preacher or 
priest). What do you think happened there?”
-P-A-G-E-336
  316 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
(c) “An Indian who had come to town for the first time in his life 
saw a white man riding along the street. As the white man rode 
by, the Indian said — ‘The white man is lazy; he walks sitting 
down.’ What was the white man riding on that caused the 
Indian to say, ‘He walks sitting down’?” 
Do not ask questions calculated to draw out the correct 
response, but wait in silence for the subject’s spontaneous 
answer. It is permissible, however, to re-read the passage 
if the subject requests it. 
Scoring. Two responses out of three must be satisfactory. 
The following explanations and examples will make clear 
the requirements of the test: —~- 
(a) What the man saw hanging 
Satisfactory. The only correct answer for the first is “A man 
who had hung himself” (or who had committed suicide, been 
hanged, etc.). We may also pass the following answer: “Dead 
branches that looked like a man hanging.” 
A good many subjects answer simply, ““A man.” This answer 
cannot be scored because of the impossibility of knowing what is 
in the subject’s mind, and in such cases it is always necessary to 
say: “Explain what you mean.” The answer to this interrogation 
always enables us to score the response. 
Unsatisfactory. There is an endless variety of failures: “A 
snake,” “A monkey,” “A robber,” or “A tramp” being the most 
common. Others include such answers as “A bear,” “A tiger,” “A 
wild cat,” “A cat,” “A bird,” “An eagle,” “A bird’s nest,” “A 
hornet’s nest,” “A leaf,” “A swing,” “A boy in a swing,” “A bas- 
ket of flowers,” “An egg,” “A ghost,” “A white sheet,” “Clothes,” 
“A purse,” etc. 
(b) My neighbor 
Satisfactory. The expected answer is “‘A death,” “Some one has 
died,” ete. We must always check up this response, however, by 
asking what the lawyer came for, and this must also be answered 
correctly. 
While it is expected that the subject will understand that the 
doctor came to attend a sick person, the lawyer to make his will,
-P-A-G-E-337
  
TEST NO. XIV, 4 31% 
and the minister to preach the funeral, there are a few other in- 
genious interpretations which pass as satisfactory. For example, 
“A man got hurt in an accident; the doctor came to make him well, 
the lawyer to see about damages, and then he died and the preacher 
came for the funeral.” Or, “‘A man died, the lawyer came to help 
the widow settle the estate and the preacher came for the funeral.” 
We can hardly expect the 14-year-old child to know that it is not 
the custom to settle an estate until after the funeral. 
The following excellent response was given by an enlightened 
young eugenist: ““A marriage; the doctor came to examine them 
and see if they were fit to marry, the lawyer to arrange the mar- 
riage settlement, and the minister to marry them.” The following 
logical responses occurred once each: ““A murder. The doctor 
came to examine the body, the lawyer to get evidence, and the 
preacher to preach the funeral.” “An unmarried girl has given 
birth to a child. The lawyer was employed to get the man to marry 
her and then the preacher came to perform the wedding ceremony.” 
Perhaps some will consider this interpretation too far-fetched to 
pass. But it is perfectly logical and, unfortunately, represents an 
occurrence which is not so very rare. 
If an incorrect answer is first given and then corrected, the cor- 
rection is accepted. 
Unsatisfactory. The failures again are quite varied, but are most 
frequently due to failure to understand the lawyer’s mission. Of 
66 tabulated failures, 26 are accounted for in this way, while only 
6 are due to inability to state the part played by the minister. 
The most common incorrect responses are: “A baby born” (ac- 
counting for 5 out of 66 failures) ; “A divorce” (very common with 
the children tested by Dr. Ordahl, at Reno, Nevada!); “A mar- 
riage”; “A divorce and a remarriage”’; “A dinner”; “‘An enter- 
tainment”’; “Some friends came to chat,” etc. In 20 failures out of 
66, marriage was incorrectly connected with a will, a divorce, the 
death of a child, ete. 
The following are not bad, but hardly deserve to pass: “Sick- 
ness and trouble; the lawyer and minister came to help him out of 
trouble.”’ Or, “Somebody was sick; the lawyer wanted his money 
and the minister came to see how he was.”’ A few present a still 
more logical interpretation, but so far-fetched that it is doubtful 
whether they should count as passes; for example: “A man and 
his wife had a fight. One got hurt and had to have the doctor, then 
they had a lawyer to get them divorced, then the minister came to  
-P-A-G-E-338
  818 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
marry one of them.” Again, “Some one is dying and is getting 
married and making his will before he dies.” 
(c) What the man was riding on 
The only correct response is “Bicycle.” The most common 
error is horse (or donkey), accounting for 48 out of 71 tabulated 
failures. Vehicles, like wagon, buggy, automobile, or street car, were 
mentioned in 14 out of 71 failures. Bizarre replies are: “A cripple 
in a wheel chair”; “A person riding on some one’s back,” ete. 
Remarks. The experiment is a form of the completion 
test. Elements of a situation are given, out of which the 
entire situation is to be constructed. This phase of intelli- 
gence has already been discussed.1 
While it is generally admitted that the underlying idea 
of this test is good, some have criticized Binet’s selection 
of problems. Meumann thinks the lawyer element of the 
second is so unfamiliar to children as to render that part 
of the test unfair. Several “‘ armchair” critics have men- 
tioned the danger of nervous shock from the first problem. 
Bobertag throws out the test entirely and substitutes a 
completion test modeled after that of Ebbinghaus. Our 
own results are altogether favorable to the test. If it is 
used in year XIV, Meumann’s objection hardly holds, for 
American children of that age do ordinarily know some- 
thing about making wills. As for the danger of shock from 
the first problem, we have never once found the slightest 
evidence of this much-feared result. The subject always 
understands that the situation depicted is hypothetical, 
and so answers either in a matter-of-fact manner or with 
a laugh. 
The bicycle problem is our own invention. Binet used 
the other two and required both to be answered correctly. 
The test was located in year XII of the 1908 scale, and in

year XV of the 1911 revision. Goddard and Kuhlmann 
retain it in the original location. The Stanford results of 
1911, 1912, 1914, and 1915 agree in showing the test too 
difficult for year XII, even when only two out of three cor- 
rect responses are required. If the original form of the ex- 
periment is used, it is exceedingly difficult for year XV. 
As here given it fits well at year XIV. 
XIV, 5. Arithmetical reasoning 
Procedure. The following problems, printed in clear 
type, are shown one at a time to the subject, who reads 
each problem aloud and (with the printed problem stili 
before him) finds the answer without the use of pencil or 
paper. 
(a) If a man’s salary is $20 a week and he spends $14 a week, how 
long will it take him to save $300? 
(b) If 2 pencils cost 5 cents, how many pencils can you buy for 50 
cents? 
(c) At 15 cents a yard, how much will 7 feet of cloth cost? 
Only one minute is allowed for each problem, but nothing 
is said about hurrying. While one problem is being solved, 
the others should be hidden from view. It is not permissible, 
if the subject gives an incorrect answer, to ask him to solve 
the problem again. The following exception, however, is 
made to this rule: If the answer given to the third problem 
indicates that the word yard has been read as feet, the sub- 
ject is asked to read the problem through again carefully 
(aloud) and to tell how he solved it. No further help of any 
kind may be given. 
Scoring. Two of the three problems must be solved cor- 
rectly within the minute allotted to each. No credit is 
allowed for correct method if the answer is wrong.

  820 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Remarks. We have selected these problems from the 
list used by Bonser in his Study of the Reasoning Ability 
of Children in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth School Grades. 
Our tests of 279 “at age” children between 12 and 15 
years reveal the surprising fact that the test as here used 
and scored is not passed by much over half of the children 
of any age in the grades below the high-school age. Of 
the high-school pupils 19 per cent failed to pass, 21 per cent 
of ordinarily successful business men (!), and 27 per cent 
of Knollin’s unemployed men testing up to the “ average 
adult ” level. To find average intelligence cutting such a 
sorry figure raises the question whether the ancient defini- 
tion of man as “ the rational animal ”’ is justified by the 
facts. The truth is, average intelligence does not do a great 
deal of abstract, logical reasoning, and the little it does 
is done usually under the whip of necessity. 
At first thought these problems will doubtless appear to 
the reader to be mere tests of schooling. It is true, of course, 
that in solving them the subject makes use of knowledge 
which is ordinarily obtained in school; but this knowledge 
(that is, knowledge of reading and of addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division) is possessed by practically all 
adults who are not feeble-minded, and by many who are. 
Success, therefore, depends upon the ability to apply this 
knowledge readily and accurately to the problems given 
— precisely the kind of ability in which a deficiency cannot 
be made good by school training. We can teach even morons 
how to read problems and how to add, subtract, multiply, 
and divide with a fair degree of accuracy; the trouble comes 
when they try to decide which of these processes the prob- 
lem calls for. This may require intelligence of high or low 
order, according to the difficulty of the problem. As for 
the present test, we have shown that almost totally un- 
1 Columbia University Contributions to Education, no. 37, 1910.
-P-A-G-E-341
   TEST NO. XIV, 6 321 
schooled men of “ average adult” intelligence pass this 
test as frequently as high-school seniors of the same mental 
level. 
XIV, 6. Reversing hands of clock 
Procedure. Say to the subject: “Suppose it is sia 
twenty-two o’clock, that is, twenty-two minutes after six; 
can you see in your mind where the large hand would be, 
and where the small hand would be?” Subjects of 12- to 
14-year intelligence practically always answer this in the 
affirmative. Then continue: ‘“‘ Now, suppose the two hands 
of the clock were to trade places, so that the large hand takes 
the place where the small hand was, and the small hand takes 
the place where the large hand was. What time would it then 
be?” 
Repeat the test with the hands at 8.10 (10 minutes after 
8), and again with the hands at 2.46 (14 minutes before 8). 
The subject is not allowed to look at a clock or watch, 
or to aid himself by drawing, but must work out the prob- 
lem mentally. As a rule the answer is given within a few 
seconds or not at all. If an answer is not forthcoming within 
two minutes the score is failure. 
Scoring. The test is passed if two of the three problems 
are solved within the following range of accuracy: the first 
solution is considered correct if the answer falls between 
4.30 and 4.35, inclusive; the second if the answer falls be- 
tween 1.40 and 1.45, and the third if the answer falls be- 
tween 9.10 and 9.15. 
Remarks. It appears that success: in the test chiefly 
depends upon voluntary control over constructive visual 
imagery. Weakness of visual imagery may account for the 
failure of a considerable percentage of adults to pass the 
test. Visual imagery, however, is not absolutely necessary 
to success. One 8-year-old prodigy, who had 12-year in-   
 
-P-A-G-E-342
  822 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
telligence, arrived in forty seconds at a strictly mathematical 
solution for the second problem, as follows: “If it is 2.46, 
and the hands trade places, then the little hand has gone 
about one fourth of the distance from 9 o’clock to 100’clock. 
One fourth of 60 minutes is 15 minutes, and so the time would 
be 15 minutes after 9 o’clock.”’ Such a solution is certainly 
possible by the use of verbal imagery of any type. 
The test shows a high correlation with mental age, but 
more than most others it is subject to the influence of crib- 
bing. For this reason, other positions of the clock hands 
should be tried out for the purpose of finding substitute 
experiments of equal difficulty. Until such experiments 
have been made, it will be necessary to confine the experi- 
ment to the three positions here presented. 
Schooling seems to have no influence whatever on the 
percentage of passes. 
This test was first used by Binet in 1905, but was not in- 
cluded in either the 1908 or 1911 series. Goddard and Kuhl- 
mann both include the test in their revisions, placing it in 
year XV. They give only two problems (our a and c) and 
require that both be answered correctly. Neither Goddard 
nor Kuhlmann, however, indicates the degree of error per- 
mitted. 
Something depends upon original position of the hands. 
Binet used 6.20 and 2.46. For some reason the 2.46 arrange- 
ment is much more difficult than either 8.10 or 6.22, yield- 
ing almost twice as many failures as either of the other 
positions. 
XIV, Alternative tests: repeating seven digits 
This time, as in year X, only two series are given, one of 
which must be repeated without error. The two series are: 
2-1-8-3-4-3-9 and 9~-7-2-8-4-7-5. Note that in none   
-P-A-G-E-343
  TEST NO. XIV, ALTERNATIVE 323 
of the tests of repeating digits is it permissible to warn the 
subject of the number to be given. 
Remarks. Binet originally placed this test in year XII, 
giving three trials, but later moved it to year XV. Goddard 
and Kuhlmann retain it in year XII. Our data show that 
when three trials are given the test is too easy for year 
XIV, but that it fits this age when only two trials are 
allowed; that after the age of 12 or 14 years memory for 
relatively meaningless material, like digits or nonsense 
syllables, improves but little; and that above this level it 
does not correlate very closely with intelligence.

  CHAPTER XIX 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR “AVERAGE ADULT” 
Average adult, 1: vocabulary (sixty-five definitions, 
11,700 words) 
Procedure and Scoring, as in previous vocabulary tests. 
At the average adult level sixty-five words should be cor- 
rectly defined. 
Average adult, 2: interpretation of fables (score 8) 
Procedure. As in year XII, test 6. Use the same fables. 
Scoring. The method of scoring is the same as for 
XII, but the total score must be 8 points to satisfy the re- 
quirements at this level. 
Remarks. For discussion of test, see XII, 5. 
Average adult, 3: differences between abstract terms 
Procedure. Say: What is the difference between: — 
(a) Laziness and idleness? 
(b) Evolution and revolution? 
(c) Poverty and misery? 
(d) Character and reputation? 
Scoring. Three correct contrasting definitions out of four 
are necessary for a pass. It is not sufficient merely to 
give a correct meaning for each word of a pair; the subject 
1 See VIII, 6.
-P-A-G-E-345
  AVERAGE ADULT, 3 325 
must point out a difference between the two words so as to 
make a real contrast. For example, if the subject defines 
evolution as a “ growth” or “ gradual change,” and revolu- 
tion as the turning of a wheel on its axis, the experimenter 
should say: “‘ Yes, but I want you to tell me the difference 
between evolution and revolution.’’ If the contrast is not then 
forthcoming the response is marked minus. 
The following are sample definitions which may be con- 
sidered acceptable:— 
(a) Laziness and idleness. “It is laziness if you won’t work, and 
idleness if you are willing to work but have n’t any job.” “Lots 
of men are idle who are not lazy and would like to work if they had 
something to do.” “Laziness means you don’t want to work; 
idleness means you are not doing anything just now.” “Idle people 
may be lazy, or they may just happen to be out of a job.” “It is 
laziness when you don’t like to work, and idleness when you are not 
working.” “An idle person might be willing to work; a lazy man 
won’t work.” “Laziness comes from within; idleness may be forced 
upon one.” ‘Laziness is aversion to activity; idleness is simply 
the state of inactivity.” “Laziness is idleness from choice or pref- 
erence; idleness means doing nothing.” 
The essential contrast, accordingly, is that laziness refers to un- 
willingness to work; idleness to the mere fact of inactivity. This con- 
trast must be expressed, however clumsily. 
(b) Evolution and revolution. “Evolution is a gradual change; 
revolution is a sudden change.” ‘Evolution is natural develop- 
ment; revolution is sudden upheaval.”’ “Evolution means an un- 
folding or development; revolution means a complete upsetting of 
everything.” “Evolution is the gradual development of a country 
or government; revolution is a quick change of government.” 
“Evolution takes place by natural force; a revolution is caused by 
an outside force.” “Evolution is growth; revolution is a quick 
change from existing conditions.” ‘Evolution is a natural change; 
revolution is a violent change.” “Evolution is growth step by 
step; revolution is more sudden and radical in its action.” ‘“Evo- 
lution is a change brought about by peaceful development, while 
revolution is brought about by an uprising.” 
The essential distinction, accordingly, is that evolution means a
-P-A-G-E-346
  826 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
gradual, natural, or slow change, while revolution means a sudden, 
forced, or violent change. Non-contrasting definitions, even when 
the individual terms are defined correctly, are not satisfactory. 
(c) Poverty and misery. “Poverty is when you are poor; misery 
means suffering.” ‘Only the poor are in poverty, but everybody 
can be miserable.” “Poverty is the lowest stage of poorness; misery 
means pain.” “The poor are not always miserable, and the rich 
are miserable sometimes.”’ ‘‘ Poverty means to be in want; misery 
comes from any kind of suffering or anguish.” ‘The poor are in 
poverty; the sick are in misery.”’ “Poverty is the condition of being 
very poor financially; misery is a feeling which any class of people 
can have.” “One who is poor is in poverty; one who is wretched 
or does n’t enjoy life is in misery.” ‘Poverty comes from lack of 
money; misery, from lack of happiness or comfort.” “Misery 
means distress. It can come from poverty or many other things.” 
(d) Character and reputation. ‘‘Character is what you are; rep- 
utation is what people say about you.” “You have character if 
you are honest; but you might be honest and still have a bad rep- 
utation among people who misjudge you.” “Character is your 
real self; reputation is the opinion people have about you.” “Your 
character depends upon yourself; reputation depends on what 
others think of you.”’ “Character means your real morals; repu- 
tation is the way you are known in the world.” “A man has a 
good character if he would not do evil; but a man may have a 
good reputation and still have a bad character.” 
A little practice and a good deal of discrimination are 
necessary for the correct grading of responses to this test. 
Subjects are often so clumsy in expression that their re- 
sponses are anything but clear. It is then necessary to ask 
them to explain what they mean. Further questioning, 
however, is not permissible. For uniformity in scoring it is 
necessary to bear in mind that the definitions given must, 
in order to be satisfactory, express the essential distinction 
between the two words. 
Remarks. What we have said regarding the psychological 
significance of test 2, year XII, applies equally well here. 
The test on the whole is a valuable one. Our statistics
-P-A-G-E-347
  AVERAGE ADULT, 4 827 
show that it is not, as some critics have thought, mainly a 
test of schooling. 
The main criticism to be made is that it imposes a some- 
what difficult task upon the power of language expression. 
For this reason it is necessary in scoring to disregard clum- 
siness of expression and to look only to the essential correct- 
ness or incorrectness of the thought. 
This test first appeared in year XIII of Binet’s 1908 
scale. The terms used were “happiness and honor”; 
“evolution and revolution”; “event and advent”; 
“poverty and misery ”; “ pride and pretension.” In the 
1911 revision, ‘‘ happiness and honor ” and “ pride and pre- 
tension” were dropped, and the other three pairs were 
moved up to the adult group, two out of three successes 
being required for a pass. Kuhlmann places it in year XV, 
using “happiness and honor ”’ instead of our “ character 
and reputation,” and requires three successes out of five. 
Average adult, 4: problem of the enclosed boxes 
Procedure. Show the subject a cardboard box about one 
inch on a side. Say: “ You see this box; it has two smaller 
boxes inside of it, and each one of the smaller boxes contains 
a little tiny box. How many boxes are there altogether, count- 
ing the big one?” To be sure that the subject understands 
repeat the statement of the problem: “ First the large box, 
then two smaller ones, and each of the smaller ones contains 
a little tiny box.” 
Record the response, and, showing another box, say: 
“This box has two smaller boxes inside, and each of the 
smaller boxes contains two tiny boxes. How many altogether ? 
Remember, first the large box, then two smaller ones, and each 
smaller one contains two tiny boxes.” 
The third problem, which is given in the same way,
-P-A-G-E-348
  328 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
states that there are three smaller boxes, each of which con- 
tains three tiny boxes. 
In the fourth problem there are four smaller boxes, each 
containing four tiny boxes. 
The problem must be given orally, and the solution must 
be found without the aid of pencil or paper. Only one half- 
minute is allowed for each problem. Note that each prob- 
lem is stated twice. 
A correction is permitted, provided it is offered spon- 
taneously and does not seem to be the result of guessing. 
Guessing can be checked up by asking the subject to ex- 
plain the solution. 
Scoring. Three of the four problems must be solved cor- 
rectly within the half-minute allotted to each. 
Remarks. Success depends, in the first place, upon abil- 
ity to comprehend the statement of the problem and to 
hold its conditions in mind. Subjects much below the 
12-year level of intelligence are often unable to do this. 
Granting that the problem has been comprehended, suc- 
cess seems to depend chiefly upon the facility with which 
the constructive imagination manipulates concrete visual 
imagery. In this respect it resembles the problem of revers- 
ing the hands of a clock. With some subjects, however, 
verbal imagery alone is operative. Tactual imagery would, 
of course, serve the purpose as well. 
This is as good a place as any to emphasize the fact that 
the introspective study of mental imagery has little to 
contribute to the measurement of intelligence. Intelligence 
tests are concerned with the total result of a thought process, 
rather than with the imagery supports of that process. 
Thought may be carried on almost equally well by various 
kinds of imagery. As Galton showed, a person can be taught 
to carry on arithmetical processes by the use of smell 
imagery. The kind of imagery employed is the product of  
-P-A-G-E-349
AVERAGE ADULT, 5 329 
slight, innate preferences complicated by the more or less 
accidental effects of habit. 
We may say that imagery is to thinking what scaffold- 
ing is to architecture. The important thing is the com- 
pleted building rather than the nature of the scaffolding 
employed in erecting it. No one thinks of blaming the ill 
construction of a building upon the kind of scaffolding used, 
for if the architect and builder are competent satisfactory 
scaffolding will be found. Just as little are deficiencies or 
peculiarities of imagery the real cause of low-order in- 
telligence. We cannot increase intelligence by formal 
drill in the use of supposedly important kinds of mental 
imagery, any more than we can transform a plain carpenter 
into a Michael Angelo by instructing him in the use of 
scaffolding materials such as were employed in the con- 
struction of St. Peter’s Cathedral. 
This test is of our own invention and has been brought to 
its present form only after a good deal of preliminary ex- 
perimentation. It correlates fairly well with mental age as 
determined by the scale as a whole. It was passed by 55 
per cent of high-school pupils and by 65 per cent of un- 
schooled business men. Success in it is thus seen not to 
depend upon schooling. 
Average adult, 5: repeating six digits reversed 
The series used are: 4~7-1-9-5-2; 5-8-3-2-9-4; and 
7—-5-2-6-3-8. 
Procedure and Scoring, as in year VII, alternative 2. 
Remarks. The test is passed by approximately half of 
“average adults” and by three fourths of “ superior 
adults.” It shows no effect of schooling, the uneducated 
business men even surpassing our high-school students. 
For the higher levels of intelligence, especially, the test
-P-A-G-E-350
  330 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
is superior to that of repeating digits in the direct order. 
It is less mechanical and makes heavier demands upon 
higher intelligence. 
Average adult, 6: using a code 
Procedure. Show the subject the code given on the 
accompanying form. Say: “ See these diagrams here. Look 
and you will see that they contain all the letters of the alphabet. 
Now, examine the arrangement of the letters. They go (point- 
ing)abe,def,ghi,jklLmnopqr,stur,wrys. 
You see the letters in the first two diagrams are arranged in 
the up-and-down order (pointing again), and the letters in 
the other two diagrams run in just the opposite way from the 
hands of a clock (pointing). Look again and you will see 
that the second diagram is drawn just like the first, except 
that each letter has a dot with it, and that the last diagram is 
like the third except that here, also, each letter has a dot. 
Now, all of this represents a code; that is, a secret language. 
It is a real code, one that was used in the Civil War for 
sending secret messages. This is the way it works: we draw 
the lines which hold a letter, but leave out the letter. Here, for 
example, is the way we would write ‘ spy?’ ’? Then write 
the word spy, pointing out carefully where each letter comes 
from, and emphasizing the fact that the dot must be used in 
addition to the lines in writing any letter in the second or 
the fourth diagram. Illustrate also with war. 
Then add: “ I am going to have you write something for 
me; remember now, how the letters go, first (pointing, as before) 
abc, def,g hi, thenjklmno,pqr, then st uw», then 
w2xyz. And don’t forget the dots for the letters in this dia- 
gram and this one” (pointing). At this point, take away 
the diagrams and tell the subject to write the words come 
quickly. Say nothing about hurrying.
-P-A-G-E-351
  AVERAGE ADULT, 6 331 
The subject is given a pencil, but is allowed to draw only 
the symbols for the words come quickly. He is not permitted 
to reproduce the entire code and then to copy the code let- 
ters from his reproduction. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the words are written in 
six minutes and without more than two errors. Omission of 
a dot counts as only a half error. 
Remarks. It is not easy to analyze the mental functions 
which contribute to success in the code test. Contrary to 
what might be supposed, success does not necessarily de- 
pend upon getting and retaining a visual picture of the dia- 
grams. Kinesthetic imagery will answer the purpose just 
as well, or the original visual impression may even be trans- 
lated at once into auditory-verbal imagery and remembered 
as such. The significance of the test must be expressed in 
other terms than the kind of imagery it may happen to 
bring into play. 
Healy and Fernald describe the task of writing a code 
sentence without copy as one which requires “ close at- 
tention and steadiness of purpose.” They also emphasize 
' the fact that the attention must be directed inward, since 
there is no object of interest before the senses and since no 
special stimulus to attention is offered by the experimenter. 
Observations we have made on subjects during the test con- 
firm this view as to the factors involved. 
That inability to remember the code as a whole is not a 
common cause of failure is shown by the fact that subjects 
above 12-year intelligence who have failed on the test are 
nearly always able to reproduce the diagrams and insert the 
letters in their proper places. To give the code form of a 
given letter without copy, however, makes a much heavier 
demand on attention. Nearly all subjects find it necessary 
to trace the code form, in imagination, from the beginning 
up to each letter whose code form is sought. Subjects of
-P-A-G-E-352
  3832. THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
superior intelligence, however, sometimes hit upon the de- 
vice of remembering the position of individual key letters 
e.g. (the first letter of each figure) from which, as a base, any 
desired letter form may be quickly sought out. 
The test correlates well with mental age, but for some 
reason not apparent it is passed by a larger percentage of 
high-school pupils than unschooled adults of the same 
mental level. 
The code test was first described by Healy and Fernald 
in their “Tests for Practical Mental Classification.” ! 
The authors gave no data, however, which would indicate 
the mental level to which the test belongs. Dr. Goddard 
incorporated it in year XV of his revision of the Binet scale, 
but also fails to give statistics. The location given the test 
in the Stanford revision is based on tests of nearly 500 
individuals ranging from a mental level of 12 years to that 
of “ superior adult.” It appears that the test is considerably 
more difficult than most had thought it to be. 
Average adult, alternative test 1: repeating twenty-eight 
syllables 
The sentences for this test are: — 
(a) Walter likes very much to go on visits to his grandmother, be- 
cause she always tells him many funny stories. 
(b) Yesterday I saw a pretty little dog in the street. It had curly 
brown hair, short legs, and a long tail. 
Procedure. Exactly as in VI, 6. Emphasize that the 
sentence must be repeated without a single change of any 
sort. Get attention before giving each sentence. 
Scoring. Passed if one sentence is repeated without a single 
error. In VI and X we scored the response as satisfactory 
1 Psychological Review Monographs (1911), vol. xt, no. 2, p. 51.
-P-A-G-E-353
  
AVERAGE ADULT, ALTERNATIVE 2 333 
if one sentence was repeated without error, or if two were 
repeated with not more than one error each. 
Remarks. The test of repeating sentences is not as satis- 
factory in the higher intelligence levels as in the lower. 
It is too mechanical to tax very heavily the higher thought 
processes. It does, however, have a certain correlation 
with intelligence. Contrary to what one would have ex- 
pected, uneducated adults of ‘‘ average adult ”’ intelligence 
surpassed our high-school students of the same mental 
level. 
Binet located this test in year XII of the 1908 series, but 
shifted it to year XV in 1911. The American versions of 
the Binet scale have usually retained it in year XII, though 
Goddard admits that the sentences are somewhat too diffi- 
cult for that year. Kuhlmann puts the test in year XII, 
but reduces the sentences to twenty-four syllables and per- 
mits one re-reading. We give only two trials and our sen- 
tences are considerably more difficult. With the procedure 
and scoring we have used, the test is rather easy for the 
“average adult” group, but a little too hard for year 
XIV. 
Average adult, alternative test 2: comprehension of 
physical relations 
(a) Problem regarding the path of a cannon ball 
Procedure. Draw on a piece of paper a horizontal line 
six or eight inches long. Above it, an inch or two, draw a 
short horizontal line about an inch long and parallel to the 
first. Tell the subject that the long line represents the per- 
fectly level ground of a field, and that the short line repre- 
sents a cannon. Explain that the cannon is “ pointed 
horizontally (on a level) and is fired across this perfectly level 
field.” After it is clear that these conditions of the problem  
-P-A-G-E-354
  
334 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
are comprehended, we add: “Now, suppose that this 
cannon is fired off and that the ball comes to the ground at 
this point here (pointing to the farther end of the line which 
represents the field). Take this pencil and draw a line 
which will show what path the cannon ball will take from the 
time itt leaves the mouth of the cannon till it strikes the ground.” 
Scoring. There are four types of response: (1) A straight 
diagonal line is drawn from the cannon’s mouth to the point 
where the ball strikes. (2) A straight line is drawn from the 
cannon’s mouth running horizontally until almost directly 
over the goal, at which point the line drops almost or quite 
vertically. (3) The path from the cannon’s mouth first 
rises considerably from the horizontal, at an angle perhaps 
of between ten to forty-five degrees, and finally describes 
a gradual curve downward to the goal. (4) The line be- 
gins almost on a level and drops more rapidly toward the 
end of its course. 
Only the last is satisfactory. Of course, nothing like a 
mathematically accurate solution of the problem is expected. 
It is sufficient if the response belongs to the fourth type 
above instead of being absurd, as the other types described 
are. Any one who has ever thrown stones should have the 
data for such an approximate solution. Not a day of school- 
ing is necessary. 
(b) Problem as to the weight of a fish in water 
Procedure. Say to the subject: “ You know, of course, 
that water holds up a fish that is placed in it. Well, here is a 
problem. Suppose we have a bucket which is partly full of 
water. We place the bucket on the scales and find that with 
the water in it it weighs exactly 45 pounds. Then we put a 
5-pound fish into the bucket of water. Now, what will the 
whole thing weigh? ” 
Scoring. Many subjects even as low as 9- or 10- year
-P-A-G-E-355
AVERAGE ADULT, ALTERNATIVE 2 335 
intelligence will answer promptly, “‘ Why, 45 pounds and 
5 pounds makes 50 pounds, of course.”’ But this is not suf- 
ficient. We proceed to ask, with serious demeanor: “ How 
this can be correct, since the water itself holds up the fish? ” 
The young subject who has answered so glibly now laughs 
sheepishly and apologizes for his error, saying that he 
answered without thinking, etc. This response is scored 
failure without further questioning. 
Others subjects, mostly above the 14-year level, adhere 
to the answer “ 50 pounds,” however strongly we urge the 
argument about the water holding up the fish. In response 
to our question, “ How can that be the case? ’’ it is sufficient 
if the subject replies that ‘‘ The weight is there just the same; 
the scales have to hold up the bucket and the bucket has to 
hold up the water,” or words to that effect. Only some such 
response as this is satisfactory. If the subject keeps chang- 
ing his answer or says that he thinks the weight would be 
50 pounds, but is not certain, the score is failure. 
(c) Difficulty of hitting a distant mark 
Procedure. Say to the subject: “‘ You know, do you not, 
what it means when they say a gun ‘ carries 100 yards’? 
It means that the bullet goes that far before it drops to amount 
to anything.” All boys and most girls more than a dozen 
years old understand this readily. If the subject does not 
understand, we explain again what it means for a gun “ to 
carry ” a given distance. When this part is clear, we pro- 
ceed as follows: “Now, suppose a man is shooting at a 
mark about the size of a quart can. His rifle carries per- 
fectly more than 100 yards. With such a gun is it any harder 
to hit the mark at 100 yards than it is at 50 yards?”’ After 
the response is given, we ask the subject to explain. 
Scoring. Simply to say that it would be easier at 50 
yards is not sufficient, nor can we pass the response which 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
336 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
merely states that it is “ easier to aim” at 50 yards. The 
correct principle must be given, one which shows the sub- 
ject has appreciated the fact that a small deviation from 
the “ bull’s-eye ” at 50 yards, due to incorrect aim, be- 
comes a larger deviation at 100 yards. However, the sub- 
ject is not required to know that the deviation at 100 yards 
is exactly twice as great as at 50 yards. A certain amount 
of questioning is often necessary before we can decide 
whether the subject has the correct principle in mind. 
Scoring the entire test. T'wo of the three problems must 
be solved in such a way as to satisfy the requirements 
above set forth. 
Remarks. These problems were devised by the writer. 
They yield interesting results, when properly given, but 
are not without their faults. Sometimes a very superior 
subject fails, while occasionally an inferior subject unex- 
pectedly succeeds. On the whole, however, the test corre- 
lates fairly well with mental age. At the 14-year level less 
than 50 per cent pass; of “average adults,” from 60 to 
75 per cent are successful. Few “ superior adults” fail. 
The test as here given is little influenced by the formal 
instruction given in the grades or the high school. In fact, 
80 per cent of our uneducated business men, as contrasted 
with 65 per cent of high-school juniors and seniors, passed 
the test. Success probably depends in the main upon pre- 
vious interest in physical relationships and upon the abil- 
ity to understand phenomena of this kind which the sub- 
ject has had opportunity to observe. 
It would be interesting to standardize a longer series of 
problems designed to test a subject’s comprehension of 
common physical relationships. In the first few months 
of life a normal child learns that objects unsupported fall 
to the ground. Later he learns that fire burns; that birds 
fly in the air; that fish do not sink in the water; that water

AVERAGE ADULT, ALTERNATIVE 2 337 
does not run uphill; that it is easy to lift a leg or arm as one 
lies prone in the water; that mud is thrown from a rotating 
wheel (and always in the same direction) ; that a stone which 
is flying through the air swiftly is more dangerous than 
one which is moving slowly; that it is more dangerous to 
be run over by a train than by a buggy; that it is hard to 
run against a strong wind; that cyclones blow down trees 
and houses; that a rapidly moving train creates a stronger 
wind than a slower train; that a feather falls through the 
air with less speed than a stone; that a falling object gains 
momentum; that a heavy moving object is harder to stop 
than a light object moving at the same rate; that freezing 
water bursts pipes; that sounds sometimes give echoes; 
that rainbows cannot be approached; that a lamp seems 
dim by daylight; that by day the stars are not visible and 
the moon only barely visible; that the headlights of an 
approaching automobile or train are blinding; that if the 
room in which we are reading is badly lighted we must hold 
the book nearer to the eyes; that running makes the heart 
beat faster and increases the rate of breathing; that if we 
are cold we can get warm by running; that whirling rapidly 
makes us dizzy; that heat or exercise will cause perspira- 
tion, ete. 
Although the causes of some of these phenomena are not 
understood even by intelligent adults without some in- 
struction, the facts themselves are learned by the normal 
individual from his own experience. The higher the mental 
level and the greater the curiosity, the more observant one 
is about such matters and the more one learns. Many 
items of knowledge such as we have mentioned could and 
should be standardized for various mental levels. In de- 
vising tests of this kind we should, of course, have to look 
out for the influences of formal instruction.

  CHAPTER XX 
INSTRUCTIONS FOR “SUPERIOR ADULT” 
Superior adult, 1: vocabulary (seventy-five definitions, 
13,500 words) 
Procedure and Scoring, as in previous vocabulary tests. 
At the “superior adult ” level seventy-five words should 
be known. 
The test is passed by only one third of those at the 
“ average adult ” level, but by about 90 per cent of “ su- 
perior adults.”’ Ability to pass the test is relatively inde- 
pendent of the number of years the subject has attended 
school, our business men showing even a higher percentage 
of passes than high-school pupils. 
Superior adult, 2: Binet’s paper-cutting test 
Procedure. Take a piece of paper about six inches square 
and say: “ Watch carefully what I do. See, I fold the paper 
this way (folding it once over in the middle), then I fold it 
this way (folding it again in the middle, but at right angles 
to the first fold). Now, I will cut out a notch right here”’ 
(indicating). At this point take scissors and cut out a small 
notch from the middle of the side which presents but one 
edge. Throw the fragment which has been cut out into 
the waste-basket or under the table. Leave the folded paper 
exposed to view, but pressed flat against the table. Then 
give the subject a pencil and a second sheet of paper like 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
  SUPERIOR ADULT, 2 339 
the one already used and say: “Take this piece of paper 
and make a drawing to show how the other sheet of paper 
would look if it were unfolded. Draw lines to show the creases 
in the paper and show what results from the cutting.” 
The subject is not permitted to fold the second sheet, 
but must solve the problem by the imagination unaided. 
Note that we do not say, “Draw the holes,” as this would 
inform the subject that more than one hole is expected. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the creases in the paper are 
properly represented, if the holes are drawn in the correct 
number, and if they are located correctly, that is, both on the 
same crease and each about halfway between the center of 
the paperand the side. Theshape of the holes is disregarded. 
Failure may be due to error as regards the creases or 
the number and location of the holes, or it may involve any 
combination of the above errors. 
Remarks. Success seems to depend upon constructive 
visual imagination. The subject must first be able to con- 
struct in imagination the creases which result from the 
folding, and secondly, to picture the effects of the cutting as 
regards number of holes and their location. It appears that 
a solution is seldom arrived at, even in the case of college 
students, by logical mathematical thinking. Our unschooled 
subjects even succeeded somewhat better than high-school 
and college students of the same mental level. 
Binet placed this test in year XIII of the 1908 scale, but 
shifted it to the adult group in the 1911 revision. Goddard 
retains it in the adult group, while Kuhlmann places it in 
year XV. There have also been certain variations in the 
procedure employed. As given in the Stanford revision the 
test is passed by hardly any subjects below the 14-year 
level, but by about one third of “‘ average adults ” and by 
the large majority of “ superior adults.”

Superior adult, 3: repeating eight digits 
Procedure and Scoring, the same as in previous tests 
with ons oc The series used are: 7-2-5-3-4-8-9-6; 
49-8597 G-2; and 8-3-7-9-5-4-8-2. |< Gy pq Ras” be sider retin and grouping in reading the digits 
and do not give warning as to the number to be given. 
The test is passed by about one third of “ average adults ” 
and by over two thirds of “ superior adults.” The test 
shows no marked difference between educated and unedu- 
cated subjects of the same mental level. 
Superior adult, 4: repeating thought of passage 
Procedure. Say: “I am going to read a little selection 
of about six or eight lines. When I am through I will ask 
you to repeat as much of it as you can. It does n’t make any 
difference whether you remember the exact words or not, but 
you must listen carefully so that you can tell me everything 
it says.” Then read the following selections, pausing after 
each for the subject’s report, which should be recorded 
verbatim: — 
(a) “Tests such as we are now making are of value both for the ad- 
vancement of science and for the information of the person who 
is tested. It is important for science to learn how people differ 
and on what factors these differences depend. If we can separate 
the influence of heredity from the influence of environment, we 
may be able to apply our knowledge so as to guide human de- 
velopment. We may thus in some cases correct defects and de- 
velop abilities which we might otherwise neglect.” 
(b) “Many opinions have been given on the value of life. Some call 
tt good, others call it bad. It would be nearer correct to say that 
it 1s mediocre; for on the one hand, our happiness is never as 
great as we should like, and on the other hand, our misfortunes 
are never as great as our enemies would wish for us. It is this 
mediocrity of life which prevents it from being radically unjust.”
-P-A-G-E-361
  SUPERIOR ADULT, 4 341 
Sometimes the subject hesitates to begin, thinking, in 
spite of our wording of the instructions, that a perfect re- 
production is expected. Others fall into the opposite mis- 
understanding and think that they are prohibited from 
using the words of the text and must give the thought 
entirely in their own language. In cases of hesitation we 
should urge the subject a little and remind him that he is 
to express the thought of the selection in whatever way he 
prefers; that the main thing is to tell what the selection 
says. 
Scoring. The test is passed if the subject is able to re- 
peat in reasonably consecutive order the main thoughts of 
at least one of the selections. Neither elegance of expression 
nor verbatim repetition is expected. We merely want to 
know whether the leading thoughts in the selection have 
been grasped and remembered. 
All grades of accuracy are found, both in the compre- 
hension of the selection and in the recall, and it is not always 
easy to draw the line between satisfactory and unsatis- 
factory responses. The following sample performances 
will serve as a guide: — 
Selection (a) 
Satisfactory. “The tests which we are making are given for the 
advancement of science and for the information of the person 
tested. By scientific means we will be able to separate character- 
istics derived from heredity and environment and to treat each 
class separately. By doing so we can more accurately correct de- 
fects.” 
“Tests like these are for two purposes. First to develop a 
science, and second to apply it to the person to help him. The 
tests are to find out how you differ from another and to measure 
the difference between your heredity and environment.” 
“These tests are given to see if we can separate heredity and en- 
vironment and to see if we can find out how one person differs from 
another. We can then correct these differences and teach people 
more effectively.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  342 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
“The tests that we are now making are valuable along both 
scientific and personal lines. By using them it can be found out 
where a person is weak and where he is strong. We can then 
strengthen his weak points and remedy some things that would 
otherwise be neglected. They are of great benefit to science and to 
the person concerned.” 
“Tests such as we are now making are of great importance be- 
cause they aim to show in what respects we differ from others and 
why, and if they do this they will be able to guide us into the right 
channel and bring success instead of failure.” 
Unsatisfactory. “Tests such as we are now making are of value 
both for the advancement of science and for the information of 
the person interested. It is necessary to know this.” 
“Such tests as we are now making show about the human mind 
and show in what channels we are fitted. It is the testing of each 
individual between his effects of inheritancy and environment.” 
“Tt is very interesting for us to study science for two reasons; 
first, to test our mental ability, and second for the further develop- 
ment of science.” 
“Tests such as we are now making help in two ways; it helps 
the scientists and it gives information to the people.” 
“Tests are being given to pupils to-day to better them and to 
aid science for generations to come. If each person knows exactly 
his own beliefs and ideas and faults he can find out exactly what 
kind of work he is fitted for by heredity. The tests show that en- 
vironment does n’t count, for if you are all right you will get along 
anyway.” (Note invention.) 
Selection (b) 
Satisfactory. “There are different opinions about life. Some 
call it good and some bad. It would be more correct to say that 
it is middling, because we are never as happy as we would like to 
be and we are never as sad as our enemies want us to be.” 
“One hears many judgments about life. Some say it is good, 
while others say it is bad. But it is really neither of the extremes. 
Life is mediocre. We do not have as much good as we desire, nor 
do we have as much misfortune as others want us to have. Never- 
theless, we have enough good to keep life from being unjust.” 
“Some people have different views of life from others. Some 
say it is bad, others say it is good. It is better to class life as 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
SUPERIOR ADULT, 4 343 
mediocre, as it is never as good as we wish it, and on the other 
hand, it might be worse.” 
“Some people think differently of life. Some think it good, some 
bad, others mediocre, which is nearest correct. It brings unhappi- 
ness to us, but not as much as our enemies want us to have.” 
Unsatisfactory. “Some say life is good, some say it is mediocre. 
Even though some say it is mediocre they say it is right.” 
“There are two sides of life. Some say it is good while others 
say it is bad. To some, life is happy and they get all they can out 
of life. For others life is not happy and therefore they fail to get 
all there is in life.” 
“One hears many different judgments of life. Some call it good, 
some call it bad. It brings unhappiness and it does not have enough 
pleasure. It should be better distributed.” 
“There are different opinions of the value of life. Some say it is 
good and some say it is bad. Some say it is mediocrity. Some 
think it brings happiness while others do not.” 
“Nowadays there is much said about the value of life. Some say 
it is good, while others say it is bad. A person should not have 
an ill feeling toward the value of life, and he should not be unjust 
to any one. Honesty is the best policy. People who are unjust are 
more likely to be injured by their enemies.” (Note invention.) 
Remarks. Contrary to what the subject is led to expect, 
the test is less a test of memory than of ability to compre- 
hend the drift of an abstract passage. A subject who fully 
grasps the meaning of the selection as it is read is not likely 
to fail because of poor memory. Mere verbal memory 
improves but little after the age of 14 or 15 years, as is 
shown by the fact that our adults do little better than eighth- 
grade children in repeating sentences of twenty-eight sylla- 
bles. On the other hand, adult intelligence is vastly su- 
perior in the comprehension and retention of a logically 
presented group of abstract ideas. 
There is nothing in which stupid persons cut a poorer 
figure than in grappling with the abstract. Their think- 
ing clings tenaciously to the concrete; their concepts are 
vague or inaccurate; the interrelations among their concepts
-P-A-G-E-364
344 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
are scanty in the extreme; and such poor mental stores as 
they have are little available for ready use. 
A few critics have objected to the use of tests demanding 
abstract thinking, on the ground that abstract thought is 
a very special aspect of intelligence and that facility in it 
depends almost entirely on occupational habits and the 
accidents of education. Some have even gone so far as to 
say that we are not justified, on the basis of any number of 
such tests, in pronouncing a subject backward or defective. 
It is supposed that a subject who has no capacity in the use 
of abstract ideas may nevertheless have excellent intelli- 
gence “along other lines.” In such cases, it is said, we 
should not penalize the subject for his failures in handling 
abstractions, but substitute, instead, tests requiring motor 
codrdination and the manipulation of things, tests in which 
the supposedly dull child often succeeds fairly well. 
From the psychological point of view, such a proposal 
is naively unpsychological. It is in the very essence of the 
higher thought processes to be conceptual and abstract. 
What the above proposal amounts to is, that if the subject 
is not capable of the more complex and strictly human 
type of thinking, we should ignore this fact and estimate 
his intelligence entirely on the ability he displays to carry 
on mental operations of a more simple and primitive kind. 
This would be like asking the physician to ignore the dis- 
eased parts of his patient’s body and to base his diagnosis 
on an examination of the organs which are sound! 
The present test throws light in an interesting way on 
the integrity of the critical faculty. Some subjects are un- 
willing to extend the report in the least beyond what they 
know to be approximately correct, while others with de- 
fective powers of auto-criticism manufacture a report which 
draws heavily on the imagiration, perhaps continuing in 
garrulous fashion as long as they can think of anything 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
  
SUPERIOR ADULT, 6 345 
having the remotest connection with any thought in the 
selection. We have included, for each selection, one illus- 
tration of this type in the sample failures given above. 
The worst fault of the test is its susceptibility to the in- 
fluence of schooling. Our uneducated adults of even “ su- 
perior adult ” intelligence often fail, while about two thirds 
of high-school pupils succeed. The unschooled adults have 
a marked tendency either to give a summary which is in- 
adequate because of its extreme brevity, or else to give a 
criticism of the thought which the passage contains. 
This test first appeared in Binet’s 1911 revision, in the 
adult group. Binet used only selection (0), and in a slightly 
more difficult form than we have given above. Goddard 
gives the test like Binet and retains it in the adult group. 
Kuhlmann locates it in year XV, using only selection (a). 
On the basis of over 300 tests of adults we find the test too 
difficult for the “‘ average adult ”’ level, even on the basis of 
only one success in two trials and when scored on the 
rather liberal standard above set forth. 
Superior adult, 5: repeating seven digits reversed 
Procedure and Scoring, the same as in previous tests of 
this kind. The series are: 4-1-1 “ie —5-9-3; 3-8-2-6-4-7-5; 
and 974-5-28-3-4. © 1 \ 
We hive collected obs data on this test than on any 
of the others, as it was added later to the test series. As 
far as we have used it we have found few “ average adults ” 
who pass, while about half the “ superior adults ” do so. 
Superior adult, 6: ingenuity test 
Procedure. Problem a is stated as follows: — 
A mother sent her boy to the river and told him to bring back exactly 
7 pints of water. She gave him a 3-pint vessel and a 5-pint vessel.
-P-A-G-E-366
  346 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
Show me how the boy can measure out exactly 7 pints of water, using 
nothing but these two vessels and not guessing at the amount. You 
should begin by filling the 5-pint vessel first. Remember, you have a 
3-pint vessel and a 5-pint vessel and you must bring back exactly 
7 pints. 
The problem is given orally, but may be repeated if 
necessary. 
The subject is not allowed pencil or paper and is requested 
to give his solution orally as he works it out. It is then 
possible to make a complete record of the method employed. 
The subject is likely to resort to some such method as 
to “ fill the 3-pint vessel two thirds full,” or, “ I would mark 
the inside of the 5-pint vessel so as to show where 4 pints 
come to,” etc. We inform the subject that such a method 
is not allowable; that this would be guessing, since he could 
not be sure when the 3-pint vessel was two thirds full 
(or whether he had marked off his 5-pint vessel accurately). 
Tell him he must measure out the water without any guess- 
work. Explain also, that it is a fair problem, not a “catch.” 
Say nothing about pouring from one vessel to another, 
but if the subject asks whether this is permissible the answer 
is “yes.” 
The time limit for each problem is 5 minutes. If the 
subject fails on the first problem, we explain the solution 
in full and then proceed to the next. 
The second problem is like the first, except that a 5- 
pint vessel and a 7-pint vessel are given, to get 8 pints, the 
subject being told to begin by filling the 5-pint vessel. 
In the third problem 4 and 9 are given, to get 7, the in- 
struction being to “ begin by filling the 4-pint vessel.” 
Note that in each problem we instruct the subject how 
to begin. This is necessary in order to secure uniformity 
of conditions. It is possible to solve all of the problems by 
beginning with either of the two vessels, but the solution 
 
-P-A-G-E-367
  SUPERIOR ADULT, 6 347 
is made very much more difficult if we begin in the direc- 
tion opposite from that recommended. 
Give no further aid. It is necessary to refrain from com- 
ment of every kind. 
Scoring. Two of the three problems must be solved cor- 
rectly within the 5 minutes alloted to each. 
Remarks. We have called this a test of ingenuity. The 
subject who is given the problem finds himself involved in 
a difficulty from which he must extricate himself. Means 
must be found to overcome an obstacle. This requires prac- 
tical judgment and a certain amount of inventive ingenuity. 
Various possibilities must be explored and either accepted 
for trial or rejected. If the amount of invention called for 
seems to the reader inconsiderable, let it be remembered 
that the important inventions of history have not as a rule 
had a Minerva birth, but instead have developed by suc- 
cessive stages, each involving but a small step in advance. 
It is unnecessary to emphasize at length the. function of 
invention in the higher thought processes. In one form or 
another it is present in all intellectual activity; in the crea- 
tion and use of language, in art, in social adjustments, in 
religion, and in philosophy, as truly as in the domains of 
science and practical affairs. Certainly this is true if we 
accept Mason’s broad definition of invention as including 
“every change in human activity made designedly and 
systematically.” ! From the psychological point of view, 
perhaps, Mason is justified in looking upon the great in- 
ventor as “an epitome of the genius of the world.” To 
develop a Krag-Joergensen from a bow and arrow, a “ velvet- 
tipped” lucifer match from the primitive fire-stick, or a 
modern piano from the first crude, stringed, musical in- 
strument has involved much the same intellectual processes 
as have been operative in transforming fetishism and magic 
1 Otis T. Mason: The Origins of Inventions. (London, 1902.)
-P-A-G-E-368
348 THE MEASUREMENT OF INTELLIGENCE 
into religion and philosophy, or scattered fragments of 
knowledge into science. 
Psychologically, invention depends upon the construc- 
tive imagination; that is, upon the ability to abstract from 
what is immediately present to the senses and to picture 
new situations with their possibilities and consequences. 
Images are united in order to form new combinations. 
As we have several times emphasized, the decisive in- 
tellectual differences among human beings are not greatly 
dependent upon mere sense discrimination or native re- 
tentiveness. Far more important than the raw mass of 
sense data is the correct shooting together of the sense 
elements in memory and imagination. This is but another 
name for invention. It is the synthetic, or apperceptive, 
activity of the mind that gives the “ seven-league boots ” 
to genius. It is, however, a kind of ability which is possessed 
by all minds to a greater or less degree. Any test has its 
value which gives a clue, as this test does, to the subject’s 
ability in this direction. 
The test was devised by the writer and used in 1905 in 
a study of the intellectual processes of bright and dull boys, 
but it was not at that time standardized. It has been found 
to belong at a much higher mental level than was at first 
supposed. Only an insignificant number pass the test below 
the mental age of 14 years, and about two thirds of “ average 
adults” fail. Of our “ superior adults ” somewhat more than 
75 per cent succeed. Formal education influences the test 
little or not at all, the unschooled business men making a 
somewhat better showing than the high-school students.

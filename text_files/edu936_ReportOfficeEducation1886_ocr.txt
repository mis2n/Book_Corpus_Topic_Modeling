DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., September 30, 1887. 
Srr: I have the honor to submit the following report of the opera- 
tions of this Office for the year ending June 30, 1887: 
1 was appointed by the President on the 3d and confirmed by the 
Senate on the 5th of August, 1886; but having obtained your permis- 
sion to arrange my private business before entering upon my duties, I 
did not assume personal charge of the Office until the 27th of Septem- 
ber following. 
THE WoRK OF THE OFFICE. 
Upon assuming charge of the Office, after consultation with you and 
an examination into its condition and its business methods, I deemed 
it best to reduce the number of divisions into which it had been organ- 
ized from seven to three, called, respectively, the Division of Records, 
the Division of the Library and Museum, and the Division of Statistics. 
This consolidation was made with the purpose of making the organiza- 
tion more simple, the responsibility of the employés more explicit, the 
service more efficient, and the work more systematic, prompt, and ac- 
curate. 
The Division of Records is charged with the correspondence, index- 
ing and filing of all communications, and the distribution of the publi- 
cations of the Office and other public documents. 
il
-P-A-G-E-12
  12 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
The Library and Museum Division is charged with the care of all the 
books, pamphlets, journals, apparatus, and other articles embraced in 
these collections. 
The Division of Statistics is charged with the collection, arrangement, 
and comparison of statistics for the Annual Report and other publica- 
tions of the Office, and with their preparation for publication. 
To the supervision of each of these divisions was assigned an experi- 
enced chief, who became responsible for the proper execution and dis- 
patch of its work. This plan has worked admirably, and has enabled 
the Office to complete much work previously unfinished, to respond to 
all the calls made upon it for information, and to perform promptly the 
routine duties assigned to it by law. 
During the year this Office has received, written letters, 11,006; ac- 
knowledgments, 43,990; documents, 4,825; and 20,000 replies to statis- 
tical forms of inquiry; and has sent out 19,354 written letters and dis- 
tributed 218,526 copies of documents. The statistical forms related to 
the Report for 1885-86, and the result appears in the appendices to the 
volume for that year, recently completed. 
The documents received, above mentioned, comprising school reports, 
educational journals, treatises and other works and pamphlets on edu- 
cational subjects, have been catalogued and filed in the Library and 
Museum Division, wherein the card catalogue of the general collection 
of books has been carried very far towards completion, and the special 
catalogue of the articles in the museum prepared. 
THE MUSEUM. 
This collection of educational apparatus and appliances has never 
received the attention which its value and extent demand, partly on 
account of the want of space for an adequate display of the same. 
Desiring that it should be made serviceable to some extent, I have 
caused a selection of the articles to be made, have made some additions 
in order to complete the collection, and have had the same catalogued, 
eased, and displayed in accordance with the most approved methods, 
following the general plan furnished by the National Museum. Visitors 
to this Office will find this collection of infinitely greater value than 
ever before for educational purposes, on account of the ease with which 
they can have access to the articles for examination, comparison, and 
study. 
The museum, as now arranged, will be a genuine surprise to almost 
any one not connected directly with the Office. 
That portion now exhibited contains approximately two thousand 
five hundred objects and series of objects. 
It has been suggested that the museum, on account of the want of 
room for its proper display, and the want of means to bestow upon it 
.that care and attention which are necessary for its preservation, should 
   
-P-A-G-E-13
THE COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT. 13 
be deposited in the National Musewm until proper accommodation shall 
be provided for this valuable collection. 
For many reasons this arrangement would be a subject of regret to 
the friends of education, who have so zealously and carefully watched 
and fostered the growth of this valuable addition to the educational 
facilities of the Bureau, and the idea could only be entertained on ac- 
count of the great necessity that exists for its preservation. 
THE LIBRARY. 
The value. of the library is well known to educationists of every 
grade, and it has been used during the past year by a number of per- 
sons engaged in the investigation of educational subjects. Inquiries 
are frequently made upon these subjects by correspondents, not only 
in the United States, but in foreign countries, for information which 
can not be obtained elsewhere. 
It now contains 19,200 volumes and 60,000 pamphlets, besides many 
thousand duplicates which are used for exchange and distribution. 
During the year 1,700 volumes and 15,000 pamphlets were added to the 
library, indexed, and filed; 8,000 cards for the catalogue were written, 
and over 300 cards giving references to investigators on various topics 
were prepared. Some of these cards were the result of very elaborate 
research, and were prepared with great care and labor. 
Many of the books in the library and a very large portion of the arti- 
cles in the museum are the gifts of foreign Governments and of native 
and foreign authors and inventors, and are pecuniarily of great value. 
These parts of the collection could not be duplicated if scattered or de- 
stroyed. So valuable a collection should be deposited in a fire-proof 
building, and I trust that the time is approaching when the claims of 
this Office for a building suitable for its purposes and capable of pre- 
serving these collections will be recognized by the Government. 
A complete Index to the publications of the Bureau since its founda- 
tion to the close of the fiscal year now under review, has also been pre- 
pared. This will add greatly to the convenience.of those who may wish 
to examine these publications. It will be found in Chapter XXII of this 
volume. 
It is intended that these catalogues and indexes shall hereafter con- 
tain all additions as soon as made. 
PUBLICATIONS OF THE OFFICE. 
Upon taking charge of the Office I found that the Annual Report for 
1884-85 was not completed, and that no steps had been taken for the 
preparation of the Report for 1885-86. 
Under these circumstances it was deemed best to forward the com- 
pletion of these Reports and other unfinished work, so that hereafter 
the preparation of the Aunual Reports would begin immediately after 
the end of the fiscal year.

14 EDUCATION REPORT, 1836-87. 
In pursuance of this plan, the Report of 1884-85 was completed and 
sent to the printer in January, 1887, and has been published and dis- 
tributed, The Report of 1885-86 was then taken up and pushed for- 
ward rapidly, and was placed in the hands of the printer on the 15th of 
last June, and will be ready for distribution soon after the meeting of 
Congress in December. 
In addition to the preparation and publication of these Reports, much 
other unfinished work was completed. Circular of Information No. 1, 
1886, respecting the Study of Music in the Public Schools, was com- 
pleted and published ; and the Proceedings of the Department of Super- 
intendenceof the National Educational Association for the year 1885-86 
was edited and published as a circular, in accordance with the usages 
of the Office. 
The Special Report of Education at the New Orleans Exposition, con- 
sisting of three parts, was also printed and distributed; and the second 
part of the Special Report on Fine and Industrial Art has been revised, 
and a sinall part of it printed during the year. 
This work was undertaken in response to a resolution of the Senate, 
dated February 2, 1880, directing the Secretary of the Interior, through 
the Bureau, to “ furnish the Senate with a statement of all the informa- 
tion relative to the development of instruction in drawing as applied to 
the industrial or fine arts in the colleges of agriculture and the mechanic 
arts, and in the public schools and other institutions of the country, 
with special reference to the utility of such instruction in promoting the 
arts and industries of the people.” 
Part I of this work was completed and published in 1886. I deem it 
important that the other parts of this work should be finished at an 
early period, in order that no further delay may occur in laying the 
information in the possession of the Office before the Senate. The 
work has been in charge of Mr. I. Edwards Clarke since its inception. 
The second part will cover at least one thousand pages, and there are 
to be two additional volumes. 
The Special Report on Indian Education and Civilization, under- 
taken in response to a resolution of the Senate dated February 23, 
1885, was continued and completed under the editorial charge of Miss 
Alice O. Fletcher, assisted by a portion of the clerical force in the Divis- 
ion of Statistics. This volume is now in the hands of the printer, and 
will cover at least seven hundred printed pages. 
In response to a general expression from the correspondents of the 
Office, the list of libraries, other than private, containing over three 
hundred volumes, which appeared in the Report for 1884-85, was also 
reprinted and largely distributed. 
During the year Cireulars Nos. 1 and 2 have been prepared and pub- 
lished. The first, containing a historical account of the College of 
William and Mary in Virginia, was prepared by Prof. Herbert B.

Adams, Ph. D., associate professor of history in Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity, and has been received with singular favor. ‘This forms the first 
of a series of historical monographs which I have made arrangements 
to publish at suitable times. Considerable work in this direction has 
been done during the year with reference to the history of higher edu- 
cation in the universities and colleges of the older States in the Union, 
with special referénce to the period anterior to the war of the Revolu- 
tion. 
Cireular No. 2 is a historical summary respecting The Study of His- 
tory in the Colleges and Universities of the United States, and has 
elicited great interest and commendation. 
The Proceedings of the Department of Superintendence of the Na- 
tional Educational Association, held in this city in March, 1887, were 
prepared and edited as Circular No, 3, and are now in the hands of the 
printer, to whom it was delivered in the month of July, 1887.1 
THE PLAN AND SCOPE OF THE ANNUAL REPORT. 
Upon examining the previous Reports of the Office, it seemed to me 
that, without violating the spirit or lessening the usefulness of the 
series, it was possible to increase the promptness of publication, the 
variety of contents, and the value of deductions in future issues by suita- 
ble changes in the method of their preparation and the details of their 
arrangement. 
These changes may be summarized by saying that they contemplate 
the absolute avoidance of duplicate mention of facts, the omission of 
columns in the statistical tables which experience has shown can not be 
filled, the union and printing together of text and tables wherever re- 
lating to the ‘same subject, and the addition of many convenient ratios 
and comparisons. 
Following the lines of this plan, in preparing for the Report of 1885-86, 
the forms of inquiry were systematically revised, and in many cases 
simplified, though new topics were introduced wherever thought ad- 
visable. This process was continued in the preparation for the present 
Report, and the forms, printed in a convenient shape, were distributed 
to all the systems and schools upon the lists of the Office, amounting 
to nearly fifteen thousand. 
The current literature of education was carefully examined, both for 
facts and opinions of value. The printed reports of States and cities, 
the catalogues and circulars of public and private schools of every 
grade, and other documents, were also examined with care for suitable 
material. 
Having determined what facts could be best stated in tabular form, 
blank sheets for such tables were prepared in advance, and the names 
and addresses of schools were inserted therein. When the forms were 
received back from our correspondents, the statistical facts therein 
1 This Circular was printed and published in May, 1888,   
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
given were promptly tabulated as received; meanwhile such portions of 
the text as did not require consultation of the tabular matter were 
hastened. As now presented, it is believed that the statistics relating to 
public and private instruction of all grades and kinds in the United 
States will be found more thoroughly systematized and more fully an- 
alyzed than heretofore. 
The statistics of State and Territorial systems previously published 
by the Office, somewhat remodelled and extended in my first Report, are 
now further modified, so as to render the tabulated statements shorter and 
more compact and the discussion thereof more plain and convenient: 
While the concrete facts are thus presented, the ratio-tables and other 
comparative statistics then begun have been correspondingly extended 
and re-arranged. The main lines, now as then, are to illustrate and 
define (1) the increase or decrease during the year of each item for each 
State; (2) the ratio which each item in each State bears to every item in 
the same State, thus enabling the educational status of each State to be 
compared with that of every other; (3) tabular summaries by geo- 
graphical sections, thus enabling broader comparisons and generaliza- 
tions to be instituted. 
Instead of depending upon the kindness and taking the time of cor- 
respondents by asking them to supply these ratios and comparisons, I 
have had them caleulated in this Office according to carefully considered 
rules; in short, the object has been to give the information itself in- 
stead of the materials therefor, and to present accurate and complete 
statistics on a uniform basis. 
The Report for 1885-86 presented these features mainly for State 
systems; in the present volume the work of improvement on the lines 
referred to above has been continued and enlarged. For example, the 
most important difference in the method of presenting the statistics of 
city and town systems in the Reports for 1885-86 and 1886-87 consists 
' in the introduction in the latter of a comparative table similar in pur- 
pose to those described in the preceding paragraphs respecting State 
systems. A short account of the modifications introduced in this part 
of this Report is not out of place here. 
The statistics have been extended to those cities whose population is 
4,000 or more. The census of 1880 made that number the dividing line 
between the urban and the rural population, and this standard has been 
adopted as the lowest limit of population of “cities” by this Bureau. 
Though only a single column has been added to the table of statistics, 
the value of the figures there shown is vastly increased by the deduc- 
tions drawn from them in the comparative table that follows. 
In the blanks sent out for 1885-86 superintendents were asked to 
state “the average number of scholars per teacher ;” the “average 
cost per capita of pupils in average attendance, based upon cost of 
supervision and instruction,” and upon “ incidental and contingent ex- 
penses;” and the “ tax for school purposes upon the total property,
-P-A-G-E-17
  THE COMMISSIONER'S STATEMENT. LG 
assessed and estimated.” All these questions are omitted in the in- 
quiries for the 1886-87 Report. Instead, all these calculations and 
others of a similar nature are made in this Office, thus insuring uniform 
methods of computation. 
Further, the population between the ages of 6 and 14 years has been 
determined in each case, and averages are made upon that basis, as 
well as upon the average attendance upon the schools. For purposes 
‘of comparison upon equal terms this is absolutely necessary, since the 
“jegal school age” is so variable as to make comparison impossible 
unless uniform bases were established. 
The new tables show the percentage of ‘‘ enrolment to population 6 to 
14;” of “average daily attendance to population 6 to 14, and to: enrol- 
ment;” the “average number of days that each person between the 
ages of 6 and 14 has been instructed;” the ‘average number of days 
of attendance of each pupil enrolled ;” the “number of sittings for each 
100 pupils enrolled and for each 100 pupils in average attendance; ” 
the ‘average number of sittings to a building;” “the number of pupils 
in average attendance to each teacher ;” “ rake of male teachers to 
whole number;” “ratio of high-school enrolment to total enrolment; ” 
“ratio of private school enrolment to total public and private school 
enrolment;” “ratio of total public and private enrolment to popula- 
tion 6 to 14;” “number of volumes in libraries to each 100 pupils in 
average Renders: 3” “assessed value of property per capita of popu- 
lation 6 to14;” ‘value of school property per capita of population 6 
to 14 and of average attendance ;” “ratio of value of school property 
to total assessed valuation ;” “amount raised by city tax per capita of 
population 6 to 14 and of average attendance;” ‘ratio of amount raised 
by city or town tax to total assessed valuation;” “ salaries of superin. 
tendents and teachers per capita of population 6 to 14 and of average 
attendance;” and finally, “ratio of salaries of superintendents and 
teachers to total assessed valuation.” 
The several instrumentalities for the training of teachers are carefully 
considered and represented in Chapter VI. In addition to the public 
normal schools and to a class of private schools which make the train- 
ing of teachers their principal work, the summaries of pupils reported 
in the normal courses of secondary schools and colleges are included in 
the chapter, so that the general view of normal-school instruction may 
be as complete as heretofore. 
On the other hand, care has been taken in other parts of the v lume 
to display the amount and statistics of normal teaching afforded in each 
secondary or superior school, and copious cross-references are made 
wherever necessary. 
Kindergartens, of which detailed tables were omitted in the Report 
for 1884-85, were carefully tabulated in my first Report, and simi- 
lar tabulations appear in this volume (Chapter VII). The application 
2 ED

-P-A-G-E-18
  
  LB EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
of kindergarten methods to the instruction of the blind and of other 
special classes is set forth in connection with other related facts. 
The statistics of secondary instruction (Chapter VIII) have been ren- 
dered more complete in regard to public high schools, while the sub- 
divisions adopted for the table correspond more exactly to the present 
condition of the schools considered, and therefore better facilitate the 
study of the details. ‘ 
‘The changes in the forms and methods of the classification adopted 
_ are explained in the remarks relating to these schools. The whole sub- 
ject was considered from every practicable point of view, and the best 
result attainable has been presented. It should not be understood, 
however, that the scheme here indicated is not open to future modifica- 
tions; on the contrary, the experience gained during the year under re- 
view will be used to improve and extend the subject in future volumes. 
Those familiar with the educational history of the past few years can 
not fail to be impressed with the evidence it affords of vital force in the 
superior institutions of learning in the United States, and of the great 
and growing interest manifested by foreign students of education in the 
details of their organization, equipment, and conduct. 
The number and varied character of these institutions make it exceed- 
ingly difficult to devise a scheme suited at once to the just representa- 
tion of individual institutions and to the record of particulars common 
toaclass. The former is necessary to give a fair idea of the genius and 
growth of our institutions, aud the latter to show their relation to edu- 
cational problems of universal moment. 
Two departures from the scheme formerly employed in this division 
of the Report have been made, namely, the introduction of Tables 43 
and 44, presenting in a single view all the departments of State uni- 
versities and foundations of private origin which consist of groups of 
related faculties or schools, and the removal from Table 48 of those de- 
partments whose statistics could not be separated from those elsewhere 
tabulated. These changes are fully explained in Chapter IX. 
The treatment of details here, as in the division of secondary instruc- 
_ tion, has been determined by the consideration of the information of 
chief importance to those charged with the duty of promoting the edu- 
cational interests of the country. 
Training for special pursuits and the education of special classes are 
considered with such fulness as is consistent with their relations to other 
parts of the field of instruction. 
The section relating to libraries (Chapter XVIII) is much enlarged 
since my last Report. The general table of libraries, printed in the Re- 
port for 1884-85, was taken as the point of departure, and the tabulated 
statistics presented in this volume are the result of three processes, viz.: 
(1) the elimination of libraries connected with schools and systems 
mentioned in other parts of the volume; (2) the adding of all libraries 
discovered since the publication of that list; and (3) the classification of 
libraries having one thousand or more volumes into seven divisions,
-P-A-G-E-19
      
THE COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT. 19 
according to the nature of their support and the conditions appended 
to their use. Summaries of libraries connected with schools and sys- 
tems treated in other parts of this Report present the reader with the 
general facts useful for geographical and chronological comparison. 
Chaptet XXIT contains @ list of the publications of this Bureau from 
its origin in 1867 to the year covered by this volume, and an alpha- 
betical index to their contents. This index is intended to render the 
use of these publications more easy when they ate accessible, and to 
save the time of investigators and applicants when they do not possess 
the documents themselves. : 
The general condition and pr § of education during the year un- 
det review thus set fortli is di sed and exemplified in connection 
with the tables and statistics above described, and needs no further ex- 
emplification here. An examination of these disqnestond, éte,, will show 
that the conditions and progress heretofore characteristic of American 
education have been, in general, maintained during the year 1886-87, 
There may have been here and there retrogressions and reactions, but 
these are more than balanced by healthy growths and judicious improve- 
ments. The subjects that attracted the attention of the profession in 
the year 1885-86 still continue to be the main objects of interest in the 
following year. 
Among notable events of the year in the educational world may be 
mentioned the celebration by Harvard University of the two hundred 
and fiftieth anniver of its foundation; the formal asstimption by 
the corporation of Yale College of the name of “Yale University,” as 
more exactly expressing the extent and importance of its present work 
in education; the centennial celebration of the incorporation of Colum- 
bia College, and the opening by that institution of its “School of Lik 
brary Economy,” and the various experiments, public and private, instiv 
tuted for the introduction and application of manual and industrial 
training in the schools, both public and private.     
  History oF AMERICAN HpvucAtion. 
The Bureat of Education, with your approval, has entered upon ah 
important line of educational inquiry. It las undertaken to investi- 
gate the history of American education from its earliest beginnings. 
The approaching Centennial of the United States Governinent under 
the Constitution renders such an historical review of the educational 
progress of the whole country both fitting and desirable. Our States 
will be stimulated to greater individual activity in the promotion of 
sound learning by a comparative history of what has been already 
accomplished. 
THE COLLEGE OF WILLIAM AND MARY. 
This new work of inquiry was begun in a very modest way by a study 
of the history of the College of William and Mary, the oldest collegiate 
institution of the South. At Williamsburg, the old capital of Virginia, 
   
-P-A-G-E-20
      20 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
were trained many of the statesmen of the Revolutionary period, men * 
who devised the so-called “Virginia plan,” upon which our present 
Federal Constitution is based. George Washington was for many years 
the Chancellor of this famous college, and Thomas Jefferson and John 
Marshall were among its most distinguished sons. The influence of 
William and Mary College upon Southern education was carefully traced 
out, and the results of the inquiry were published as Circular of Infor- 
mation No. 1, 1887, a monograph of ninety pages, which has attracted 
great interest and favorable mention in the North and West, as well as 
at the South. The subject of Southern educational history has been 
so long neglected, and contains so much of real value, that the friends 
of American education, irrespective of section, are well pleased to have 
systematic inquiries extended into that part of our common country. 
The precise scope of the above monograph can be quickly perceived 
from the following letter which was addressed by me to you. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
Bureau or Epucation, 
Washington, D. C., January 20, 1887. 
The Honorable Taz SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, 
Washington, D. C.: 
Sir: The history of the higher education in the United States deserves organized 
inquiry and national attention. The origin, development, academic status, and prac- 
tical usefulness of many of our older and better institutions of learning are scarcely 
known beyond their own scholastic environment. Documentary and manuscript ma- 
terial for such educational history and statistics is abundant, although often widely 
scattered, as will be seen by an examination of the bibliography appended to the 
present sketch. 
The College of William and Mary, founded in 1693 by royal grant, and long sup- 
ported by popular legislation in Virginia, has been suffered to decline almost to ruin 
since the civil war, which destroyed the greater part of its property. The oldest col- 
lege in the South, in fact the oldest in the country, with the exception of Harvard 
University, has been left to decay, while the latter institution, with which William 
and Mary College used to share the annual income of the bequest by Robert Boyle, 
the English philosopher, has lately celebrated its 250th anniversary amid general re- 
joicing, with the President of the United States and representatives of American and 
European universities to do honor to the occasion. Thoold college at Williamsburg, 
which gave Washington his first degree as civil engineer, and to which he gave his 
last public service as chancellor, the college which trained in law and politics Thomas 
Jefferson, Governor Randolph, Chief Justice Marshall, and nearly all of the Virginia 
statesmen of the Revolutionary and formative periods in our Federal history, has not 
now asingle student. Its classic halls are closed and deserted. From aonce flourish- 
ing faculty, which early and ably represented both history and political science, with 
other liberal arts, only the president, who is also professor of mathematics and phys- 
ics, now remains. At the opening of every academic year, in October, Doctor Ewell 
causes the chapel bell to be rung, reminding Williamsburg that the ancient col- 
lege still lives. To friends of the higher education in all of our States this fact will 
echo as a note of warning against public neglect and legislative indifference towaid 
higher institutions of learning. 
The present monograph has been prepared by Dr. Herbert B. Adams, the head of 
the department of history and political science at the Johns Hopkins University in 
Baltimore, in connection with his more extended inquiry for the Bureau of Educa- 
tion respecting the study of history in American colleges and universities.
-P-A-G-E-21
      THE COMMISSIONER'S STATEMENT. 21 
  This special inquiry is, however, not designed to be a special plea for the College of 
William and Mary, whose claim for reimbursement for damages suffored at the hands 
of undisciplined and straggling soldiers has more than once been presented to Con- 
gress, and more than once favorably reported by tho Committee on Education and 
Labor, sustained by the opinions of lawyers and Federal officers. The primary ob- 
jects of the present investigation have been to discover tho historical beginnings of 
the higher education at the South; to trace the causes of the early prosperity of Will- 
iam and Mary College; to show its influence upon Virginia statesmen and the South- 
ern States, its relation to the university ideas of Jefferson and Washington, and its 
significance to the whole country ; to point out the causes of the decline of William 
and Mary College; to explain tho rise of the University of Virginia, and the neces- 
sity of popular support for the higher education. 
The most practical of all results from this historical study of William and Mary 
College is the suggestion of a possible revival in the city of Washington and through- 
out the country of the original Virginia idea of political education, which made 
Williamsburg a school of statesmen who were fitted in the college-capital to prepare 
the so-called ‘ Virginia plan,” from which our present Constitution grew. It is the 
idea of intimate organic connection between education and government in a munici- 
pal environment. 
The promotion of political education by connection on the one hand with the peo- 
plo, and on the other with the administration of State and Nation, is an idea worthy 
of consideration in this centennial year of our Constitution, which was founded upon 
political wisdom and Federal democracy. In December, 1886, it was proposed, at a 
meeting in Philadelphia of delegates from the various States and Territories in the 
Union, to create a suitable memorial commemorative of the Constitution. Doctor 
Adams suggests a civil academy in the city of Washington for the practical training 
of representative college graduates appointed to government fellowships for two years 
from Congressional districts. He would combine, at the national capital, the West 
Point idea and the Williamsburg idea for the highest political education, and apply 
the results to the general improvement of civic life throughout the country. This 
eminent scholar writes with the freedom of one who understands as well as loves his 
subject; his article will commend itself to the hearty approval of all who are inter- 
ested in American learning, in the history of our country, and in the faithful record 
of the first steps in American education. 
In view of these facts I recommend the publication of the paper as a circular of in- 
formation. I have the honor to be, 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
N. H.R. Dawson, 
Commissioner. 
L. Q. C. Lamar, 
Secretary. Approved, 
Encouraged by the favorable reception of the history of William and 
Mary College, I urged the author to prepare a similar but more exten- 
sive monograph upon Thomas Jefferson and the University of Vir- 
ginia, Jefferson was the pioncer of university education and of free 
schools at the South. He advocated both as early as 1779, when serv- 
ing as a visitor or trustee of William and Mary College. It has taken 
nearly a century for his noble scheme of public education for the whole 
people to find practical realization. Doctor Adams has traced the pro- 
cess of educational development in Virginia through various phases, 
and has discovered. in the writings of Thomas Jefferson many early 
anticipations of what are now thought to be progressive ideas in pri-

    22 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
mary, secondary, and higher education, A review of Jefferson’s intlu- 
ence upon American institutions of learning can not fail to interest 
American educators in all parts of the country. His influence in this 
regard was not confined to a single State; it has pervaded the whole 
land; it is a vital element in modern educational democracy. 
Tn connection with the monograph upon Jefferson and the University 
of Virginia, now in the hands of the Public Printer, sketches have 
been prepared of all the colleges of Virginia, with pictorial illustrations, 
This supplementary matter, together with the history of William and 
Mary College and of Jefferson’s largersinstitution, will make the higher 
educational history of Virginia quite complete. _The importance of this 
State as the original training-ground of many Southern statesmen and 
of teachers of every profession clearly justifies the historical attention 
bestowed upon it. 
From such beginnings I have advanced gradually to the idea of an 
organized inquiry with regard to the history of American education, 
to be treated in State groups and in the following order: 
1, The Southern Atlantic States,embracing Virginia, North and South 
Carolina, and Georgia. The work inthis group of States has been already 
nearly completed by representatives of those States, working under the 
editorial direction of Dr. H. B. Adams, who himself elaborated the 
Virginia report as a model for the rest. These monographs upon the 
history of education in the older Southern States will all be ready for 
the Public Printer at an early date, and will be published during the 
current year. The historical interest discovered in the educational — 
fields of North and South Carolina and Georgia is not surpassed’ even 
by Virginia, mother of institutions of learning, as well as of presidents 
and statesmen. 
2. The Northwest.—The rapidly approaching centennial of the settle- 
ment of the old Northwest Territory made proper an immediate exten- 
sion of these historical inquiries into that rich educational field. Prom- 
inent educators in each State in that territory have been engaged to 
co-operate in the prosecution of an organized inquiry under the general 
direction of this Bureau, Professor William F, Allen, of the historical 
department of the University of Wis as consented to be respon- 
sible for the educational history of that State; Professor George W. 
Knight, a graduate of the University of Michigan, and now professor 
of history in the State University of Ohio, will group the returns from 
Michigan, Ohio, and Illinois; and Professor Jas, A, Woodburn, of the 
tate University of Indiana, will write the monograph upon tliat State. 
Illustrations will be secured to represent all the leading institutions, 
8, The Southwest,—Justly balancing the inquiry into the educational 
history of the Old Northwest, I now propose, for the year 1889, a series of 
monographs upon the History of Education in the Southwest and Gulf. 
States, embracing Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, 
Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri. The successful pros:    
   
-P-A-G-E-23
THE COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT. 23 
ecution of this inquiry demands preliminary arrangement during the 
current year. Writers will be engaged and systematic investigations 
begun promptly under competent direction. The resources of this Bu- . 
reau do not admit of a rapid extension of the work, but they are capa- 
ble of achieving satisfactory results within limited areas in successive 
years. The method of handling a great subject, like American educa- 
tional history, by State groups and State monographs'seems to me not 
only est suited to the economic resources of the Bureau, but also quite 
in hafmony with the State and local spirit of this country. The indi- 
vidual monographs can be freely distributed throughout all the States, 
but more especially in the sections most interested. ‘The combined mon- 
ographs will form a series of volumes representing handsomely and 
characteristically the various State groups already described. 
4, The New Northwest.—After the completion of the work in the 
Southwest the inquiry will be extended into the great Northwest be- 
yond the Mississippi River. This region of investigation will embrace 
Iowa, Minnesota, Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, and Montana. 
5. The Far West and the Pacific Slope will conclude the pioneer work 
in American, educational history. 
6. New England.—Returning eastward, our inquiries will be centred 
for a time upon the Eastern States, considered as one educational group, 
Historical investigation in the older fields may well be undertaken after 
the pioneer work in the West and South has been completed. The ed- 
ucational history of New England is already comparatively well known, 
whereas in other sections of the country very little has been done to- 
ward the historical treatment of American education. All fair-minded 
and thoughtful men will rejoice to see work done first where it is most 
needed; and the older fields of American educational history will ac- 
quire fresh interest from the application of the comparative method of 
treatment. — : 
7. New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, and the 
District of Columbia will form a convenient group for the conclusion of 
this educational series. Organized inquiry should finally be brought 
to bear upon the educational history of the city of Washington and 
upon an historical review of the scientific work of the United States 
Government, including the work of the Bureau of Wducation. 
REPORT ON THE STUDY OF HISTORY IN AMERICAN COLLEGES AND 
; UNIVERSITIES. 
Public interest in American educational history has been tested by 
the Bureau of Education in a broader field than that opened by the 
monograph on William‘and Mary College. Immediately after the pub- 
lication of the latter, the Bureau issued a larger monograph by the same 
author upon the Study of History in American Colleges and Universi- 
ties. This report, while chiefly concerned with the origin and develop- 
ment of historical studies in American institutions of learning, gave ‘

some account of representative American universities, notably of Har- 
vard and Yale, Columbia and Cornell, the University of Michigan, and 
_ the new Johns Hopkins University, together with the principal Ameri- 
can colleges for women. The following preliminary letter to you will 
explain concisely the general scope and purpose of the work: 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BuREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., April 18, 1887. 
The Honorable Tue Secretary OF THE INTERIOR, 
Washington, D. C.: 
Sir: The accompanying monograph, prepared at the request of the Bureau of Ed- 
ucation by Dr. Herbert.B, Adams, of Johns Hopkins University, relates to the methods 
of studying history in American colleges and universities. The subject is treated 
from an historical point of view, and is a substantial contribution to the history of 
the higher education in the United States. Doctor Adams’. sketch of William and 
Mary College, Circular of Information No. 1, 1887, with its practical suggestions for 
reviving political education throughout our country, was preliminary to this larger 
report, which is designed to promote the study of history as a basis for political 
science. : 
In December, 1835, a cireular letter was issued from this Office, inquiring into the 
present condition of historical studies, not only in colleges and universities, but also 
in high schools, normal schools, institutes, academies, ete. The returns, while ex- 
tensive, were on the whole unsatisfactory. In a few instances there were encourag- 
ing signs of good work in both higher and secondary training, but the general results 
indicated a serious absence of proper historical instruction in all grades of American 
education. By my advice the tabulation of statistical returns was restricted to in- 
stitutes of the college and university grade. The question of secondary education in 
history demands special treatment and a study of the best methods now in use in the 
German gymnasia, the French lycées, and the English public schools. 
From the unsatisfactory nature of the great mass of statistical returns, Doctor Adams 
was driven to another method of treating his subject—to a descriptive statement of 
the best experience of a few representative institutions in different parts of the coun- 
try, based upon an original and independent study of documents, official reports, and 
catalogues. Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Cornell were selected to represent. the 
best Eastern and Northern experience in the teaching of history; the University of 
Michigan worthily stands for the great West; while the young Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity represents the historical spirit of the New South. At this latter institution 
studies are in preparation upon Jefferson and the University of Virginia, and the 
History of Higher Education in North and South Carolina and Georgia. 
The best colleges for women have been included in the present monograph, namely, 
Vassar, Wellesley, Smith, and Bryn Mawr. 
Many other institutions are brought into rapid review by means of the statistical 
tables appended to this report, and representing returns actually made to this Office. 
Other colleges are mentioned in a special inquiry into the subject of American History 
in our Schools and Colleges, contributed to this report, at the request of Doctor 
Adams, by Dr. Francis N. Thorpe, Fellow of the University of Pennsylvania. An ac- 
count of the Study of History and Political Science in the Washington High School, 
by Dr. E.R. L. Gould, formerly Fellow of Johns Hopkins University, concludes the 
report. Doctor Gould’s account shows what can_ be done for the development of sec- 
ondary education in history and economics, and what actually has been done in the 
Federal capital under the auspices of the Government. 
In this monograph, prepared by Doctor Adams, theoretical and ideal views of his- 
torical training have been carefully avoided. The writer has deliberately confined 
his attention to sclect chapters of actual American experience, and to things done or  
-P-A-G-E-25

attempted by particular institutions and individuals, whose work he has studied from 
authentic records. He has thus opened up a new line of inquiry, namely, the history 
of academic departments. 
History is simply the record of human experience, whether in’ physics, politics, eco- 
nomics, ethics, or education, History has been called philosophy teaching by exam- 
ple; or, as teachers say, by object-lessons. Doctor Adams has applied the historical 
method to the discovery of the most approyed methods of teaching history and of 
organizing historical departments in our American schools and colleges. 
One of the most suggestive and noticeable features of his work is the attempt to 
illustrate by photo-engravings and diagrams the actual environment or library sur- 
roundings of certain schools of history and politics. In these modern days the col- 
lege or university library has been brought into close rapport with department work 
by means of an ingenious system of seminary or class libraries in the very room where 
students meet. This suggested the introduction of the laboratory method for the 
gtudy of history and other moral sciences. The growing value of historical and polit- 
ical studies, and the importance of promoting them throughout the country as a 
means of strengthening good government and good citizenship, I need not emphasize. 
I beg leave to recommend the publication and illustration of this report on The 
Study of History in American Colleges and Universities as a most valuable contri- 
bution to the history of higher education in the United States. 
Very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
N. H. R. Dawson, 
Commissioner. 
Approved.

OPINIONS OF THE RECENT WORK OF THE BUREAU. 
In commendation of these contributions to American educational his- 
tory many letters and acknowledgments have been received by the Bu- 
reau of Education from competent specialists and educators in the Old 
World, as well as in the United States and Canada. Our publications 
have been gratefully acknowledged, not only by American libraries and 
institutions of learning, but by the universities and learned academies 
of all the leading countries of Hurope. Itis impossible in this connec- 
tion to present this mass of letters of acknowledgment; but the follow- 
ing selections from American critical journals and popular newspapers 
will serve to show how the recent work of the Bureau has been received,

“By a pleasant coincidence these two volumes reach us together, and they have a

most valuable, of all,

“Dr, Adams’s paper on the study of history in American colleges and universities 
is quite as painstaking and far more comprehensive a study than that of Professor 
Fredericq. The substance of some of the chapters has previously appeared as arti- 
cles in Education, but they are now reproduced with many additions. Dr. Adams 
traces the study of history at Harvard from its foundation up to the preparation of

teenth century to the foundation of the courses now given by Professors Whocler and. 
Dexter. To Columbia College the writer awards the honor of being the first institu- 
tion in America to recognize history as worthy of a professorial chair. Ilis sketch of 
the historical teaching at Columbia, which embraces the work of Vardill, Anthon, 
MeVickar, Lieber, and Burgess, is in many respects the most interesting in the vol- 
ume, and to it a very appreciative account of the School of Political Science is added. 
The University of Michigan- and Cornell receive separate and generous treatment. 
The chapter on the Johns Hopkins University is a slightly revised reprint of Dr. 
Adams's earlier paper on the subject. We were very much interested in reading 
of the excellent instruction being given in the colleges for women, particularly at 
Wellesley. f 
‘Read in connection with each other and together with Professor Fredericq’s arti- 
cles on the teaching of history in Germany and France, published some little time 
ago in the Revue Internationale de V Enseignement, these pamphlets afford us the data 
for determining with some approach to exactness the comparative value of the his- 
torical instruction now being given at the world’s great colleges and universities. 
We find advance everywhere—promising, hopeful advance. The spirit of Savigny, 
Ranke, and Droysen is abroad ;. and the work of Freeman and Seeley in England, and 
of Burgess, Emerton, Adams, and Channing in this country, is in the right direction, 
and productive of excellent results. But the next generation will be even better able 
than our own to appreciate what the modern method of studying and teaching his- 
tory really means.”—Science, December 9, 1887. 
“One of the most interesting publications ever sent out by the Government Bureau 
of Education is a book entitled The Study of History in American Colleges and Uni- 
versities, by Herbert B. Adams, Ph. D., associate professor of history in the Johns 
Hopkins University. Itis a work of 300 pages, and it is excellently illustrated with 
full-page wood-cuts of the reading rooms of leading institutions. The picture of the 
book room of the Peabody Library is especially good, The work was prepared at the 
request of the Bureau of Education. Dr, Adams treats the subject from an historical 
point of view, and his book, in point of general and special value, is one of the most 
substantial contributions to higher education that has been published this year. 
Harvard, Yale, Columbia, and Cornell were selected to represent the best Eastern 
and Northern experience in the teaching of history; the University of Michigan 
worthily stands for the great West, while Johns Hopkins University represents the 
historical spirit of the new South. At this latter institution studies are in prep- 
aration upon Jefferson and the University of Virginia, and the History of Higher Edu- 
cation in North and South Carolina and Georgia. The colleges for women that have 
been included in the monograph are Vassar, Wellesley, Smith, and Bryn Mawr. 
Many other institutions are brought into rapid review by means of the statistical 
tables appended to this report, and representing returns actually made. Other col- 
leges are mentioned in a special inquiry into the subject of American history in our 
schools and colleges, contributed to the report, at the request of Dr. Adams, by Dr. 
Francis N. Thorpe, fellow of the University of Pennsylvania. An account of the 
study of history and political science in the Washington High School, by Dr. E, R. L. 
Gould, formerly fellow of the Johns Hopkins University, concludes the report. In 
the monograph theoretical and ideal views of historical training have been carefully 
avoided. The writer has deliberately confined his attention to select chapters of act- 
ual American experience, and to things done or attempted by particular institutions 
and individuals, whose work he has studied from authentic records. He has thus 
opened up a new line of inquiry, namely, the history of academic departments.”—

“Tt isnot often that Government publicatioys can be recommended as interesting 
rea ding, but this monograph [The College of William and Mary], written by one of 
the most distinguished historical scho lars in America, is an exception to the general

rule. Several practical educational questions * * * are ably discussed, and those 
interested in the higher education will find it instructive as well as entertaining.” — 
State Chronicle (Raleigh, N. C.), May 26, 1887. 
‘The second circular, also by Doctor Adams, is an extended and valuable report on 
The Study of History in American Colleges and Universities. Its aim is to revive the 
study of political science throughout the country by promoting the study of the Amer- 
ican nation as a basis.”—The (Philadelyhia) American, Decomber 24, 1887. 
“Of all the Circulars of Information issued by the Bureau of Education, one of the 
most valuable is No. 2 for 1837, entitled The Study of History in’ American Colleges 
and Universities, by Dr. Herbert B. Adams, Professor of History in the Johns Hopkins 
University, Baltimore. 
“This ‘circular’ reaches the respectable dimensions of a volume of 300 pages, and 
consists of two parts; the first isan extended account of the origin and growth of 
historical study at some of our largest universitics, and the second asummary of its 
present condition, to which are added extensive tables, showing all the details of the 
departments of history in forty-seven colleges and universities at the present time. 
“To all interested in education this monograph will be welcome. To those who 
hold to the ‘classical’ side of the controversy concerning the proper subjects of col- 
lege discipline, it will bring comfort in the oft repeated statement that the study has 
ever been and must continue to be ‘based upon the solid substructure of thorough 
classical study.’ Believers inthe ‘elective’ programme will welcome it as indicating 
a'tendency toward studies practical as well as disciplinary. It is well worth the at- 
tention of conservative institutions as indicating to them some of tho distinctively 
modern demands which are now so plainly made upon tkem, while at the same time 
it shows clearly enough that they are in the best position to meet these demands. 
The large number of students at institutions of very recent origin shows that an ex- 
clusive reliance upon the traditions and methods of previous generations can not be 
maintained, certainly not if that reliance implies the deliberate closing of the eyes to 
tendencies which are none the less deep and strong because they are only lately de- 
veloped. 
“Several very attractive pictures of library interiors are found in the book, and 
help.to make it the most complete and satisfactory account we have of college work 
in this one line.”— The (New York) Independent, February 9, 1888. 
  As additional evidence of the influence of the work already donein 
the field of educational history, I would call attention to the fact that 
the Legislature of Virginia has lately agreed to revive the College of 
William and Mary by an annual grant of $10,000 to make it a normal 
college in addition to its general academic functions. The accompany- 
ing letter from General William B. Talliaferro, president of the Board : 
of Governors, is a gratifying statement of this fact: 
Dear Sm: In response to my request, you did me the favor to send me a number 
of copies of the paper prepared for your Bureau by Dr, Herbert B. Adams, of Johns 
Hopkins University, upon the College of William and Mary. In the extreme finan- 
cial embarrassment to which events beyond control had reduced that college, which 
resulted practically in closing its doors, the Board of Governors determined, for the 
first time in her history, to apply to the Commonwealth for some relief, and accord- 
ingly a proposition was submitted to the General Assembly at its late session by which 
in consideration of an annual appropriation of $10,000, the college proposed to edu- 
cate free of all charge for tuition not less than ono young white man for each county 
or delegate to the General Assembly, on condition that satisfactory assuranceshould be 
given by the student that he would teach two years in the public free schools of the 
State. In addition to the collegiate course. it was proposed to establish a system of 
normal instruction in which these pupilsshould be trained without expense. 
   
-P-A-G-E-28
28 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
The college possessed ample buildings for lecture rooms, assembly halls, boarding 
houses, dormitories, and it was believed by the friends of the institution that the 
free school system of the State, to support which more than a million and a half of 
dollars is annually collected from the people of Virginia, would receive, by the in- 
fusion of trained teachers into the public schools, a benefit which can hardly be over- 
estimated. 
It is perhaps well to state that we have in Virginia two normal schools for colored 
pupils, namely, at Hampton and Petersburg, and one at Farmville for white females, 
but no normal institution for white males. To present this scheme to the Legislature 
acommittee was appointed, of which Iwas chairman. Believing that the naked 
presentation of the simple economic and practical proposition above stated would be 
greatly aided by an appeal to the sentiment involved in tho even partial restoration 
of this ancient institution, and that the recollection of her history, and of the vast 
influences which she had exerted through her sons upon the destinies of the country, 
would rekindle the pride with which sho had been heretofore regarded, and would aid 
usin our effort to secure the appropriation, the committee determined to avail them- 
selves of the means of presenting this view to the Legislature which were so oppor- 
tunely afforded by the admirable and very valuable production of Professor Adams, 
and it was therefore that I requested you to send me the copies which you so kindly 
furnished. We have had the good fortune to be successful, having secured the ap- 
propriation, and have, I think, the right to hope and the reason to believe that our 
old institution will renew its course of usefulness. I write now to acknowledge the 
obligation we are under to the Bureau oyer which you preside, to yourself, and to 
Doctor Adams, and to assure you that you may have the satisfaction of believing that 
the restoration of the oldest but one of the institutions of learning in the country 
will be quite largely due to the valuable paper which you have published. 
Iam, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALASKA. = 
  One hundred and sixty years ago Vitus Behring discovered the strait 
between Siberia and Alaska which still bears his name, and which has 
since been extended to that part of the Pacific Ocean south of that 
strait between the continents of Asia and America and the Aleutian 
Islands. That intrepid explorer, in his second expedition between 1733 
and 1741, discovered the Aleutian Islands, and touched the American 
continent south of Bristol Bay at the 58th degree of north latitude. 
Two years after this expedition had ended in his shipwreck and death, 
his attempts to establish a trade with the native tribes resulted in the 
acquisition of Northwest America by the Russian Empire. From that 
time until the sale of the territory to the United States, the Russian 
Government, through the agency of the trading companies, maintained 
an absolute despotism over the native races, and reduced the Aleuts to 
a state of serfdom. They were much more intelligent and less warlike 
than the Esquimaux, and were an entirely different people from the 
natives of the coast or the interior. The barbarous and inhuman treat- 
ment to which they were subjected by the early Russian explorers and 
trading companies, reduced the population to less than ten per cent. of 
 
-P-A-G-E-29
   29        TIIE COMMISSIONER'S STATEMENT.        its original number. This system continued until 1818, when the Rus- 
sian Government interposed between them and the trading companies, 
and adopted a policy which resulted in the improvement of their con- 
dition. In 1824 Father Innocentius Veniaminoff, now the Primate of 
the Greek Church, began his labors as a missionary among the Aleuts, 
and to him is due in great measure the change which has taken place 
in their condition. The entire race, under the influence of the clergy, — 
were educated to some extent, and Christianized and converted to the 
doctrines and worship of the Greek Church. 
Alaska, formerly Russian America, comprises all that mpnean of the 
North American continent lying west of the 141st parallel of west longi- 
tude, together with a narrow strip of land between the Pacific Ocean 
and the British Dominions, and separated from the latter by a line be- 
ginning at the southernmost point of Prince of Wales Island, in latitude 
64° 40/ north; running thence north along Portland Canal to the point 
of the main land where it strikes latitude 56° north; and from this 
point along the summits of the mountain range parallel with the coast, 
except where the distance of these summits from the ocean exceeds 
ten marine leagues, to its intersection with the 141st meridian. 
It also includes all the islands near the coast, and the whole of the 
Aleutian Archipelago, except Behring’s Island and Copper Island, on 
the coast of Kamschatka. The area of Alaska, including the islands, 
is 532,000 square miles. This territory was ceded to the Government 
of the United States, in consideration of the sum of $7,200,000, by a 
treaty with Russia on the 30th of March, 1867, the ratifications of which 
by the respective governments were exchanged on the 20th of June 
following. : : 
By this purchase the United States acquired an additional extent of 
sea-coast on the Pacific and Arctic Oceans greater than its entire coast 
line on the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. 
In regard to both climate and agriculture, the Territory is divided 
into three regions :. The Yukon district, comprising the country north of 
the Alaskan Mountains; the Aleutian distr comprising the islands 
of that name and the peninsula; and the Sitka district, Cone the 
remainder of the Territory. 
In the Yukon district the mean annual temperature is about 25° 
Fahrenheit, and the ground remains frozen to within two or three feet 
of the surface throughout the summer. 
The climate of the Aleutian district is warmer, the mean annual tem- 
perature being from 36° to 40° Fahrenheit. In a series of observations, 
extending over five years, the greatest cold was found to bo zero, while 
the highest temperature was 77°. 
A still warmer and moister climate is characteristic of the Sitka dis- 
trict, the mean annual temperature being 44.7°, and the temperature 
during the winter seldom reaching the freezing point

The interior of the country is well wooded. On the Pacific Coast 
dense forests of spruce, yellow cedar, hemlock, and balsam fir clothe the 
mountain sides, both on the islands and main land. 
The Aleutian Islands are wholly destitute of timber. In the Yukon 
region the wooded district recedes from the coast, but timber is abun- 
_ dant in the interior. 
The agricultural resources of Alaska are practically confined to the 
Aleutian and Sitka districts. The abundant growth of rich grasses in 
these districts affords excellent pasturage, and good oats, barley, po- 
tatoes, and root crops can be raised. 
The natives of Alaska may properly be classed into two divisions, the 
Esquimaux and kindred tribes, and the Indians. To the first belong 
the inhabitants of the Aleutian Islands and the Innuit, on the islands 
along the coast from Behring’s Strait to Mount St. Hlias. 
The commerce of Alaska at present grows out of its fisheries, fur 
trade, and mining interests. Its extent may be inferred from the fol- 
lowing caretully estimated statement of the market value of the prod- 
ucts of these industries for the last year by the Governor of Alaska: 
Fur trade, $2,500,000; gold (bullion and dust), $1,350,000; fisheries, 
$3,000,000 ; lumber and ivory, $100,000; making a total of $6,950,000. 
Four peninsulas project from the continent into the waters of the 
Arctic and Behring’s Seas. The most southern, long and narrow, has 
given its name to the whole land, and is prolonged by a chain of rocky 
islands westward for more than eight hundred miles. 
From the southeastern corner of the main land projects the coast line 
as far south as 54° 40/ north latitude, Into the heart of the central 
portion of this Territory extend the northern ranges of the Rocky 
Mountains. One of these, the Alaskan range, turns southward at about 
147° west longitude, runs along the southern edge of the Alaskan Pen- 
insula, and forms the Aleutian Islands before mentioned, extending 
into the deeper waters of the North Pacific. North of these ranges 
the prodigious river Yukon takes its rise, flows through the Arctic 
plains, penetrates the mountains surrounding Norton Sound, and pours 
its floods into Behring Sea. 
The river of warm water which flows through the Pacific Ocean, known 
as the Kuro-Siwo, or Japanese Current, is the great climatic influence 
of the country. It flows northward from the torrid zone along the coast 
of Japan, turns eastward and southward along the Aleutian Islands, 
then trends down the Pacific Coast of America, exerting its genial influ- 
ence from Alaska along the shores of Washington, Oregon, California, 
and Mexico. Wherever its warm, moisture-laden winds find their way, 
there winter and drought are almost unknown. Under the influence of 
this wonderful current, and the winds that are constantly blowing land- 
ward across its temperate stream, the climate of the Aleutian Islands 
and southeastern Alaska is surprisingly temperate and mild, comparing 
most favorably with regions in the same latitude on the Atlantic coast.

“4 THE COMMISSIONER'S STATEMENT. 31 
This Territory is the only part of the United States that is not dom- 
inated at this day by the Anglo-American ideas and institutions, which 
began nearly three centuries ago to assert their supremacy in the New 
World. It has been repeatedly observed that colonization and civiliza- 
tion prosper best when travelling on parallels rutining east and west. 
This natural tendency is shown in the presence of the Esquimaux peo- 
ple in Alaska and other Arctic regions. The power that civilization 
gives increases this capacity, and the English races have shown them- 
selves pre-eminently capable of successful modification ae widespread 
growth. Ifit be true that 
Westward the courso of empire takes its way, 
then the Anglo-American flood-tide will eventually extend also to Alaska, 
Such seems the lesson of history, as it is the commonplace of poetry. 
Shall history repeat for Alaska the melancholy tale she has already 
penned respecting the Indian of the United States? Are the natives 
of the new Territory to be expelled from their fishing places and hunt- 
ing grounds, confined to ever-diminishing reservations, or driven into 
mountains and deserts too poor to tempt the cupidity of the white in- 
vader? Are they also to acquire the vices and diseases of the white 
man, without acquiring his safeguards of industry, education, and re- 
ligion? Shall they be exterminated, and shall the millstones of our 
Christian civilization grind to powder the simple children of our Alas- 
kan winds and waves? ‘These problems are to be solved in the shadows 
of the Rocky Mountains and along the tempestuous coasts of the Pa- 
cific, but the moral responsibility will rest upon us here, in the older, 
richer, better trained, and more thoughtful parts of our land. We may 
attempt to evade the problem and shirk the responsibility, but not 
without injury to our moral sense and fair fame as a great factor in the 
civilization of the Western Continent. 
CIVIL GOVERNMENT. 
The political condition of Alaska is anomalous and exceptional. The 
Organic Act of May 7, 1884, which provided a civil government, was 
deferred until nearly twenty years after the treaty of CAST and 
is an imperfect and crude piece of legislation. 
This Act provides little more than the shadow ofvcivil government, 
without the right to legislate or raise revenue. It expressly inhibits 
the operation of the general land laws, while it provides that the laws 
relating to mines and mining shall be in full force and operation. It 
provides no means by which its citizens may acquire homes or home- 
steads, or obtain title to an acre of Jand in its ample domain. It pro- 
vides no means by which the inhabitants can obtain the benefits and 
protection of municipal law, It has established a single tribunal, with 
a more extensive jurisdiction than any similar court in the United 
States, but provides no means by which its processes and decrees may be
-P-A-G-E-32
EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
enforced. This Act has been well described as a “legislative fungus, 
without precedent or parallel in the history of American legislation.” 
As a consequence, the material progress and advancement of the 
Territory have been retarded, immigration has been discouraged, and 
its rich and inviting fields of industry remain undeveloped. 
Tracts of land adapted to agriculture,. producing vegetables and the 
grasses, and affording rich pasturage, may be found in many portions 
of the Territory. With the extension of the land laws to these parts of 
the country, an industrious and enterprising population would soon 
find comfortable-homes and develop thriving industries. With the 
same advantages of civil government which are enjoyed by the citizens 
of other Territories, the people of Alaska would soon enter upon anera 
of prosperity which would justify the expectations of its most sanguine 
friends. It is to be hoped that Congress, at its present session, will 
provide such needful legislation as will protect its citizens and develop 
its rich resources. Alaska is the gate of the North Pacific, and in the 
not distant future must become one of our most valuable possessions. 
EDUCATION IN ALASKA, 
  The duty of making needful and proper provision for the education 
of children of school age in the Territory of Alaska was devolved upon 
the Secretary of the Interior by the provisions of the act providing a 
civil government for Alaska, May 17, 1884, section 18, and the Commis- 
sioner of Education having been designated to carry out these purposes 
by the order of the Hon. H. M. Teller, Secretary of the Interior, bear- 
ing date March 2, 1885, and the same having been continued in force, 
with authority to prepare all needful rules and regulations for the man- 
agement of the schools, a system of rules and regulations for the con- 
duct of the public schools in the Territory was prepared, which was 
adopted and ordered to be promulgated by your order of the 15th day 
of June, 1887, These rules and regulations are contained in Chapter IIL 
of this Report. 
This plan was forwarded to the Hon. A. P. Swineford, Governor of 
the Territory, and the other gentlemeri who were appointed members 
of the Board of Education, with the request that they would at once 
organize under it. 
When I took charge of this Office, as stated in the Annual Report for 
1885-86, I found that Dr. Sheldon Jackson, General Agent of Educa- 
tion for the Territory, had just departed upon a tour of inspection. 
This was undertaken by order of my predecessor, which was approved 
by the Secretary of the Interior, bearing date of August 4, 18386. Under 
the authority given him a vessel was chartered, and he visited, in the 
fall of 1886, the Kadiak group of islands, the Shumagin Islands, and 
Unalaska, in Behring’s Sea. During this voyage schools were estab- 
lished at several points, and a complete census of the population from 
Kadiak westward to Attu was taken. For a full report of his expedi-

tion, and of the condition of education in that Territory for the year 
ending June 30, 1887, I would refer to his report, which will be found 
in Chapter III, to the interesting details of which I would respectfully 
call your attention. 
TOUR ‘OF INSPEC‘LION. 
On the 15th of July last I was directed by you to visit the Territory 
for the purpose of examining into its educational affairs and public 
schools. I was instructed to see that the plan of education recently 
promulgated by your order of the 15th of June was put into operation, 
and that the schools of the Territory were made to conform to the same 
in its requirements; to examine the present condition of education 
among the children of school age, without reference to race; to decide 
what provision for the building of school-houses was needed, and to di- 
rect in what manner the school fund for the current fiscal year should 
be used, so far as I deemed necessary, and to make a_ detailed report 
upon the points covered by these instructions. 
I left Washington on the 22d of July, and proceeded via the North- 
ern Pacific Railroad to Tacoma, Wash. Ter., and thence by steamer 
through the inland passage to Sitka, 
I was a passenger on the Ancon, and passed through the famous 
Alexander Archipelago, studded with its thousand islands. The ship 
stopped at nearly all the villages and settlements, affording me an 
excellent opportunity of seeing the country and conversing with its 
inhabitants. ; 
Islands, mountains, glaciers, inlets, and channels appear all along 
this inland passage; the eye is delighted at every turn by a succession 
of the most beautiful and picturesque scenery. The islands are never 
out of sight, and rise from the bosom of the sea like emeralds in a crown 
of diamonds. The atmosphere is so light and pure that you are hardly 
conscious that you are breathing the elixir of life. The blue waters are 
as smooth and calm as those of an Alpine lake. Ranges of lofty mount- 
ains, rich in forest and verdure, with snow-capped summits and glaciers 
covering large areas, are nearly always in sight. Allis wild, weird, and 
grand. Mounts La Perouse, Crillon, and Fairweather, and many others 
equally imposing, rising from 9,000 to 15,000 feet above the level of the 
ocean, with immense glaciers debouching from their frozen valleys and 
slopes, are successively seen ; while Edgecumbe, whose fires have slum- 
bered for a hundred years, with its crown of volcanic scoria glistening 
in the sunlight, appears like a sleeping giant resting from his labors. 
From its frozen peak cascades come leaping down like threads of silver 
until lost to view in the forest line. : 
En route I visited Nanaimo, Bella-Bella, Metlakahtla, and Port Simp- 
son, in British Columbia; Fort Tongass, Annette Island, Port Chester, 
Fort Wrangell, Loring, Juneau, Douglas Island, Chileat, and Haines. 
The steamer stopped for several hours and parts of days at each of these

points. At all of these towns schools have been in operation since 1885. 
I reached Sitka, the capital, on the 13th of August. 
The schools were in vacation, but I met a number of the native chil- 
dren who attended the schools, and many adult Indians and citizens, 
Most of these children and some of thé Indians speak English. — 
I met, also the teachers at Fort Wrangéll, Juneau, Killisnoo, Doug: 
las Island, Chileat, and Sitka; and obtained from them all the informa- 
tion they could give in regard to the condition of the native children 
under their care. They all unite in the opinion that the natives are 
METLAKAHTLA. 
During the voyage, William Duncan, the distinguished English mis- 
sionary, Was a passenger on the steamer. Thirty years ago he estab- 
lished a mission for the Indians near Port Simpson, in British Colum- 
bia. He found-them the slaves of superstition, practicing cannibalism 
and other disgusting rites of their ancestors. 
Under his teachings about twelve hundred of them have been con- 
verted to Christianity and have gathered around them, in their Arca- 
dian village of Metlakahtla, many of the comforts and appliances of 
civilization. The village was situated on a beantiful plateau near the 
seashore, and was in plain view of the steamer. One hundred dwell- 
ings, with gardens attached, two large school buildings, a public hall, 
several miils and stores, and a Gothic church, built of yellow cedar, 
equal in architectural design and finish to many ofthe churches of our 
own towns, attested their progress. Under his practical and sensible 
guidance they have been trained to habits of industry, and have be- 
come well-behaved and order-loving citizens. The children have had 
the advantages of schools and religious training. -On account of some 
political differences betiveen Mr. Duncan and the civil authorities of 
British Columbia, growing out of disputes respecting the_title to the 
lands upon which this village was built, and also with the Church au- 
thorities, these people have become alienated from the Columbian gov- 
ernment, and have removed to Alaska and placed themselves under the 
protection of the United States. 
The point selected for their present settlement is on Annette Island, 
near Port Chester, about 60 miles north of the southern boundary of 
Alaska, and has been named Metlakahtla, after their old home. Mr. 
Dunean had been to the United States in the interest of his people, 
and was on his return.. The steamer landed on Sunday afternoon, the 
7th of August, at this point. The day was perfect—a “ bridal of earth 
and sky.” 
Attended by some of the passengers, Mr, Duncan was met upon the 
beach by a few of his people, and was warmly welcomed. The meeting 
was exceedingly impressive and affeeting, Old men and women, girls 
and boys, gathered around this good man and expressed with tears 
their intense joy and gladness. Two United States flags, which had

been presented to him, were raised upon an improvised staff, and the . 
Indians and passengers assembled under their folds in the shade of the 
trees on the shelving shore. 
I quote the following description from the pen of a correspondent, 
who contributed a graphic account of this incident to the Portland Or- 
-egonian : 
It is impossible to imagine a more lovely place than the harbor where the steamer 
Jay at anchor. Semi-circular in shape, it opens out through a number of small islands 
to the sea on the westward. On the east and north, wild, rugged, mountains come 
down to the water’s edge, and on the south a low green shore, skirted by a gravel 
8 beach, winds in beautiful curv 
The place was entirely uninhabited, except by afew of the Metlakahtlans, who oc- 
cupied it as an advance guard of the colony. The remainder, about one thousand in 
number, will come as scon as the means of transportation are provided. The exer- 
cises were impromptu. Mr. Duncan addressed the people in their native tongue; told 
them of his trip to the United States, and mentioned how he had been received and 
how deep an interest had been excited in their behalf, and concluded by introducing 
Hon. N. H. R. Dawson, the United States Commissioner of Education, then upon an 
official tour of Al , Who, at his request, consented to maké an address, in order to 
allay the uneasiness of the Indians touching their new relations to the United States, 
His address was interpreted by Mr. Duncan for the benefit of those who did not un- 
derstand English. Mr. Dawson congratulated the Indians upon their advent to 
American soil. They were impressively told of the power of the great nation under 
whose protection they were about to place themselves, and assured that they would 
be protected in their rights of person and property and in the enjoyment of their 
homes, and that, although the general land laws of the United States were not in 
forcé in the Territory, they would be protected in the possession of any lands upon 
which they might settle, and that when these laws were extended over the country 
they would be allowed to hold their lands. In the meantime they would have the 
protection of the Government, and the same advantages of education which are en- 
joyed by the people of the Territory. Efforts had been made to impress them ‘with 
the idea that the American Government was unfriendly to their settlement, but this 
impression Mr. Dawson successfully removed. His address was received with evi- 
dences of great satisfaction by the Indians. When he concluded, the flags were un- 
furled to the breeze, the ship saluting them with her single gun. The Indians sang 
“Rock of Ages” in their own language. The Rev. Dr. Fraser, of California, com- 
niended the new settlement to the protection of Divine Providence in atouching prayer, 
after which all united in singing ‘‘ Coronation.” One of the chiefs or selectmen, Dan- 
iel Ne-ash-kum-ack-em, then briefly replied to Mr. Dawson’s address as follows: 
“T desire to say a few words to let you know what our hearts are saying. The God 
of heaven is looking at our doings here to-day. You have stretched out your hands 
tothe Indians. Your actis a Christian act. We have long been knocking at the door 
of another government for justice, but the door has been closed to us, You have 
isen up and opened your door to us, and bid us welcome to this beautiful island, 
upon which we have decided to build our home. What can our hearts say to this 
except that wo-are thankful and happy ? The work of the Christian is never lost. 
Your work will not be lost to you. It will live, and you will find it after many 
ays. Tho few of us who are here to-day have been made happy by your words, but 
how much more joy will they occasion when they reach all our people, numbering 
over a thousand. What shall we say more to thank you. We were told that no 
slaves lived under the flag of England. For a long time we relied upon this promise. 
We were content and happy, but we haye found that our trust was misplaced. The 
promises made to us have been broken, and that nation, in its treatment of us, has 
set aside and disregarded its own laws, and has dealt with us as if we were slaves, 
     
       
  
    
       
-P-A-G-E-36
  36 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
“We come to you for protection and safety. Our hearts, though often troubled, 
have not fainted. We have placed our trust in God, and He has helped us, We are 
now able to sleep in peace. Our confidence is restored. God has given us his strength 
to reach this place of security and freedom, and we are grateful to Him for His mercy 
and loving kindness. We again salute you from our hearts, and thank you in the 
name of all our people.” 
This speech was delivered, in the intonations of his musical language, 
with a grace and ease of manner that harmonized well with the pictur- 
esque forum in which he spoke. It was an eventful occasion in the his- 
tory of these people, and reminded me of the landing of the Pilgrims 
upon the inhospitable shores of New England, and was well calculated 
to rouse the highest feelings of devotion and enthusiasm. None who 
witnessed it, in the light of the serene heavens, and the beautiful land- 
scape of mountain, sea, and forest, will ever forget it. It was one of 
those rare instances of patriotism and self-sacrifice for conscience’ sake 
which are not often met with in the examples of history. 
A large bell which the Indians had brought with them was tolled, its 
peals re-echoing from the distant mountains across the silent waters, 
and the passengers joined the Indians in their first service of evening 
prayer and praise in the presence of a gorgeous sunset. It was a 
striking illustration of the confidence and faith of these simple people 
in the providence of that God in whom they had put their trust. 
The story of Metlakahtla teems with incidents of surprise and grat- 
ification. The abandonment of home and country by its entire popula- 
tion is well calculated to challenge the admiration and excite the sym- 
pathy of the country. So notable an event is not deemed unworthy of 
being called to your attention. 
Mr. Duncan has removed nearly all of these people to their new home, 
and is now engaged in the arduous labor of providing for their shelter 
and support. He writes that strong efforts were made to dissuade them 
from carrying out their purpose, but that they have remained firm and 
steadfast. In December over seven hundred had joined him, and others 
were to follow. In addition to the Indians who have accompanied him, 
several neighboring tribes have signified their intention to unite with 
him in this new settlement. 
A school has been established at Metlakahtla under the auspices of 
the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and itis to be hoped that this col- 
ony will receive the protection ‘id: fostering care of the Government 
and people of the United States. 
In making this voyage to Alaska, nearly ten thousand miles by land 
and water were travelled. Neither pen nor pencil can paint the won- 
derful scenery of this part of our continent, with its bays, inlets, and 
islands. It would be well for those who seek the delights of travel at 
least to acquaint themselves first with the wonderful beauties and feat- 
ures of this part of our continent, before seeking them in the Old World. 
Its calm and placid seas, its picturesque islands, its marvellous glaciers, 
its magnificent ranges of lofty mountains, are wonderful features of 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
THE COMMISSIONER'S STATEMENT. 37 
its beauty and grandeur. Its immense forests, the abundance of its 
minerals, its furs and its fisheries, all promise to make it one of the 
wealthiest portions of our ‘American empire. 
It may not be extravagant to predict that, in the years ‘that are to 
come, the exhaustless resources of this coast will furnish the material 
to rebuild the American shipping of the Pacific, and that these harbors 
will be the navy yards and havens for the commerce of half the world. 
PLAN OF EDUCATION. 
Upon my arrival at Sitka I found that the plan for the government 
of the schools, promulgated by your order of the 15th of June, had 
been adopted by the Board of Education, and that the Hon. A. P. Swine- 
ford, Governor of the Territory; Hon. Lafayette Dawson, Judge of the 
Federal Court for the district of Alaska, and Dr. Sheldon Jackson, 
General Agent of education for the Territory, who had been appointed 
members of the Board of Education, had promptly organized the same 
by electing Judge Dawson president and Dr. Sheldon Jackson secre- 
tary, and were proceeding to reorganize the schools. I met these gen- 
tlemen frequently zin consultation, and discussed with them fully the 
condition of educational affairs in the Territory, and found them in fall 
sympathy with the views and policy of the Department upon the sub- 
ject of education, and heartily approving the plan of rules and regula- 
tions for the government of the schools. 
They prescribed and adopted, with my approval, rules requiring 
the children between the ages of six and fourteen years, within two . 
miles of any Government school, to be sent by their parents or guar- 
dians to school at least two-thirds of the time during which the schools 
should be open. These regulations were deemed absolutely necessary 
to insure the advantages of education provided for the children of the 
Territory by the Government. The schools, so far as I was able to as- 
certain by examination and consultation with officials and citizens, are 
well conducted, and the teachers are.competent and prompt in the per- 
formance of their duties. 
During my visit I was furnished with a copy of the following resolu- 
tions of the Board of Education, attesting its approval of the interest 
and policy of the Department in the schools of the Territory : 
At a meeting of the Territorial Board of Education held at the office of Judge Daw- 
son, at 4 o’clock Pp. M., August 22, 1887, Governor Swineford introduced the following 
resolutions, which were unanimously adopted: 
Resolved, That the thanks of this Board, as well as of all other friends of education 
in Alaska, are due to the Hon. L. Q. C. Lamar, the Secretary of the Interior, for the 
kindly interest in the welfare of our rising generation manifested by him in sending 
hither the Hon. N. H. R. Dawson, the Commissioner of Education, to personally ex- 
amine into and report upon the educational needs of our Territory. 
Resolwed, That the thanks of this Board are likewise due and are hereby tendered to 
the Hon. N. H. R. Dawson, not only for the excellent plan devised by him for thé pro- 
motion of the cause of education in Alaska, but as well for the zeal manifested by him 
in personally investigating the condition of the schools already established, together 
with the necessity for others, to the end that he may be able to intelligently report  
-P-A-G-E-38
38 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
and recommend such further action by Congress as will fully supply the ‘educational 
needs of the whole Territory. 
We look upon his visit to us at this particular time as being fraught with promises 
of great good to the hundreds and thousands of children of school age in Alaska who 
are now being permitted to grow up in ignorance, and feel that we can not sufficiently 
thank him for the encouragement given, nor yet for the many valuable suggestions 
which haye enabled us to put his educational plans into practical and successful 
operation. 
Resolved, That the secretary be, and he is hereby, instructed to forward a certified 
_ copy of the foregoing resolutions to the President, the Secretary of the Interior, and 
Commissioner of Education, respectively. 
Iam satisfied that the adoption of this plan of education will add 
greatly to the efficiency of the administration of the schools in Alaska, 
and that it will be the beginning of a new era in its educational affairs. 
The education of the native inhabitants is a duty we owe them under 
the provisions of the treaty of acquisition with Russia. They stand 
upon the same footing in all their personal and civil rights with our 
own citizens, and upon the organization of a Territorial government 
will necessarily be admitted to all the rights of citizenship. 
In the mean time they should be prepared, by having the advantages 
of education extended to them, to enter upon the duties of their new re- 
lations, and to meet the requirements and discharge the duties of our 
civilization. 
PRESENT CONDITION OF ''tHE SCHOOLS. 
Dr. Sheldon Jackson has been in charge of the public schools since 
his appointment as General Agent in 1885, and has organized schools at 
twelve places. The following table, compiled from the monthly reports 
of these schools, as far as they have been received, shows their condi- 
tion for the year 1886-87:

  THE COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT. - 89 
I regret to state that the school at Bethel, which was founded by the 
Moravian Church, has met with a great many difficulties and disappoint- 
ments, while that at Saint Michael, which was founded by the Protest- 
ant Episcopal Board of Missions, has been equally unfortunate. I trust 
that the difficulties which have been encountered will be surmounted, 
and that these schools will yet become centres of civilization in these 
inhospitable parts of the Territory. 
The appropriation of $25,000 for the present year will barely main- 
tain the Government schools now in operation, including the building 
and repair of school-houses, and the purchase of supplies of stationery 
and fuel. In order to make this appropriation go as far as possible 
towards supporting the schools, it was found necessary to reduce the 
salaries of the teachers below the sum formerly paid them for their 
services. 
Teachers have been reappointed for the next fiseal year at the above 
places, except Bethel and Saint Michael, and the indications are that 
there will be an increased attendance. 
While at Sitka the Board recommended the erection of two new 
school buildings, one at Sitka and one at Juneau, at a cost of $2,000 
each, the completion of the school-house at Killisnoo, and of the school 
room at Fort Wrangell. To all of these recommendations I gave my : 
consent. 
From all the information I could gather, the school population of the 
whole Territory may be estimated at from 5,000 to 6,000. 
There are conflicting opinions in regard to the increase of the native 
population. I, of course, could form no opinion upon this subject my- 
self, and have had to rely upon the opinion of residents of the Terri- 
tory. The general opinion seems to prevail that this population is not 
on the decrease, but is likely to increase. It is estimated that the en- 
tire population of the Territory is about 35,000. 
Of this population about 25,000 are found in that section of the Ter- 
ritory westward from Kadiak, including the villages along the coast 
and islands, to the end of the Aleutian peninsula. These contain about 
4,000 Oreoles and Aleuts, who are civilized, and to a large extent edu- 
cated. They reside mainly on the islands and are generally members 
of the Greek chureh. 
In the southeastern section of the Territory the white population is 
estimated at 2,000, residing principally at Sitka, Juneau, Douglas Isl- 
and, Wrangell, Killisnoo, and some smaller points, while the natives 
number seven or eight thousand. 
WHAT PROVISION IS NECESSARY FOR SCHOOL-HOUSES. 
In order to provide for the present wants of the Territory, and also 
for the accommodation of children at other points where schools are 
not now organized, it will be necessary to build a number of school- 
houses. 
   
-P-A-G-E-40
40 - : EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
The Board of Education, after .a full consideration of the educational 
wants of the Territory, urgently recommend the immediate organiza- 
tion of schools, with the erection of proper school-houses, at the follow- 
ing points: Unalashka, Belkofsky, Morshevoi, Wood Island, Spruce 
Island, Haguck, Ayakhtalik, Cook’s Island, Yakatak, Hoonab, and 
Metlakahtla. 
This would require for the first year an outlay of $10,500 to build 
school houses, $9,000 for the salaries of teachers, besides $3,400 to pro- 
vide supplies for the support of the schools, aggregating $22,900. At 
these places the population under twenty-one years of age is estimated 
at 1,097, 
The Board of Education also recommend that schools ought to be es- 
tablished at the following places : 
Karluk, Katmai, Old Harbor, Orlova, Umnak, Skilakh, Sushetno, 
Atkha, Klukwan, Attoo, and Akhiok. 
The population under twenty-one years of age at these places is esti- 
mated at 836. In order to establish schools at these points it would 
require an expenditure for buildings of $11,000, for teachers’ salaries of 
$12,800, and for supplies $3,300, amounting to $27,100. 
In transmitting to,me the above recommendation the Board use the 
following language: 
‘For your guidance in preparing the estimates of appropriations for education in 
Alaska for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1889, the Territorial Board of Education 
have the honor to transmit to you, as a preliminary report, the following tables, and 
to recommend that you urge upon Congress the importance of making an appropria- 
tion sufficient to establish these new schools. 
Tables Nos. 1, 2, and 3 aggregate $77,100. New mining camps, like Douglas City, 
and Berner’s Bay, and fisheries, like Loring and Tongass Narrows, will also probably 
require schools soon, so that for one year an appropriation of $85,000 could be wisely 
used for education. After the necessary buildings are erected the annual expense 
need not be so great. 
The tables referred to in this communication are as follows:

at least $5,000 of the present appropriation should be used to build 
school houses at Juneau and Sitka, to complete the school-house at Kil- 
lisnoo, and to repair that at Wrangell. I deemed the erection and repair 
of the school buildings at these places absolutely necessary, after a per- 
sonal inspection of the buildings that had been in use. They did not 
afford suitable accommodations for the teachers and children. 
The cost of building is made expensive by the fact that all the lum- 
ber used for building purposes in the Territory has to be purchased at 
Tacoma or Portland. There are immense forests of spruce and hem- 
lock, which afford abundant timber of excellent quality, but the yoee 
States laws prohibit the manufacture of lumber for sale. 
APPLICATION OF SCHOOL FUND FOR PRESENT YEAR. 
The school fund for the present year will be applied towards the main- 
tenance of the schools now organized, and the completion and repair of 
school houses at the points mentioned, and for the purchase of supplies 
of stationery and fuel.
-P-A-G-E-42
  
    42 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
The members of the board desire to do all in their power to increase 
the efficiency of the schools, and to extend the benefits of education to 
all the children in the Territory. 
It will be remembered that the Government owns no school-houses at 
any of the points where schools are now established, except at Sitka, 
Juneau, Killisnoo, and Fort Wrangell. At all other points buildings 
have to be leased. I can see no good and sufficient reasons to postpone 
the establishment of schools at .all the points where they ean be sup- 
ported and have the attendance of a moderate number of children, If 
the natives are to be civilized, the earlier the proper means are adopted 
to educate them, the better for them and the better for the ‘country; 
they will the sooner become citizens and add to the wealth of the State 
by their intelligence. 
I feel great confidence that the ereation of a Territorial Board of Hd- 
ucation, with the rules provided for the government of the schools, will 
insure an honest and faithful administration of the educational affairs 
of the Territory, and a wise and judicious expenditure of the appropria- 
tions made for that purpose. The aid and assistance of a local board 
I deem absolutely necessary for the proper administration of the educa- 
tional affairs of that,distant and isolated district. The familiarity of 
its members with the condition and wants of the Territory must be of 
great advantage in the organization and management of its public 
schools. 
  FUTURE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT. 
It is coneeded that the perpetuity of our American institutions de- 
pends in great measure upon the intelligence of its citizens, and that 
this intelligence is due in no small degree to our system of common 
schools and public education. If it be true that the intelligence of the 
American citizen is so necessary to the security and enjoyment of his 
liberties, how much more important is it that the native races, who are 
now being endowed with all the rights of citizenship, shall be prepared 
by education to appreciate and enjoy their new privileges, and to under- 
stand their new obligations and political relations. Especially is this 
true of the people of Alaska, whom the Government has undertaken by 
its treaty stipulations to place upon an equal footing with its own citi- 
zens. Their education and elevation in the scale of civilization should 
become the settled policy of the Government, and should be pursued 
with earnestness and vigor. It is proposed by the plan for the local 
management of the schools, which has been put in operation, should 
the means be furnished, to establish common schools in every native 
tribe, and in every settlement having a sufficient number of children, 
which schools shall be open to all, without reference to race. They are 
to be taught to speak, read, and write English, the purpose .of the 
Government being to educate them in our customs, methods, and lan- 
guage. In addition to the public schools which are supported by the 
United States Government, seventeen schools are maintained by the

Greek Church on the Aleutian Islands and in the southernmost part of 
the Territory, at which the children are taught both the Russian and 
English languages. These schools haye an attendance of about four 
hundred children, and are supported by the Imperial Government, which 
appropriates annually the sum of $20,000 towards their maintenance. 
At Sitka the Presbyterian Missionary Board maintains an industrial 
training school, which is partially supported by the Government, and 
is in a flourishing condition. It has over one hundred inmates, who are 
taught the elementary branches of a common English education. The 
boys are also taught carpentry, while the girls are taught to sew, knit, 
and cook, and are trained in housekeeping. The school is under the 
management of Prof. William A. Kelley, and for its purposes is a most 
excellent institution. It is well managed and conducted, and deserves 
the fostering care of the Government. The children are well clothed, 
well fed, and well behaved, and are attentive to their studies, and great 
attention is given to their moral as well as their mental training. It 
has trained quite a number of boys as carpenters, who are now valuable 
citizens and a great acquisition to the community. 
The improvement of the educational condition of the inhabitants de- 
pends entirely upon the liberality of the Government, and unless larger 
means than the appropriations which have been heretofore made are 
obtained, no inprovement can be expected. Many of the natives speak 
English, and some are fairly educated in the elementary branches, and 
seem anxious to adopt the manners and customs of the white man. They 
make good mechanics, miners, sailors, and laborers, while a few are 
skilled artisans and carve beautifully in wood and metal. Some of the 
specimens of their handicraft in earving and jewelry are indeed sur- 
prising, when we consider the few opportunities that they have had to 
improve themselves in any of the arts. Unlike the Indians upon the 
continent, they are generally industrious and self-supporting, and are 
in no sense of the term the wards of thenation. They feel the necessity 
- of labor in order to supply themselves with the comforts of life-and to 
protect themselves against the inclemencies which prevail in these. 
Aretie regions. Many have abandoned the savage practices of their 
ancestors, and have been brought under the humane teachings and in- 
fluences of Christianity, and are members of the Greek, Roman Catholic, 
and Protestant communions. This is particularly the case with the 
Creoles and the Aleuts, who are to a large extent civilized and edu- 
cated. : 
My own observation in respect to the character of these people coin- 
cides with the opinion of the Hon. A. P. Swineford, expressed in the 
following paragraph from his report for October, 1885: 
  These people, it should be understood, are not Indians. Their appearance, habits, 
language, complexion, and even their anatomy mark them as a race wholly different 
and distinct from the Indian tribes inhabiting other portions of the United States. 
They are far superior intellectually, if not in physical development, to the Indians 
of the plains, are industrious, more or less skilful workers in woods and metals, and     
 
-P-A-G-E-44
44 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
that they are shrewd, sharp traders all who have had dealings with them will be will- 
ing to testify. They yield readily to civilizing influences, and can, with much less 
care than has been bestowed upon native tribes elsewhere, be educated up to the 
standard of good and intelligent citizenship. Just in proportion to their educational 
progress they should have the rights and privileges conferred and the duties and pen- 
alties of full citizenship imposed upon them. 
It will be observed that the Territorial Board of Education estimates 
the amount needed for the support and organization of schools in the 
Territory and the building of the necessary school-houses, at $77,000. 
I do not think this sum is extravagant or too large, if it be the purpose 
of Congress to provide schools for the whole population of the Territory, 
and to extend the advantages of education to all the children within 
its limits. In view of the fact, however, that all of these schools can- 
not conveniently be organized and provided with suitable buildings 
within one year, I think that an appropriation for the next fiscal year 
for education in Alaska should not be lessthan $50,000. This sum will 
support the present schools with some additions, and allow $20,000 to 
be used inthe erection of school-houses at places where they are abso- 
lutely necessary. If schools are to be maintained, buildings must be 
provided. For this reason I believe that the sum of $50,000 can be 
wisely and judiciously used for the purposes mentioned, and I therefore 
recommend it, and I hope that an appropriation of that amount will be 
recommended by you in your estimates. 
I remained in the Territory until the end of August, and during my 
visit was the recipient of many kindnesses and courtesies at the hands 
of citizens and officials. To the governor, the judge of the district 
court, the general agent of education, the collector of the port, the mar- 
shal, and clerk, I am specially indebted for many attentions, and also 
to Commander J. S.. Newell, of the United States steamer Pinta ; Lieut. 
James A. Turner, U.S. Navy; the late district attorney, Hon. M. D. 
Ball; Mr. Maurice EH. Kenealy, editor of the Alaskan; Hon. James 
Sheakley, U. 8. Commissioner at Fort Wrangell; and Mr. George Kosi- 
rometinoff, United States interpreter, all of whom gave me every op- 
portunity and facility to prosecute the objects of my visit. 
I have also to acknowledge the great kindness of the Rev. Mr. Austin, 
and of Prof. W. A. Kelley, of the Presbyterian Mission School, at 
Sitka, and of their excellent staff of teachers. 
REMOVAL OF THE OFFICE. 
The sundry civil appropriation bill, approved March 3, 1887, enacted 
that as soon as practicable after the completion of the Pension Build- 
ing, and not later than December 1, 1888, the Secretary of the Interior 
should cause to be removed to that building the General Land Office, 
the Bureau of Education, the office of the Commissioner of Railroads, 
and the Bureau of Labor, and vacate the buildings now occupied by said 
Offices and Bureaus. 
I would respectfully protest against the removal of this office, as  
-P-A-G-E-45
Oe IE RE ERT TE OTN Cia mE Qe Rae Le en eh Tee en a ee ts ne ene. ee 
THE COMMISSIONER'S STATEMENT. 45 
contemplated, and urge you to use your influence to have the order of 
Congress, so far as it relates to the removal of this Bureau, revoked, 
and suitable provision made in the appropriation bills for the retention 
of it in its present quarters. 
The duties performed by the employés of the Bureau of Hducation, 
though nominally clerical, generally differ from those performed by 
clerks in most Offices. The principal duty of this Bureau is the col- 
lection, preparation, tabulation, and publication of statistical infor- 
mation in the form of reports, and such other methods as shall seem 
best fitted for the benefit of the public schools and the improve- 
ment of the means of education. In other words, much of its work 
is original, and requires careful study, analysis, and investigation. 
In its investigation this Bureau deals largely with questions of a sta- 
tistical and historical character, and needs for the full performance of 
its work the use of books and apparatus to which no parallel can be 
found in the ordinary service of most Government Bureaus. ‘These in- 
vestigations require the comparison of authorities, the compilation of 
reading matter, calculation and construction of statistical tables, and 
the general investigation of educational causes, conditions, and results. 
To perform this labor successfully its employés need not only good 
light, good air, comfortable temperature, and properly constructed seats 
and desks, but also an ample collection of books close at hand and ready 
for reference, a museum of articles relating to the construction of edu- 
tional buildings, the furniture of school rooms, and the apparatus of 
instruction, space around each employé for the proper use of books and 
articles from the library and museum, and freedom from the disturb- 
ance and noise which inevitably exist when large numbers of employés 
are congregated, no matter how orderly their behavior. It is quite pos- 
sible in ordinary offices to organize clerks into divisions of one or two 
hundred, with subdivisions of correspondingly large size. It is utterly 
impossible to do thisin such an office as the Bureau of Education with- 
out sacrificing both the unity and the accuracy of results. 
In consequence of the character of its work, this Bureau has aceu- 
mulated a very valuable library of 20,000 volumes, 60,000 pamphlets, 
and many thousand duplicates, and a museum of approximately twenty 
thousand articles. These books and articles have been collected from 
all countries. The books are in many languages, and on all subjects 
relating to education. The space assigned to them in the present 
building is inadequate to their perfect use, but is so apportioned that 
the most useful and necessary parts of these collections are accessible 
and are effectually protected from the intrusion of unauthorized per- 
sons. The isolation of the Office and its property, as at present or- 
ganized, I deem essential to the usefulness of the one and the safety of 
the other. : 
The removal of these collections is no mere matter of transfer from 
one building to another, but will require time, care, and money.
-P-A-G-E-46
  2 
46 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
The loss of time in making such a removal will be great; the loss of 
convenience almost entire; and the labor and money required for this 
purpose will be considerable, 
The foregoing’ observations are not presented as my theory of the 
matter, or from any personal objection to removing to the Pension 
Building, but are the result of the past experience of the Bureau in a 
somewhat similar position. 
Bleven years ago Congres’. caused the Bureau of Education to be 
moved from the present building to a joint occupancy with the Pension 
Office of the building on the corner of Twelfth Street and Pennsylvania 
Avenue. The Pension Office then, as now, was the first occupant of the 
building, and the quarters assigned to this Bureau were so inadequate 
in extent, inconvenient of access, and unsuited for its work, that prac- 
tically no efficient work was done by this Office during the year that the 
joint tenancy continued. The growth of the Pension Office forced the 
Bureau out of its unwelcome quarters, and Congress removed it back 
to the present building, the two changes in location costing somewhat 
more than the present rent of this building for one year. 
The Twelfth Street building, like the present Pension Building, con- 
sisted of large rooms on each floor, suitable, perhaps, for the large 
divisions and sections of the Pension Office, but absolutely destructive 
to the repose, the quiet, and the seclusion found essential to the proper 
performance of the duty of the Bureau of Education. The plan of the 
present Pension Building, the great number of employés already in 
that office, and the very large number proposed to be added by the 
transfer of other offices, will repeat, and doubtless aggravate, the his- 
tory of that change. 
Another view of the relations of this Bureau to its work would not 
occur to the ordinary thinker. It was established chiefly for the pur- 
pose of supplying the teachers and people of the United States with in- 
formation as to the methods most useful for the promotion of public 
and other education. The performance of this duty has made it proper 
to open the library and museum of the Office to persons interested in 
education, and such persons, under present circumstances, subject to 
proper regulations, have made frequent and valuable use of them. 
If the Bureau and its collections are to be moved toa building where 
the necessities of another kind of service will render access to the 
library and museum difficult or uncertain, the use of them by persons 
not connected with the Bureau would necessarily be greatly disturbed 
or prevented, 
In this connection I would invite your attention to the wise and lib- 
eral action of Congress a few years ago, when a specially constructed 
building for the Medical Library and Medical Museum was authorized. 
By this measure the great working tools of that magnificent Bureau 
were put into a condition for most effective use, both by that Office and 
by those for whom that Office chiefly labors. The reasons that justified
-P-A-G-E-47
THE COMMISSIONER’S STATEMENT, AT 
the constraction of that building are equally cogent for the permanent 
and suitable lodgment of the Bureau of Education separate from other 
Offices of dissimilar size and purpose. 
The Wright Building, now occupied by the Bureau, is situated very 
near the office of the Secretary of the Interior, and close to lines of cars 
by which persons desiring to visit it for consultation and study may have 
easy access; and yet the location is one sufficiently quiet and retired to 
allow the work of the Office to be done in comfort and with considerable 
efficiency. Though too’ small for the needs of the Bureau, it can be made 
to serve for some time longer by a judicious use of the present space. 
It contains about 11,000 square feet and has a basement and four 
other stories. ‘ 
Briefly described, the basement is for the storage of fuel and the 
documents of the Office; the first story is used by the Statistical Divis- 
ion, the second floor by the Commissioner, chief clerk, and Recofd 
Division, and the third floor by the library and the clerks employed in 
connection therewith; while the upper floor is devoted to the museum. 
It will be seen that the constructive divisions of the building corre- 
spond to the administrative divisions of the Office, while the six rooms 
on each floor permit that subdivision and seclusion which the nature of 
its work requires. In case of the removal of the Bureau to the Pension 
Building, there is no possibility of securing even an equal floor space ; 
a reduction of this would be ‘disastrous to the Bureau in every con- 
eeivable way. 
If any change is made at all, the one dictated by a regard for the 
purpose and usefulness of the Bureau, would be to provide it with a 
building specially adapted for the safe and proper storage and use and 
display of its valuable collections and the efficient service of its em- 
ployés, and until such a change can be made, it would seem wise, eco- 
nomical, and expedient to retain it in its present quarters. 
DELAY IN THE PUBLICATION OF THE REPORT. 
It has been my endeavor to expedite the publication of the Annual 
Report. I am informed that, as a general rule, of late years it has not 
been received from the Public Printer until about a year and nine months 
after the close of the period to which it relates. After so long a delay 
much of the statistical and other information which it contains is stale, 
and the value of the whole Report is seriously impaired. 
Many causes conspire to produce this delay. The Bureau is in im- 
mediate correspondence with every known educational institution in the 
United States, sending its forms of inquiry at the end of each year to 
State superintendents of public instruction, superintendents of city 
schools, presidents and principals of academies, normal schools, kin- 
dergartens, professional, agricultural, and scientific colleges, colleges 
and universities, and to managers of libraries and museums, and re- 
ceiving from them reports covering every phase and feature of the in- 
   
-P-A-G-E-48

terests under their charge. This, however, can not be done until after 
: the close of the school year in June, when the work of preparing the Re- 
: port commences. The statistical tables are made up mainly from the 
voluntary replies received after this date from these corresponuents. 
Some of them, notably the State superintendents of public instruction, 
are themselves subjected to delay in receiving and collating the reports 
of their subordinates, so that their returns are frequently not received 
until many months after the close of the school year. The importance 
of early returns to this Office has been urged upon these gentlemen, and 
it gives me pleasure to say that they have responded promptly to my 
appeals as far as lay in their power. In some instances, however, they 
have not been able to give the desired information until seven or eight 
mouths after the close of the school year. 
The work of digesting, tabulating, and summarizing the statistical 
returns, when once under the control of this Office, with accuracy and 
expedition, has been the object of constant solicitude. The employés 
of the Office constitute a force of experts, trained to handle the material 
thus collected. From their constant and intelligent study of the sub- 
ject, and the accumulated experience of the past, they have learned ~ 
what.information is of most value to the educational world, how best 
to present their inquiries, and the breadth and scope to give them. 
: As a result of the efforts made in this direction, the preparation of 
the manuscript of the Annual Report for the Printer has been advanced 
some six months during the last two years. This Report is now sent to 
the Printer in ten months after the close of the school year. It is not prob- 
able, for the reasons assigned above, that much further improvement can 
be made in this respect. It is greatly to be desired that the printing 
and binding of the Report should be conducted with greater dispatch. 
The Office is now furnished with 20,000 copies of its Annual Report 
for distribution among its correspondents. When it is remembered 
that this Report is sent to all of the State, county, city, and town super- 
intendents, to colleges and universities, secondary schools, public libra- 
ries, and a large number of teachers and others interested in education 
in the United States, and also to foreign Governments and institutions 
of learning, it will readily appear that this number is entirely too small 
to supply the demand. ‘There are nearly three hundred thousand 
teachers in the schools of the United States. If only ten per cent. of 
these were supplied with a copy of this Report, thirty thousand copies 
would be necessary. 
On account of this limited supply a great many most worthy appli- 
cations have to be declined. The Reports of other Bureaus, certainly 
not more valuable to the people than those of the Office of Education, 
are given a large and liberal circulation. The claims and wants of the 
educational classes of the country would seem to deserve the same gen- 
erous recognition and consideration at the hands of Congress.   
  
1The manuscript of this Report was sent to the Printer May 16, 1888.

ConcLUSION. 
In bringing this Report to a close, I beg to express my obligation 
to the large number of correspondents who have voluntarily furnished 
the greater portion of the material for its preparation. Without fee 
and without reward many thousand educationists promptly and cheer- 
fully responded to all the inquiries and demands that have been made 
upon them. Without their valuable assistance and co-operation the 
Annual Reports of this Office could not be prepared. 
I would also acknowledge my indebtedness to the employés and cler- 
ical corps of the Office, who have zealously, intelligently, and cheerfally 
performed the labors and duties of their respective positions. To the 
chief clerk and the chiefs of divisions I am under renewed obligations 
for their hearty aid and respectful kindness and consideration, while to 
you I must return my thanks for the interest which you have always 
taken in the work of the Office and for the uniform courtesy shown me 
personally and officially. 
I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Completeness of the statistical returns.—The progress and present condition of common 
school education in the United States is set forth in the following tables with as much 
accuracy and completeness as the material that came to hand up to the time of going to 
press permitted. Returns for the current scholastic year, of more or less completeness, 
were received from forty-one States and Territories, including Georgia and Louisiana, 
whose statistics for the calendar year 1886 are republished. This equals the number 
reporting the previous year. It isa matter affording considerable satisfaction that such 
is the case, since of the twenty-four States and Territories that have adopted the bien- 
nial report system few or none issue a report for the present year. 
The Bureau is greatly indebted to many State superintendents for the special efforts 
they have made to forward their returns in season for publication, and in several eases       
for their courtesy in iurnishing advance sheets of their printed reports. It is only 
through their voluntary co-operation in the interest of edueation that the exhibits which 
appear in the following pages have heen made possible. 
Seven States and ‘Territories failed to send returns for 1886-87, as follows: New 
Jersey, Delaware, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Wyoming, Utah, and New Mexico. The re- 
turns of the preceding year are given in every case, however, except in that of New 
Mexico, from which no full efucational statistics have been received later than those 
of the United States census of 1880. 
The State superintendency of Delaware haying been abolished, application for the 
statistics of the current year was made to the county superintendents; two of the three 
county superintendents (those for New Castle and Kent Counties) responded; as their 
returns did not give a complete view of the State, however, it was deemed best to pub- 
lish the figures for 1884-85 as taken from the printed State report. 
The statistics of Wyoming and Washington Territories were taken from the reports 
of their respective Governors to the Seeretary of the Interior, and are very imperfect, 
especially those of the former Territory. 
SYSTEM PURSUED, 
The practice of working up in this Bureau the material of the returns made to it has 
been extensively pursued, as will appear from the following tables. ‘The idea has been to 
give, not only the materials for information, but the information itself, Such computa- 
tions as are most needed, and as are of general utility, have been made, so that those who 
have use for the results may find them ready to hand. Not the least advantage of this 
work is, that it is uniformly done for all the States, the imperfections.and limitations of 
the data, when known, being taken into consideration, and the best results obtained of 
which the character of the material admits. : 
Arrangement.—The arrangement of the tables has undergone some alteration, chiefly 
with the object of facilitating reference and rendering more easy the comparison of dif- 
ferent States and geographical sections with each other as regards their educational con- 
dition. 
51 
   
-P-A-G-E-52
52 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 2 
Totals.—No totals are given for the United States or for any geographical.section, ex- 
cept in case of those items which are reported from every State or are estimated. The 
common practice of using incomplete totals as if they were complete, has been a fruitful 
source of erroneous deductions. Too much emphasis cannot be laid upon the point that 
only homogeneous numbers, such as only complete totals are, are comparable with each 
other. In order to fill up the most important columns, if returns were lacking in only a 
few instances, recourse was had to estimates, if there was any good basis therefor, or to 
the returns for the preceding year. In such cases it may be seen that the percentage of 
error in the totals is only a small fraction of what it was in the number so supplied. 
‘This course has been pursued on the assumption that it is better to have an approximate 
knowledge of a subject than to be entirely destitute of information regarding it. 
MULTIPLICITY OF RATIOS, 
The idea may occur to a person examining the tables for general purposes, without hav- 
ing his attention directed to any particular subject, that there are an unnecessary num- 
ber of ratios, etc., enough, it may be, to perplex or even confuse him. But it must be 
borne in mind that each student or investigator who has recourse to the tables for any 
specific purpose, follows his own line of argument and requires data adapted to his own 
particular needs, according to the aspect under which he is viewing educational problems. 
LIMITATIONS OF STATISTICS. 
In the discussions of the tables the Bureau has formulated only the most obvious of 
the many conclusions of which the data admit. The points that can be satisfactorily 
elucidated by these statistics, however, are few, compared with the host of questions that 
are pressing for a solution, or upon which more light is desired. Even within their legit- 
imate sphere the usefulness of the tables is greatly restricted by their incompleteness— 
to mention no other defect—by the array of blanks which is met with in nearly every 
column. But above and beyond this, the fact remains that but few of the circumstances 
or conditions that affect the educational life of a State can be subjected to quantitative 
measurement. The tables give the number of teachers in a State, but how can their 
educational force be measured as compared with as many teachers in another State,—their 
power of developing latent faculties,of moulding character, or of imparting information? 
‘We may know that in one State there has been half as much again expended for educa- 
tion for.each child as in another, but where are we to find the figures which will tell 
which State profited most from its expenditure, in which it has been made judiciously 
under competent direction, and in which it has been marked by extravagance, jobbery, 
ora vain desire for outward show to the sacrifice of more essential matters? Regard should 
be had for these and like considerations in the use of statistics; the information they fur- 
nish should be compared with and supplemented by that derived from non-statistical 
sources, in order to get the clearest light practicable upon any subject. 
URBAN AND RURAL SCHOOL SYSTEMS. 
A comparison of the schools of a State which contains a dense city population with 
those of a sparsely settled agricultural State, is manifestly unjust to the latter; hence the 
desirability of making separate exhibits of the rural schools of the different States has 
forcibly impressed itself upon the attention of this Office. In order to effect this, the 
city statistics must be eliminated from the State returns, an operation which can be 
properly effected only when the city returns have all been made; these latter, however, 
have heretofore been incomplete, a considerable percentage of cities failing to make any 
report to this Office. 
MISUSE OF THE TABLES—SOURCES OF ERROR. 
Improper use of the tables.—There are frequently brought to the notice of the Bureau 
instances where false deductions have been made through improper use of the statistical 
tables. Nearly all these errors arise from considering as comparable with each other 
quantities which in point of fact are not so; which do not cover the same extent of ter- 
ritory or are for different years, or are not homogeneous in some other respect, as an in- 
spection of the foot-notes or an examination of other columns of the table would gen- 
erally have made apparent. For instance, in determining the amount of money ex- 
pended in any State for each pupil enrolled, care must be taken that the enrolment and 
expenditure are each reported for the whole State and for the same year, and also that 
they are free from any other limitations that would impair the accuracy of the result. 
The number of ‘children of school age’’ in one State can not be compared with that 
of another, except in those few cases where the school age is the’same in the States con- 
cerned. This might appear to be a self-evident proposition, were it not for the fact that 
the expenditure per capita of ‘‘school children,’’ the percentage of ‘‘school popula- 
tion’? enrolled, and such like quantities are continually used as the measures of the 
educational status of the different States, even in journals of the highest class. If the
-P-A-G-E-53

  capacity of a bushel were different in each State; if in some, for instance, it were twice 
  what it was in others, a comparison, without-any notice of this circumstance, of the 
number of bushels of wheat raised in the different States would furnish results just as 
truthful as the comparisons involving “population of school age,”’ the school age being 
arbitrarily determined by the Legislature of each State. 
Defects of the tables—The above remarks apply to the misuse of the statistical tables 
and the erroneous deductions resulting therefrom. There are other sources of error, 
however, inherent in the tables themselves, which the most skilful manipulator of sta- 
tistics cannot avoid, being, in fact, unaware of their existence. These sources of error 
are of various kinds; but it is the desire of the Bureau again to call attention to that 
particular one which is the cause of the greatest confusion and misconception, i. e., the 
want of uniformity in common school statistics. 
This want of uniformity has been fully recognized in the addresses and discussions of » 
educationists during the past decade and a half. The necessity for a common language 
of statistics has been frequently pointed out; but there has been no general movement 
in the direction of uniformity, notwithstanding the reports and recommendations that 
have been made. Steps in advance have been taken here and there, but the matter, as 
a whole, is in nearly the same unsatisfactory condition as ever. Each State has its own 
understanding as to the meaning of the terms used, its own rules and methods of com- 
putation, so that its statistical language is unintelligible when placed in juxtaposition 
with that of other States. 
Classification of school revenue.—The classification of school revenue affords perhaps the 
most notable instance of diversity. There is a certain source, viz, the income of the 
United States surplus revenue of 1837, which is essentially of the same character in all 
the States that possess it. Yet it is classified in some States as income from permanent 
funds, in others as income from State taxes, and in one at least as income from local 
taxes, varying according to the system of book-keeping that may have been adopted. 
Again, in the case of taxes levied under a State law the revenue from which is 
retained and distributed in the localities where it was collected, there is a want of uni- 
formity; such taxes are classed sometimes as State taxes, and sometimes as local taxes, 
Also, special taxes on the property and capital stock of corporations, and miscellaneous 
taxes and licenses, are sometimes classed as local taxes, and sometimes as revenue ‘‘ from 
other sources.”? Taking it altogether, the table of school revenue affords but poor facili- 
ties for ascertaining the relative amount of income from the different sources in the 
several States. 
Average wages of teachers.—There are two methods in use for ascertaining this quantity; 
the first gives‘the simple mean of the several rates of pay; in the second, each rate is 
given a weight proportioned to the number of months it was in operation, the average 
being found by dividing the total amount paid to teachers by the total number of 
months taught. Where the school term is of unequal length in different parts of a 
State and the salaries vary widely, it makes a great difference which method is used. 
Either one may be resorted to, provided it is uniformly followéd by all the States, with 
@ proper understanding of the result it gives. If the average salary is wanted, the first 
method would seem to be the proper one to use, since a salary is not a sum "received, 
but is a rate of pay, and is independent of the time it is in operation. If the average 
amount actually received by each teacher during the year is wanted, the second method 
would be the one to use. 
Reliable vs. wnreliable statistics.—The above are only some of the more palpable diffi- 
culties that lie in the way of the adoption of a universal language of statistics. It is 
the more to be regretted that they exist, since, after a uniform system was once adopted, 
the making of reports, returns, and computations, at least in regard to certain impor- 
tant points, would be as easy as is now the case. A teacher need not be called upon to 
“lay down his life in a struggle simply to perfect his statistics;’’ he, as well as school 
officers, can attain to statistics of wide application with as little labor as they now do 
to those of limited range; to statistics that will not only answer the question, ‘“‘Are we 
of this State advancing or receding?’’ but also that other question, ‘‘ How do we stand 
as compared with our neighbors in other States ?”’

Mode of computing population. —The necessity of having some statistics of population, 
and the methods of computing those given in this Report, are set forth somewhat in de- 
tail in the Bureau’s Report for 1885-86 (pp. 22 and 23). It was erroneously stated in 
that Report, however, that a committee of the National Council of Education had recom- 
mended the age six to fourteen as the school census age. The original recommendation 
of their report was in accordance with that statement; but after considerable discussion 
in the council, the committee withdrew this recommendation and substituted four to   
  
-P-A-G-E-54
        
      
      64): HDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
twenty-one as the school census age. The age of each individual enumerated was to be 
noted, however, so that the number of children between any two limits of age could be 
ascertained. 
Predominance of child population.—An examination of the last column of Table 1 re- 
veals the circumstance that the proportion of children to be educated in a community 
varies greatly in different parts ofthe country. In the North Atlantic Division, for in- 
stance, there are only 17 children of the age given to every 100 perucns, while in the 
South Atlantic Division there are 21, and in the South Central Division 22. A compu- 
tation of the number of children 6 to 14 years of age to every 100 adults would show 
a still greater disparity. This excess of children whose education is to be provided for 
forms one of the peculiar disadvantages under which the South labors, and must be 
taken into account in forming an idea of the educational situation in that section. 
Density of population.—The density of population is another important factor affecting 
education. In sparsely settled agricultural States, where the schools are of necessity 
small and far between, the conditions‘are, and must remain, unfavorable to the devel- 
opment of a highly organized system, carried on at great expense for teachers and edu- 
cational appliances, and holding sessions of nine or ten months in the year, as is the 
-ease with densely peopled States having a large urban population. It is on this account 
that Column 5 of Table 1, giving the population per square mile of each of the States 
and Territories, has been introduced. 
It is a notable circumstance that while the density of population in the North Central . 
States is less than one-third of that in the North Atlantic States (it being twenty-seven 
and ninety-seven in the two sections respectively), the people of the former group have 
nearly equalled, and in some cases surpassed, those of the latter in the development of 
their public schools. The fact that this is so forms a high encomium upon the enter- 
prise and intelligence of the people of the North Central States. 
The desirability of having separate exhibits of urban and rural school systems, in ad- 
dition to the complete State exhibit, is referred to elsewhere in this Report.

[Table 2, Page 57.] 
The primary object of a school census, in nearly every case where one is taken, is to 
secure a basis for the apportionment of the State school revenue. Asageneral rule, the 
persons of the age for free attendance at the public schools are the ones enumerated; in 
a few instances, however, as in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Michigan, Oregon, and 
California, the scope of the school census is determined, not by the age of those entitled 
to free school privileges, but by special age limits which govern the distribution of the 
school revenues. Hence, as regards the school population of the different States as given 
by the school censuses, there is a want of homogeneity, not only in respect to the years 
included, but as regards the essential natures of these quantities, some of them being 
merely ages for the distribution of funds, others ages for free attendance. 
This circumstance has been mentioned in order to illustrate further the non-compar- 
ability of the “State school populations;’’ this point can not be too strongly emphasized; 
it may be said, without exaggeration, that the treating of these quantities as homo- 
geneous has been the most fruitful source of the abnormal and contradictory statements 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
ee 
56. EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
. that have been made of late years, in the public press and in legislative debates, regard- 
ing educational conditions. 
Age for free attendance.—The age for free school privileges, as will be seen by the table, 
is very different for the different States. In an attempt at classification of these ages, it 
can not be found that they follow any very well defined law under the different aspects 
under which they may be viewed. In most cases they were presumably determined by 
local or temporary causes, and were not based upon any general consideration, else there 
would not be seen the diversity that actually exists in the case of contiguous and similarly | 
circumstanced States. 
The number of different school ages for free attendance is fifteen; of these, the age six 
to twenty-one has been selected by fourteen States; five to twenty-one comes next, adopted 
by ten States; and six to eighteen by seven States. Of the remaining ages, no one has 
been adopted by more than two States. 
As regards duration, the Southern Central States have the shortest average period, ex- 
tending over 13} years; then follow (excluding in the compatation those States whose 
age limits are undefined) the South Atlantic States, 14} years; the Western States, 14 7°) 
years; the North Atlantic States, 14} years; and lastly the North Central States, 153 
years. 
- It will be seen that the differences in the duration of the free school age in the differ- 
ent sections of the country are so small as to be practically without significance. 
In 1 State (Massachusetts) there is no inferior limit of the free-school age. In 4 States 
it begins at 4 years of age, in 15 at5 years, in 23 at 6 years, in3 at’7 years, and in 1 (Texas) 
at 8 years. As regards the superior limit of free attendance, in 2 States (Connecticut 
and Texas) it stops at 16 years, in 8 at 18 years (including the District of Columbia, 
where the free-school age is6 to 17 inclusive), in 6 States at 20 years, in 28 at 21 years, 
and in 3 States (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Michigan) the free-school age extends 
indefinitely upwards. 
In the preceding paragraphs the word ‘‘States’’ is to be considered as including also 
the Territories. 
Compulsory school age.—Seventeen States, seven Territories (including Alaska), and the 
District of Columbia have a compulsory attendance law; twenty-one States and two 
Territories have none. The compulsory school age of New Mexico has not been re- 
ported to this Office, though it is known that a law establishing one was recently en- 
acted. 
The compulsory school age, unlike the free school age, has one well-defined character- 
" istic, which the geographical classification adopted in the tables clearly exhibits. It is 
entirely wanting (except in the District of Columbia, which stands in a peculiar relation 
to the rest of the country) in the two southern divisions. Every North Atlantic State 
has compulsory attendance, except Pennsylvania, and the same is true of every North 
Central State, except Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri. 
In many instances, however, the compulsory attendance law, if not actually a dead 
letter, is practically so, as will be exhibited in another portion of this Report. 
The duration of the period of compulsory attendance ranges from 4 years (in Dakota) 
to 9 years (in Wyoming). Six years of age is the lowest inferior limit and 10 the highest 
(the latter also in Dakota). The superior limit ranges from 14 to 16 years of age, in no 
case going beyond the latter. 
Inerease of school-census population.—Although the school-census populations may not 
be compared with each other, nor aggregated, on account of their heterogeneity, the per- 
* centage of increase of these populations may, if we assume that the population between 
any two limits of age in any State increases in the same ratio as that between any other 
two limits (i. ¢., that the proportion of the population of any given age remains constant 
in each State), an assumption that may be made as regards the increase of a few years 
within very narrow limits of error. It is on this assumption that the percentage of in- 
= crease or decrease of school-census population has been aggregated by geographical di- 
visions in Column 8 of Table 2. 
The largest percentage of increase is found, as might be expected, in the Western 
Division, which contains the newer States and Territories that are being opened up for 
settlement, and where a small absolute increase sometimes causes a large relative one. 
Taking the five States and Territories of that division that furnish the necessary data, 
the average increase per cent. of the school-census population is found to be 5.68, which 
would cause it to double in about twelve and a half years. 
The next largest rate of growth of school-census population is found in the South; the 
percentage of increase in the South Atlantic Division (based on two States only) is 3.21,   eee ee pe Se tS ete 
)From information received at this O1Gce since the tables were compiled, it appears that the law - does not define the age at which chilcren may be compelled to attend school in New Mexico, thereby rendering it applicable to the wiole “school population ”—i. ¢., those from 5 to 20 years.
-P-A-G-E-57
STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. 57 
while in the South Central (based on five States) it is 4.21; these rates of increase would 
cause a doubling in the two divisions in twenty-two and in seventeen years respectively. 
Of the individual States of these two last named sections, Alabama shows an increase 
of 7.2 per cent., equivalent to a doubling of her school population (and also of her total 
population, upon the assumption referred to above) in about ten years. This growth, if 
correctly: reported, is a truly phenomenal one, and emphasizes the plea for more funds for 
the schools of Alabama, made by Superintendent Palmer of that State in his last report. 
The average increase of the school-census population for all the States and Territories 
affording data to be used in the computation (27 in number) is 2.61 per cent., which 
would cause it to double in twenty-seven years. States and Territories from all parts of 
the country and under all conditions of growth are represented in this average, and it 
may be considered as expressing with a tolerable degree of correctness the actual present 
rate of growth of the United States in population.

  ENROEMENT. 
[Table 3, Page 59.] a 
The total public school enrolment of the United States, as made up from the latest 
ae received and supplemented by estimates in two cases (Arkansas and Montana), is 
,805,660, 
Growth of enrolment.—The yearly increase for the United States can not be accurately 
determined, as ten States and Territories do not furnish the necessary data. Assuming, 
however, that the States and Territories so lacking have made the same progress as the 
others in the same divisions, the yearly increase would, be 305,772, or at the rate of 2.66 
per cent. per annum. ‘The increase over the amount reported for 1885-86 is greater 
than this, a circumstance which results from the fact that the returns of some of the 
States are two or more years later than those given in the preceding Report. 
In only five States (New Hampshire, Vermont, South Carolina, Ohio, and Nevada) 
and one Territory (Arizona) has the enrolment decreased. The largest relative decrease, 
5.37 per cent., is found in New Hampshire. Dakota furnishes the largest per cent. of 
increase, 11.70, followed by Indiana with 9.20. This large development of the school 
registration of Indiana is a notable circumstance, when compared with the nearly sta- 
_ tionary condition of that of the contiguous States, Ohio and Illinois. 
The enrolment of Mississippi is considerably less than that reported for last year, as 
is also the average daily attendance. State Superintendent Preston writes to the Office 
that there has probably been no actual decrease, but that the attendance has heretofore 
been fraudulently exaggerated in the reports of certain teachers who were paid aecord- 
ing to the number of pupils they taught. The law has been changed so that this method 
of determining teachers’ wages is no longer practised. 
Considering the different geographical divisions, all show a satisfactory growth in en- 
rolment, unless it may be the North Atlantic Division, where the rate of increase (.71 per
-P-A-G-E-59
STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. : 59 
cent.) is less than one-half the rate of increase of school population (1.62 per cent.); this 
last. quantity, however, is computed from such defective data that entire reliance can 
not be placed upon it. 
Proportion of children enrolled.—In the proportion of children enrolled in the public 
schools, the North Central States are far in the lead, having 121 pupils in the public 
schools for every one hundred children six to fourteen years of age. That this result 
should be a matter of congratulation, considering the relatively low density of popula- 
tion of these States, has been already noted. 
Notwithstanding the tremendous strides that have been taken in the development of 
the school systems of the Southern States during the last ten years, as exhibited in 
Table17, they are still far behind the Northern States in regard to proportion of children 
enrolled in the public schools. In the South Atlantic States only 89, and in the South 
Central States only 79 children out of every 100, 6 to 14 years of age, are enrolled as 
pupils in the public schools. This results in a great degree from the excéssive propor- 
tion of children to grown persons met with in the Southern States; for if we com- 
pare the proportion of total population enrolled, the disparity which appears to the pre- 
judice of the Southern States almost disappears, and in one case is quite reversed, 7. ¢., 
the proportion of total population enrolled is actually greater in the two Southern 
divisions (being 19.06 and 17.49 in the cases referred to) than it is in the Western 
Division (16.86). 
No account is taken here of the duration of attendance at school, but only of the cir- 
cumstance that the pupils were on the school registers. If the element of time is taken 
into consideration, the South appears much more at disadvantage. 
The great advantage which the Northern States possess is the much larger number 
of tax-payers in proportion to the number of children to be educated. Even if the rela- 
tive wealth of the North and South were equal, which is far from being the case, each 
tax-payer of the former section would have a far less burden to bear in the work of get- 
ting all the ‘‘schoolable’’ children within the schools.

AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. 
[Table4, Page 62.] 
According to the most recent returns, the number of pupils daily attending all the 
public schools of the United States while they are in session is, on an average, 7,571,416, 
Asin the case of enrolment, it is not possible to determine the exact yearly increase, 
but a very fair approximation places it at 218,500, or at the, yearly rate of 2.89 per cent. 
The greatest increase in average attendance is observable in the South; in both of the 
Southern divisions it is not only remarkably large, but it is to be noted that it exceeds 
the increase of enrolment; in other words, not only more pupils are going to school 
there, but also the attendance of those who do go is more regular. This is an evidence 
of increased appreciation of public schools not to be overlooked. | 
Florida shows the greatest growth of average attendance, viz, 13.94 per cent.; in the 
District of Columbia, Virginia, and Georgia the growth is also exceedingly noteworthy. 
Indiana stands in the same relation to the States on her east and west borders as in 
- the case of enrolment. 
The average attendance has decreased in six States, so far as reported, viz, New 
Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and South Carolina. The 
greatest decrease, 3.64 per cent., took place in New Hampshire,

STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. 61 : 
Regularity of attendance.—The rate of increase of average attendance for the United 
States (2.89 per cent.) exceeds slightly the rate of increase of enrolment (2.66 per cent.) 
as estimated; this indicates a greater regularity of attendance for the country at large. 
Column 7 of Table 4 gives this regularity of attendance explicitly. The average for 
the United States is 64.13; that is, for every one hundred pupils enrolled during tho 
school year, sixty-four have attended daily, on an average, during the sessions of the 
schools; or, looking at the matter in another light, each pupil enrolled was present, on 
an average, sixty-four days out of every one hundred his school was in session. 
Regularity of attendance is greatest in the Western Division (66.51), and least in the 
South Atlantic Division (62.79), but it is nearly uniform in the different sections of the i 
country, more so, perhaps, than any other single item which admits of statistical rec- 
ord. When the individual States are considered, a greater inequality is observed; in 
Maine and Arizona the regularity of attendance is 82.79 and 84.26, respectively, while ‘ 
in Minnesota it drops to 49.17; it is possible, however, as in other instances, that this 
inequality may be due in some measure to inaccuracy or incompleteness in the school « 
reports, or to a lack of uniformity in the methods used. 
‘This regularity of attendance is far from being as high as is tobe desired. Compul- 
sory attendance laws do not seem to affect it to any appreciable extent, as it is some- 
what higher in the South Central States, where there are no compulsory laws, than in 
the North Central States. It will probably depend for improvement upon a growing 
appreciation of the benefits of a public school education. 
Such as it is at present, however, it is far in advance of any former period, and the 
progress it has made in the last semi-decade is especially noteworthy. This virtually 
uninterrupted growth in the regularity of school attendance will become very apparent _ 
from an inspection of the following tabular statement: . 
Ratio of average daily attendance to enrolment at various periods since 1871-72; computed

The tendency suggested by the above figures is unmistakable; they show conclusively 
the steady growth of a sentiment in favor of popular education—a growth not confined to 
any one part of the country, but extending throughout its length and breadth. 
‘This remark will be seen to possess greater force when it is considered that there has 
been an increase in the proportion of children enrolled as pupils, as well as an increase 
in the proportion of the number enrolled who attend regularly (see Table 3). 
Average number of pupils to a teacher.—This (as given in Column 8) may be said to be 
a measure of the sufficiency of the teaching force. It is only given for those States that 
report the number of teachers’ places; and as that highly important item is reported 
from only a few States, the column is mostly blank. 
As far as it is possible to ascertain, the number of pupils to a teacher is very nearly 
uniform in the different sections of the country, ranging from 23.59 in the Western Di- 
vision (founded on two States only) to 28.06 in the North Atlantic Division (founded 
on three States). ‘The figures for the individual States, however, show great inequali- 
ties, enough so to throw some suspicion on the accuracy or uniformity of the returns,

STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. 63 
ToraL ATTENDANCE; DURATION oF SCHOOLS. 
[Table 5, Page 61.] 
The total number of days attended is reported by but thirteen States. This quantity 
is so important for statistical purposes, however, and withal so simple and easy to obtain, 
that it has been deemed best to retain it in the tables, in the hope that it will come to 
be more generally reported. 
It should be obtained by aggregating, or summing up, all the days attended in all the 
schools as shown by the school registers, and by no other method. 
Comparative amount of schooling given.—Column 3 shows how many days’ attendance 
each child 6 to 14 years of age would have been able to obtain if the actual attendance 
had been divided up among such children equally. This quantity possesses greater sig- 
nificance, as a measure of the amount of schooling given in a community, than perhaps 
any other single one that can be deduced from the data supplied to the Bureau. ‘The re- 
sults are comparative merely; any other minor age might have been selected, with the 
result of giving another series of numbers of virtually the same relative values. 
It will be seen from this table that, so far as reported, the greatest relative amount of 
schooling was given in Massachusetts—enough, in fact, to provide each child six to four- 
teen years of age, with 194.79 days, or 9.74 months of twenty days each. From this 
the numbers range down to 39,51 days, given in Alabama, about one-fifth of that given 
in Massachusetts. 
The summary of Column 3 by geographical divisions exhibits vividly the disparity in 
the amount of ‘schooling given in the different sections of the country. ‘The statistics 
given in Tables 3 and 4 related only to the number of pupils going to school, without 
regard to the length of time they went; the inequality under those circumstances was 
considerable, but still within bounds. It is when the element of time is introduced, 
and the whole school population brought into consideration, that the disparity between 
the sections is brought into strong relief. 
Actual average amount of schooling given to each pupil enrolled.—Column 4 furnishes an 
entirely different set of numbers. Only the pupils on the school registers are taken into 
account, and the number of days each one on an average attended is shown. This quan- 
tity is of inferior significance to that contained in Column 3 or that in Column 5; but as 
it may be found useful to know in certain inquiries, it has been computed and tabulated 
here. 
Average duration of attendance.—This quantity, given in Column 5, gives the'average 
length of session of the schools in days, when to each school is given a weight propor- 
tioned to its average daily attendance. This is manifestly the proper basis upon which 
to compute the average number of days the schools were in session during the year. A 
school with ten times the average attendance of another school should count for ten x 
times as much. 
The ‘‘average duration of schools in days,’’ tabulated in Column6, is presumed to give 
the simple mean of the number of days of session of the different schools, regarding all 
the schools as equal units. This quantity is of no practical use, or would be of none, if - 
the material existed for computing Column 5. It is less than that contained in Column 
5, since the larger city schools with their greater number of days of session are not given 
their proper weight. ‘ 
In the case of some States the numbers tabulated in Columns 5 and 6 are equal. This 
shows that in these States the average duration of schools in days (Column ¢) has been de- 
rived from the average daily attendance or total attendance (Column 2), or vice versa, while 
in other States these quantities have been computed independently of each other. 
This want of uniformity should be noted for the purpose of guarding against it. The 
quantities contained in Columns 2 and 6 are independent of each other, and eachshould be 
derived as previously stated. 
The average duration of attendance, then, it may be repeated, is the average number > 
of days the schools were in session, giving to each school a weight proportioned to its 
size (or number of pupils), and is found by dividing the total number of days’ attend- 
ance by the average daily attendance. 
The greatest duration of attendance, 189.62 days, is found in the North Atlantic Di- 
vision, the least 94.23 days, in the South Central Division, so far as can be ascertained. 
Increase in the duration of schools.—Of the States which furnish data for tabulating 
the change in the duration of schools, 18 show an increase, 8 a decrease, and 3 no change 
from the previous year. This indicates a decided balancein favor of more days of school- 
ing ina year, but no estimate has been made of the extent of this change. Whatever it 
may be, however, taken into consideration with the increased regularity of attendance 
previously set forth, it shows a condition of affairs full of promise as regards the num- 
ber of days’ schooling given to each pupil. 
It is hoped in the next Report of this Office to give more definite information regard- 
ing the increase over previous years in the duration of schools. 1

NuMBER oF SCHOOL BUILDINGS; SEATING CAPACITY. 
[Table 6.] 
School accommodations.—Column 2 of Table 6 gives the number of school buildings in | 
each State, so far as reported. In some cases where reports were lacking the number of 
schools is given instead. 
A knowledge of the number of school-houses is useful for some purposes; on account 
‘of their great difference in size, however, something else is needed to determine the 
question of sufficiency of school accommodations. This is effected by a consideration of 
the number of sittings taken in connection with the number of pupils for whom seats 
are to be provided. : 
The number of sittings is reported only from ten States and Territories. It is hoped 
that this number will be increased in future years. 
As regards the sufficiency of the seating capacity, it should be observed that the num- 
ber of seats may fall short of the enrolment, and yet be large enough, since all the 
scholars enrolled during the year are seldom present at one time. On the other hand, 
it should be greater than the average daily attendance, since the number actually at- 
tending must sometimes exceed the average. The number it should just equal, in order 
to show a sufficiency without a surplus, is the maximum attendance, a statistical 
quantity almost unknown in the United States, though used with effect in some foreign 
systems. 
Whenever the number of sittings, then, exceeds the enrolment, there is, ipso facto, 
a sufiiciency of school accommodation. This is the case with all the States reporting, 
except {thode Island and the District of Columbia, as will be seen from an inspection of 
Column 6. Yet in these two cases the number of sittings exceeds the average attend- 
ance, so that a deficiency can not be argued; the data simply are not sufficient to deter- 
mine whether or not the sittings are sufficiently numerous. 
Column 8 gives the average number of sittings to a building, or the average size of 
school buildings.

School libraries,—The educational value of school libraries is beginning to be more 
fully appreciated by superintendents and teachers. No statistics upon this point in any 
degree approaching completeness, however, have ever been collected. Those given in 
Columns 2 and 3 of Table 7 present what information of a quantitative character touch- 
ing this subject it has been possible to collect. « 
It appears that Ohio and Michigan are the States in which, so far as known, school 
libraries have received their greatest development, the former having 191 volumes and 
the latter 154 volumes for every one hundred pupils in average attendance. In the 
Southern States no public school libraries of any consequence are reported. 
It is not possible, from want of data, to make summaries of the statistics of school 
libraries that would be of any use whatever. 
High schools.—High school statistics in like manner are, and apparently must remain, 
inan unsatisfactory ( condition. There is no well-defined line outside of cities, as a gen- 
eral rule, separating high schools from other schools. In the rural districts schools, and 
even the studies of individual pupils, are of a mixed primary and secondary character. 
The high school statistics that are given, therefore, can lay no claim to accuracy or com- 
pleteness in most cases, but are presented as being the best that could be collected from 
State superintendents, and as furnishing valuable indications of a general character.
-P-A-G-E-67
  STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. — 67 
The statistics of individual high schools are given in detail in another chapter of this 
Report (see Index). 
By far the greatest public high school enrolment is found in the North among the 
older States. In the North Atlantic Division, out of every 1,000 pupils enrolled 64 are 
high school pupils. Maine leads in this point, 77 pupils out of every 1,000 enrolled in 
that State being high school pupils (Column 9). 
With the exception of the District of Columbia, and an estimate by the State super- 
intendent of Mississippi, no high school statistics are reported from the two Southern 
divisions. It is known, however, that in these divisions the great bulk of secondary 
instruction is or was given in private high schools and academies. In Georgia, at least, 
there is a constitutional provision forbidding any except the elementary branches being 
taught in the public schools at the charge of the public funds. 
In the North Central States 28 pupils out of every 1,000, and in the Western States 
17, are high school pupils. The average for all the States reporting is 35.

PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
[Table 8, Page 69.] 
The statistics of private schools, notwithstanding the importance that attaches to them, 
are of the most fragmentary character. One phase of educational activity, a definite 
knowledge of which is absolutely necessary to a full understanding of the subject, is 
thus left almost wholly unrecorded. Furthermore, the statistics that are given bear in 
some cases internal evidences of unreliability. 
The obligations which should be imposed upon private school teachers, in the matter 
of reporting the statistics of their schools, have become a subject of discussion. In 
Connecticut legislative action has been taken which should result in a complete system 
of private school reports. Superintendent Orr, of Georgia, has urged the right of the 
State to require private school reports, and has defined the basis upon which this right 
rests. (See Index, under head of ‘‘ Private schools.’’) 
Growth of private schools.—It would be useful to compare the percentage of increase 
or decrease of the private school enrolment as given in Column 6 with that of the 
public school enrolment, to see if the public schools are more than holding their own. 
‘The abnormal results that are recorded for some of the States, however, in the column 
mentioned, would seem to indicate that either this year’s or last year’s report, as the 
case may be, was extremely defective. 
‘The three North Atlantic States reporting apparently furnish the most reliable statistics 
of growth; enough so, perhaps, to enable a fair estimate to be made of the present pros- 
pects of private schools in that section. It will be found that while Vermont shows a 
decrease of .36 per cent. in public school enrolment, and Connecticut and New York an 
increase of only .20 and .98, respectively, the private school enrolment has increased 3.57 
per cent. in Vermont, 5.13 in Connecticut, and 4.12 in New York. Those figures may. 
be considered as establishing conclusively the fact that the private schools are gaining 
on the public schools in the States mentioned, and the presumption that they are-so do- 
ing in the neighboring States.

Extent of private school cnvotment.—Column 7 gives the proportion of pupils who are en- 
rolled in the private schools. It shows that, so far as can be determined, private schools 
have received their greatest development in the North Atlantic Division, where 11.17 
per cent. of all pupils are enrolled in private schools; that is, out of every 100 pupils 
enrolled in schools of all kinds, 11 are enrolled in private schools. 
Tlinois and California also show a large private school enrolment; Dakota a phenom- 
enally small, perhaps imperfectly reported one. For all the States reporting 8.56 per 
cent. of their total enrolment is to be found in private schools, leaving 91.44 per cent. 
for the public schools. 
Comparative enrolment to be found in all schools. —Coluimn 6 of Table 3 gave the average 
number of pupils enrolled in the public schools for each 100 persons 6 to 14 years of age, 
    Column 8 of the table under review gives the same, taking in also the pupils enrolled / ° 
in the private schools ; thatis to say, it shows how many pupils are enrolled in all schools, 
public and private, for each 100 persons of the age mentioned. Table 3 gave only a 
partial view, i. e., it was confined to the public schools. Table 8 gives a complete view, 
but unfortunately it is limited to a few States.

‘TEACHERS. 
[Table 9, Page 72.] 
Table 9 gives (1) the whole number of different teachers, classified by sex, and (2) the 
number necessary to supply the schools, or number of teachers’ positions. This latter 
quantity does not admit of classification by sex, since any teacher’s position may be oc- 
cupied at onetime by a man and at another time by a woman. 
The number of teachers necessary to supply the schools, though réported from only 
eomparatively few States, is the more important item of the two. It is the quantity 
which should be used, as a general rule, when the ‘‘number of teachers’’ is wanted; 
that is to say, though a number of different teachers may in succession occupy the same 
position in the course of a school year, they only count as one teacher for most statistical 
purposes. 
The ‘‘whole number of different teachers’’ is wanted principally for determining ques- 
tions of sex in teachers, and of frequency of change in the teaching force. It is, however, 
almost universally used, or rather misused, when the ‘‘number of teachers’’ is wanted for 
any purpose whatever, thereby vitiating the arguments or conclusions based upon it. 
Still it furnishes the enly knowledge we have regarding the number of teachers in the 
majority of States and Territories. 
‘ Attention is called to this point for the purpose of emphasizing the great need that 
exists of having reported the number of teachers necessary to supply the schools. 
The whole number of different teachers in the United States, according to the latest 
returns, is 338,637, an increase of 15,571 over the number last reported. This increase, 
however, possesses no particular significance, since it may arise from an increased num- 
ber of changes in the existing teaching force instead of the establishment of new teach- 
ers’ positions. What knowledge the Bureau has regarding the actual sufficiency of the 
teaching foree is given in Column 8 of Table 4. 
Sex of teacher's.—A comparison of the increase of the whole number of male teachers 
with that of female teachers should show to what extent one sex has displaced the other 
during the year. As far as can be determined the number of male teachers in the United 
Statesincreased at the rate of 2.63 per cent., female at the rate of 2.61 per cent., shéw- 
ing practically no change in the relative numbers of the two sexes for the country at 
large. 
In the North Atlantic Division the male teachers would seem to be gaining in num- 
bers, due to the heavy decrease of female teachers (20.90 per cent.) in New Hampshire,
-P-A-G-E-71
STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. 
In the next three divisions the female teachers have increased in greater proportion than 
the males. The large decrease of teachers in Mississippi is probably one of the results 
of the re-organization of the school districts of that State, securing fewer and larger 
schools. In the Western Division, again, the male teachers have gained in proportion- 
ate numbers. : 
The present relative number of teachers of each sex is given in Column 13, The 
different sections of the country present well-marked distinctions in this matter. In 
the North Atlantic States only 23 teachers out of every 100 are male; then come the 
North Central and Western Divisions, in which about one-third of all of the teachers 
are male; in the two Southern divisions the males are in the majority, in the South 
Central Division largely so. 
Massachusetts has the smallest proportion of male teachers of any State or Territory, 
or about one in ten. . In Arizona and Arkansas the proportion of male teachersis largest, 
being in each instance more than three-fourths of the whole. 
_ Though no considerable change in the relative number of teachers of each sex has 
taken place during the year covered by this Report, yet when the last 16 years are 
taken into account a decided displacement of male teachers is apparent, extending through 
every section of the country, except in one instance. This displacement will be seen 
from the following tabular statement: 
Percentage of mate teachers at intervals of five years since 1876-77, computed from the Re- 
ports of the Bureau of Education. 
  
The | North | South | South | North United | Atlantic | Atlantic | Central | Central

3. 60, 25 44.28 a4, 65 
5 67.46 38.14 
52.25, 62.23 32. 64 
  
It will be observed that in the North Atlantic Division, where the relative number of 
male teachers was smallest in 1876-77, the displacement of males has been going on 
nearly as extensively as in any other section. Whether this process can continue with- 
out detriment to the best interests of the schools, especially as regards the education of 
the older boys, is a question worthy of serious consideration. 
Changes in the teaching force.—Column 12 is designed to show the average number of 
changes in the teaching force to every 100 teachers’ positions during the school year. 
This will be seen to vary exceedingly in the several States reporting the necessary data, 
so much so as to suggest a greater or less degree of inaccuracy in the reports made. 
The averages for the North Atlantic, North Central, and Western Divisions, however, are 
tolerably uniform, being 25.41, 28.60, and 27.15, respectively. The want of permanency 
in the teachers’ position is one of the greatest drawbacks to the progress of the public 
schools to a higher degree of efficiency. Just to what extent this want of permanency 
exists can be determined in no better way than the one given, and it would be a matter 
affording peculiar satisfaction if the data required for the puxpose were more accurate 
and complete.

    74 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. : 
SALARIES OF TEACHERS, 
[Table 10.] © 
The average monthly salaries of male teachers have increased in 15 States and Terri- 
tories, and decreased in 17, out of the 32 in which this change can be determined satis- 
factorily. As regards the salaries of female teachers, there has been an increase in 17 
States and Territories, a decrease in 13, and no change in 2. £ 
The greatest difference between the salaries of male and female teachers is met with 
in the North Atlantic and North Central Divisions; the least, in the South Atlantic 
Division. 
The want of uniformity in the methods of computing the average wages of teachers 
has already been pointed out in previous Reports of the Office; so long as it continues to 
exist, no reliable comparisons of the wages of teachers in different States can be made. 
There is oné method that is wnqualifiedly incorrect, namely, taking the mean between 
the maximum and minimum salaries of a county or township as the average salary. 
The average salary of ‘all the male or female teachers of a State possesses no great 
degree of significance. The classification should be more in detail, distinguishing city 
from country teachers, and white from colored, in order to be useful as a guide in de- 
termining the remuneration of teachers.

ScHooL REVENUE. 
‘ [Tables 11, 12, and 12A, Pages 76, 78, and 79.] 
A consideration of school revenue is chiefly valuable for comparing the relative amounts 
derived from different sources in the several States. 
The value of the results arrived at, however, is considerably vitiated through a want 
of uniformity in the classification of ‘school revenue. As an instance of this, it may be 
said that certain revenues of essentially the same character in all the States are classed 
in some States as income from permanent funds, in others as income from State taxes, 
and in others still as ineome from local taxes. Also, taxes imposed by a State law, but 
retained and distributed in the communities where they were collected, are sometimes 
reported as State taxes and sometimes as local taxes. These taxes may be called com- 
pulsory local taxes, as they differ both from voluntary local taxes and from taxes paid 
into the State treasury. and distributed therefrom on some general basis of population or ° 
attendance, which latter are State taxes proper. A more detailed classification would 
remedy the misunderstanding in this matter, were there any possibility of its being 
adopted. 
State aid to education.—There may be noted a growing sentiment in favor of having 
more of the school revenues collected and apportioned by the State authorities according 
to population or attendance (see Index under the head of ‘‘Revenue’’). The design is 
to equalize the school funds, so that all parts of a State may have a school term of equal 
length, or nearer equal than at present. 
Ten States and Territories, all situated in the North and West, report no State tax 
-yhatever (Table 11, Column 3). In the North Central Division only 9.8 per cent. of all 
the school revenue (Table 12 A, Column 3) is raised by State taxes, hardly sufficient to 
give anything like equal school privileges to all the children in the States composing 
that division.

  80 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
ScHooL EXPENDITURES. 
[Tables 13, 14, and 14 A, Pages 81, 83, and 84.] ‘ 
The tota] amount expended forcommon schools in the United States during the school 
year 1886-87, or according to the latest reports, was $115, 103,886, an increase of $3,798,959 
over the amount last reported by this Office. 
This amounted to an average expenditure of $1.99 per capita of total population, 
$10.27 per capita of population 6 to 14 years of age, and $15.40 per capita of aver- 
age attendance. The schools were kept open a mean length of 135 days (Table 5, 
Column 6), so that each dollar expended furnished about 9 days’ schooling on an aver- 
age. 
The Northern and Western Divisions expended from three to five times as much 
per capita of population 6 to 14 as did the two Southern divisions. When the pro- 
portion of actual wealth expended is considered, however, the disparity nearly or quite _ 
disappears; though the statistics on this point are incomplete and unreliable, yet they 
show satisfactorily in a general way that the South is expending about as much rela- 
tively of its available means for education as the North. The average expenditure for 
all the States reporting the necessary data was 5.61 mills per dollar of assessed valua- 
tion. 
By far the greatest expenditure per capita of average attendance (setting aside Alaska 
with its expenditure of $59.72 per capita of average attendance) is met with in the 
Western Division where it averages $25.12. t 
The amount reported as expended for salaries of superintendents and teachers is 
$79,531,925, indicating a yearly increase of $2,641,722, or at the rate of 3.44 per cent. 
per annum. This exceeds the rate of increase of either the school population or average 
attendance, as will be seen by reference to Table 16. 
Of the total amount expended for schools, 14.42 per cent. was expended for sites, 
buildings, furniture, libraries, and apparatus; 69.10 per cent. for the salaries of super- 
intendents and teachers; and 16.48 per cent. for all other purposes. (Table 14 A.) 
It will be observed that the older North Atlantic States are expending proportionably 
quite as much of their school moneys for sites, buildings, etc., as the newer North Cen- 
tral States, and considerably more tan the Western States. The least relative expendi- 
ture of this permanent character is met with in the Southern States, as might be expected 
rom the low density of population and mild winter climate.

PERMANENT ScHooL FuNpD, ToTaL ASSESSED VALUATION, AND VALUE OF SCHOOL 
PROPERTY. 
[Table 15, Page 86.] 
Permane::t school funds.—Twenty-one States report permanent school funds yielding an 
annual revenue, nine of which are in the North Central Division. A number of other 
States are known to have some permanent funds not reported in the table. In some 
f cases what was originally a permanent school fund has been so invested or disposed of 
. that it is a mere matter of book-keeping whether it continues to appear as such or not, 
the practice varying in different States in that respect. 
Texas has the largest permanent school fund, both presentand prospective; on account 
of the defective returns from that State, however, it is impossible to say what proportion 
of her total school revenue, or what revenue per capita, is derived from it. Illinois has 
the next largest permanent fund, nearly twelve million dollars, though only 6.1 per cent. 
of her whole school revenue is derived from it (Table 12 A, Column 2). Alabama de- 
rives a larger proportion of her school revenue from permanent funds than any other 
State, depending on that source for nearly one-fourth of the whole, though the amount 
of the fund itself is not reported. 
Total property valuation.—On account of the difference in the rates of assessment in the 
different States, conjoined to other circumstances, the statistics of total property valua-
-P-A-G-E-85

tion are of a very uncertain character, and, as was stated in the last Report of this Office, 
can only be used as a general guide. They were introduced to meet the necessity that 
exists of providing some way of determining what proportion of their actual means the 
people of different localities are paying out for education. It may be that it would be 
preferable to compare the school expenditure with the expenditure forall purposes, State 
and local, as has been suggested by Superintendent Bettison, of New Orleans, were there 
not difficulties in the way of determining the latter quantity satisfactorily. 
School property.—The value of school property has increased at a much greater rate, in 
every section of the country, than either the school population orattendance. (See also 
Table 16.) The average yearly increase in the value of school property for all the States 
reporting was 6.22 per cent., while that of school population was only 2.61 per cent. 
and that of average attendance 2.89 per cent. In the State of Missouri alone the in- 
crease in the value of school property was close upon two million dollars. 
The present value of school property, as related to population, attendance, ete., is given in Columns 12 to 15 inclusive.

STATISTICS OF STATE SYSTEMS. 
TEN YEARS GROWTH OF THE PuBLic ScHooL SysTEM. 
e [Table 17, Page 91.] 
The general lines of development of the public schools of the different parts of the 
United States for the last ten years are indicated in Table 17. In thistable it is clearly 
demonstrated that the growth of the public school system, taking into account the aver- 
age for the United States, has not only kept pace with the growth of population, but 
has outstripped it. 
While the population of the United States 6 to 14 years of age has increased 29 per 
cent. during the last decade, the enrolment in the public schools has increased 31.1 
per cent., showing that there is an increase of 1.6 per cent. in the proportion of children 
6 to 14 enrolled. 
EDUCATION IN THE SOUTH. 
  This increase in the proportion of school children enrolled is due entirely to the growth 
of the public schools of the two southern divisions, which are the only ones in which 
the public school enrolment has increased at a greater rate than the population 6 to 
14. In the South Central Division, especially, the growth in school enrolment, as com- 
pared with the increase of school population, has probably never been paralleled in 
a country so long settled; the school enrolment has, in fact, in the division referred 
to, nearly doubled during the decade, while the population 6 to 14 has only increased 
by about one-third. 
From the relative increase of population 6 to 14 and enrolment, it may be deduced 
that the proportion of school population enrolled as pupils has increased 25.3 per cent. 
in the South Atlantic Division, and 34.1 per cent. in the South Central Division. In 
the three northern and western divisions there has been a decrease, amounting to 9.3, 
1.7, and 8 per cent., respectively. 
The actual proportion of children enrolled in the public schools (Table 3, Column 6) is 
still at the present time less in the South than in the North. If the extension of the 
public school system in the South, however, should continue at the marvellous and un- 
precedented rate it has exhibited during the past decade, the two sections would be placed 
nearly on an equal footing in this respect (though notin regard to length of school term). 
Whether such will prove to be the case will probably depend on the growth of the South 
in material prosperity. It has already been shown that, as near as can be ascertained, 
the people of that section are paying nearly as largely of their means for education as 
those of the North (Table 14, Columns5and9). Any further considerable development 
of their public school system will probably depend, therefore, on their increased ability 
to bear the expense, i. eh on the increase of their property per capita of population. 
EXPENDITURE. 
The increase of expenditure has in every saobrauhiond division grown at a greater. 
rate than the increase of population 6 to 14; that is to say, the expenditure for schools 
per capita of population 6 to 14 has increased in all the different groups of States 
in which it has been summarized. This increase in per capita expenditure is least in 
the Western Division (2.2 per cent.), greatest in the South Central Division (20.9 per 
cent.), and averages 9.4 per cent. for the United States. 
On account of the inordinate increase of enrolmentin the South, however, theincrease 
in expenditure has not been able to keep pace with it ; so that the expenditure per capita 
of enrolment shows a small decrease in the two southern divisions. Thisisa result that 
might haye been anticipated from a school enrolment growing to such a degree that it 
has begun to tax to the utmost the ability of the people to provide for it. 
The status of education in the South, it may be remarked, can not be properly con- 
sidered without a reference to the fact that the funds for educating both the whites and 
colored people are, and must continue to be, supplied in the main by the whites. Further 
reference is made to this point in another chapter. 
In the three northern and western divisions the expenditure per capita of enrolment 
has largely increased, allowing longer school terms, and higher wages for teachers. 
The following tabular summary has been computed from Table 17, and presents a more 
complete view of some of the data made use of in the preceding remarks:

EDUCATION IN THE NORTH AND WEST. 
It may be noted here that the proportion of children 6 to 14 years of age enrolled in 
the public schools has decreased only in those divisions in which compulsory attendance 
Jaws are generally in force, and in each one of these there has been a decrease. 
Tt is possible that this decrease has been offset, or more than offset, by an increase in 
private school enrolment. On this point no satisfactory knowledge can be obtained on 
account of the general absence of private school statistics. 
Whether, however, the private schools have absorbed the children who might have 
swelled the public school enrolment, or whether such children are out of school alto- 
gether, the fact remains that the public schools of the three divisions referred to seem to 
have been on the wane during the past decade, and that they do not gather in as large 
a proportion of the school population as they did ten years ago, although more money 
- is expended uponthem.! ‘This is a matter of the highest gravity,.and requires serious 
consideration. Has the public school system reached and passed.its maximum phase in 
the North and West? Is universal ‘education by the State an abstraction not to be real- 
ized in the concrete ?. 
The disclosures made by the tables which are given in this connection impart new 
significance to the remark made by Superintendent Le Roy D. Brown at a recent meet- 
ing of the Department of Superin tendence of the National Educational Association: 
“‘Strange it would be if a growth, at once so rapid and luxuriant, should be altogether 
sound and enduring !”?   
1As to the causes at work to produco the falling off in the proportion of children enrolled in Con- 
necticut, see page 114.

DIGESTS OF STATE SCHOOL REPORTS. 
ALABAMA. 
[from Report of State Superintendent Solomon Palmer, 1886-87.] 
The schools of Alabama during the past year have been in as prosperous a condition 
as the meagre school revenues permitted. ‘‘The pressing want of our school system,’ 
says Superintendent Palmer, ‘‘is more money, that the public schools may continue a 
longer period each year, and that our teachers may be paid better salaries. Notwith- 
standing the fact that the system is sorely crippled in its operations for the want of ade- 
quate funds to meet the constantly growing demands upon it, there is no doubt of its 
increasing popularity and usefulness. The advantages to be derived from a good school 
system are more keenly felt by the great body of the people of the State to-day than 
ever before in its history.”     
CHANGE IN THE PLAN OF THE REPORT. 
The statistical tables and summaries of the report include only the country schools. 
Special reports are given from the cities and separate school districts. These reports, 
however, are not upon any uniform plan, so that it is not possible to get exact totals for 
the State except upon one or two points. Alabama is thus placed upon a different plane 
from the other States as regards her educational statistics, and is not comparable with 
them. There is no question as to the desirability, for certain purposes, of separating the 
statistics of the country from those of the city schools in all the States; without so do- 
ing, States with a large urban population can not be justly compared in many respects 
with the more sparsely settled States. But it is necessary'to have in addition a general 
summary for the whole State. 
COMPARATIVE STATISTICS.

The marked decrease in these figures, as before explained, is on account of the omission 
of the cities and separate school districts; were they included there would be but little 
change since last report. *

SCHOOL CENSUS—REDUCTION OF THE PER CAPITA. 
  The school census of August, 1887, shows for the whole State a total increase of chil- 
dren of school age (7-21) in two years of 32,614. Speaking of the effect of this increase 
upon the apportionment of the school revenues, Superintendent Palmer says that “‘ the 
reduction in the per capita of the colored is larger than that of the whites on account 
of the liberal appropriations made by the last Legislature out of the fund for that race 
for the university for the colored people and for normal schools. It should be borne in 
mind that this reduction in the per capita occurs notwithstanding the additional appro- 
priation of $20,000 to the school fund made by the last Legislature. But for this ap- 
propriation the per capita would have been reduced some 4 cents lower than it was. 
‘These figures must impress every thoughtful person who desires the prosperity of the 
State and values the intellectual and moral culture of the young with the fact that, to 
make our public school system what it ought and must be, 
MORE MONEY IS NEEDED. 
_ _ “Tn point of material resources and natural advantages Alabama is surpassed by no 
State in the Union. Capital as never before is seeking investment within her borders. 
The demand of the times is a public school system with adequate funds to place the 
blessings of at least an elementary education within the reach of every child in the 
State. Possessed of such a system, noState inthe Union would have so bright a future 
as Alabama. But, if in our haste to grow rich, we neglect our public school system, 
and the intellectual and moral training of our youth, these natural advantages and 
boundless resources may prove a snare and a curse by enticing to our State a mass of 
ignorant immigrants who care not for education, who regard not our long-cherished in- 
stitutions, and who are enemies to a higher and more ennobling civilization. But if 
we foster our public school system and make it the pride of our citizens, as many of 
our sister States have done, we will be blessed with a thrifty, enterprising class of im- 
migrants, who appreciate and who have been accustomed to free public schools for their 
children, and who will invest their money among us and heartily co-operate with us in 
developing our State and in perpetuating our free institutions. To such a class of im- 
migrants, a public school system that pays no more than $1 per child, including poll 
tax; that pays teachers on an average only $21.87 per month; that runs its free public 
schools only 70} days in the year, and that does not pretend to provide any school 
buildings, is not very inviting.” 
After introducing statistics to show how much more Michigan, Arkansas, and Ten- 
nessee are paying for public schools than Alabama, the superintendent continues: 
“With the foregoing figures before us it is not so surprising that in 1880 the census 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
96 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
shows that Alabama, out of a population of 1,262,505, had 433,447 over the age of 10 
years who could not write, while Michigan, with her splendid school system, out of a 
population of 1,648,690, had only 63,723, and Arkansas, out of a population of 802,525, 
had only 202,015, and Tennessee, out of a population of 1,542,359, nearly 300,000 larger 
than Alabama, had-only 410,722 illiterates. 
“This difference may, it is true, be accounted for in some measure by the large illiter- 
ate negro population of the State, but it must be admitted by every one not blinded by 
prejudice that our meagre appropriations for public schools causes in no small degree 
this difference so disparaging to Alabama, when comparedeven with other Southern 
States. 
“One of our wisest statesmen recently said ‘that no State in the Union is more deeply 
interested in the cause of popular education than Alabama.’ After citing the fact that 
more then 96,000 voters in the State could not read the ballots which, as freemen, they 
are empowered to cast for the weal or woe of their country, he asks with pertinency and 
much force, ‘How can we, with such a mass of ignorance exercising the great privilege 
of suffrage, hope to perpetuate the life and continued prosperity of our free institutions?’ 
“How to dispel this dark cloud of illiteracy that hangs over our State, shrouding all 
in gloom and obscuring our prospects for the future, is the practical question that should 
engage the mind and stir the heart of every patriot and lover of humanity. There isno 
better way of rifting this cloud of illiteracy than by letting in the rays of intellectual 
light into the minds of the young, or of dispelling the gloom that it engenders than by 
instilling in their young hearts correct principles and habits of living, which can and 
should be done by every teacher of our public schools. These schools are the available 
means for the intellectual and moral training of our young, and it is the highest duty of 
the State to sustain them, but to do this as it should be done, more money is necessary. 
“Upon the imperative duty of the State to provide the means for the education of her 
children, I hope to be excused for making the following apt quotation from a speech of 
Lord Macaulay, one of the greatest historians, most brilliant writers, and ripest scholars 
of the past century: 
“**T say, therefore, that the education of the people ought to be the first concern of a 
state, not only because it isan efficient means for promoting and obtaining that which 
all allow to be the main end of government, but because it is the most efficient, the 
most humane, the most civilized, and in all respects the best means of obtaining that end. 
This is my deliberate conviction, and in this opinion I am fortified by thinking that it 
is also the opinion of all the great legislators, of all the great statesmen, of all the great 
philosophers of all ages and of all nations, even including those whose general opinion 
is and has ever been to restrict the functions of government.’ 
“Strong as the foregoing is, it is not stronger than the following from that peerless 
orator and wise statesman, Seargeant S. Prentiss, of Mississippi, taken from a speech de- 
livered in New Orleans in 1846: 
‘««The principle that society is bound to provide for its members’ education as well 
as protection (protection of person and property), so that none need be ignorant except 
from choice, is the most important that belongs to modern philosophy. It is essential 
to arepublican government. Universal education is not only the best and surest, but 
the only sure foundation for free institutions. ‘True liberty is the child of knowledge; 
she pines away and dies in the arms of ignorance.’ 
LOCAL TAX RECOMMENDED. 
‘In my former reports I have frequently expressed the hope that a sentiment favor- 
able to local taxation for school purposes might be awakened in the minds of the people 
of the State, and earnestly urged its importance as the best available means of securing 
sufficient funds to make a public school system efficient. But in this my hopes were 
blasted by a decision of our Supreme Court ina case brought up from the separate school 
district of Cullman, in which the Supreme Court held that such a tax was in violation 
of our constitution. The only chance to increase our school fund by means of local 
taxation is to have our fundamental law amended. This should be done, as we can not 
hope to make our school system what it ought to be without local.taxation. As may 
be above seen, Michigan derives more than one-half of her ample school fund from local 
taxation. But a change of our fundamental law is not only uncertain, but at best its 
accomplishment requires time, and we can not afford to wait for this to be done.’’ 
In addition to the district of Cullman, mentioned by Superintendent Palmer, many 
communities, small towns, and country neighborhoods, says the Montgomery Advertiser, 
asked and obtained from the Legislature a special act authorizing them to levy a local tax 
for schools. These special acts were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, 
as above stated; but the fact that they were called for is conclusive evidence of the strong 
public sentiment in favor of free schools, and of the willingness to support them by 
voluntary local taxes, in addition to the State apportionment.
-P-A-G-E-97
ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—ALABAMA. iG 
A STATE TAX PREFERABLE TO AN APPROPRIATION. 
“‘Qur only hope, so far as the State is concerned, is to increase the direct appropria- 
tion from the State. The people of the State have manifested a willingness to do this, 
as has been repeatedly expressed by their representatives in the Legislature by an in- 
crease of the appropriation for schools within the past few years from $130,000 to $250,- 
000. It is confidently hoped ihat by the time our next Legislature convenes that the 
values of the taxable property of the State will have so increased that an additional 
appropriation for school purposes may be made without risk of impairing the State’s 
credit. A better plan still, in my judgment, would be to levy a special tax of say three 
mills on taxable values, to be used exclusively for public schools. I believe in this way 
the people would more willingly pay this tax, knowing that it could never be diverted 
from the sacred purpose for which it was raised, and that it would be returned to them 
ten-fold in the enhanced valuation of their property, and better still, in the education of 
their children free of cost.’’ 
POLL TAX, 
“There was no material difference between the school funds of the two preceding years’ 
except in the amount of poll tax collected. There has been a very decided falling off in 
the poll tax, both in the amount of assessments and collections, but especially in the 
latter. The poll tax collected for the year ending September 30, 1886, was $144,962.37, 
while that for the past year was only $135,572.34, a falling off of $9,390.03. There was 
a failure on the part of the collectors in‘Elmore and in Sumter Counties to pay over to 
the county superintendents all the poll tax due the school fund in these counties, but 
this only amounts to a few hundred dollars and will not account for this difference. 
* %* * By an examination of preceding reports it will be seen that the collections of 
poll tax are no more than they were several years ago. It is true that this failure to col- 
lect polls is chiefly in the ‘black belt,’ as itis sometimes termed, where the colored 
race are most numerous; but I feel sure that by greater vigilance on the part of collectors, 
and more rigid scrutiny on the part of commissioners’ courts, much more poll tax could 
be collected to increase the school revenues of the State than has been done the past 
year. By an act of the last Legislature the collector is charged with the ¢ollection of the 
insolvent polls of the preceding year, a much better plan than that of turning the lists 
over to the justices of the county, as required by the old law. The aggregate of errors 
and insolvencies allowed the past year amounts to $72,782.63, nearly one-third of the 
entire assessment, and more than half as much as was collected. This is not creditable 
to our people and does not manifest the interest in education that should be shown by 
those who so sorely need the blessings of a public school system. 
SCHOOL LANDS. 
‘“Tt will be seen that there has been collected, during the year, on claims for school 
lands, the sum of $8,855.79. It is to be regretted that the records of this office are so 
defective, caused, no doubt, by the confusion resulting from the Civil War, that.it is im- 
possible to ascertain, with any degree of certainty, what particular subdivisions of school 
lands were purchased by those persons against whom the State holds claims; and, in many 
cases, parties claim that they have made full payment for school lands when the record 
fails to show any payments; and in some cases, lands were sold before the war, and there 
is no evidence in this office of any such sales. Itis very desirable both for the State and 
for the persons claiming these lands that the question of title should be settled, and 
patents issued to those entitled to them, and the claim of the State enforced against those 
who have not paid for the school lands claimed and used by them. During the year there 
has been constant inquiry about title to school lands, caused, no doubt, by the fact that 
these lands are becoming more valuable. It is to be hoped that county and township 
superintendents will take advantage of the favorable opportunity offered by the demand 
for these lands to secure settlements of these old claims held by the State. In many 
cases parties have been in the adverse possession of these lands for twenty and thirty 
years, claiming that the purchase money has all been paid, and yet there isno pretence that 
the State has been divested of her legal title to them. In such cases the intérest of the 
claimants demands that they should have these questions settled, and should secure a 
patent from the State under compromise act, approved March 1, 1881.. Quite a number 
of « ttlements under this act have been effected during the year, and considerable money 
certified into the State treasury to the credit of the school fund of the townships in which 
the land lies.” z 
ARBOR DAY. 
“Tn compliance with a request made by the Southern Forestry Congress, and in ac- 
cordance with a beautiful custom that is prevailing in well nigh every State in the 
Union, I requested the schools of the State to observe the 22d of February, George Wash- 
7 ED 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  98 * EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
ington’s birth-day, as Arbor Day, by planting shade trees and shrubbery on their school- 
grounds, and dedicating them with appropriate ceremonies to the memory of those they 
love. 
‘e Notwithstanding the fact that the appointed day was most unfavorable, by reason 
of heavy rains, hundreds of schools observed the day, and thousands of trees were planted 
and dedicated amid the songs of the joyous children.”” 
“That the day may continue to be observed until such results are obiathed, I hereby 
designate the 22d of February as Arbor Day, and request its proper observance by all 
~ the schools of the State.”

Suc. 2. Kadiak, comprising the region from Mount Saint Elias westward to Zakharoff © 
Bay, with an area of 70,834 square miles. 
Src. 3. Unalashka, comprising the region from Zakharoff Bay westward to the end of 
Aleuggn Islands, and northward to the Arctic Ocean, with an area of 431,545 square 
miles. ; 
Suc. 4. In the districts of Kadiak and. Unalashka the district superintendent, the 
United States deputy collector of customs, and the United States commissioner at Ka- 
diak and Unalashka shall constitute and are hereby appointed a school committee. The 
supervision of the schools in these districts shall be under these committees, and all re- 
ports of the progress and condition of the schools, with recommendations for the loca- 
tion of new schools, and for the erection and repair of school buildings, shall be made 
to the general agent by said committees, and for their services as members of such com- 
mittees the deputy collectors and commissioners shall be allowed $100 each per annum. 
Sec. 5. In each of these two last-named districts or divisions the Territorial Board of * 
Education shall appoint one of the teachers to act as district superintendent. These 
superintendents shall visit the schools of their districts at least once a year, and keep 
the general agent informed of their condition and wants as to school buildings, the man- 
ner in which the teachers perform their duties, and all reports shall be made to the 
general agent by the superintendents through the committees of their districts. The 
district superintendent, in addition to his salary as teacher, shall be paid the sum of 
$200, which shall be in full payment of his services and travelling expenses as such su- 
perintendent. 
Suro. 6, The children shall be taught in the English language, and the use of school 
books printed in any foreign language will not be allowed. The purpose of the Govern- 
ment is to make citizens of these people by educating them in our customs, methods, 
and language. The children are primarily to be taught to speak, read, and write the 
English language. Vocal music may also be taught in the schools. 
Sxo. 7. The Sitka training school should teach the primary branches of industrial 
education. The boys should pe taught shoemaking, carpenter and cabinet work, print- 
ing, and such other trades as are of use in the Territory, while the girls should he in- 
structed in intelligent housekeeping and household industries. 
3uc. 8. A common school should be established in every settlement where there are 
children in sufficient number, and at least one school in every tribe of Indians or native 
settlement. 
Comfortable school-houses must be provided. These schools must be open to all chil- 
dren without reference to race. 
L. Q. C. Lamar, 
Secretary of the Interior. 
  The organization of the board of education provided for in the above rules and regu- 
lations has already been referred to in Chapter I (see p. 32). The board met at Sitka 
July. 14, 1887. Judge Lafayette Dawson was chosen president of the board, and Dr. 
Sheldon Jackson, general agent of education for Alaska, secretary. 
Following is the report of the general agent to the Territorial hoard of education, to- 
gether with the letter of the board transmitting the report, with recommendations, to 
the Commissioner of Education. 
LETTER TRANSMITTING REPORT OF GENERAL AGENT. 
Sitka, ALASKA, November 17, 1887. 
Sir: We have the honor to transmit to you the annual report of the educational agent 
for Alaska, with our approval, except the recommendation, on page 57?, of & division of 
the field. ® : 
We consider a division of the district unnecessary—that it would only complicate and 
retard the educational interests of Alaska. 
But we would recommend one superintendent or general agent for the whole district, 
at a salary of not less than $2,500 per annum, and that he be compelled to remain in the 
Territory and give his undivided personal attention to the Government schools.

REPORT OF THE GENERAL AGENT. 
OFFICE OF THE GENERAL AGENT OF EDUCATION IN ALASKA, 
» Sitka, Alaska, June 30, 1887. 
To the TERRITORIAL BoARD oF EDUCATION: ‘ 
Sms: In accordance with the recent regulations received from the Hon. N. H. R. 
Dawson, United States Commissioner of Education, I have the honor to send you my 
second annual report as general agent of education in Alaska. t 
This report covers the period from July 1, 1886, to June 30, 1887. 
But few of the friends of Alaskan education, outside of her borders, realize that this 
Territory is without roads, horses, stages, and railroads, and much the larger portion with- 
out steamers or other means of regular communication with the outside world. 
A monthly line of mail steamers reaches Sitka anda few points in southeastern Alaska, 
and that is all; and when tourists make the grand excursion to Alaska, they only sail 
among the islands in one small corner of the country. 
‘The great main-land of Alaska, with its smoking volcanoes, mammoth het springs, 
highest mountains, largest glaciers, grandestrivers, wildest scenery, teeming animal life, 
and strangest natural phenomena, unvisited and unseen, stretches away two thousand 
miles beyond them. 
And not only is Alaska largely cut off from the outside world, but in a certain sense 
it is cut off from itself; that is, there are no public means of intercommunication between 
its widely-separated sections. The private steamers of the Alaska Commercial Company, 
a few whaling vessels, an occasional trading schooner, and the Revenue Marine steamer, 
on their annual cruise to Behring Sea, are the only vessels seen in its waters, and they only 
for a few months in summer. 
When, therefore, the United States Government was led to undertake the establishnient 
of public schools in Alaska it was met‘at once with the difficulty of transportation. This 
proved so serious that the Government was compelled to be content the first year with 
taking charge of the schools in southeastern Alaska previously established by the Presby- 
terian Board ef Home Missions. The only exceptions were the schools at Unalashka and 
on the Kuskokwim River. 
Very unexpectedly a teacher was able to reach the former on a steamer chartered for 
another purpose. To reach the latter the Moravian Church, which took the contract for 
conducting the school, chartered a schooner at San Francisco, which conveyed the teacher 
and his party 4,479 miles to the mouth of the river. The material for the houses, school 
supplies, and supplies for the household were then transferred to row-boats, which car- 
ried them to their destination, 150 miles up theriver. Thesame vessel that conveyed the 
teacher carried the lumber and hardware for the necessary buildings, the family furni- 
ture, the school appliances, and provisions for twelve months. They left San Francisco 
on the 3d of May, 1885, and it was the middle of the following August before all the 
building material reached its destination, at Bethel. This was the Moravian party of 
Rey. and Mrs. William H. Weinland, Rev. dnd Mrs. John H. Killbuck, and Mr. Hans 
Torgersen. _ 
When, therefore, in 1885 the responsibility of establishing schools in all sections of 
Alaska was placed upon the Hon. John Eaton, United States Commissioner of Education, 
he was greatly embarrassed by his inability to secure reliable and explicit information 
concerning the educational needs of the villages of civilized Creoles, Aleuts, and Eski- 
maux in southern and southwestern Alaska, + 
Application was made to and instructions received from the Honorable the Secretary 
of the Navy, directing the commanding officer of the United States ship Pinta to take 
the general agent on a trip of inspection along the coast. 
A combination of circumstances prevented the ship from making the trip. 
It was then decided that the only practical way of securing the information absolutely 
necessary for the intelligent action of the Government was to send a special vessel under 
the control of the general agent. 
Nothing could be done, however, until the amount of the appropriation for 1886-87 
should be known. ‘The appropriation was not made until the 4th of August, 1886. 
Immediately upon the passage of the bill I was authorized to charter the schooner 
Leo, and by September 3 teachers had been summoned from Texas, California, and 
Washington Territory, the vessel loaded with lumber for school-houses, family furni- 
ture, and supplies, and we were on our way to sea. The authority to charter the vessel 
was given by Hon. John Eaton, by letter dated on the 4th day of August, 1886, as shown 
by a copy of his letter among the papers. The schooner was chartered from John G. 
Brady, of Sitka. The cost of the trip was $4,535, which was paid to Brady on the 1st 
of February, 1887, out of the appropriation, as per voucher on file. 
The cruise proved a stormy one, consuming 104 days. Passing through the equinoc- 
tial storms, we encountered the early winter gales of that high northern latitude. 
Laying our course for Atkha, one of the Aleutian group of islands, the storms finally 
landed us, September 21, at Kadiak, 900 miles to the eastward of our destination. Ka-

diak Island is the western limit of forests along the southern coast of Alaska. It is also 
near the eastern limit of the Innuit, or civilized Eskimau population. 
The first European or Russian settlement on this island was made by Gregory Sheli- 
koff in 1784; and soon after a school (the first in Alaska) was organized for the children 
of the Russians. Also the first church building in Alaska was erected on this island. 
‘For a long time it was the Russian capital and the chief seat of their operations in Amer- 
ica, A tombstone in the Russian cemetery bears the date of 1791. 
The village has a pleasant look, and consists of 43 log-houses, 23 rough board houses, 
and 12 painted ones. It has a Russian Creole population of 303, of whom 143 are chil- 
dren. There are 20 white men in thesettlement. The Russian school had been extinct 
for more than a quarter of a century, and for years the people had been looking for an- 
other. It was a great satisfaction to be permitted to give them a good school. Prof. 
W. E. Roscoe, an experienced teacher from California, with his wife and babe, was 
stationed at this place, and received from the people a very warm welcome. He had 
been landed but a few hours when a delegation of adults waited upon him and asked that 
a night school for instruction in English might be established for the married people. 
“ Mr. Benjamin McIntyre, the efficient general agent of the Alaska Commercial Com- 
pany, furnished a school-room free of rentand in many ways gave important help to the 
teacher. Valuable assistance was also received from Mr, Ivan Petroff, deputy. collector 
ne of customs. 
Opposite Kadiak is Wood Island, with 50 bright children. The patriarch of the vil- 
lage gathered them into a room and then made a touching appeal fora school. It was 
with a heavy heart that I said to them, as subsequently I was compelled to say to many 
others, ‘‘I would be glad to give youaschool, but Ican not.’? The meagre appropriation 
by Congress of $15,000 for the education of the ten or twelve thousand children of Alaska 
necessarily deprives the majority of them of any school. 
To the north of Wood Island is Spruce Island, where a Russian monk, at his own ex- 
pense, kept up a school for thirty consecutive years. He died and his school was dis- 
continued. To their entreaties for a school we had toturn adeafear. They are a well- 
to-do people, with humble but pleasant homes. They haye a number of cows, make 
butter and cheese, and raise potatoes. The men are mostly hunters of the sea-otter. 
Still farther north is Afognak Island, with 146 school children. A school was estab- 
lished amorig them, with Prof. James A. Wirth in charge. While superintending the 
unloading of the school supplies through the breakers we were invited by one of the vil- 
lagers toa lunch of rice, fried chicken, potatoes, eggs, bread, and sweet fresh butter, 
cake, home-made preserves, and Russian tea served in glass tumblers. 
From Afognak we visited Karluk, with its 118 children; Akhiok, 48; Ayakhatalik, 
72; and Kaguiak, 45. All of these groups of bright-eyed, rosy-cheeked, and healthy 
children had to be refused schools for want of funds. At some of these villages the ladies 
of our party were the first white women ever seen. 
From the Kadiak group of islands, nine days’ battling with the waves brought us to 
Unalashka, in Behring Sea. This is the commercial port of western Alaska and contains 
a population of 340, 132 of whom are minors under twenty-one years of age. 
Mr. S. Mack, agent of the Alaska Commercial Company; Dr. Call, the company physi- 
cian; Collecter Barry, and Commissioner Johnston did all in their power to make our 
visit pleasant. At this village a school of 24 pupils was in operation under the control 
of the Russo-Greek Church. The teacher, Tsikoores, was born in Greece and partly 
educated in San Francisco. : 
The boys attend school in the forenoon and the girlsin the afternoon. The instruction 
is mainly in the Russian language. a 
The public school maintained in 1885-86 had been discontinued. * 
The appropriation of Congress was made so late in the summer that there was no op- 
portunity of communicating with the teacher. 
He hearing nothing from the Bureau with reference to continuing another year took 
passage upon the revenue steamer, at the close of her summer cruise, and left the coun- 
try. The desks and school supplies were removed to Unga. 
The Greek Church has 16 general holidays and 200 minor ones during the year, which 
are celebrated more or less by the Alaskan churches. These numerous holidays prove a 
serious hinderance in securing regular attendance at school. 
American citizens that have never heard a prayer for the President of the United 
States, or of the Fourth of July, or the name of the capital of the nation, are taught to 
pray for the Emperor of Russia, celebrate his birthday, and commemorate the victories 
of ancient Greece. Upon one occasion, trying to inform them that we had come from the 
seat of government at Washington to open the way for the establishment of schools, we 
found that the only American city they had ever heard of was San Francisco, After 
laboring with them, one man was found who had somehow heard of Chicago. Boston, 
New York, Philadelphia, and Washington were unknown regions. 
In the mountains back of Unalashka a volcano was in active eruption. 
Passing out of the beautiful harbor of Unalashka four days brought us by the magnifi-

‘cent smoking volcanoes of Shishaldin and Pavoloff to Belkofsky, the centre of the sea- 
otter fur trade. 5 
This place, with its white houses crowning a high bluff, presents a very pleasant ap- 
pearance from the sea. It has a population of 203 Aleuts and Creoles, of whom 91 are 
under 21 years of age. The Greek Church keeps a small school with an attendance of 
16 at the time of our visit. The teaching is in Russian, with the exception of two after- 
noons in the week, when a Creole teaches in broken English. We were importuned to 
establish a good Government school, but the appropriation was too small. 
From thence we sailed to Unga, the centre of the cod fisheries of the North Pacific. 
Unga has the largest American population of any village in Western Alaska, and a 
greater appreciation of the value ofa good school. Ithas'74 children under 21 years of age. 
At this point I left Mr. and Mrs. John H. Carr to establish a school. On this trip a 
complete census was taken of the population from Kadiak westward to Attoo, and in a 
total population of 3,840 I enumerated 1,649 children. These are children of a civilized 
people who, by the terms of Article III of the treaty of 1867 between Russia and the 
United States, are declared to be citizens, and are guaranteed all the ‘‘ rights, advantages 
and immunities of citizens of the United States,’’ and yet after nineteen years of total 
neglect the United States Government only gives them three teachers, and the American 
churches but one missionary. 
At every station visited the agents and employés of the Alaska Commercial Company, 
without an exception, gave us their hearty co-operation and all the assistance in their 
power towards the establishment of their schools. At two of the stations they supplied 
the buildings necessary for the schools free of rent,and at all of them furnished the teach- 
ers ‘vith their household supplies on the same terms given their own agents. Without 
these facilities it would have been almost impossible to have established the schools in 
that section. 4 
From Unga eight days’ driving before the storm brought us to Klawak, one. of the 
principal settlements on Prince of Wales Island. It was my purpose to establish a new 
school at this point, but finding that the salmon cannery and saw-mill had closed for the 
season and the larger number of the people left for their winter village, Tuxikan, with 
the full consent of the teacher, Prof. L.W. Currie, I took him and his family to Tuxi- 
kan and temporarily established the school at that point. In the spring, when the peo- 
ple returned to Klawak for work, the school was removed to that point, where it now is. 
Bidding them God speed, four days bring us to Sitka, the capital of the Territory, with 
its two good day schools and flourishing industrial training school. 
At Sitka, taking on board the Governor and his interpreter, we sailed to Killisnoo, 
where was landed lumber and materials for a new school building. 
Calls were made and schools inspected at Hoonah, Juneau, Wrangell, and Tongass. 
Mr. and Mrs. §. A. Saxman, with their furniture and school supplies, were removed 
from Loring to Tongass, and finally we dropped anchor at Seattle, Puget Sound, on the 
15th of December, and the memorable voyage of the first load of schoo! teachers for 
Alaska was at an end. 
All the objects of the trip were secured. 
CONDITION OF THE SCHOOLS. 
St. Michael.—In pursuance of the plan of the United States Commissioner of Educa- 
tion to establish schools in at least a few of the leading centres of the Territory (as the 
amount appropriated was not sufficient to do more), correspondence was had with the 
Mission Board of the Protestant Episcopal Church with reference to the establishment 
of a public school in the valley of the Yukon River. 
Owing to the impossibility of getting the necessary supplies into that region the first 
season, it was finally arranged that the school might temporarily be located at St. 
Michael, on the coast. Consequently on the 1st day of July, 1886, a contract} for the 
establishment of such a schdol was entered into between the Hon. John Eaton, United 
States Commissioner of Education, and Dr. William 8, Langford, Secretary of the 
Protestant Episcopal Mission Board. : 
Rev. Octavius Parker, of Oregon, was appointed teacher. From a correspondence be- 
tween Dr. Langford and the Alaska Commercial Company, the former was led to believe 
that although houses were very scarce at St. Michael, yet they would be able to provide for the teacher. 
“Upon Mr. Parker’s arrival at his destination he found, to his great disappointment, 
that although the agent of the company did everything in his power for him, even to 
sharing his own residence, yet'the quarters were so contracted that it was with great 
discomfort that his own family could get along, and that there was no possible place for holding a school. 
To add to his difficulties the priest of the Russo-Greek Church, who had previously been living in the Yukon Valley, remoyed to St. Michael and opened a school, teaching 
the natives in the Russian language. This church school, while doing next to nothing

for the children, yet through misrepresentation and ‘prejudice kept them away from the 
Government school. > ‘ 
Professor Parker, however, taught a few from time to time in his own sitting-room. 
He has now purchased a building at Anvik, on the Yukon River, where he will open 
a school next September with Rev. John W. Chapman as assistant. Although there are 
two teachers the Government pays but one salary. 
This school met with a great loss last winter in the death of Mrs. McDowell, who had 
accompanied Professor Parker as an assistant. 
Bethel.—At this point, 150 miles up the Kuskokwim River from Behring Sea, school was 
opened on the 8th of September with six pupils—four boys and two girls; of these, three 
boys were boarding pupils, living in the teacher’s family. This number gradually in- 
ereased until he had an attendance of thirteen. The migratory habits of the people after 
food, and the ¢eustom of the whole family accompanying the man and father, greatly in- 
terferes with the attendance on school. The few children who did attend were found to 
be willing and apt scholars, and made as good progress as could be expected inastrange 
language. The boys are taught and required to do their own washing, ironing, and 
cooking. Asthe children have never been accustomed to any restraint, the school hours 
haye been broken up as much as possible. The school day consists of two hours in the 
forenoon, two in the afternoon, and one in the evening. Outside of these hours they cut 
and split wood, wash, iron, cook, and do chores. Good buildings were erected at the 
expense of the Moravian Church, and the foundations of an industrial training school are 
being wisely laid. During the last two years there has been a great scarcity of food in 
the valley of the Kuskokwim, which has interfered with school operations, but it is 
thought that a sufficient supply can be secured this season, which will enable the teacher 
to receive all the pupils that shall offer. 
There are twenty-two regular villages on the river, with a population of 2,600. 
On the coldest day last winter the thermometer recorded 44° below zero as over against 
50° below during the winter of 1885-86. I regret to say that, owing to illness in his 
family and hemorrhages of the lungs himself, Professor Weirland has been compelled 
to leave the field and return to Pennsylvania. 
The school will be carried on by Mr. and Mrs. John H. Killbuck, experienced teach- 
ers from Kansas. They have been in the work at that place for the past two years, and 
have made considerable progress in mastering the native language. 
Aushagak.—During the summer of 1886, Rev. Frank E. Wolff, of Wisconsin, was sent 
out by the Moravian Church to erect a teacher’s residence and school-house at Nusha- 
ik, at the mouth of the Nushagak River, Behring Sea. After the erection of the resi- 
lence, he returned east for the winter. On the 12th ‘of May last, accompanied by his 
family and Miss Mary Huber, he sailed from San Francisco to open a Government school 
at Nushagak. Miss Huber is a teacher from Pennsylvania, of large experienceand great 
success, who resigned her position in a prominent ladies’ seminary in order to enter the 
Alaska work. At this school, as at the others, the Government pays but one salary. 
These three schools, 500miles from each other, and central toa population of from 10,000 
to 12,000 uncivilized natives, should by all means be sustained. They are the entering 
wedges to the civilization of that whole great region—the beginning of better things. 
And the trained men and cultivated women who are willing to exile themselves from 
the world, endure the rigors of anarctic climate, battle continuously with cruel supersti- 
tions and filthy customs, and work witha barbarous, degraded, and dirty people, in their 
zeal to educate, civilize, and lift up the child population and transform them into useful 
citizens, are worthy of full sympathy, hearty co-operation, and a generous support. 
Unga.—This is the chief sea-port and village on the Shumagin Islands. School opened 
on the first day of November, 1886, with Professor and Mrs, John H. Carr, of Washing- 
ton Territory, teachers. 
The only place that could be obtained for the school was a small and uncomfortable 
room 22 by 9} feet. Into this the children were crowded so closely that they could not 
leave their seats for recitation. A commodious school-house is a pressing necessity. The 
progress of the pupils has been as gratifying as it was unexpected. Towards the close of 
the school year the Russo-Greek Church established a school in this village and sought 
to draw the children away from the Government school, but without success. 
The Russian school, like the majority of theirschools in Alaska, is mainly taughtiu 
the Russian language, and the studies are largely on the liturgy and catechism of the 
church, This school met with a great lossin the death of Mrs. Carr on the 15th of June. 
By her sweet disposition, as well as skill in teaching, she had secured the affections of 
her pupils to an unusual degree. 
Kadiak.—This school was kept in a cooper shop, which was fitted up and kindly ten- 
dered to the Government by the Alaska Commercial Company. While it was a gener- 
ous act on the part of the company, for which the Bureau of Education should render 
it thanks, yet it is not to the credit of a great Government that it must be dependent 
on private parties for buildings in which to hold its schools,
-P-A-G-E-105
  ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—ALASKA. 105 
A good substantial school building is greatly needed at Kadiak. 
The pupils manifested a great fondness for and excelled in writing and drawing, but 
with a few exceptions were dull in arithmetic. In addition to the ordinary day school’ 
Professor Roscoe held an evening school for working men who could not attend during 
the day, and Mrs. Roscoe an afternoon school for married women. 
Strenuous efforts were made upon the part of some to discourage the attendance of 
the children, and a strong prejudice manifested itself against the children being taught 
English. But notwithstanding the oppositién 59 pupils were enrolled during the year. 
Over against these discouragements there were some encouraging examples of unusual 
eagerness to secure the advantages of a good school. 
One family, over 80 miles away by sea, reading in a stray copy of a San Francisco 
paper that a public school was to be established at Kadiak, broke up housekeeping and 
the mother and two grown daughters moved to Kadiak to attend school, reaching there 
six months in advance of the teacher. 
Another family, consisting of a mother and five children, on their way to school were 
shipwrecked and lost. There isno doubt that there are many families ready to make 
great personal sacrifices to secure educational advantages. 
Professor Roscoe has made good progress in learning the Russian language, spoken by 
the pupils of his school, As he becomes more and more proficient in it he will be more 
and more successful in teaching English. 
Afognak.—This school has met the usual difficulties encountered in all the schools 
among the Aleut and Creole population. The people in language, and still more in 
sympathy and feeling, are Russian. They are taught in some cases to believe that the 
American occupation is but temporary and that Russia will again come into possession. 
Many of them look upon the Americans as barbarians and do not wish their children to 
learn English, In some cases an effort has been made to frighten those who manifested 
some interest by telling them that as soon as their boys learned English the Govern- 
ment would draft them into the army and carry them off, no one knew where. 
The school at Afognak had the further difficulty that there was no interpreter to be 
had, as at Kadiak and Unga, or any children of American fathers, as a nucleus for the 
school. Neither parents nor children have any idea of the necessity of application or 
the importance of the advantages offered them by the school. Then, the building used 
for the school (the only one suitable that could be rented in the community)-was too 
far one side to accommodate the people. Notwithstanding these and other hindrances, 
a good school was maintained and the chi/dren that attended with any degree of reg- 
ularity made good progress. They excel:in music, writing, and drawing. 
The murder of Mr. B..G. McIntyre, the general agent of the Alaska Commercial Com- 
pany at Kadiak, was a great blow to the school. He had great influence among the 
people of the islands and had actively interested himself in behalf of the schools. 
Prof. James A. Wirth, who has natural gifts in acquiring language, being able to speak 
several European tongues, i is making rapid progress in learning the Russian, which is the 
language of his district. 
The private building occupied by the school is inconvenient and unsuited for the pur- 
pose and a comfortable building should be erected at once in a central location. 
Chileoot. Owing to the infrequency of communication (this school being 100 miles from 
a post office) it was not for some weeks after school should have commenced that I re- 
ceived the resignation of Miss Sarah M. Dickinson as teacher and it was several weeks 
after her successor was appointed before he could reach the place. 
The school was opened in January by Mr. Salomon Ripinsky with a good attendance. 
The average continued large until April, when the parents, hiring as packers to the 
miners going into the interior, took their children away with them. 
This greatly diminished the attendance during the spring months. 
Through the courtesy of Rev. Eugene S. Willard, in charge of the Presbyterian mis- 
sion, a good building, desks, etc., were furnished the school free. 
Juneau.—Dr. F. F. White, in taking charge of this important school at the commence- 
ment of the school year, at once proceeded to systematize and grade it. 
The school opened with a good attendance of American and Creole children, the na- 
tives being largely away from home preparing their winter supply of food. But as the 
natives returned to their homes the attendance of their children steadily increased 
through the winter until spring, when they were off again for food. As the attendance 
of the native children increased that of the Americans and Creoles fell off. It was the 
old story of mixed schools. The appropriation allowed of but one teacher, and conse- 
quently there could be but the one school. In 1885 and 1886 the attendance was largely 
Creole; in 1886 and 1887 it was largely native. 
The advanced classes finished their geography and made satisfactory progress in United 
States history, physiology and hygiene, and arithmetic, both mental and practical. 
It was a notable fact that the first and second chiefs of the Auke tribe were at times 
daily attendants, and their children among the most regular of the pupils,

Juneau, being the largest and most important settlement in Alaska, should have a good, 
" substantial school building and separate schools for the whites and natives, 
Killisnoo.—This school has had to contend in common with the others with irregular 
attendance. 
Professor Johnston speaks approvingly of the eagerness to learn manifested by the Cre- 
ole pupils. 
At the commencement of the school year lumber and material were procured to erect 
the much needed school-house, but a difficulty arising with regard to the location the 
erection of the building was delayed until this summer. This is the first school build- 
ing erected by the Government in Alaska. ‘ 
Sitka.—The two Government schools at the capital of the Territory are housed in 
buildings that a thrifty farmer would not consider comfortable enough for his cattle. 
They also have to contend with irregularity of attendance, especially in the school for 
natives. , 
Miss Powell reports the rapid advancement of the Creole pupils and the gratifying 
progress they are making in learning the English language. 
If suitable buildings can be erected this coming fall the usefulness of these schools 
will be greatly increased. 
Fort Wrangell.—This eldest of the schools in southeastern Alaska has had a most suc- 
cessful year. 
The school year opened with 45 pupils and steadily increased to 112. It can well be 
called the polyglot school. Among the pupils were representatives of 13 tribes, Ameri- 
cans, and the following half bloods; French and Stickine, Irish and Stickine, American 
and Stickine, American and Russian Creole, American and Alaskan Oreole, American 
and Hydah, Scotch and Hanegah, and Norwegian and Taltan. 
With regard to the intellectual capacity of the full and half bloods, Miss McAvoy re- 
ports that while the half bloods learn more easily, the full bloods master their studies 
more thoroughly. That while the half bloods are more nimble of brain, the full bloods 
have quite as much of it. And that the full bloods learn to speak better English than 
the half bloods. She also reports the great interest her children have taken in the 
Child’s Health Primer and the hygiene for young people. 
The school has been kept in a room in the old hospital. The roof leaks, the water 
pours in around the windows, and the floor of the front porch has rotted away, and 
partly fallen in. If the school is to be kept in the same place another season the build- 
ing should be extensively repaired. 
Klawak.—This is a new station, the school being established for the first time last 
winter. The school was first commenced at Tuxikan, where, with commendable hero-- 
ism, Mr. and Mrs. Currie had volunteered to go. Asno white man had ever resided in 
the village there was no suitable dwelling to be had, and the teacher was compelled ‘to 
occupy a portion of one of the native houses. This was a plank building about thirty- 
seven feet square with a rotten bark roof. Through the cracks of the plank floor the 
surf could be seen at high-tide dashing under the building. The house was constructed 
after the native fashion, all in one room.’ Entering the door, steps led down two feet to 
a plank platform seven and one-half feet wide, which extended around the four sides of 
the room. From the platform steps descended three feet to the lower floor, which formed 
a pit twenty-one by twenty-two feet in extent. 
In the centre of this pit a space eight feet square had been left unplanked. This was 
the fire-place. In the roof directly over the fire-place a similar opening had been left 
for the escape of so much of the smoke as had not previously escaped through the cracks 
of the sides of the building. Through this same hole in the roof the rain descended in 
sufficient quantities to put out the fire. 
On the platform opposite the door was a small room fifteen and a half by six anda 
half feet used as a bed and store room. The hole in the roof was roughly boarded up, 
and a large box stove placed in the pit, which became the school room. 
Posts were erected at each corner of the pit, and sheeting stretched across, curtaining 
off the platforms on two sides of the building. These platforms thus curtained off be- 
came the residence of the teacher. The native with his family of six occupied the other 
two platforms. . 
Into this dilapidated and uncomfortable building this cultured family, in their zeal 
to lift up this poor people, moved without a murmur. 
In the spring Mr. Currie, with his family, removed to Klawak, renting the only 
building to be had, an unfinished board shanty erected out of refuse lumber. 
Notwithstanding all these discomforts and hindrances he had a very large school, his 
total enrolment for the whole year being 184. The best work, however, can not be ex- 
pected until the teacher has a comfortable building in which to house his school. 
_ Howkan.—This school has continued to send in its good monthly reports. 
The temporary shanty which for several years past has been used for the school dur- 
ing a heavy snow storm last winter was crushed, and now the school is shelterless,

In some respects the Hydah are considered the best people on the North Pacific Coast, 
and immediate steps should be taken to erect a school-house suitable for this important 
Hydah centre. : 
Tongass.—In southeastern Alaska are the three small villages of Port Tongass, Cape 
Fox, and Scowls, neither of them with a population sufficient to justify the expense © 
of a school, and yet, if united, would form the constituency of a'good school. 
To secure such a school the leading men of the three villages have agreed to leave 
their old settlements and together build a new one. . 
In the hope that the united village would be located at Loring, Prof. 8: A. Saxman, 
of western Pennsylvania, was sent to that place. 
Finding but very few people there (work for the season having closed at the salmon 
cannery), it was thought advisable that for the winter at least he should teach the 
school at Tongass. 
During the Christmas holidays Professor Saxman, accompanied by Mr. Louis Paul, a 
native missionary, and another native, started to visit Port Chester, a place that had been 
mentioned as a suitable location for the new village. ‘The party was lost at sea, When 
they did not return two search parties were sent out, who found the canoe broken on 
the rocks, The bodies of the men were never recovered, This sad event closed the 
school. ag 
It is now more than probable that Port Chester will be settled this summer by a col- 
ony of Christianized and civilized natives from Metlakahtla led by Mr. William Duncan. 
If this proves to be the case, it will make a centre around which the scattered popula- 
tion can cluster and secure good school facilities. 
The above schools furnish the following statistics:

CHURCH AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS. 
In addition to the above, schools have been in operation on each of the seal islands, 
St. Paul and St. George, supported by the Alaska Commercial Company. The Russo- 
Greek Church has had small schools at Unalashka, Belkofsky, Kadiak, andSitka, * * * 
At Juneau there has been a school under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church, 
and at Sitka an industrial training school under the control of the Presbyterian Board 
of Home Missions, assisted by the Indian Bureau. 
. Although applied for, I have failed to receive the statistics of the Russian and Roman 
Catholic schools. 
The Sitka Industrial Training School, with its large and commodious buildings and 
teaching force of 13 persons, is the best equipped school in the Territory. 
The two principal industries at present taught the boys are carpentering and black- 
smithing. ‘The institution is also furnished with tools for boot and shoe making, anda 
press and complete outfit for a printing office. 
During the present summer the Elliott F. Shepard Industrial Building has been erected, 
. furnishing accommodations for the carpenter shop, wood-carving, boot and shoe room, 
and printing office. A hospital building has also been erected in connection with the 
school. 
Mr. Edwin Hale Abbott, of Milwaukee, has generously offered to found a department 
of wood-carying and weaving, in which the native population excel. 
The attendance has averaged 100. 
As the boys and girls are clothed, fed, lodged, and taught at the institution, they are 
continuously under the influence of the teachers, and the best results are secured. 
The school is under the management of Prof. William A. Kelly, assisted by Rev. 
Alonzo E. Austin, chaplain; Mrs. A. E. Austin, matron of the Boys’ Home; Miss A. R. 
Kelsey, matron of the Girls’ Home; Miss Ida M. Rogers, teacher in the school-room; Mrs. 
Susan 8. Winans, teacher in sewing room; Miss Virginia M. Pakle, teacher ‘n the laun- 
dry; Mrs. Charles E. Overend, teacher in the kitchen; Mr. C. E. Overend, teacher in 
the carpenter shop; and Mr. Joel Liberty, teacher in the blacksmith shop.

  110 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
No official course of study has been marked out for the various schools. The expe- 
rience'of the two years during which public schools have been in operation, and the ex- 
perience ofthe mission schools for nearly twelve years, have demonstrated the fact that 
it would not be wise to hamper the teachers with a course of study that would not fit 
the surroundings of the school. Attendance is so irregular, ‘the pupils of such different 
ages (from 6 to 60), with such varying aptitudes for acquiring the English language, 
and all ages in the primary grades, that a uniform plan would be impossible. It must 
be left necessarily to the tact and originality of the teacher. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE, 
The reports of the several teachers during the year are burdened with complaints of 
irregular attendance and of their inability to secure the best results from their teaching 
because of this irregularity. The new board of education has taken this.matter in 
hand, and it is hoped that something may be accomplished next year in securing a more 
regular attendance of the pupils. 
‘The appropriation of Congress forthe education of childrenin Alaska, without distinc- 
tion of race, was only $15,000. 
If the schools had been dependent upon that alone, either one-half of them would 
have had to be closed, or all of them closed up at the end of six months. Fortunately 
there wasan unexpected balance of 1884 which was available. The aggregate expense 
of running the schools the past year has been $25,000. In the appropriation for 1887 
and 1888 the sum of $25,000 has been granted. As it is very essential that the number 
of schools should be increased and buildings erected at the more important points, I 
would urgently recommend that the appropriation for 1888 and 1889 be increased to 
$50,000.

rectly or indirectly, helps the school work.

I would recommend the following additions to and modifications of the school laws: 
1st. That as the new rules and regulations look to obligatory school attendance, 
the board of education be authorized to employ a special policeman to entorce attendance 
at each settlement where a public school exists and at which there is no other police- 
man to perform the duty; said policeman to be paid from the educational fund. 
2d. That the supervision of the schools of the ‘Territory be divided into the eastern 
and western division. 
The eastern division shall comprise southeastern Alaska and the western division the 
remainder of the Territory. 
‘That a superintendent of public instruction be appointed by the United States Com- 
missioner. of Education for each of these divisions. 
That the superintendent of.the eastern division shall have his headquarters at Sitka, 
and be ex officio secretary of the board of education. 
That the superintendent of the western division shall have his office at the Bureau of 
Education, Washington, and spend that portion of the year in which vessels are plying 
between the different ports of western Alaska in visiting the schools in his district. 
This division of the superintendence is rendered necessary— 
(a) Because there is no meansof transportation between eastern and western Alaska. 
The one section is reached by sea from Puget Sound, and the other section by sea from 
San Francisco. This is such abarrier to jurisdiction, that although the civil government 
has been in existence over three years, not one of the civil officials has been able to visit 
any portion of the Territory outside of southeastern Alsaka, except the general agent 
of education, and he only succeeded by chartering a special vessel. ‘There have been 
several murders in southwestern Alaska, but the guilty parties are at large because the 
court has no means of reaching them. 
(0) This division is rendered necessary by section 4 of rules and regulations, which 
directs that the general agent ‘‘shall visit each school district and each school in the 
district at least once a year.’’ 
This is a physical impossibility. With the present means of communication no one 
person can visit each schoolin the Territory once during the same year. If he gives his 
attention to the schools in southeastern Alaska he can not reach those in western Alaska 
the same season. And vice versa, if he attempts to visit the schools in western Alaska 
it will keep him away from southeastern Alaska the entire season. In the forming state 
of the schools it is important that a yearly visit should be made, but this can only be 
accomplished by a subdivision. 
3d. I would again renew my recommendation that the Honorable Secretary of the 
Interior be requested to ask Congress for $50,000 for the school fund for the year end- 
ing June 30, 1889. 
4th, I would further ecommentl that the annual reports of the several teachers, the 
special report of Miss Alice C. Fletcher to the Honorable Secretary of the Interior on © 
the need of schools in western Alaska, and the proceedings of the Territorial board of 
education be printed in the appendix to this report. 
5th, I sata still further recommend that legislation be asked from Congress setting 
apart one-fourth of the gross revenues of Alaska annually as a fund for the education of 
the children of Alaska without distinction of race. 
In the Western States and Territories Congress has granted sections 16 and 36 in each 
township for the use of the schools in said States and Territories. 
{n Alaska the lands are unsurveyed, and when in course of time the general land laws 
are extended over it, the nature of the country and the requirements of the population 
will prevent the laying out of the land to any great extent in sections of a mile square. 
While no school fund is practicable for years from the lands, the General Government 
derives a regular revenue from the Seal Islands, a portion of which can be used in the 
place of the proceeds of the sale of the school lands. 
‘The present method of supporting the schools by an annual appropriation prevents 
the feeling of permanence. A failure on the part of Congress any one year to make 
provision for thé support, of the schools will close them up, causing a loss of public 
property and a serious drawback to the success of the schools. 
Very truly, yours, 
SHELDON JACKSON, 
United States General Agent of Education in Alaska.

ARIZONA, 
LFrom Report of Governor C. M. Zulick, 1887.] 
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. * 
The public school system of Arizona is a subject of pride to allof her citizens. School 
advantages are freely offered to every child in every partof the Territory. Paying higher 
salaries than any State or other Territory, it also requires a higher standard of ability 
in the teacher. The public schools are supervised by a Territorial superintendent of 
public instruction, who is elected biennially. There is also a Territorial board of edu- 
cation, consisting of the superintendent of public instruction, Territorial treasurer, and 
the Governor, whose duty is to adopt rules and regulations for the government of the 
public schools and-libraries, devise plans for the increase and management of the Terri- 
torial school fund, prescribe and enforce the use of uniform series of text-books and course 
of studies, grant educational diplomas, and revoke for immoral conduct or evident un- 
fitness for teaching Territorial diplomas. The probate judge of each county in the Ter- 
ritory is made ex officio county superintendent of the public schools for his county. His 
duty is to apportion the school moneys to each district of his county, to draw the neces- 
sary warrants on the county treasurer for expenses against the school fund, enforce the 
course of study, the use of text-books, and the rules and regulations for the examina- 
tions of teachers as prescribed by the proper authority. The Territory is divided into 
school districts, which are presided over by three school trustees, who are elected at a 
special election, and whose duties are to generally superintend all school matters within 
their district. The public schools of the Territory are maintained by the levy of a tax 
of 3 cents upon each $100 value taxable property, collected and paid into the Terri- 
torial treasury asa special fund for school purposes, and then apportioned to the respect- 
ive counties. The school year begins on the 1st day of July and ends on the last day 
of June. The Territory hasalsoin successful operation a normal school, located at Tempe, 
Maricopa Courty, and has endowed a university at Tucson, Pima County, which is not 
yet constructed. 
All moneys accruing to the Territory by the sale of personal or real property of an- 
escheated estate, or from the rents or profits of lands or tenements held as escheated, are 
payable into the school fund, as also all moneys arising from fines, forfeitures, and 
gambling licenses. 
By her liberal and progressive system of publicschools Arizona is diffusing knowledge 
among her rising generation and preparing her youths to intelligently assume the duties 
of American citizenship when clothed with its cares and responsibilities. 
SCHOOL LANDS. 
By act of Congress there have been seventy-two sections of public lands within the 
Territory granted for the purposes of a university, also the sixteenth and thirty-sixth 
sections of every township for a school fund. The Territory is deprived of the use of 
these lands until it becomes a State. If the sixteenth and thirty-sixthsections in every 
township ‘could be sold and the money arising from the same appropriated to defraying 
the school expenses of the Territory, it would prove a great benefit to the cause of edu- 
cation and greatly relieve our overburdened tax-payers. Arizona needs the benefits to 
accrue from these lands now more than when she becomes a State, and should enjoy the 
privilege of their disposal the same as is granted the States. Not having any control 
over these lands they are fast being denuded of timber, so that when we do enter state- 
hood ana control them they may practically prove valueless. Again, many of these sec- 
tions are being occupied by settlers who innocently and from want of information are 
wasting time, labor, and money in clearing the land, erecting buildings, and making 
improvements which will in the future prove a total loss to them. 
I respectfully recommend that Congress be asked to give the Territories the same priv- 
ileges as the States now enjoy in this matter and authorize the absolute transfer of these 
lands to the respective Territories for the immediate benefit of the cause of public edu- 
cation.

} ENUMERATION AND ATTENDANCE, 
. Of the 153,260 children enumerated as between four and sixteen years of age, 126,426 
were reported as having attended school. This attendance may have been for one day 
or a few days only. It includes those who attended private as well as public schools, . 
but does not include any over sixteen years of age. 
Of the whole number enumerated, 26,834 are reported as having attended no school. 
Of these non-attendants, 10,203 were reported to be under five, and 8,891 were be- 
tween five and eight years of age. Thus 19,094 were either too young to attend or 
were below the compulsory limit; 5,556 were reported to be over fourteen and had passed 
the compulsory limit. 
We have left 2,184 non-attendants between eight and fourteen, the limit of compul- 
sory attendance. This is larger than last year by 268, 
Causes of falling off in attendanee.—In 1879, 86 out of every 100 children entmerated 
were enrolled in public schools, and 53 out of every 100 enumerated were in regular at- 
tendance. In 1887, 82 and 49 out of every 100 were enrolled and in attendance respect- 
ively. The fact which deserves attention is that a decreasing proportion of the persons 
enumerated attend school. 
Among the causes of this falling off are: 
1. The large towns exclude all children under five, and everywhere there is little dis- 
position to send very young children. 
2. The limit of sixty days has become in many places the standard, and instead of long 
periods of attendance there have been long periods of work with intervals of school. 
The law prohibiting employment of children under thirteen would naturally increase 
the number in attendance; but so many advanced with a bound from eleven or twelve 
to fourteen that in few schools has any increase from this cause been noted. The diffi- 
culties encountered in ascertaining the ages of children, whether by reference to town 
or school records, are very great. Without doubt many children under thirteen are to- 
day escaping the provisions of the law relating to employment and ‘attendance through 
false statements of parents. 
Effect of private schools upon attendance. —The average attendance in all the schools was 
853 less than last year. 
This contraction is in part explained by the opening in several large towns of private 
schools. This special cause can not long operate, because the number which can be with- 
drawn from public to private schools is limited, and the limit will soon be reached. 
Moreover, private schools can not exist in competition with public schools as long as 
the latter maintain a clear superiority. This superiority has thus far been easily main- 
tained, and no considerable number of people can be enticed or compelled to diminish 
the privileges of theirchildren. So long as the best education is found in public schools 
these schools will attract the great body of chiidren. 
Connecticut leads in the matter of compulsory attendance.—The law which requires all 
children under thirteen years of age to attend 120 days in each year places this State in 
the lead in respect of compulsory attendance. In districts where school is open not 
longer than six months in the year comformity to the law will permit no absence not 
guarded by the recognized legal excuses. 
The law now regards each week’s absence a distinct offence on the part of the parent, 
who may be proceeded against at once, and also permits the State board of education 
more actively to engage in enforcing attendance.    
  
EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN. 
The record of active work by the agents for the enforcement of the Child-Lahor Act 
of 1886 is summarized for the year as follows:

  ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—CoNNECTICUT. 115 
Few cases of violation of the law have been discovered. These cases range all the 
way from pure accident to careless and illegal negligence. 
The law is plain and simple and easy of administration. . Noné of the evils which 
were apprehended from_ it: ge have resulted. Business has not been affected; no 
appreciable number of families have left the State; idleness has not increased; vagabond- 
age is not prevalent, and cases of hardships have not been numerous. 
‘There is no evidence that attendance at school has sensibly increased in consequence 
of the discharge of 1,173 children from eniployment. The rapacity of parents has im- 
pelled them to fulse statements concerning the ages of their children. The reports inidi- 
cate extensive, deliberate, and unqualified lying for the sole purpose of securing the 
miditey Which their children can earn. It is difficult and generally impossible to fix this 
falsification by evidence admissible in court. The result is that children are employed 
who ought not to be employed, and are out of school when they ought to be in school. 
Employés have genérally yielded cheerful obedience to thé law, assisted in its exeet- 
tion, and approved its form and principle.. The exceptions are so few that they are 
conspicuous, Deliberate and intentional evasion and deception have béen found in one 
casé only. 
      
TEACHERS. 
Sex of teachers:—The secretary gives 4 tabtilar summary of the statistics of teachers 
since 1866, from which the following conclusions are drawn: 
In the winter of 1 1 in every 100, and in summer, 5 in every 100 teachers were 
ten; in 1887, in winter 13, and in summer 11, in every 100 were men. Thenumber of 
teachers increased about one-third. 5 
In the same period the number of female teachers employed in winter increased 1,111, 
while the number of male teachers decreased 1 ‘The number of male teachers em- 
ployed in summer is larger by 230, and the number of female teachers in summer by 
771. The number of male teachers in summer shows accurately the number of male 
teachers continuously employed. It is evident that, so far as permanent situations are 
concerned, men are not giving place to womén; while more atid more districts that 
fermerly alternated in winter and summer employ women for the whole year. More- 
Over, women have entirely superseded men in primary and most grammar schools, leav- 
ing open to mén only @ small number of grammar schools, an insignificant number of 
high school positions, and substantially all the positions requiring supervisory duties, 
In uiigraded schools few men are employed, either in summer or winter. 
Nuinber continuously employed.The number continuously employed has more than 
dowbled, and the number of beginners shows a steady decrease, 
Wages of teachers. —The wages of men show fluctuations from yeat to year, being af- 
fected by the addition or subtraction of two or three large salaries to the small aggregate. 
The average wa of womien have increased, but not’ very rapidly or largely. There 
are still about 900 female teachers whose salaries are $30 a month or Jess, and of these 
500 receive $25 or less. This stizh is received for six to nine months’ service, in most 
eases for not mote than eight months. In fine, 900 teachers receive less than $240 
per year, and out of this all expénses must be paid: I will be profitable to those who 
accept poor teachers and regard poor schools as a necessity to consider the effect of such 
tieagre salaties. There is no encouragement for preparation nor for contiziuance in the 
business. ‘There is no chance for a decent living, nor any stimulus, except that of duty, 
to thoroughness of improvement. 
               
  SCHOOLS, 
Number of days of session.—There has been a steady advance in thé number of days 
séhools are in session. The average for the State is now 180 days, or 9 months in the 
year. In many towns schools are oper 10 months or 40 weeks, and a inajority of the 
children of the State can attend for this longer period. In too many districts theré are 
put 120 days or 6 months in the school year, and children cai not and do not makea 
steady progress. 
SCHOOL-HOUSES AND SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
School accommodations.—The number of school-hotisés built since 1865 is 618, which 
is moxé than one-third of the whole timber now standing. 
While the number of school-hotses reported is the same for 1867 as for 1888, there 
have in 20 years been great changes. New buildings are constantly demanded and 
erected iti cities and large towns, while in declining towns school-houses have been en- 
tirely abatidoned. 
Often two or more contiguous districts havé united und o¢eupy one school-house in- 
stead of the two or more formerly required. 
The number of sittings is greater tlian the number of scholars who enter the public 
schools. It can not be said, however, that there are ample acedinimodations for all 
children, ‘There are towns and districts where little children are wasting their timé, 
                 
-P-A-G-E-116
116 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
because too many are crowded into one room. Not more than 40 children can be seated 
and instructed in one room, if due regard is paid to health and efficient teaching. 
Especially do young children form bad habits and fail in the special work of early 
years, if they can not receive adequate attention. 
School libraries.—In the last few years the interest in libraries and books for schools 
has erent increased. The number of school libraries has increased in 4 years from 
The number of districts drawing money, from 195 to 287, and the amount 
drawn, from $3,025 to.$5,000, the limit of the State appropriation. 
‘There were more applications at the close of the last fiscal year than could be paid out 
of the appropriation for the year. 
These libraries have everywhere been of advantage to the schools. They have stimu- 
lated the scholars and aided the teachers. There is need of legislation which will make 
the benefits received from this library money permanent. There are many districts which 
have in years past drawn this money from the State and to-day have not a remnant of a 
beck or of any apparatus. There are well-known cases of misappropriation, while the 
cases of neglect and loss because of changing offices are very numerous. 
‘The gratifying advance shown in the matters of buildings and libraries is not universal. 
There are still poor school-houses and 300 districts which have never drawn library money. 
The following statement, verified by personal inspection, describes a school-house in a 
district which will neither repair nor build: ‘‘The appearance of the inside of the room 
is bad. The floor is dirty, the desks cut and unpainted, some of the seats broken so 
that they are hardly 6 inches wide, most of the plastering is off the walls and ceiling, 
and the windows are loose and dirty. The outhouse was inanawful condition. * * * 
' The door was off its hinges, and the building faced the road.”’ 
PERMANENT SCHOOL FUNDS. 
The town deposit fund—An illustration of the result of unconditional gratuities to edu- 
cation.—The amount of fund as reported for 1887 was $753,326.87: 
Invested in town securities (orders, bonds, ete.) . $528, 598. 88 Notes and mortgages Bank stock... Savings banks. Railroad and w: In State treasury. 
Cash in hands of 
758, 326. 87 
In the amount ($528,593.88) reported as invested in town securities is included a 
Jarge sum upon which towns do not make any pretence of paying interest; other con- 
siderable sums which the town officers never heard of; other sums invested in town 
farms, public buildings, etc. The reports from officers charged with the care and legal 
application of this fund unmistakably indicate that not a dollar’ thus invested in any 
sense promotes education in the common schools, as the condition of the trust requires. 
It follows that this large trust fund given upon plain conditions has been to the extent 
of these town orders and bonds entirely estranged, if not illegally diverted, from its 
original purpose. 
Of the notes secured by mortgage, a large part not accurately ascertained are worth- 
less. A few towns hold some unproductive real estate taken on foreclosure. 
In fine, five-sevenths of this fund devoted by the State and received in trust by the 
towns, if not dead, is in a profound and very unhealthy sleep. 
The interest is not a substantial sum of money which can be devoted to schools, but 
a fiction, legal or illegal, which appears on the books or not, as the town desires. 
Locai funds.—The amount of interest on local funds is reported to be $7,723.20. 
While no investigation has been made, it is probable that these funds have been ab- 
sorbed and have practically disappeared in the same manner as the town deposit fund, 
that this showing of interest is merely a method of book-keeping, and that there ac- 
ernes therefrom no real addition to the amount appropriated to public schools, 
TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION,   Text book on physiology.—The-text book of physiology and hygiene, with whose prep- 
aration the board of education was charged in 1886, was, after numerous and some- 
what troublesome delays, issued in September last. 
It was at first intended that the book should consist of two parts, one for the teacher 
and the other for the scholar. This was, for the present at least, abandoned, and the 
work was issued in a duodecimo cloth cover of 53 pages, with a series of charts for each 
school using the book.     
“TA considerable sum, perhaps $20,000, is held by town officers, awaiting investment. ‘This, when invested, would be really productive.
-P-A-G-E-117
    
ABSTRACTS OF SCHQOL REPORTS—-DAKOTA. 117 
‘In reference to the purpose of the book, one view regards the law as mainly requiring 
the teaching of “‘the effects of alcoholic liquors, stimulants, and narcotics on the human 
system.’ If this is correct, there should only be enough physiology and hygiene in the * 
book to furnish a peg on which to hang such teaching. Precisely this idea obtains in 
some quarters and finds public expression. Another view regards the law as requiring 
primarily the teaching of physiology and hygiene, but with the effects of alcoholic 
liquors, etc., more fully dwelt on than in the usual text-books for the teaching of that 
study. This view was entertained by the board in the belief that it was correct and 
that it expressed the intention of the General Assembly, which during its deliberations 
on the subject struck the word ‘‘evil’’ from the bill, which originally provided for 
teaching concerning ‘‘the evil effects of stimulants and narcotics.’’ It was the purpose 
of the board to follow faithfully the law in the preparation of the book (which duty was 
far from the desires of the members of the board) and to the best ability to set forth 
only the truth. P 
The call for books has been voluntary on the part of school officers. Thus far the 
board has not prescribed its book to the exclusion of any other. It is a noteworthy 
and gratifying fact that without such prescription the hooks have gone into all the 
towns and independent districts except six. This general distribution of the book is 
due largely to the fact that it costs nothing; but it is presumed that if the book were a 
bad one it would not be accepted. 
It is too early to pronounce a confident opinion upon the experiment. Some like the 
book and some do not. So far as can be learned, and the investigation has been im- 
partial, those who like it are more than those who do not. It is not in purpose, nor in 
methods suggested, an ordinary text-book, but many who are interested in good teach- 
ing approve its plan. 
TOWN MANAGEMENT, 
A bill was introduced at the last session of the General Assembly providing for the 
control by every town of the schools within its limits, 
ARBOR DAY. 
In 1886 the State Legislature passed an act directing the Governor to designate annu- 
ally an Arbor Day to be observed in the schools, and for economic tree planting. April 
29, 1887, was so designated. Returns have been received from 412 out of 1,424 school 
districts in the State, showing that on that day 3,432 trees and 727 shrubs were planted. 
NEW LEGISLATION, 
Child labor.—The agents appointed by the State board of education under the act of 
1886 (which forbids the employment of children under 13 years of age) are authorized 
to enforce the provisions of the law as they may be directed by the State board. 
Right of women to hold ofice.—No person shall be deemed ineligible to serve as a mem- 
ber of any board of education, school visitor, or school committee by reason of sex. 
Compulsory attendanee.—Children under 13 years of age who have attended school 24 
weeks of the preceding 12 months, and children between 13 and 14 who have attended 
school 12 weeks within the preceding 12 months, and children over 14 years of age 
shall not be required to attend school during all the school year, provided they are law- 
fully employed to labor at home or elsewhere. 
Any parent who fails to have his children attend school regularly during the entire 
school year, except when they are excused as above, and except when the child is desti- 
tute of suitable clothing, or is mentally or physically unfit to receive instruction, shall 
be subject to a penalty of $5 for each week’s failure. 
Attendance at private schools shall not be regarded as compliance with the provisions 
of the law requiring attendance at school unless the person in charge of such school 
shall make reports to the State board of education similar in form to those required from 
the public schools.1

  DAKOTA. 
[From Report of Superintendent H. A. Dye, 1886-87.] 
‘Dakota has passed the timeof phenomenal growth, asshown inamore numerous popu- 
lation and increasing number of school-houses and an enlarged taxation for the support 
of the schools. She must now be content with a slower growth than has characterized   
1 “Tt has been difficult for many years to obtain full statistics of private schools, and the method adopted in this statute, while perhaps displeasing to many, is yet one brought about by necessity, in order that the authorities may get more accurate notions as to the amount of schooling which is being given to the children of the State.”—(Hartford School Report, 1886-87, p. 31.)
-P-A-G-E-118
      SEB: 5 EDUCATION REPORT, 1986-87. 
her progressin the decade closing with 1885, as shown in these tangibleresults; butthough | 
slower in these directions, it does not argue that there is not a substantial and certain 
grtoyth in the educational affairs of the Territory. ‘The statistics herewith reported pre- 
sent a very healthful growth, but the most important results of school work can not be 
' tabulated nor presented in statistics. As the excitements that usually attend rapid set- 
tlements and. material development in a measure subside, men are disposed to attend 
more and more to the immaterial affairs of life. We already have ample evidence of 
this change in the rapidly multiplying private and sectarian schools; in the anxiety 
which men manifest to secure the establishment of these schools near to. their homes, 
and in an awakening interest in the real progress.and work of the school. The past year 
has been fruitful in new schools, and we may safely assert that education has shared 
fully in the general prosperity, and in the steady development of the Territory it has 
more than held its own. The people of Dakota generally have a lively, if not an enthu- 
siastic, interest in the schools and education. ‘They are demanding better schools and 
are liberally voting taxes upon themselves for the purpose of providing and supporting 
them. The children are kept more continuously and regularly at school, the best teach- 
ers are being sought and employed, and the length of terms is gradually increasing. In 
many of the counties it is with the greatest difliculty that a teacher without a special 
training for her work can find employment. Normal schools are increasing in number 
and efficiency. The demand for more numerous opportunities to obtain a professional 
training for the work of teaching was met by the last Li ture in an act authorizing 
the appointment of certain schools to give a normal training at the expense of the Ter- 
ritory. The creation of the Territorial board of education, by increasing the number of 
persons in the educational department, has made that department more prompt and effi- 
cient, and enables it to perform all of its duties and to have more time to unify and sys- 
tematize the educational work. The county supervision is becoming very efficient. 
The increase of school interests has, in the first place, made it necessary to secure capa- 
ble men for the office of county superintendent, and the increasing wealth of the people 
has, in thesecond place, made it possible tosecure them, There ate numerous instances 
where men of eminent ability and of extended experience in the school work of our 
Eastern States are now superintendents of some of our counties, School men are being 
sought for these positions and are generally chosen.”

“The foregoing table shows somewhat of the remarkable growth make by Dakota and 
~ her school system during the twelve years beginning with 18 x ng with 1887. 
Not only do these figures show a vast increase in the school population, and a consequent 
increase in the number enrolled, but it shows that in proportion to the whole number a 
larger per cent. of the children are enrolled in the schools, and further that those enrolled 
are attending more regularly than in thé forepart of the period covered by these statistics. 
In 1875 only 53 per cent. of the children of school were enrolled in the schools and 
the same per cent. in 1879. In 1883 the per cent. ased to 62, while the report 
of 1887 shows that 79 per cent. of the school population attended school for the whole 
or part of the year. During the year 1879 only 25 per cent. of the school population 
were in regular attendance at school. ‘The per cent. of the population attending regu- 
larly in 1883 increased to 37, while in 1887 we make the magnificent showing of 53 per 
cent, attending every day for the whole term of 112 days. In this respect Dakota 
leads nearly all of the States. 
“The whole number of teachers has increased from 208 in 1875 to 4,924 in 1887, but the 
average wages for the same period show a slight decrease for the male teachers, while the 
wages of the female teachers have increased from in 1875 to $30.36 in 1887.

for every 40 pupils of school age, and in 1887 there is one school for every 28 of the children 
of schoolage. These figures explain in part the more general and regular attendance dur- 
ing the last years of the period, but only in part. Much of the increase in the attendance 
is doubtless due to the increase in the wealth of the people. Many parents in the early 
days were compelled to keep their children at home to work in various capatities on the 
farm. The steady prosperity of these years has given many more of the comforts of life, 
and has enabled parents not only to do withont-the service of the children, but to provide 
them with books and clothing necessary to attend the schools. ‘The real “object and best 
results of the public school will be most nearly realized in that community where the 
largest proportion of the population comes most directly under the influence of the school. 
Tn these items Dakota bears comparison with any of the older States of the East, which 
surely argues that she has accomplished much in the few years since the organization of 
her school system. 
COMPARISON WITH OTHER STATES. 
“*Probably no State or Territory in thé Union has had such a remarkable growth as 
Dakota. Surely none have ac complished so much.in the same period of time; indeed, 
many have not accomplished as much in much longer time. What we have done is 
shown in our growth; what we are is best shown in comparison with other States. In 
school population Dakota leads Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, 
Oregon, Khode Island, Vermont, and all of the Territorie: 
“Tn the number of her teachers Dakota is ahead of A: as, California, Connécticut,’ 
Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Hamp- 
shire, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, and West Virginia. 
* Dakota has more days of school than Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, 
New Hampshire, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, or 
any of the Territories, except Arizona and Utah. 
“Tn the value of her school property Dakota exceeds all of the States and Territories, 
except California, Connecticut, Mlinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, ;Masachnestts, Michi- 
gan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. 
In the amount of expenditures for the support of the public oe ‘Dakota is in the 
lead of the same list, including Connecticut.’? 
‘When it is considered that Dakota’s population is scattered over such a wide area, 
that she is supposed to be more unfavorably situated as to her climate, and that her soil 
has, until a few years ago, been useless as maintaining civilized life, this feature ofthe 
report is perhaps the most surprising to those unfamiliar with the work of education in 
this Territory, and the most satisfactory to those interested in the educational progress 
of Dakota.    
       
             
      RECENT SCHOOL LEGISLATION, 
‘There has been for some time a demand for a new school law or a considerable re- 
vision of the ones in force in the past. The Li ture of 1887 undertook to revise the 
law, or rather to make a new law. The main fea i 
satisfactory to the people, but the same may be said of the law of 1883, which was re- 
pealed by this.act. The demand for a change was more for a change in a few of the 
minor features of the law, and for harmony in the territorial system. It may be doubt- 
fal whether, in th®se respects, the new law has accomplished what it was intended to 
accomplish. Heretofore, seventy-one of the counties were operated under the township 
system, and were known as the township counties ; fifteen counties were operated un- 
der the district system; and besides these two systems there were many towns, cities, 
and villages operated under special or general acts passed by various Legislatures. The 
new law does not aim to harmonize these systems, but simply takes the place of the 
Jaw of 1883 in the seventy-one counties to whieh the latter applied. It does, however, 
provide a general law for the organization of nen and cities as independent ‘schools.     
   
    ““The law of 1887 has made considerable chayee in the organization and administration 
of the school system of the Territory. The general supervision and control of public in- 
struction is vested in a Territorial board of education consisting of three members ap- 
pointed by the Governor. The Territorial superintendent is a member of the board and 
its chairman, and when the board is not in session the other members are assistant su- 
perintendents. The members of this board at present are Eugene A. Dye, of Mellette, 
superintendent; George A. McFarland, of Scotland, secretary; and Frank A. Wilson, of 
Bathgate, vice-president. This board prescribes the rules for all institutes and exami- 
nations, prepares all examination questions, grants Territorial certificates, provides for 
the printing of the law and of all blanks and reports, directs the superintendents of 
counties in their work, and makes annual report to the Governor. ‘The township or- 
ganization is somewhat changed. Each school has a representative upon the township 
school board, and each school district has definite fixed boundaries. The township 
school board is by law required to grade teachers’ wages according to the grade of cer- 
tificate held. The county superintendent of schools is now to be elected in June instead

of at the general election in November. The number of subjects upon which teachers 
are examined has been increased by the addition of physiology and hygiene for all grades 
of certificates, and of algebra, geometry, natural philosophy, civil government, physical 
geography, book-keeping, and theory and practice for those who desire the first-grade 
certificate. The Territorial board of education is authorized to designate ten auxiliary 
normal schools, and provision is made whereby the township school board may establish 
and maintain a high school for the township at its expense. 
FINANCES. 
“The financial condition of most of our school corporations is very good. The amount 
of outstanding warrants is not large, and they are good for their face value and are easily 
» sold at asmall discount. The school bonds find ready sale at their par value, and in 
many instances are sold above par. The unpaid warrants draw interest at 8 per cent., 
and the bonds vary from 7 to 8 per cent. Theinterest on bonds is usually paid promptly 
when due, and the bonds are in most counties cancelled at maturity. 
“Taxation for the support of common schools is of four kinds: (1) The county clerk 
at the time of making the annual assessment levies a tax-of $1 upon each elector; (2) 
at the same time he levies an additional tax of 2 mills upon each dollar of taxable prop- 
erty in the county, and the fund raised by these two is apportioned to the children of 
‘school age resident thereof as shown by the last school census; (3) a township tax not 
exceeding 3 per cent. of the taxable property of the township is levied by the township 
board for the support of the schools of the township; (4) the patrons of any given school 
may meet in what is known as a subdistrict meeting and vote an additional tax upon 
their own property for the support of the school of their own subdistrict. The tax lev- 
ied for schools is spread upon the tax list by the county clerk the same as levies for other 
purposes, and the taxes are collected by the county treasurer. The funds raised by 
county taxation are apportioned by the county superintendent to the several corpora- 
tions in the county in the proportion before mentioned. The money is drawn from the 
county treasury by the several township treasurers, and is by them paid out upon orders 
from the township clerk.”’ 
SCHOOL LANDS. 
“The subject of the school lands is one of great interest to the people of Dakota, but 
owing to the fact that these lands are still held in trust by the National Government, 
there is very little definite information concerning them among the people. The edu- 
cational department not having any authority in cases in which they are involved has 
not taken the time from numerous other duties to make inquiry about their condition 
or value. The reports have often come to the Department, and complaints have been 
made that the school lands were being quite generally cultivated in some parts of the 
Territory, that valuable timber was being taken from those sections where it is growing, 
and that the lands were otherwise being despoiled. The complainants have been informed 
that the Department has no jurisdiction, but the complaints becoming more frequent of 
late, the Department determined to send out circulars of inquiry concerning school lands, 
and so far reports have been made from seventy counties, and from these reports the fol- 
lowing information has been gleaned: Itshows thatin several localities there are persons 
that care more for present gain than. for the future of the school fuypd. The danger is 
that if the tendency to cultivate and occupy these lands is not checked, there will beso 
strong a sentiment in certain parts of the Territory in favor of the settler on school lands, 
that it will have a controlling influence in State legislation on this important question of 
the disposal of the lands—an influence that will be to the advantage of the settler and 
in favor of a great public wrong. Every crop removed from the land diminishes the 
value when put upon the market, and the cultivation of them ought to be in some way 
regulated if Dakota is to receive her generous gift in all its fair proportions. The sev- 
enty counties reporting have a total of 3,684 sections of school Jand, or 2,347,760 acres. 
The average value of the land, if put upon the market at the present time, is $5.50 per 
acre, as estimated in the different counties. At this rate a fund of $12,912,680 would 
be realized from the sale of lands in seventy of the counties.”

[From Report of State Superintendent T. N. Williams, 1884-86.] 
GROWTH OF THE FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
A survey of the educational work in Delaware reveals the undeniable fact of real prog- 
ress. No State in the Union,-according to the belief of Superintendent Williams, is 
developing more rapidly its educational interests thanis Delaware. ‘‘ Gladly we survey 
the results of patient years of growth and look hopefully to the future. Our district 
 
-P-A-G-E-121

ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL’ REPORTS—DELAWARE. 121 
schools are improved, and all of our towns are seen to vie with each other in the elegant 
and commodious buildings to be found all over the State. It affords me satisfaction to 
bear testimony to the fact that the prejudice against free schools is fast giving way, and 
the people are beginning to look upon them as the surest and only means by which a 
Jarge portion of the rising generation can ever hope to acquire an education sufficient to 
fit them for intelligent citizenship. As the schools of every community answer to local 
public opinion, their success must depend on the sympathy and appreciation of the peo- 
ple. We can not go ahead of publicsentiment, but we can endeavor to make it a correct 
one. Of one thing weare assured, our schools are taking year by year stronger hold upon 
the affections of the people. Our work is‘but begun. A complete, well-organized sys- 
tem may be yet far in the future, but I believe it is there, and though we may be long 
in reaching a perfect system, we are constantly attaining to a better one.” 
  SCHOOL ACCOMMODATIONS, 
During the last two years something over $125,000 have been spent in the erection 
and improvement of school buildings in different parts of the State. Many convenient 
and attractive houses may now be seen scattered through the rural districts, evidencing | 
an enlightened regard for the public welfare, and assuring the intellectual and moral 
elevation of the young. In the towns and larger villages, structures of a higher order of 
architecture have been erected and furnished in a style to adapt them to the most ap- 
proved methods of teaching. Apparatus, black-boards, globes, maps, charts, and what- 
ever else experience has proved to be useful in the work of instruction, have been sup- 
plied with a liberal hand. These are exponents of a degree and kind of public intelli- 
gence that apprehends the sources of prosperity and power; but there are some sections 
in which the accommodations provided for the education of children are poor, very poor. 
In some localities have been found pupils sitting on seats that seemed designed for en- 
gines of torture or instruments for effecting a permanent deformity. 
AGRICULTURE, 
The desire manifested by many throughout the State to have taught in the public 
schools some practical study on the subject of agriculture meets the hearty approval of 
Superintendent Williams, The State board of education has been unable to procure a 
suitable book for that purpose; but in a short time this study will probably form an 
important feature of the student’s work, 
SCHOOL LIBRARIES. 
Special efforts have been made during the year to have school libraries established in 
connection with the school, and in several localities they have been attended with suc- 
cess, There are already several districts supplied with good school libraries, 
EXAMINATION OF TEACHERS. 
During the past year 621 candidates have appeared for examination; 473 candidates 
have secured certificates, and 148 have been rejected. Life certificates have been issued. 
to7. The oral and written methods in examinations are still employed. The standard 
has been raised from year to year to satisfy the increasing demand for thoroughly com- 
petent teachers, while the questions have been of a plain and practical character. It can. 
not be denied that teachers under the system of examination made use of show marked 
improvement from year to year, and many of them produce good results in their respective 
school rooms. The essentials which go to make an efficient teacher are various, many 
of which can be known only by actual observations in the school room. The superin- 
tendents have constantly endeavored to impress upon the minds of the school commission- 
ers that literary attainments are not the only essentials of a successful teacher, and that 
their duties do not cease ‘‘with the mere looking at”? the teacher’s certificate. Time 
is required to show the unfitness of a teacher who evinced competency upon examina- 
tion. Indifferent teachers are being gradually eliminated and efficient ones substituted. 
This can not be accomplished instantly, but will be done, it is not doubted, as fast as is 
consistent with the rights of the teachers and the good of the schools. 
FREE TEXT-BOOKS AND LIBRARY BOOKS. 
_ Superintendent Williams expresses himself as of the opinion that the time has come 
when the State would furnish text-books free to pupils. He also recommends that an act 
be passed requiring the superintendent to farnish to the clerk of each school district, at 
cost price, a library of text-books sufficient to meet the wants of the school, and that the 
same be charged to the district, and that the amount be deducted from the school divi- 
dend by the auditor in his settlement with the clerk of the district. t

THE STUDY OF SCIENTIFIC TEMPERANCE. 
[From Act passed April 12, 1887.] ‘ 
‘Provision shall be made immediately upon the passage of this act by the school com- 
missioners and local school boards for instructing all pupils in all public schools receiv- 
ing aid from the school fund of the State, in physiology and hygiene with special reference 
to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system, such 
instruction to be given orally in primary schools where pupils can not read. 
‘No certificate shall be granted any person to teach in the public schools of the State 
of Delaware after the first day of January, eighteen hundred and eighty-eight, who has 
not passed a satisfactory examination in physiology and hygiene, with special reference 
to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system.’? 
SCHOOLS OF NEW CASTLE COUNTY, 1886-87. 
-Superintendent Bessey, of New Castle County, writes to the Bureau that the schools 
of that county are in a prosperous condition. The school dividends are greater than 
ever before. Several beautiful and commodious school houses have been erected and 
supplied with modern furniture. The school apparatus is generally good, and the teach- 
ers are enthusiastic, active, and progressive.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
[Report of 1886-387.] 
SCHOOL ACCOMMODATIONS, 
Although the seven new buildings provided for at the last session of Congress have rer | 
lieved to a considerable extent the lack of school accommodations, still it will require 
another and at least as liberal an appropriation for the same PuTROSE to afford accommo- 
dation equal to the growing needs of the schools. 
Many rooms were rented for school purposes during the past year; yet these failed to 
meet'the demand for more room, so that one-third of the white schools and considerably 
more than one-half of the colored schools were restricted to half-day exercises. -As re- 
gards the character of the rooms rented, Superintendent Powell says in his report to the 
board of trustees: ‘Your attention is called to the fact that it is yet necessary to rent 
many rooms to accommodate the growing demands of the schools, Nearly all of these 
rooms also are unfit for school purposes. In many cases they are dark, small, and in- 
convenient. In nearly all cases they are without means of ventilation, Teachers can 
not do good work in them; therefore the work of the school suffers, but the greatest 
objection to these rooms is that the health of the pupils is constantly endangered. Both 
teachers and pupils work to a disadvantage and in constant danger. Epidemics find in 
these places food for fearful ravages. The influence of such environments upon the 
spirits and of such atmosphere upon the yital organs is a constant depression, and can 
but be pernicious.” 
HALE-DAY SCHOOLS, 
And in regard to half-day schools: ‘A half-day'at school ‘is enough for a first or 
second grade pupil, if the school is not well taught or is in an unhealthful, uncomfort- 
able, or uninviting school room. These conditions, however, ought not to exist. The 
school room should be commodious, well lighted and well ventilated, clean and whole 
       
-P-A-G-E-124
    124 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
some, and not overcrowded. Our teachers are competent to teach well, and where 
opportunity is given do teach well. The children who go to school in the afternoon are 
tired because of too much play in the forenoon. It has been the custom in the middle 
of the year to change the afternoon schools to forenoon schools, and vice versa. Thus 
has the condition of all the primary schools changed in the middle of the year. The 
progress of the children has thereby been greatly impaired. 
‘‘Every child who goes to school should havea desk of his own and should not be 
forced to give it up to some one, he knows not whom, for half the day. The greater 
part of the moral effect of school life is lost to the child by the half-day school. 
“*Manual training begins in the kindergarten and should be continued in the primary 
school, but the child in the half-day school has no time to draw, to make forms of clay, 
or by folding and cutting paper, or by laying sticks or other means, has no time to rep- 
resent forms. His time must be spent in committing to memory that which he may or 
may not understand, because the scholastic grade work must be done. 
“Education should accomplish the best possible mental, moral, and physical good to 
the child, especially during the first few years of the formative period of his life. In 
half-day schools no moral lessons can be wrought in the presence of the child and im- 
pressed upon him. There isn’t time. The teacher must dictate. Thus the moral les- 
sons the child gets at school are the simple ipse dixit of one who is almost a stranger to 
him. The child can not be developed mentally by self-activity, or gain knowledge by 
investigation under the direction of the teacher. There isn’t time. The teacher must 
dictate and the child must memorize what is dictated whether he understands it or not— 
not to say whether he knows it to be true or not. He can not be trained systematically 
in the use of eye and hand, or be given exercises for rest and physical development. 
There isn’t time. The lessons must be learned, and the desks must be cleared out that 
other children may come and in turn be filled with facts for examination day. That 
healthy, mental, moral, and physical growth that can come to childhood only by wisely 
directed, systematic, pleasing, and conscious self-activity can not be realized in a half- 
day school. That pure, natural, and earnest love for truth and knowledge is never 
known by the child who receives without question or investigation doses of facts as from 
the hands of one who has diagnosed and prescribed without explanation. Most of our 
teachers can do the legitimate work of the primary school properly, but they complain 
that the half-day school does not afford the time for doing it, and their complaint is well 
founded. Little time is allowed for calisthenic exercises, for games, for songs, and repe- 
tition of mottoes; but all effort must be directed to accomplishing the grade work that 
can be done only by a continued pouring in, and a nervous, hurried, and too often mean- 
ingless memory drill, No one knows this better than the conscientious teacher, and no 
one speaks of it more frequently or more feelingly. That such memoriter work can be 
found in the schools is too true. That such work is found in the schools is not the fault 
of the teacher who is forced to do work on the half-time allotment. If we would have 
more and better training in school and fewer home lessons to be studied by our small 
children, we must give more time and better opportunity to do the work.” 
      ENUMERATION OF SCHOOL POPULATION. 
No enumeration of the children of school age has been made since 1880. Superin- 
tendent Powell recommends that “‘ provision should be made for ascertaining biennially, 
if not annually, (a) the number of children of school age residing in the District; (b) the 
number of such children attending private and parochial schools, and (¢) the number of 
such children not attending any school, together with the reasons for non-attendance.”’ 
CHARACTER OF ATTENDANCE. 
It isa general rule in all public school systems that the attendance falls off rapidly 
from the iower to the higher grades, The white schools of the District of Columbia form 
an exception in this regard. The attendance in the lower grades, as compared with the 
population of school-going age, is fully equal to that of the most favored cities; yeta large 
percentage of these pupils continue on through the higher grades, nearly half of them, 
in fact, through the entire eight grades. Thus, in the first six divisions, embracing the 
white schools of the District; there were enrolled in the first grade 3,378 pupils; inthe 
second, 2,729; in the third, 2,904; in the fourth, 3,097, and in the fifth, 3,013; while in 
the sixth there were 2,294; in the seventh, 1,689, and in the eighth 1,399. The enrol- 
mentin the High School was 827. 
In the schools for colored children there is a diminished attendance as the grades as- 
cend, more in accordance with the statistics of other cities. Thus, during the past year, 
the number of colored children in attendance in the first grade was 4,720; in the second, 
2,293; in the third, 1,508; in the‘fourth, 1,267; in the fifth, 868; in the sixth, 546; in 
the seventh, 350; and in the eighth, 220, with 276 in the High School. 
The trustees, in their report, explain this peculiarity, as follows: ‘‘The attendance in 
the primary grades, as compared with the population of school-going age, is equal to 
    
   
-P-A-G-E-125
ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—-FLORIDA. | 125 
that of the most favored of our sister cities. But the absence of large manufacturing 
and other industrial enterprises deprives us of a class of pupils common to other cities, 
whose educational privileges are usually limited to the lowest or primary grades. With 
fewer accumulations of large fortunes, the wealth of the District is more equally dis- 
tributed-than in most large cities; and with us the average citizen is able to afford to 
his children opportunity to take the full course of instruction provided in the public 
schools. The result and the conditions which give rise to it are matters of congratula- 
tion to the community, and can not fail to be gratifying to all friends of education.” 
PAY OF TEACHERS. ’ 
The board of trustees earnestly recommends a substantial increase in the salaries of 
teachers. This class of public servants occupies a most responsible position, calling for 
intelligence, culture, manual dexterity, tact and delicacy in management, sympathy, 
patience, gentleness, fidelity, and other qualities of the highest order; their influence is 
all powerlw good or evil; yet their wages, as compared with that of laborers, door- 
keepers, ete., is so low as to draw the following just observations from the board: 
“The salary of messengers throughout the Departments of the Government is fixed by 
Congress at $840 per annum—that of what are known as assistant messengers is $720 per 
annum; while the average salary of the cultivated men and women who constitute the 
teachers of our public schools is limited to $670 per annum, or only $10 per annum more 
than that of a laborer in the Departments. All reside in the same community and sub- 
ject to the same general conditions which regulate the cost of the necessaries of life. 
‘That the average salary thus allowed teachers is, in the city of Washington, barely ade- 
quate to the comfortable and decent support of a single person occupying that position 
in life, and that it affords no possible margin for provision for sickness or old age, to say 
nothing of the maintenance of a family, must be apparent, not only to every citizen, but 
to every temporary sojourner in our midst. 
‘Whatever difference may exist upon other subjects, the board feels that it represents 
the entire community in expressing its regret at the remarkable discrimination against 
this most important, useful, and meritorious body of workers above pointed out. Nor 
is it for a moment believed, if only its attention to the subject can be secured, that the 
Congress of the United States will accord inferior considerations and recompense to the 
educating class, the teachers of our.public schools, than to others, whose duties are neither 
so important nor exacting, whose qualifications are of a less difficult order, and to whom 
the cost of living certainly is not greater.”’ 
No less than four of the High School teachers resigned last June to accept more remu- 
nerative positions in private schools, showing that the salaries are too low to command 
the services of the best teachers. 
PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE. 
It is believed that this subject was taught in compliance with the spirit as well as with 
the letter of the law prescribing it.

  FLORIDA. 
[From Report for 1886-87 of State Superintendent A, J. Russell.] 
There has been a steady growth of interest throughout the State in the public schools, 
a constant advance in their efficiency, while a most healthful esprit de corps animates 
the teachers as a rule, a result of which is that much better work has been accom- 
plished. Patrons are becoming more identified with the schools and manifest a deep 
and lively interest in their encouragement and success. 
It can be safely said there are but few children who live in isolated places now in the 
State to whom the door of the school is hot opened without fee or hindrance, of any 
race or condition of the population, and there is every reason for believing there are 
comparatively very few of the youth of school age who are not able to read. 
Every county in the State, even the most remote and isolated, is organized and has 
its public schools in operation. The six new counties created’ by the last Legislature 
have been organized and started off upon their work at the beginning of the school 
year, October 1, with less friction than could possibly have been expected, reflecting 
great credit upon the officers selected to manage the affairs of the schools in those coun- 
ties. 
A convention of the county superintendents was held in February. Eighteen of the _ 
thirty-nine were present, and the conference, and comparison of work, the manner of 
superintendence of the county schools, the difficulties encountered and the impediments

existing and how overcome, made this meeting of county superintendents most profit. . 
able and pleasant, every one present expressing great gratification. 
The iticrease in the number of schools is very gratifying, also the increase in the num- 
ber of teachers employed. New and neat comfortable school-howses have been built all 
over the State; new and modern improved sittings have been supplied, and much closer 
attention is giveti in many parts of the State to the hygiene, ventilation, and light of the 
school-room and grotinds. 
COUNTY HIGH SCHOOLS, 
_ County high schools, or graded schools, have been established and are in successful 
opetation in several countiés and are doing an excellent work. Notably among the 
counties having these schools aré Dtval at Jacksonville, Jefferson at Monticello and 
Watikeenah, Madison at Madison, Nassau at Fernandina, Saint John’s at Saint Augus- 
tine, Escambia at Pensacola, Hillsborough at Tampa, and Columbia at Lake City. 
These are county schools, open to any pupil who may advancé to such grade as is re- 
gain to enter the high school, from any county school, thus affording an opportunity 
all the people of the county who desire a High School course for their children. 
It is nimed to make these schools intensely practical and useful. In addition to the 
ranches ustially taught in high schools, a business course, embracing book-keeping and 
business rules, is taught, and normal instruction is given and practice work is afforded 
im the school in teaching, resulting in giving some of the best, brightest, and freshest 
young teachers we have in the work. These are in most case’ employed as assistants 
under older teachers, and are thus matiired in the work. i 
There are no city schools exclusive as in some of the States; each coutity is & school 
district tinder the government of a board of public instruction, consisting of five niem- 
bers, who are appointed by the State board of education, and ate made a cotporate body 
by the law; and also a county superintendent; and all the schools are county schools, 
whether in cities and towns or not, and are uiider the saine government, 
     
  
ARBOR DAY. 
On the 10th of February, 1887, Arbor Day was almost universally observed with great 
enthusiasm ahd pleasure and profit. The schools, as well as the patrons, look forward 
in each recurring year for the coming of Arbor Day, and all commend the introduction 
of its observance as full of blessing and profitable instruction, and desire most heartily 
its perpetuation. 
Three hundred and four schools are reported as participating, and 5,129 trees were 
planted.

The session of the Legislature which closed on October 20, 1887, passed an act revising 
and consolidating the school law. Among the changes to which Superintendent Orr has 
called attention are the following : 
Apportionment of the school fuid.—The apportionment of the school fund no longer has 
to be laid before the Governor. Time has effected a change in the provision of the old 
law for including Confederate soldiers under thirty years of age in the school population, 
and the change thus made is ‘recognized in the Act by omitting them from its provi- 
sions. s 
Expenses of State school commissioners.—The provision of the old law which made the    
State school commissioner pay his own board and hotel bills when travelling on official 
business is omitted. ‘ 
County school boards. —Members of county school boards are made exempt from road, 
militia, and jury duty, and are to receive no other compensation. 
Schools. —One school must be established in every sub-district for white pupils and one 
for colored pupils, ‘‘ where the population of the two races is sufficient,’’ and no addi- 
tional school can be established in the sub-district without an enrolment therein of not 
Jess than twenty-five pupils. The schools must be as near ‘‘ the centre of the sub-school 
districts as can be conveniently arranged, reference being had to any school-house al- 
ready erected and population of said sub-school district, and to the location of white 
and colored schools with regard to contiguity.’’ The power to change district lines re- 
mains intact. 
Text-books.—There shall be no change in the books adopted for a term of five years, 
save by a three-fourths vote of all the board. This would require the concurrence of

fout members. Should a teacher allow a pupil to use. any other than the prescribed 
books, he can not receive pay from the public fund for that pupil. 
Qualifications of county school conmissioners:—Applicants for the office of county school 
commissioners must submit to an examination by the president of the board, or by some 
one appointed by him, or bythe board for that purpose. This examination is by means 
of questions furnished by the State school commissioner and is on the subjects taught in 
the common schools, ‘‘ upon the science and theory of common school teaching and gov- 
ernment, and upon such other subjects as the State school commissioner may deem 
propet.” ‘‘The said county board of education shall then elect such applicant county 
school commissioner who has stood satisfactory examination, taking into consideration 
the moral character, business qualifications and general availability of each applicant.’’ 
Examination of teachers.—A new branch is added to those formerly examined upon, viz: 
“The science and practice of teaching in common sthools,’’ and the questions are to be 
prepared and furnished to the county school commissioners by the State school commis- 
sioner. He also instructs as to the grading of applicants, and fixes ‘‘ the lowest standard 
for cach class of licenses.’? County school commissioners grade the applicants according 
to the State school commissioner’s instructions and submit to the board a written re- 
port and recommendation. The board licenses, provided the applicants obtain the low- 
est mark fixed for the several grades by the State schodl commissioner. Evidence of 
good moral character is required to be submitted in writing. Fourth-grade licenses are 
abolished. The Act requires the State school commissioner to fix a ‘‘day, or days,’ for 
the examination of all teachers throughout the State. The county school commissioner 
is to give notice of the day (not days)on which examinations are to be had. No teacher 
ean be examined at any other time except on affidavit that ‘‘he or she was providen- 
tially hindered from being present onthe general examination day, or days, and has not 
seen or been informed of the contents of the general question papers.’’? Papers of un-= 
usual merit may be forwarded tothe State school cominissioner, with an indorsement by 
the county school commissioner of the author’s good moral and professional character. 
Upon these papers the State school commissioner may issue a permanent State license, 
revocable for ‘‘good and sufficient cause’? by him only. 
Co-education of white and colored pupils.—‘* No teacher receiving or teaching white and 
colored pupils in the same school shall be allowed any compensation at all out of the 
common school fund.’’ 
‘* Ambulatory schools’? abolished. —The provision of the old law petmittinga two months’ 
school term instead of three in sparsely settled districts, the terms being so arranged 
that the same teachers might serve in two or more schools, has been rescinded. 
Attempted legislation. —A nuinber of bills to inereasé the school revenues were intro- 
duced, prominent among which was one to levy an annual tax of one-tenth of one per 
cent. upon the taxable property of the State for the support of common schools; it did 
not pass, however, and the sources of the State school revenue remain practically as 
before, nearly stationary, while the number of school children is contiaually increasing. 
Superintendent Orr says, however, that there was a stronger feeling in the House in favor 
of increasing the school fund than there has been for a long time. r

[Report of Superintendent Moody, 1886-87.] 
SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
“Our school system is that commonly known as the ‘eommon-school plan,’ designed 
to give all resident children an education in the elementary branches, and is similar in 
character to that in many of the Eastern States. 
“The school officers consist of a Territorial superintendent of public instruction, a 
county superintendent of schools in each county, and a board of three school trustees in 
each district.” 
NEW SCHOOI-HOUSES. 
“T think that all is being done tliat can be reasonably expected of districts in the 
parts of the Territory remote from markets and transportation, in the matter of erecting 
school houses. In what may be ternied the new communities, the lands are not yet 
patented, and only the improvements and personal property of the settler are placed 
upon the assessment roll and subject to taxation for school-house purposes, so that until 
such time as the land is patented and the assessment roll shall show the true value of 
each man’s property in the district, we can not expect that much will be accomplished 
except what may be done by voluntary subscription. It is a matter of regret that very 
many districts are obliged to use structures erected and owned by religious societies, in     
   
-P-A-G-E-128
    128 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
default of owning school houses of their own. No district should be placed at the mercy 
of any religious society, or be compelled to keep its school in any building not owned 
or controlled by the trustees,” 
THE MORMON COUNTIES, 
“Much trouble has been experienced, and more is to be apprehended, in connection 
with the problem presented under the existing laws of the Territory and the sentiments 
of the members of the organization known as ‘The Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day 
Saints,’ hostile to the carrying out of the provisions of the law applicable to the public 
schools. 
“The board of school trustees is composed of three members, one of whom goes out 
of office and his successor is elected on the first Monday of September in each year, in 
each district. Among other requirements of the law, each incoming trustee takes an 
official oath in which is embodied the test oath annexed to this report. 
“Tn certain portions of Bear Lake, Bingham, Cassia, and Oneida Counties there are 
school districts in which there are no ‘ Gentiles’ eligible either for election or appointment 
as trustees. The entire community is ‘Mormon.’ No ‘Mormon’ can take the official 
oath without danger of conviction of perjury. Hence but two trustees remain in office 
in such districts. Next year there will be but one trustee, and where there is but one 
trustee the schools can not be carried on. In many districts, I am informed, the latter 
is the case already arising from the fact of vacancies caused by death or removal of one 
of the trustees prior to the last election. 
“The school superintendents of the above-named counties (except of Bear Lake) have, 
in the discretion given them by law, held that a person who belongs to an organization 
which teaches things defined by our statutes to be crimes, as a matter of performance 
of a religious duty. is not a law-abiding citizen or a person of good moral character, and 
therefore they refuse to license any member of that organization to teach in our public 
schools. The ‘Mormons,’ represented by the reputed leaders of their organization, have- 
notified this office that in cases where ‘ Gentile’ teachers are employed, they will not per- 
mit their children to attend the public school, but will either cause schools to be started 
by subscription, wherein their children can be under the instruction of ‘Mormon’ 
teachers, or else keep their children at home. 
‘The issue seems to be, either that the schools of Idaho, in those districts, shall be 
subject to the control and supervision of the priesthood of the so-called ‘Mormon’ 
church, or else that they must be closed. Their leaders set up no reasonable excuse 
for this demand or threat, nor do they allege that ‘Gentile’ teachers endeavor to enforce 
any sectarian, political, or denominational doctrines in the schools which their children 
attend. 
“From an extended and patient investigation I am satisfied that the real reason why 
they do not wish their children to attend non-Mormon and non-sectarian public schools 
is, that they do not wish them taught that obedience to the law of the land is one of 
the evidences of good citizenship, or that acts which the ‘Mormon’ church denominates 
a religious duty or privilege are, in fact, crimes against the law of the land, and that 
they fear that under the instruction of non-sectarian teachers the rising generation, 
which is now taught by the priesthood that violators of the law when punished are 
‘martyrs for conscience sake,’ may learn the contrary to be true. 
“So faras I am advised, every effort has been made by the superintendents to keep the 
schools open in accordance with the law. It is a matter of deep regret that the innocent 
children must be made to suffer for the fanaticism and disloyalty of their parents. 
With every sentiment and desire to extend the facilities and advantages of a non-secta- 
rian public school education to all the children, without regard to the religious or politi- 
cal creeds of the parents, existing among those “who have the general supervision of the 
schools and the administration of the Jaw, the responsibility for the continuance of blind 
faith in the leadership of an organization teaching crime to be duty, and for the preva- 
lence of ignorance in the years to come among those who should now be studying in the 
public schools, but who are not because of the hostility of their parents, must rest upon 
the infatuated fathers and mothers of the children upon whose future they invoke the 
curse of i ignorance, and not upon school officers who would help the children to knowl- 
edge.’ 
: TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
“ “The Act of Congress approved May 20, 1886, concerning the teaching of the effects 
of alcoholic drinks and narcotics upon the human system, has been complied with except   
1Tn a letter to this Office under date of December 13, 1887, Superintendent Moody says upon this int: “Tam happy to say that reports from two of the counties where the trouble had arisen show that the Mormons are taking a more sensible view of the situation. It isan unfortunate and bitter finht, bnt we propose to make Americans of the rising generation in spite of the priesthood’s efforts 
to the contrary.”

  in a few instances. As a general rule the law has met with but little opposition. In 
my judgment the terms of the first section of the act are too severe, and if a strict con- 
struction be put upon the language thereof, it will beimpossible to comply literaily with 
thelaw. Strictly construed, it requires achild tostudy hygiene and. the nature and effects 
of alcoholic drinks and narcotics by the use of text-books before the child can read. 
‘By Act of the last Legislature every parent or guardian is required to send his child 
to school for at least twelve weeks in each school year, eight weeks of which must be con- 
secutive. This act applies only to children between the ages of 8 and 14 years who reside 
within 2 miles of the school-house by the nearest travelled road. A failure to comply 
with said law subjects the parent or guardian to a fine of not less than $5 nor more than 
$50. There are many exceptions made in the law, and the board of trustees in each dis- 
trict is permitted to excuse the parent from complying with the provisions of the law. 
As a fair test of its efficiency can not be made at present, it is impossible to say whether 
or not its effects will he beneficial. 
“Sections 16 and 36in each surveyed township are reserved for public school purposes. 
There being no record kept in the surveyor-general’s office of the number of surveyed 
townships in this Territory, I am not able to state the number of acres or sections now 
reserved.’? 
BENEFITS OF A MORE RIGID SUPERVISION. 
‘The separation of the office of Territorial superintendent from that of the comptroller 
éccurring but a few months ago by enactment of the Fourteenth Legislative Assembly, 
has afforded opportunities for a more rigid inspection and supervision of the schools gen- 
erally. Ihave visited nine of the fifteen counties. A detailed report at this time is 
not feasible, but I would remark in general that I am satisfied that the effects of such 
visitations are good, and that they tend to a renewed interest on the part of parents and 
teachers and all school officers. Thus far I have discovered eated estates amount- 
ing to about $3,000, and proceedings are being taken by which the Territorial treasury 
will soon receive the benefit of that sum. 
“Tt is a difficult matter to impress upon school trustees, as well as upon county su- 
perintendents, the necessity of complying strictly with the law regarding our school sys- 
tem. Many of the trustees are illiterate. and too often the business of the district is 
neglected. Ido not hope, after affairs have ran so many years without supervision 
worth mentioning, to at once correct all mistakes, but trust thata gradual improvement 
may take place and eventually reach the point already attained in the Eastern States ot 
the Union.”” 
        MORE MONEY NEEDED. 
“The Territory needs money to perfect the work of education and to extend aid to 
the poorer districts. With the school lands notavailable and with no national assist- 
ance, we can only rely upon the assistance of the people and await the time when by rea- 
son of increased taxable wealth we can better help ourselves.’’

[From Report of Superintendent J. W. Akers, 1884-35 and 1885-86.] 
GENERAL REMARKS, 
“Tt is gratifying to be able to report a most satisfactory and prosperous condition of 
education throughout the State. The past two years have been years of increased in- 
terest, activity and growth. This applies to no particular county or locality, but is 
general. The number of school-houses has been increased by about five hundred, and 
their aggregate value by more than $550,000. The number of teachers is increased by 
about five hundred, while our school population is ten thousand greater than the same 
as reported two years ago. 
‘The total number of teachers attending normal institutes in 1884 was 14,794. This 
report shows 18,026. 
“Our report for 1884 shows $4,962,276 raised by district taxation. For 1886 the 
amount is $5,200,807; showing an increase of $233,531. This does not represent our entire 
receipts for 1886, that being, for the three funds, $6,514,639.56. The aggregate dis-

bursementsof the three fands for 1834 were as follows: School-house fund, $1,182,544.15; 
contingent fund, $1,329,459.91; teachers’ fund, $3,724,966.54; making a total of $6,236,- 
847.82. Por the year 1886 these amounts are as follows: Total disbursements of the, 
school-house fund, $952,540.03; contingent fund, $1,361,749.39; teachers’ fund, $4,008,- 
883.54; making the total disbursements of the three funds for 1886, $6,323,172.42; leay- 
ing on hand in all funds, $2,091,028.29. 
“Since 1854 there has been quite a decrease in the amount of money expended for 
school-houses and sites. The years1833 and 1884 were remarkably active in this respect, 
as compared with earlier and later years. ‘The explanation of the falling off of the last 
two years is, of course, to be found in the hard times and the general depression in busi- 
ness enterprise.’’ 
. In connection with a tabulated statementof receipts and expenditures for the past six 
years, thesuperintendent remarks: ‘‘ These tables will reward acarefulstudy. Itshould 
be remembered that thousands of boards of directors, acting entirely independent of each 
other, contribute to these grand totals ; that while they represent millions of dollars re- 
ceived and disbursed, they vary but a few thousands from year to year; and these varia- 
tions usually represent an increase in the current expenses, consequent upon the growth 
of the system. There could be no more satisfactory showing that boards of directors as 
a rule are honest and regular in the transaction of business and in disbursing the peo- 
ple’s money, than is to be found in the regularity of these annual totals.”   
TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
“The county superintendents are entitled to great credit for the general success which 
has attended our law requiring that scientific instruction in physiology having special 
reference to the ‘influence of stimulants and narcotics upon the human system, should 
be taught in all public schools.. The law has been very generally obeyed. Owing to, 
the fact that while the law went into effect on the Ist day of July, 1886, and the pro- 
vision that teachers should be examined on the subject after July, 1887, many boards of 
directors, supposing that the law would not come into fall force and effect until July, 
1887, failed to make immediate preparation for teaching the subject as early in the year 
as should have been done. ‘There were those, no doubt, who, being unfriendly to the 
law, intentionally neglected making the required provisions, and subsequently claimed 
not to have understood that they were required to do anything in the matter before July, 
1887. 
‘These cases were not numerous, however, and it is to be hoped that hereafter the law 
will be honestly and faithfully carried out in all schools. 
“Tn all county superintendents’ conventions held in the spring and summer following 
the enactment of this law, the subject was very'generally and thoroughly discussed, and 
an earnest desire manifested by the great majority of superintendents to secure an ob- 
servance of all its provisions in their several counties. It soon became apparent, how- 
ever, that the construction and execution of the law was attended with many difficul- 
ties. For the purpose of clearing the subject of these difficulties, so far'as possible, a 
circular letter containing notes and suggestions of an advisory character was issued by 
the superintendent. In accordance with the views of the superintendent therein ex- 
pressed, (1) the influence of alcohol, etc., should be taught ‘in each division of the sub- 
ject,’ such as nutrition, digestion, circulation, etc., and that text-books that did not so 
teach it did not conform to the law; (2) ‘regular’ teaching should be construed to 
mean daily teaching; (3) the subject should be studied by all pupils, from the pri- 
mary classes through the high school; this must continue until satisfactory examina- 
tions have been passed; (4) it is made the duties of boards of directors not only to 
provide that certain instruction shall be given, but to see that it is given; (5) the duty 
of reporting the manner and extent to which the law has been complied with is made 
mandatory upon the county superintendent. 
» “One of the principal difficulties experienced in carrying out the provisions of this 
law has been the unwillingness of many parents to purchase text-books for their chil- 
dren. To aveid trouble where any considerable number of parents have shown an un- 
willingness to provide the necessary books, boards have simply directed their teachers to 
teach the subject orally. 
‘‘ While under some circumstances such teaching amounts to a compliance with the 
law, in many cases it is simply an evasion. Where boards of directors have secured the 
preparation of a complete outline, covering the entire subjectof physiology, and having 
special reference to stimulants and narcotics, and containing information either by state- 
ment or reference, and where such outline has been formally adopted and the teachers 
officially notified that they are required to teach the subject regularly, and where it is 
so taught from such outlines, it las been held that this is a compliance with the law. 
But where boards have simply requested their teachers to teach the subject orally and 
have not provided for and regularly adopted an outline or course of instruction, it is 
 
-P-A-G-E-131
ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—KaNsas. °° 181 
not a compliance with, but an evasion of, the law. Boards are required to ‘make all 
necessary provisions,’ and to see that the subject is regularly taught. Owing to the 
fact that sources of information on this special phase of physiology are searce, and that 
many of our teachers are young and comparatively inexperienced, a text-book in the 
“hands of both teacher and pupils is a great advantage if nota necessity.””, 
TEXT-BOOKS. 
‘The superintendent renews his recommendation in favor of a law permitting the elec- 
tors of any school district to authorize the board of directors to purchase text-books, the. 
use of which is to be free to the children of the district. 
ARBOR DAY. 
  Inregard to Arbor Day, Superintendent Akers says: ‘Chapter 23, Laws of 1882, makes 
it the duty of boards of directors to plant shade trees upon school-house sites, and au- 
thorizes payment from the contingent fund. In obedience to this law, thousands of 
young trees have been planted; but this necessary improvement hasso far been neglected 
in many districts. For the purpose of encouraging tree planting, and investing the ex- 
ercise with all possible interest, I issued a circular letter, under date of April 4, 1887, 
designating the 4th day of May to be generally observed by all the schools of Iowa as 
Arbor Day. The day was very generally observed, and many interesting and delightful 
exercises were held. Owing to the early opening of the season, May 4th proved a little 
late for many varieties of trees, but it is believed that May 4th will be early enough for 
the average season, The hard-wood trees should be selected, and the planting of such 
trees may safely be deferred to May 4th.”

KANSAS. 
REPORT ON THE KANSAS SCHOOL SYSTEM BY A COMMITTEE OF THN KANSAS STATE 
TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATION. 
To the Kansas State Teachers’ Association: 
The committee appointed at the last annual meeting of this association to report on 
the desirability of a change from our present district system to either the township or 
county system, early in September sent a circular of inquiry to every county superin- 
tendentin the State. More or less complete reports were received from about forty coun- 
ties, and these faithfully represent the condition ofall parts of the State, as will befound - 
in perusing the tabular statements embodied in this report. 
In the first place, let us ask attention to the fact that the present system results in a 
choice of three school officers from a very small community, and from a very limited 
number of men, 
They may be (perhaps generally are) as good men as can be found in that community; 
but this fact does not relieve them from being only too often very poor school officers. 
Now the county superintendents referred to, in making their special reports, answered 
very generally this question: ‘‘How many school ofiicers in your county visit their 
schools?’? A careful compilation of the replies shows that out of nearly 8,000 officers 
only some 1,300 (or less than one-sixth) discharge this very plain duty. In other words, 
the result is the same as though in all the odd-numbered districts the officers never Visit 
their schools, and in the even-numbered districts only one member of the board knows   
by personal observation the conditions and needs of the weighty matters intrusted tohim! — 
   ‘Lhi ald seem bad enough, and might well cause us.to look more carefully into dis- 
trict a ; but there is worse than this. Another question was: ‘‘ What proportion of 
your school officers thoughtfully and ‘intelligently discharge their duties?’ It is quite 
possible that some school officers are busy men, with no time for visitations—and yet 
give much thought to their work. It is nob impossible that excellent teachers make 
visits from the beard almost unnecessarry. But there can be no excuse for carelessness, 
thoughtlessness, or incapability. Yet answering for more than 7,000 officers, but 2,000 
were reported favorably. On an average, then, in each district about seven-eighths of 
aman “thoughtfully and intelligently discharges his duties” as a school officer! And 
    
the education of our children, and intelligent citizenship, and the future of this State, | 
depend largely on the results of this two-sevenths management! Is it not time to in- 
vestigate, to see whether the system or the men are to blame; to see what remedies are 
needed, and what can be applied ? 
                { 4

  ‘ Hf 
132 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
It is quite probable that districts do as wellas they can in selecting officers. Further, 
the superintendents in question have doubtless understated rather than overstated the 
evils prevalent in their own counties. This Jast should’ be constantly in mind. Men 
speak as favorably as possible of their constituents, even in confidential and privileged 
communications. We may be sure that the case is worse than actually reported, rather 
than better. 
‘To proceed: Superintendents having within their jurisdiction over 7,000 officers report 
2,000 of these as ‘* wholly unfit for their positions.”” It might be questioned as to the 
respects in which these officers were unfit, but on one point the returns are painfully ex- 
plicit. It is with much hesitation that we quote the figures. As Kansans and citizens 
we are ashamed of the showing. But we believe that the evil will never be remedied 
till the facts are brought to the public eye, ear, and conscience. 
Asked, ‘‘How many officers are virtually illiterate ?”’ the gentlemen interrogated say 
more than one fifth—1,600 in 7,200 (round numbers)! 
We wish to pause right here to ask careful consideration of the facts thus made prom- 
inent. As business men, as practical men, it is time citizens carried to school matters 
practical and business sense. If taxesare not a good investment, then taxes had better 
come toanend. They can not be a good investment, however, when expended by a 
body of men a large per cent. of whom have no knowledge of the business, while still a 
larger per cent. give it no attention whatever. If of any 70 hired men only 13 gave 
the business in hand the benefit of their presence and personal effort, 21 ‘ thought 
about it,” and 36 knew nothing about it at all, how long could the employers of such 
laborers keep outof bankruptcy ? Suppose that Superintendent Parnham, at the capi- 
tol building, should report to the commissioners: Total number of men employed and 
paid, 70; average reporting for duty, 13; number who say ‘‘ they are thinking about it,” 
21; cripples, blind, and ‘‘ wholly unfit’ for work, 36; about how long before Superin- 
tendent Parnham would be on his journey to Lawrence ? 
Yet this is precisely what we seem to be doing all over this State—partly because we are 
wedded to precedent (the district system), and largely because we are so very busy mak- 
ing money that we can not stop to see that it is wisely expended. 
For our children’s sake, if not for our own, we should seek a remedy for the prevail- 
ing inefficiency of a large per cent. of our rural schools. 
There is another phase of our present system which is almost as disheartening as the 
wretched showing made in official zeal and ability. Thatis, the limitations, inequalities, 
and rank injustice of the resulting taxation. We are generally so alert to perceive 
that which touches our pockets, that it is remarkable that this inequality of burdens 
has not made itself felt before. 
From part of the reports referred to the following contrasts have been drawn. The 
figures may speak for themselves, They are said to be confined to districts in which one 
teacher only is employed:

which can not be seen but can be most severely felt, for reasons that are frequently in- 
scrutable and are often those of some little clique with political influence, these people 
find themselves under the most unequal system of taxation that can be devised. Why 
should Atchison County be so divided that one community has over $1,600 assessable 
values for every child of school age, while another has but $150? Why has one district 
in Chautauqua $725 assessable for each child, and another but $125? What thoughtful- 
ness, or justice, or equity can be claimed for a system that produces such results as can 
beseen through the entire list. 
The showing ought to arouse public indignation. The least it can do is to promote 
discussion. 
It will, perhaps, be objected, that the contrasts exhibited in the statistical tables were 
exaggerated in this respect; that they touched extreme cases only. It is impossible, of 
course, to make a minute showing of every phase of the present slovenly, unjust, and in- 
equitable system of managing and providing for ourschools. But, in order that the ques- 
tion may be wisely discussed, and the presentation of facts as fair as possible, the follow- 
ing table has been prepared. Again the reports are made for districts employing but one 
teacher. The counties are taken, without selection, from the alphabetically-arranged 
list, as far as complete returns have been made:

We cannot see the use of pursuing these comparisons further. The result is the same 
oe Alpha to Omega, from A to Izzard! Any one can see the existing inequalities at 
@ glance, 
We venture the assertion, that if these inequalities and disabilities were political 
rather than educational—if they affected the political interests or prospects of parties as 
they do the educational of communities—there would be a redistricting or a revolution, 
and that before next spring. 
What is a fair estimate of the annual costofa good school? We donot mean the very 
best; but the least that we have a perfect right to demand and expect in every district, 
if our system is to be more than a faree. 
Something as follows: 
A good teacher six months, at $50. Janitor Fuel., Repairs, improvement of gro 
Additions to library, apparatus, et      
      We do not care to discuss this statement by even one printed lineof argument. Any 
one whose opinion is worth anything knows that this is really a minimum, and by 
no means all that can be desired.

» That’s a comfortable showing! In twenty-two counties—representative counties, se- 
lected: at random—the average district of the five lowest valuations can raise, by taxing 
itself to the extreme legal limit, $232, or a‘trifle more tHan half enough for a good six 
months’ school! No wonder that the chief qualifications of some rural teachers seem 
to be ‘‘ cypherin.’ and lickin’.”’ 
Take the average of the five highes st_ valuations (holding still to districts employing 
but one teacher); suppose them to tax themselves equally with the five lowest, and then 
compare the educational possibilities of the children of one with those enjoyed (?) by 
children in the other. Compare, or, better, contrast, the tables as you read.

  This shows an average of $1,014; or considerably more than four times the average of 
the five lowest. This is called equality of taxation, ‘‘ equality before the law,’ educa- 
tional equality. 
In the estimate given above, $425 was considered the minimum expense of atolerably 
good six months’ school. It was shown that many districts could not raise this amount 
under the present limitation; while some districts under a 20-mill tax could raise three 
or four times this amount. 
Can.a single valid objection be raised to spreading the aggregate running expense of 
all the schools of a county upon the county rolls? 
The State has three objectsin view in public education. It wishes to make each man 
an.intelligent voter; it wishes to make each independent of the necessity for public aid— 
that is, to lift him above possible. pauperdom; it wishes to make him. strong enough to 
bear his share of all public burdens. These are such essentials in a free republic, that 
we have accepted 4s, truism, ‘‘the State must educate or perish.’’ 
Education, then, is the public necessity, a public duty, a public burden (as far as ex- 
pense goes), and a public blessing. Its methods, therefore, should be as largely public 
and as little communal as possible. 
In, this, State, as in most Western States, the county is really the political unit. The 
desirability and justice of distributing to the county at large what had been so long.car- 
ried by townships (under the rather limited New England system)—such as bridges, the 
eare of the poor, etc.—has long been recognized. The school, which should have been

first to receive this more just as well as more generous treatment, has thus far been left 
to. be handled ina happy-go-lucky way by the petty little communalities, which we insist 
on retaining for no reason other than ‘‘for the sake of self-government; » as though ° 
self. “government did not exist in the county, or ag though selfs “government were dasira- 
ble for its own sake rather than for its results ! 
Let us suppose a county system, for taxation at least, and note the results, The task 
of making the necessary computations for many counties is arduous and unnecessary. 
One county, a thoroughly representative one, will be sufficient. 
Tn this county we find, outside of its one city, a valuation of $3,200,000. It has eighty- 
five school districts—far too many, if any reasonable amount of discretion had been used 
ricting the Sah But we will take it as it is. 
The problem then is: 85 times $425 equals $36,225; $36,225 equals 11.8 mills on $3,- 
200,000. 
Think of it! A good six months’ school in every district in the eounty for less than 
a twelve-mill tax. If any district wishes to do moze, let it do so; but here is an abso- 
lute guarantee of good work throughout the county. 
Itseems impossible to study the figures in the foregoing tables, and the inferences drawn 
from the answers of superintendents, without concludir ¢ that our school system is wret¢h- 
edly inefficient, and that our legislature should at once be asked to enact a law which 
will secure for us a juster taxation, more efficient supervision, more intelligent officers, 
a simpler machinery, a uniform course of study, uniform text-books, and, as a conse- 
quence of all these, infinitely better results in our schools than it is possible to expect 
under the present system. 
Your committee therefore recommend, that all laws in relation to our independent 
school district system be repealed. We have carefully,examined the school systems of 
various States, and we conclude that the model system of schoois for a State, approved 
by the National Association of Superintendents, at Philadelphia, in 1876, and also by the 
- veteran Commissioner of Education, General Eaton, who has given the best years of his 
life to a study of school systems, is the best for Kansas, and it is the system your com- 
mittee now respectfully present to you. As that part of the Kansas school system which 
Telates to higher education is in the main satisfactory, it has not been touched in this: 
report; and all the recommendations made have. reference solely to the rural parts of the 
State, excluding all cities of the first and second class. 
In dividing the State for school purposes, we recommend— 
That the county should exercise a limited geneval supervisory contro] over its schools, 
select a county superintendent, have a county board of education, secure uniformity in 
text-books, have power to establish county high schools. 
That the county board of education should be composed of the school trustees of cor- 
porations which are under the supervision of the county superintendent, consider the 
general needs and wants of the schools under its charge, seek to unify the school work, 
arrange a.course of study, make general rules and regulations in regard to the employ- 
ment of teachers, time ef commencing schools, the government of the schools and the 
conduct of the teachers and pupils, ete., adopt ‘sexct-books, levy a county tax. * 
‘That the city or township should be left to the local control of its schools, elect its offi-

of houses, etc.; be permitted to levy local taxes for the continuance of the schools beyond 
the minimum period fixed by the State, be permitted’to levy local taxes for the mainte- ° 
nance of schools of an advanced grade. 
That districts should be formed for the purpose of localizing the patrons of the school; 
have an advisory power in the selection of teachers and the erect jon, removal, or repair 
of school-houses. 
That trustees of townships and cities should be three for each corporation; Be elected 
by the people; serve for three years, one retiring annually; receive school revenues; 
have power to levy local taxes, within specified limitations, for grounds, buildings, fur- 
niture, repairs, supplies, apparatus, ete., and for library purposes and for additional 
tuition purposes; be compelled to locate, establish, and maintain a sufficient number of 
schools for a certain number of months in each year; have power to abolish old school. 
distriets, create new ones, build and remove houses; be compelled to make provisions for 
instruction in certain prescribed branches; have power ‘to establish township or town 
graded’ schools; have power to provide instruction in branches additional to those pre- 
seribed by law; employ and contract with teachers, being restricted in their selection 
to those who liave been duly licensed by competent authority; properly account to 
proper officers for all school revenues that come into their hands; receive reports from 
teachers, and should transmit reports to the county superintendent and other county of- 
ficers; have authority to dismiss refractory pupils from school; be prohibited from con- 
tracting debt; carry out the orders of the county board of education in respect to course 
of study and text-books,

    136 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87, 
We further recommend that no person shail be eligible to the office of county super- 
intendent who does not possess a diploma from a college or university legally empowered 
to grant literary degrees, or a diploma or State certificate issued according to law by the 
authorities of a State normal school, og a certificate from the State board of education, 
ora first-grade certificate from a county or city examining board; nor shall he be eligible 
unless he has a sound moral character, and has had successful experience in teaching 
within three years of the time of his first election. 
We further recommend that in each county the tax levied by the county buard be suf- 
ficient to secure to each district in the county six months’ school each year; and that the 
one-mill State tax be restored. 
We have placed before you as concisely as possible the evils we seek to remedy; and, 
in like manner, recommend a system which has received the approval of the most emi- 
nent educational bodies and men in the land. We sincerely hope that the substantial 
outlines of the system will be adopted, and that immaterial details may not delay your 
action. We recommend that this report, if adopted, be printed at the expense of the as- 
sociation, and that a copy be sent to each member of the State legislature. 
We further suggest that a committee be appointed to draught a bill embracing the sys- 
tem herein outlined, and to further the passage of this bill at the next session of the 
legislature.

KENTUCKY. 
[Report of 1884-86.] 
The Kentucky report of 1884-86 shows that the condition of the public schools of that 
State has been one of almost uninterrupted progress, and that the prospects for continued 
improvement are very encouraging. 
‘The greatest drawback arises from (1) a want of interest and appreciation, which is 
very decidedly marked in some counties; and (2) a lack of funds, caused in part by this 
want of interest and in part by the slender resources of the people. Hence proceeds the 
indisposition or inability in some sections to raise local revenues to supplement the State 
grants, which results in turn in the continued existence of poor, even wretched, school- 
houses and the employment of underpaid teachers. ‘‘ When they [the trustees] try to 
employ a first-class teacher and ask the district for a tax or a subscription, they are met 
with the following reply from the patrons: ‘I thought it was tobe a free school! Ipaid 
my taxes; that is all I’m going to do. The public money pays the teacher $20 a month; 
that’s more than I can get working on a farm. You needn’t say anything more to me. 
I am against the tax.’ The trustee leaves in disgust; and the energetic, thorough 
teacher, with an ambition, is soon on his way to other more appreciative States, or to a 
more remunerative profession.’’—(Superintendent of Ballard County.) 
A comparison of the county superintendents’ reports for the two years covered by the 
State report shows the growth of a much more hopeful tone, though there is still a strong 
undercurrent of such complaints as the above. Particularly is this noticeable in the 
increased willingness to raise funds by local taxes and subscriptions, The superintend- 
vent of Boyd County suys: ‘‘When the present school law took effect there were 37 dis- 
tricts, 4 good houses, 11 medium, and 20, if not 31, that should be condemned; 2 dis- 
tricts had no house at all; 14 houses were at once condemned. Eleven of these districts 
have voted tax to build new houses in place of condemned ones; 8 of the new houses 
are completed; 1 brick, worth $800; 7 frame, average value about $400. Three others 
will be builtin the spring, with probable cost of $3,500. At the end of five years from 
the date of the new law it is hoped and believed every district in Boyd will have a good, 
comfortable, healthy school house. A vote for county tax in August was defeated by 
only 27 votes; at another time the tax will carry.” Thesuperintendent of Lyon County: 
7 Dae school houses were found to be a disgrace to civilized communities, so 18 out of 
28 werecondemned. The people are responding nobly, and next year, instead of houses 
valued at $20, $50, and $75, an increase of value is confidently expected at the rate of
-P-A-G-E-137

$300, $500, and $800.”” Superintendent Pickett shows that the cause of education is not 
merely keeping pace with the general development of the State in material prosperity, 
but is considerably outstripping it. 2 
A marked feature of this report, and one which distinguishes it from most Southern 
school reports, is the information it gives as to the condition and prospects of the colored 
schools and as to the sources from which they draw their’ revenues, showing what the 
white inhabitants of Kentucky are doing for the education of the negroes. This mat- 
ter is treated of more in detail in Chapter XIV. 
The following extracts show the superintendent’s treatment of the principal topics of 
interest: 
SCHOOL POPULATION.

Aggregated totals.   
  
Total increase during this period, 79,129; white, 45,894; colored, 33,235. The extra- 
ordinary relative increase of the latter over the former must be referred, mainly, to the 
extension of the school age, in 1882-83, to correspond with the school age of the white 
children. The increase of the census of white children for 1886 over that of 1885 is 9,993, 
while that of colored children, is only 1,905. 
SCHOOL REVENUES. 
The increase of the school fund, as apportioned, from 1880 to 1886, is $399,864.33, and 
the increase in local taxation and subscription from 1880 to 1885 is $205,165.75, making 
a grand total of $605,030.08. Thus while the number of school children has been largely 
augmented, the increase of the general school fund for the same period has been corre- 
spondingly greater, producing an increase of the per capita from $1.25 to $1.65 for the 
white school children, and from $0.48 to $1.65 for the colored school children. Of course 
this is referable, first, to the additional 2-cent tax voted by the people in 1882; secondly, 
to the acquirement of the just proportion of the school tax from railroads, turnpike roads, 
banks, and other corporations; thirdly, to the increase of the taxable property of the 
Commonwealth; and, fourthly, to the increasing popular interest in the common schools. 
This speaks well for the progress and prosperity of our people. It is, in fact, the practi- 
cal realization of one of the fundamental principles in political economy —the increase 
in the wealth of a State, intelligently directed, exceeding the ratio of the increase in 
population. 
THE FOURTH INSTALMENT OF THE SURPLUS REVENUE, 
Kentucky, with her inborn intelligence, energy, and sense of independence, and with 
her vast and varied material resources only needing further development, must con- 
tinue to rely mainly on herself for the proper conduct and sustenance of her common 
schools. Every importunate.effort in any other direction contributes to lessen her self- 
reliance and her self-respect in regard to her schools. Yet there are legitimate claims 
that the Commonwealth has upon the General Government, which in no sense should 
be ignored by your honorable body or disregarded by your obedient servant. In virtue 
of the large and unavailing surplus in the Treasury of the United States, the following 
‘suggestions’? were prepared and published by the superintendent for the special con- 
sideration of the last General Assembly, and.as they are of equal force at present, they are 
duly reproduced: 
“In the common school report for 1880-81, pages 218-222, the origin of the school 
fund is succinctly recited. It will be seenthat underthe Deposit Act of June 23, 1836, 
Xentucky received $1,433,757.39 from the General Government, that sum constituting 
the three instalments, The fourth instalment, calling for $477,919.13, has never been 
paid, or, in other words, has never been deposited, as the law clearly requires. Accord- 
ing to the act. of Congress the deposits were subject to call in ratable sums by the Sec- 
retary of the Treasury if wanted to meet appropriations by law. These instalments 
have never been called for, and no law has ever been enacted by Congress preventing 
the payment of the fourth instalment. It is still due, and there is a large surplus in 
the public treasuryat Washington. That amount should be legally collected and added 
to the common school fund of this Commonwealth. 
“Kentucky has suffered largely by the late war. According to the United States 
census of 1880 as compared with that of 1860, in assessed valuation of property there was 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
ERB OE TES EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87, 
ment and is not demanded for the payment of any portion of its deb 
    a decline in this Commonweath of 34 per cent., or $177,648,722. In simple terms, ‘the 
loyal State of Kentucky’ was subjected to the sacrifice of more than one-third of her 
property in support of the Federal Government in the late war. She has sustained this 
loss, while her sister States of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois have, respectively, enjoyed for 
the same period an increase of 60 per cent., 77 per cent., and. 102 per cent. in assessed 
valuation of property. 
“Ta common with all the late slave States, Kentucky has not only suffered from the 
deprivation and depreciation of property, but has had imposed upon her a mass of illit- 
exate freedmen, whose descendants must be educated for citizenship, and as ‘mixed 
schools’ will not be tolerated in the South, a dual system is a necessity in every South- 
ern State, thus imposing an extraordinary burden in the way of additional taxation 
upon the white citizens. In Kentucky, for the school year ending June 30, 1883, they 
apportioned for the support of colored teachers $92,8: , while the colored people con- 
tributed only $16,661.19, the entire revenue derived from them. This is not stated in 
reproach to the colored people, but simply in justice to the white tax-payers. 
“Tt is not the province of the superintendent to say what other Southern States 
should do, but in regard to Kentucky, and in virtue of the foregoing statement, he re- 
spectfully suggests the following: 
“* First. That, inasmuch as there isa large surplus ‘revenue reported to bein the 
United States Treasury, which is not needed for the ordinary expenses of the Govern- 
, and inasmuch.as 
‘the fourth instalment’ has not been paid to Kentucky for common school purposes, the 
General Assembly take such steps as may be necessary for the proper consideration of 
the matter. It should beadded that Virginia and other States are moving in the same 
direction. 4 
“ Second. In consideration of the facts stated above, and that Kentucky has annually 
and largely contributed to the creation.of the surplus revenue in the Federal Treasury 
by the regular payment of taxes thereto, she is ina position to expect, as a moral and 
political obligation, her legitimate quota of such surplus, independently of all form of 
subsidy or of compromise of her inherent rights as a State. 
‘Third. Creation involves the obligation of legitimate preservation. Inasmuch as a 
large additional citizenship, with equal political rights and privileges, but of unequal 
material, had been created in Kentucky by the power of the Federal Government, and in 
view of all the facts given, the superintendent suggests that such steps shall be taken as 
shall lay before said Government that which is due, both to the white and the colored 
citizens of the Commonwealth, in regard to the necessities of the common school system 
of Kentucky. 
“Attention is invited to the following compendium from the United States census of 
1880inregard to Kentucky:

In response to the proposition concerning the ‘‘fourth instalment’ indicated above, 
the honorable joint committee oneducation favored the ‘* suggestion;” the superintend- 
ent accordingly drew up a bill covering the whole ground, which duly became an act 
of the General Assembly, approved April 12, 1884. t 
In accordance with the second ‘‘suggestion,’’ a bill, drawn also by the superintendent, 
guarding the character and credit of the Commonwealth in the event of national aid to 
common schools, was introduced in the senate, and finally, by executive approval, became 
alaw on the 12th of May, 1884, 
No special action was directly taken in regard to the third ‘‘ suggestion;”’ but as Ken- 
tucky was always rated and ranked as ‘‘a loyal State’’ by the General Government, and 
in view of her heavy lossin property, Herslavesalone being, assessed in 1860 by the proper 
State. officers. at $108,876,402, and that she is maintaining, as already shown, at the ex- 
pense of her white schools a system of common schools for the very descendants of those 
slaves, the superintendent hereby ‘‘suggests,’’ as a matter of law and as a, measure of 
relief, that these facts be duly represented to the General Government. A low rate of 
interest:on one-tenth of the value of the emancipated slaves of the ‘‘loyal citizens’? of 
the State would, with the present census of pupil children, maintain the system of col- 
ored schools, with a fair appropriation for the building of school-houses. TheStatewould 
compensate for the increase of the schoo] census. This plan isentirely practicable by the 
execution. of a bond by the General Government in favor of the Commonwealth, draw-

becomes at least measurably and by degrees self-sustaining. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
Wight schools.—The following act was approved February 26, 1886: 
Whereas, the management of the night schools in the city of Louisville by the board 
of trustees of the public schools of said city has developed the fact that a large number 
of the applicants for admission are by laboring people of both sexes who are e unable to 
read and write, haye to be excluded under the | present Jaw because over the school age; 
and whereas such people, ignorant from misfortune, poverty, or lack of opportunity, are 
children in knowledge, and manifest a laudable ambition in seeking knowledge to over- 
come their ignorance and become better citizens by studying and attending school at 
night after their toil of the day; and whereas it is manifestly. to the interest of the pub- 
lie at large that every person know how to read and write, without which knowledge 
they can not properly or fully discharge the duties of citizenship under a free and en- 
lightened Government: Therefore * * the board of trustees of the public schools 
of any city in this Commonwealth, having a-population of 20,000 or-over, are hereby au- 
thorized and empowered to admit as pupils in the night schools under their direction 
and control such pers over the pupil age now prescribed by Jaw and under the age of. 
40 years, at their discretion, and under ‘such rales, regulations, and restrictions as the 
said board of trustees provide, not inconsistent with the laws of the Commonwealth: 
Provided, That:on no account shall the pupils admitted to said school by virtue of this 
act be enumerated as pupils under the common school law of the State. 
Payment of teachers’ wages.—For the purpose of providing for the monthly payment of

MAINE. 
[From Report for 1886-87 of State Superintendent N. A. Luce.] , 
There was a slight decrease in the number of schools, but the number of pupils: was 
larger than in the previous year; the school term was longer, being on an average 
twenty-two weeks and two days—an increase of one week and three days—and there 
‘was a ‘larger proportion of experienced teachers and of those who had enjoyed the regu- 
lar and systematic training of the Normal School. It is a legitimate inference, there- 
_ fore, that more thorough, effective, and successful work was accomplished, and that 
greater progress was made by the pupils. 
SCHOOL DISTRICT SYSTEM. 
There was an increase of nine in the number of towns having the town system of 
managing the schools, causing a reduction of 89 in the number of school districts and of 
26 in the number of parts of districts. This was a decided improvement, if we are to 
judge by the language of Superintendent Luce: ‘‘ Not till we are rid of that iniquitous 
product of educational folly and democracy run mad—the school district system—can 
all of our schools be brought up to full efficiency in the annual amount of schooling 
which they should offer to every child in the State.” 
TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
The law enacted by the Legislature in 1885 requires that ‘‘all pupils in all schools 
supported by public money or under State control” shall be instructed in ‘‘ physiology 
and hygiene, with special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and 
narcotics upon the human system ;’’ and that no certificate shall be granted to any per- 
son who has not ‘‘ passed a satisfactory examination in physiology and hygiene, with 
special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics upon the 
human ‘system.’? This law has been in force two years. There were some serious 
difficulties encountered in its introduction. There were a great many young pupils 
who could not read and could understand only the simplest statements. Such instruc- 
tion could only be given them directly by the teacher—by word of mouth. This was a 
method of teaching with which many of the teachers were utterly unacquainted. 
A second difficulty was that, although text-books on physiology and hygiene were 
used in many schools, few of them directed special attention to the effects of alcoholic 
drinks, stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system. Consequently, new text- 
books had to be introduced. 
As was to be expected, many parents were opposed to such instruction for different 
reasons, and the more so when asked to supply their children with books on the subject, 
which they frequently refused to do. 
Notwithstanding these difficulties, however, the law was very generally complied 
with, so that such instruction was given to nearly all the pupils—probably to between 
80 and 90 per cent. of them.
-P-A-G-E-141
ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—MARYLAND. 141 
Superintendent Luce claims that as the end of such instruction is to give the child 
such a knowledge of the evil effects of stimulants and narcotics upon the human system 
as to forever deter him from intemperate habits, any other means which will assist in 
this purpose should be adopted. Hence, the child should also be instructed as to the 
moral, social, and financial evils resulting from habits of intemperance. — He should be 
taught how large a part of the crimes, poverty, and disease results from intemperance. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE. 
The first law for compulsory school attendance was enacted in 1875, but it was found 
impossible to enforce it. Another was enacted by the Legislature in 1887, requiring 
all children between 8 and 15 years of age to attend school for at least 16 weeks in each 
year ; but, as it has been in effect only a few months, it can not be stated definitely as 
yet what will be its effect. It is very probable that it will secure a mueh larger school 
attendance, especially if the law is rigidly enforced for the first year or two, after which 
it can be easily enforced. 
COURSES OF STUDY FOR UNGRADED SCHOOLS. 
Superintendent Luce recommends the establishment of regular courses of study for 
ungraded schools and that when pupils have completed this course they be graduated, 
just as in graded schools. It would afford a strong incentive to diligent and accurate 
study on the part of pupils, and furnish them with a definite and well-marked standard 
or degree of education to which all pupils would aspire and which their parents would 
desiré them to reach before finally quitting school. 
RECOMMENDATIONS, 
Superintendent Luce recommends— 
(1) That school committees and supervisors earnestly endeavor to increase school at- 
tendance, especially by a rigid enforcement of the new compulsory law. 
(2) That they endeavor to secure teachers of high attainments and skill, and to retain 
teachers who have given satisfaction. 
(3) That they introduce regular courses of study in ungraded schools. 
(4) That they endeavor to abolish the district system, to secure the adoption of the 
free text-book plan, and the establishment of free high schools. 
(5) That they encourage educational meetings. . 
(6) That they encourage young, teachers of promise to attend a normal school. 
(7) That they endeavor in every way to elevate the publie school system. 
MARYLAND. 
[From Report of State Board of Education for 1886-87, Hon. 4. A. Newell, Secretary.] 
The number of pupils enrolled in the county schools, 1886-87, was 121,177, as against 
123,423 two years previously. Considering the natural increase of population, the fall- 
ing off of more than 2,000 pupils in two years is a matter calculated to excite inquiry. 
It is true that this decrease is to a certain extent compensated by the fact that the aver- 
age daily attendance has increased 2,821 during the same period. 
Extending the comparison over a greater interval of time, the changes in the public 
school system can be more clearly discerned. In 1867 the average duration of the school was 
9 months. In 1887 it 8} months. In 1867 13 counties kept schools open 10 months in 
the year; in 1887 only 10 counties had schools open for a similar period. This apparent 
retrogression may be explained by the fact that in 1867 the white schools received $359, 226 
from the State (being $296,550 from the State school tax and $62,676 from the free school 
fund), and in 1887 they received only $309,846 from the State (being $267,522 from the 
State school tax and $42,324 from the free school fund), This loss of $50,000 could have 
been easily met if the conditions had remained permanent. But with the gradual dimi- 
nution of income from the State there.came a gradual increase of necessary expenses, owing 
to the natural increase of population and the growing popularity of the public schools. 
The number of white children enrolled in the county schools in 1867 was 71,060; in 
1887 it was 95,331. In 1867 the average annual salary of a white teacher was $316. 
In 1887 it was not quite $300. In order to make a just comparison it has been neces- 
sary to limit the inquiry to white schools, because the colored schools had no aid from 
the State till the year 1872. In truth, the embarrassments of the white schools sprang 
indirectly from the establishment of the colored schools. 
In 1872 the General Assembly appropriated the entire proceeds of the Stale-school tax 
($525,000, more or less) to the support of the white schools, and $50,000 additional to 
the colored schools. In 1874 the General Assembly appropriated ‘“‘ whatever sum may 
be paid into the treasury on account of the levy of the public school tax ’’ to the white 
schools, and to the colored schools $100,000. There was no interference with the law 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
      142 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. | \ 
and the custom of devoting the whole income of the State school tax to the white schools 
until the year 1878, when the General Assembly passed an Act requiring the amount 
set apart for colored schools, the appropriation to the State normal school, aud the ex- 
penses of the State board of education, amounting in all to $111,500, to be paid out of 
_ the annual proceeds of the State school tax. 
The counties, with some exceptions, have done their best to make up the deficiency 
from this diversion of the State school tax, the county school tax having risen from 
$335,371 in 1873 to $457, 802 in 1887. But there are indications that the limit, whether 
of ability or of inclination we need not inquire, has been nearly reached. The school 
year is growing shorter; the teacher’s salary is growing smaller, and the necessary result 
will be a corre: ponding deterioration of the public schools. All that is needed is to go 
back to the condition of things in 1877, devote the whole proceeds of the State school 
tax to the white schools, and give from the general treasury the same proportion per 
capita for the support of colored schools. The $100,000 now given by law to the colored 
schools is very nearly the proportion of the State sc hool tax and the free school fund to 
which they would be entitled by a per capita distribution. 
    RECOMMENDATIONS FOR NEW LEGISLATION, 
The following suggestions for the improvement of the schools and the advancement of 
education are made to the Legislature by Superintendent Newell: 
ist. Necessaty text-books for use im the school room should be supplied ment 
charge. 
od The State school tax should be 12 cents on the $100, and the minimum county tax 
should be less. 
3d. The State tax should be distributed to the several counties in proportion to the 
average enrolment of the pupils, white and colored, no pupil to be counted who has not 
made an attendance of at least 60 days (or 120 half days) in the ‘year. 
Ath. The few remaining county academies should be made a part of the public school 
  system. 
5th. There should be but one school dis 
ent law. 
6th. Every principal of a public school should be required to make a report at least 
twice a month, by postal card to the examiner, of the condition of his school as regards 
attendance, etc. 
‘th. Legal provision should be made for ascertatming accurately once in every two 
years, in the city of Baltimore and the several counties, the number of children of school- 
going age (say over six years and under sixteen), the number attending public schools, 
and the number attending private and denominational schools. 
  rict trustee, in place of three under the pres- 
TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
  The General Assembly of Maryland at its last’ session enacted a law ‘‘to provide for 
teaching the study of physiology and hygiene, with special instructions as to the nature 
and effect of alcoholic drinks, stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system, in the 
public schools of the State and educational institutions receiving aid from the State,” 
and inquiries have been made as to whether the law has been complied with, Early in 
the school year 1886-87 the State board of education revised the uniform course of in- 
struction for use in the several countyschools, and inserted physiology among the studies 
of the fifth and sixth grades of the district schools, and the seventh and eighth grades of 
the high schools. The result has been that while the number of pupils in the county 
schools studying physiology was reported in 1885 as 110, it rose in 1887 to 16,200. At 
the last annual meeting of the Association of Public School Commissioners this subject 
was discussed earnestly and intelligently. It was admitted that the full number of 
pupils contemplated in the law had not yet been reached, but an obstacle was mentioned 
which had not occurred to those who framed the law. In the majority of counties pa- 
rents buy the books which their children need. They have thus an effective veto upon 
the teacher’s wish to form classes in any study. In point of fact many parents refused 
to purchase the necessary text-books of physiology; but the teachers in these cases made 
such compensation as was possible by reading to the school from the text-book and giv- 
ing the needed explanations and questions. Tt is hoped that the next annual report will 
show a decided increase in the number of pupils studying physiolegy; but the friends of 
‘temperance must bear in mind that more is needed than scientific instruction; the con- 
science must be enlighted and the will strengthened, and for these purposes other forces 
than legislative enactments must be brought into action. Let us hope that the begin- 
ning now made may be like the path of the just, ‘‘a shining light that shineth moreand 
more unto the perfect day.”’

MASSACHUSETTS. 
[From Report for 1885-87 of Hon. John W. Dickinson, Secretary of State Boardof Hducation,] 
There has been a gratifyingly large increase (996) in the number of pupils over 15 
years of age. On the other hand, the number of very young pupils continues to dimin- 
ish, 58 less being returned as under 5 years of age. ‘The returns also show a decrease 
in the number of pupilsintrusted toeach teacher. ‘This is achange in the right direction. 
The law now authorizes 50. This isan excessive number for one teacher to control and 
teach, but the agents of the board find many primary schools containing a larger num- 
ber, sometimes as many as 70 or 80 little ones being crowded into a single room and in the, 
careofa single teacher. Such schools can not be good schools. It is gratifying to know 
that the school authorities are convinced of this fact, and by multiplying the schools are 
making the conditions for work more favorable. 
While the whole number of teachers employed has increased the number of men re- 
ported as teaching has slightly diminished. ‘The average monthly wages of the men has 
increased $5.62. These facts taken together seem to show that the decrease has been in 
the number of cheap male teachers. Last year several men were found keeping school 
for $22 a month, The more rapidly the number'of such is diminished the better will 
be the schools; 
The high schools continue to prosper: The number of these schools is 229, an increase 
of 5; the number of teachers 701, an increase of 24; the number of students 22,406, an 
increase of 1,036. Of these 229 schools 42 are kept by towns which are not required by 
law to keep them. The marked growth of this grade of schools is doubtless due ina 
large measure to the continued infiuence of the free text-book law. The sum expended 
for sundries, including text-books.and supplies, has decreased $63,513.15. This was to 
be expected, as the first cost of supplying the schools under the new law was necessarily 
larger than the average would prove to be. The towns are now approaching the aver- 
age expenditure for this purpose. This is undoubtedly much smaller than the expendi- 
ture under the old system. 
The returns of private schools are defective. ‘The whole number of pupils in such 
schools during the past year is reported to be 28,941. From official sources it is known 
that there were 30,000 pupils in schools maintained by the Catholic Church alone. 
A detailed course of study for ungraded schools has been prepared, which is designed 
to aid the school boards of towns in preparing courses for their own schools, 
    
   
ILLITERACY. 
The State decennial census, taken in 1885, has disclosed the gratifying fact that illit- 
eracy has not increased at so great a rate as the population during the last decade, and 
consequently is not so prevalent as it was ten years ago. This is true both for the na- 
tive and foreign born population. In 1835 there were 122,263 illiterates, forming 7.73 
per cent. of the population. Of these 122,263 illiterates of all degrees, 6.79 per cent. 
were born in Massachusetts, 4.58 per cent. in other States, while 88.63 per cent. were 
foreign born. The native born illiterates were, in 1875 and 1885, 1.33 and 1.29 per cent. 
of the total population, respectively, while the foreign born were 23.12 and 21.50 per 
cent. for the same periods. : 
The above figures include illiterates of all ages, many of whom have come into the 
State after reaching maturity, and are therefore beyond the reach of elementary instruc- 
tion. If only the minors from 10 to 20 are taken into consideration they will be found 
to be only 9.92 per cent. of the total number illiterates, as against 11.09 in 1875.

NEW LEGISLATION—SESSION oF 1887. f 
Temperance instruction.—The law relating to instruction in physiology and hygiene 
wes amended as follows: (1) Such instruction must be given by text-books in the case 
of pupils who are able to read and as thoroughly as in other studies pursued in the same 
school; the text-books to be used for such instruction shall give at least one-fourth of 
their space to alcoholic drinks and narcotics, and at least 20 pages in the highest grade. 
(2) Text-books used must be approved by the State board of education, the approval of 
the board of health no longer being necessary. (3) Each teacher of a public school 
must certify whether or not such instruction has been given in the school presided over 
by him or her. (4) School boards are subject to fine or forfeiture for neglecting to carry 
     
-P-A-G-E-144
144 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
out the provisions of this act. (5) This act applies to all schools in thé State, whether 
incorporated under special charter or general laws. 
Reports of township inspectors.—Reports of township inspectors are hereafter to be made 
to the county board of school examiners, instead of to the county clerk. 
School libraries. —The provision authorizing the voters of a township at their annual 
meeting to apply any part of the township tax to the purchase of books for a school 
library, has been stricken out. 
Examination of teachers.—(1) The board of school examiners of a county is to consist 
of two members elected by the chairmen of the township boards of inspectors, and of a 
secretary, who is to be ex-officio a member, elected by these two, acting with the county 
judge of probate. (2) The secretary is to hold two regular, and not more than six special, 
examinations annually; first and second grade certificates shall be granted only at the 
regular examinations. (3) In addition to the requirements heretefore in force, candi- 
dates for teachers must have attained the age of sixteen years. (4) Certificates of the 
first grade are made valid throughout the State; no special certificate shall be granted 
to a person who at any previous examination has failed to secure a regular certificate; 
holders of special certificates who have failed to present themselves for examination 
shall not have their certificates renewed. 
Supervision of schools.—The secretary of the county board of school examiners, in ad- 
dition to the duties heretofore prescribed, shall (1) visit, or cause his assistants to visit, 
each school in the county at least once a year; (2) counsel with teachers and school 
boards as to the courses of study and discipline; (3) make suggestions with regard to 
school buildings and grounds, heating, veritilation, etc.; (4) promote the improvement 
of schools, and the elevation of the characters and qualifications of teachers and officers; 
and (5) receive the reports of the township inspectors. Duties (2), (3), and (4) for- 
merly devolved upon the chairman of the township inspectors; and (5) upon the county, 
clerk. The provision authorizing county boards of examiners to hold special meetings 
to suspend or 1evoke the certificates of teachers is withdrawn. 
The compensation of the secretary of the county board of examiners shall not exceed 
$300 in counties having 30 districts or less, or $10 a district in counties having over 30 
districts, in no case to exceed $1,500 per annum; he shall not receive any compensation 
until his reports, required by law, have been made and filed. 
Crime and truancy.—Any girl from ten to seventeen years, a boy from ten.to sixteen, 
who shall wilfully absent himself or herself from school or legitimate employment, or 
frequent a place where intoxicating liquors are kept for sale, or lounge upon the streets 
against the command of parents, or attend a dance, skating rink or show without the 
consent of parents, shall be deemed a truant and disorderly person. Any such minor, 
upon conviction, may be sentenced to a reformatory institution, provid-r) the circuit 
judge or probate judge of the county has first appfoved the sentence. 
  [From Report for 1835-86, Theodore Nelson, State superintendent.] 
TOWNSHIP SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 
“During my brief connection with this department I have become convinced that 
there exist two radical defects in our present school system, i. e., imperfect supervision 
and too many school districts. These defects have been noted and discussed at length 
by several of my predecessors, and I am simply falling into line with their views in urg- 
ing the necessity of some change in these particulars. The argument in favor of consoli- 
dating the common school districts in each township is exhaustively presented by Hon. 
H. R. Gass, in the annual report of this department for 1883, and I shall only attempt 
to emphasize some of the facts presented in support of his advocacy of the proposed 
change. 
‘The inequality of the cost per capita for instruction incident to the present system 
is shown in the reports of the township inspectors on file in this office. The following 
cases are taken at random from the difterent counties in the State, and are not excep- 
tional.” 
Superintendent Nelson then instances a number of cases to show this inequality in the 
cost per capita for instruction, in some districts it being six times as much as in others 
in the same county. He then goes on to say: 
‘Instances of a similar character could be cited from nearly every county in the State. 
Assuming that the districts reporting the least enrolment are the more sparsely settled 
and the less able to bear the burden of taxation necessary to support the schools, and 
adding to the cost of instruction the current expenses of the school, cost of buildings, etc., 
the inequality is most marked. 
‘“‘While the inequality would not be entirely done away with in each instance by 
placing all the schools of the township under one management, the evil would be les- 
sened very materially, and the school taxes would be equitably distributed over all the 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—MINNESOTA. 145 
territory comprised in the township. Nor is this all. The wages of all the teachers in 
the township would be more equally adjusted, resulting in supplying the same grade of 
instructors to all sections of the township. 
‘The adoption of the township district would naturally result in a uniform series of 
text-books for all the schools of the township. The advantages that would accrue from 
greater uniformity are self-evident, the oniy question being to what extent is uniformity 
desirable? Should it be confined to the district, the township, the county, or should it 
include the entire State? While I am not favorable to State uniformity and am some- 
what in doubt as to the advisability of a county uniformity even, I am satisfied that a 
uniform series of text-books for all the schools of a township would be of great benefit 
wo the district schools, and would simplify the adoption of county uniformity should it 
be deemed advisable.’? 
STATUS OF TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
“What is the exact status of temperance teaching in our public schools? The ques- 
tion is raised because it has been a matter of some inquiry, as well as controversy. 
““While the duty to provide for special instruction in physiology is made mandatory 
upon all district boards, there is no special penalty provided for failure to comply with 
the law. With a view to ascertain to what extent the law was complied with, special 
efforts were made during the past year to secure reliable information upon this point. 
The returns from the graded schools are quite complete, but the reports from the district 
schools are not as satisfactory. The blanks furnished the school directors of the State by 
this department included the following USE: ‘Is physiology and hygiene taught in 
your school as provided in section 15, chapter 3, General School Laws of 1885?’ Of the 
6,897 districts in the State 2,313 answered ‘ Yes,? 1,789 answered ‘No,’ and 2,795 made 
no report. Among the latter are undoubtedly a number of districts in which the sub- 
ject is taught, but it is, of course, impossible to form any reliable estimate of the num- 
ber. The fact that more than 1,700 districts report that the subject is not taught indi- 
cate a very general disposition on the part of district officers to either ignore the provis- 
ionssof law, or to deliberately disregard them. The fact that they reply to the query at — 
allis evidence that they are not ignorant of their duties in this regard. Tosecure a gen- 
eral compliance with this requirement it is evident thata specific penalty should be im- 
posed for non-compliance. 
“The reports from the graded schools are much more complete and satisfactory. The 
blanks for special reports of graded schools included this question: ‘In what grades is 
physiology and hygiene taught with special reference to the effects of alcohol, etc.?? 
Reports were received from 248 schools, of which all but 25 included repliesto the above 
question. Seventy-eight report the subject taught in all the grades; 39 report it taught 
in the grammar and high school grades; 7 in the primary and grammar grades; 2 in the 
primary and high school departments; 12 in the grammar grade only; 82 in the high 
school only; 1 in the primary grade only, and 1 reported the subject not taught. 
“ These statistics show that the subject is taught in over 33 per cent. of all the schools 
of the State. While this showing is far from meeting the expectations of the friends of 
the law, some encouragement can be derived from the fact that the report for the school 
year ending September 3, 1883, the year before the statute above quoted wentinto effect, 
showed that only 653 districts out of 6,336 included physiology in their course of study, 
In four years this law has resulted in increasing the number of schools affording instruc- 
tion in this important branch of study from 10 per cent. to 33 per cent.’’

NEW LEGISLATION. 
Investment of State school funds. —A constitutional provision, adopted November 2, 
1836, provides that the permanent school fands of the State may be loaned upon inter-

school on Christmas Day, the First day‘of January, the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, | 
ox the day appointed by the President of the United States or the Governor of the State 
as a day of thanksgiving. And no deduction from the teacher’s time or wages shall be 
made by reasom of the fact that a school day happens to be one of the days referred to in 
this'section. And any contract made-in violation of this section shall have no force or 
effect as against the teacher. 
Attendunce.—In reckoning attendance all scholars enrolled shall be eredited upon the 
days named in the preceding paragraph whenever they occur within the school term, the 
same as if school! had been held and.all had been present. 
Office of State superintendent.—The superintendent of publi¢ instruction is allowed 
$1,600 per annum for clerical assistance. 
Teachers’ institutes.—The sum of $1,000, in addition to the sum now allowed by Jaw, 
$6,000, is to be annually appropriated for defraying the current expenses of State teachers’ 
institutes, and for institutes of instruction in normal methods in the elementary depart- 
ments of graded schools. 
Minimum schoot age.—Children wnder 6 years of age may be excluded from the public 
school of a district by a vote of the board of trustees. 
Apportionment of funds.—The State school funds shall be apportioned semi-annually 
in proportion to the number of scholars between the ages of 5 and 21 years, who have 
been enrolled and have been in attendance 40 days in the public schools, that have had 
ab least 5 months of term within the year by a qualified teacher. 
Length of sckool.—The minimum length of school of independent school districts has 
been lengthened from 12 to 20 weeks, 
High schools.—The annual appropriation for State high schools is increased from 
" $23,000 to $25,000. 
Normal schools. —The annual appropriations for the State normal schools at Mankato 
and Saint Cloud are increased from $15,000 to $16,000, and a standing appropriation of 
$5,000 made for that at Moorhead. 
Temperance instruction.—It is made the duty of boards of education and trustees to 
provide for, and of teachers to give, systematic and regular instruction in physiology 
and hygiene, including special reference to the effects of stimulants and narcotics upon 
the human system. Any neglect of a teacher to give such instruction shall be consid- 
ered sufficient cause for annulling his or her certificate. Teachers’ certificates will, 
after January 1, 1883, be granted only to such persons as have passed a satisfactory ex- 
amination in the above branches. Provision is made for withholding a part of its ap- 
portionment of the State school fund from any district where no arrangement has been 
made for such instruction. The superintendentof public instruction and the presidents 
of the normal schools are directed to recommend some suitable text-book. 
School library list.—The superintendent of pitblic instruction and the presidents of 
the normal schools of this State are directed to prepare a list of books, to be amended 
from time to time, suitable for school libraries, to include books of reference, history, 
biography, literature, political economy, agriculture, travel, and natural science; they 
“shall advertise in at least two leading papers for the lowest rates at which sellers 
will fill orders of school districts for books selected from this list, and make contracts 
accordingly with the lowest responsible bidder for a period not to exceed two years. 
Districts which have purchased books under these contracts are entitled, under certain 
limitations, to receive from the State one-half the sum so expended. An amount not 
exceeding $10,000 is annually appropriated by the State for this purpose.

DEFECTS HERETOFORE EXISTING IN THE SCHOOL SYSTEM, 
The school system of Mississippi during the past fifteen years has been undergoing the 
phases of development incident to every enterprise requiring complicated machinery 
and involving important and often antagonistic interests. 
Peculiar difficulties were encountered at the outset, chief among which were those 
arising from the dual character of the population, the larger portion of which were 
wholly illiterate and in the main non-tax-payers. It was not to be expected that.a sys- 
tem of such magnitude could be perfected in fifteen years, or that laws could be enacted 
to operate unerringly in the solution of such a complex problem; hence, efforts to estab- 
lish a system of free Schools have been chiefly tentative and experimental, and they. 
must so continue for many years to come.

  ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—MISSISSIPPI. 147 
From the stand-point of its development up to 1886 it was patent to all who had given 
the subject even easual consideration that the schools were not educating the children, 
and experiments showed conclusively that a revision of -the law was needed to remove 
the causes of failure. These defects had been pointed out from time to time by previ- 
ous superintendents, and may be stated as follows: (1) A want of qualified teachers; 
(2) too many schools; (3) no supervision and inspection of the teaching force; (4) a 
waste of the school fund by dividing the term into sessions of two months each. 
Lack of qualified teachers, —When free schools were established the vital question was, 
how to get teachers of any kind. There were few qualified teachers among the whites, 
and to import aliens was a policy at once repugnant and injudicious. “A supply of 
qualified teachers has been the prime need from the beginning, and the lack of them 
is the one great evil which has obstructed progress. A license to teach was within the 
reach of any tyro who could call to his a 
kind-hearted superintendent to waive an mination on the ground that the applicant 
needed the place and was represented as suited'to the community where he proposed to        
       
teach. In some counties, it is true, where superintendents were bold enough to brave 
unpopularity and were anima 
field, there were examinatio. ted by a determination to force poor teachers from the 
nd in these counties the schools advanced constantly in     
efficient work; but the examinations were highly unpopular, as they always will be if 
left to the judgment of those who are not qualified to pass them. 
Want of money to sustain the schools has done far less injury to the canse of edu- 
ention than this neglect to establish and enforce a uniform test of scholarship—a test 
which would insure competency by stimulating teachers to improve in knowledge year | 
by year, The want of competent teachers has made the system weakest where it should 
be strongest. 
fe ny schools,—The location of schools under laws prior to 1886 was placed in the 
ands of supervi: The law required the schools to be 3 miles apart, but with 
an exception providing for the pay of teachers in small schools which had located on 
account of impassable obstructions, The distance apart was generally disregarded, and 
the exception came to be the rule, By this means schools were located at the instance 
of every neighborhood faction, The education of the children was overlooked in the 
zeal to get a school located for a particular teacher, who resided in the neighborhood 
and needed a support. Indigence was the leading argument in favor of such applicants. 
Counties were thus overburdened with little schools, where emulation among pupils 
was impossible, and where the pay was too small to employ proficient teachers. 
This was a process of continual disintegration and too many schools was the result. 
The school fund was not equal to the demands made upon it, and local relief bills were 
passed to levy additional tax to make up the deficit. 
Want of supervision.—When the people of the State wrested the government from the 
sway of aliens, the office of county superintendent had been debased in many instances 
by maladministration, and was virtually abolished, being changed into a mere clerk-   
    
ship and the salary reduced to a sum which was a meagre compensation even for that. — 
The State was yearly spending three-quarters of a million of dollars, with no agents to 
see how it was spent, or whether the children were receiving an education, 
Waste of the school fund by dividing the session. —Lt had become a practice in many por- 
tions of the State to divide the term into two sessions, This had its origin in the claim 
that in an agricultural country the children could not be spared from work for four sue- 
cessive months. The claim when made means simply this; That the people must make 
slaves of their children; that they must rob them of the opportunity to become intelli- 
gent citizens; that parents must have the labor, and neglect the education of their own 
offspring. 
The people have not realized the significance of this evil, which, while it may give 
more labor, at the same time ineyitably deprives of all education. The child who has 
toiled for his parent during eight months of the year can not be denied the right of 
securing during the other four months all the advantages which the State has provided 
for his education.    
LEGISLATION OF 1886, 
‘ The Legislature of 1836 sought to correct these eyils by a revision of the school Jaw, ag 
follows: 
(1) Evamination and pay of teachers, —They provided for uniform examinations to test 
the scholarship of applicants to teach, and to classify those applicants so that they could 
be paid according to their qualifications, county superintendents being requited to fix 
‘the salary of each teacher, with due regard not only to his scholarship, but also to his 
executive ability and the scholastic population of the district in which he was to teach. 
They established monthly institutes to improve the qualifications of teachers by dissemi- 
nating among all the experience of the hest.

                t Cae oe a : . e 
148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1836-87. ; 
(2) New system of districts. —They provided a system of districts to limit the number 
of schools and to make each school large enough to justify the employment of acompetent 
teacher. 
(8) Supervision of teachers,—They required the superintendent to inspect the work of 
the teachers and to see that it was properly done, and also to organize and manage the 
institutes for the advancement of teachers in the best methods ofinstruction and discipline. 
(4) Continuous school sessions. —They required continuous sessions, so that the school 
fund might not be frittered away in worse than useless schools of only two months’ 
duration, and provided that all schools of aterm should be in session at the same time, 
so that the work of supervision and institutes might be systematic and effective. 
(5) Pay of teachers.—The salary system based on the per diem average attendance had 
been a fruitful source of unjust discriminations and of many frauds. It was abolished 
and the pay for teachers of the different grades was fixed between a maximum and a 
minimum limit. 
That these heroic remedies have created commotion and aroused opposition, says 
Superintendent Preston, is not to be wondered at when we take into consideration the 
number of barnacles that had to be shaken off when the work of repair and renovation 
was begun.! 
EXPENDITURE MADE COMPARED WITH RESULTS ACHIEVED. 
That the State of Mississippi, in the last decade and a half, has spent on free schools 
nearly $15,000,000—a sum almost equal to one-eighth of the entire assessable property — 
is a fact not calculated to inspire enthusiastic confidence in popular education, when it 
is viewed in contrast with the meagre advance made in educating those who have en- 
tered life and taken the obligation of citizenship since the State assumed control of the 
schools. The money has been spent, and it must be conceded by any fair-minded man 
that it has been largely squandered, producing inadequate results, doled out mont} by 
month to indigent and incompetent school-keepers, who were placed in charge of Most 
sacred interests of the Commonwealth, in many instances without even the semblance of 
a test as to their capacity and fitness for the vital trusts confided to their care. 
The most earnest advocate of popular education must stand appalled as he compares 
these vast expenditures with the scanty results; and the time is at"hand when this com- 
. parison must be instituted. 
NEED OF TRAINED TEACHERS, 
Superintendent, Preston utters it as his most positive conviction that the gréatest need 
of the system to-day is a corps of trained teachers. The State has squandered enough 
money in the last decade on worthless incompetents to train twice the number needed to 
do the whole work. Many of the leading, progressive teachers, it is true, are equal in 
_ ability, enterprise, originality, and power to those of any State. But they alone can 
not carry the dead weight of the laggards, or relieve the teaching force of the truthful- 
ness of the strictures that have been made upon it. 
ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OF THE NEW SYSTEM. 
The average term was 78 days in 1885 and 84 days in 1887. This shows an increase 
in time of nearly 8 per cent. If the schools had continued as long in 1885 as in 1887, 
they would have cost $905,451, nearly $64,000 more than they cost in 1887. An in- 
crease of 6 days at the same cost, or a gain of $65,000 for the same time, is the true 
economic advantage of conducting our schools under the law of 1886. Taking into con- 
sideration that these results were-produced in the first year’s trial of the law, it is but 
reasonable to expect that, when teachers are more carefully graded and their salaries 
scaled according to the provisions of the law, the school term can be still further length- 
ened and the total cost reduced. 
The total receipts reported for the scholastic year 1886-87 are $972,806.94, about 
  $100,000 more than in 1885. The reported expenditures are $143,000 less than the re- 
  
ceipts. A portion of this surplus has been consumed in taking up warrants previously 
issued and carried over, and in building school-houses in cities, but in the main it will 
be brought forward and will place the schools on a cash basis in most counties. At pres- 
ent about forty-five counties are practically on a cash basis. In the other counties from 
one-fourth to three-fourths of the warrants are discounted. With an economical admin- 
istration of our finances for the scholastic year 1837-88 the next year can be begun on 
a cash basis in nearly every county in the State. This will put an end to speculation in   
‘Superintendent Preston writes, under date of March 13, 1883, at the close of the last session of 
the Legislature, as follows: “The reform measures embodied in the law of 1338 stood the test, and the law was not ehanged materially, although there was considerable effort made to do so. We are now on a basis 
which will remain, and though the law is ahead of public sentiment, I am satisfied that it will draw 
the public up to its plane.”

[From Report for 1880-37 of State Superintendent W. HE, Coleman.] 
  NEW LEGISLATION, 
The last General Assembly, while making no radical changes in the school law, passed 
some valuable amendments, among which are the following: 
Formation of districts. —The section relating to the formation of new districts and 
to the change of boundary lines, was greatly improved by simplifying the language and 
rendering the law more definite in its requirements. 
Change of date of school census.—As the apportionment of State school moneys is made 
in July, the time for making the enumeration was changed from June to the first fifteen 
days in May, so that the county clerks can make their annual reports before the State» 
moneys are apportioned; this enables the State and county apportionment to be made 
upon the enumeration in May of the same year. 
Colored schools. —The three sections relating to colored schools were repealed and two 
new sections enacted, which outline the duties of the school boards in unmistakable 
language. Whenever there are 15 colored children within any school district, they are 
entitled to the same school facilities as are provided for the white children of the 
district; but when there are less than 15 in any district, they can attend any colored 
school in the county, and the board in the district from whence they come must pay for 
such attendance, j 
Powers of town and city boards.\—The powers of town and city boards were enlarged, 
by giving them the authority to continue their schools for a term of not less than 7 nor 
more than 10 months in the year; by authorizing them to locate additional school sites 
after the first site has been located by the people; by authorizing them ‘‘as soon as the 
funds are provided”’ to establish an adequate number of primary or school wards, and 
furnish the same; and by authorizing them to loan any surplus ‘‘sinking fund,” and 
apply the intereg thereon to augment the said ‘‘sinking fund.’” 
Normal school dtplomas.—A diploma, granted by any one of our State normal schools, 
upon completion of the full course therein, is made authority for the holder thereof to 
teach in the public schools of the State without further examination by any authorized 
examiner, until said authority is revoked by the county commissioner, State superinten- 
dent, or the board that issued such diploma, for causes therein set forth.   
   
      
RECOMMENDATIONS, 
Among the changes in the school law recommended by Superintendent Coleman in 
the present report are the following: 
(1) The establishment of efficient county supervision. This matter was entirely 
ignored by the General Assembly at its last sessioi 
(2) Making the minimum school term 6 mont! 
(3) The enactment of a law enforcing the provision of the State constitution forbid- 
ding the appropriation of public funds for any sectarian purpose or in aid of any sectarian 
institution. * ¢ 
This law is being violated daily in many of the public schools of the State, and it re- 
sults in prejudice and open opposition to the public schools in those communities where 
it is practised. i 
(4) The law should specify definitely in what language instruction in the primary 
schools must be given; two languages cannot be taught, in these schools, at the same 
time, without great detriment to the teaching of English. 
ARBOR DAY. 
       
The 15th day of last April was observed by hundreds of school districts as Arbor Day, 
and thousands of trees and shrubs were planted in the school yards. It has been such 
a dry season that many of the trees did not live; besides, it was apparent that the date 
fixed was too late, therefore this date will be observed hereafter on Friday following the 
annual school meeting, which will be the first Friday after the first Tuesday in April; 
instructions are given to this effect in theschool law; and April 6, 1888, will be observed 
as ‘‘Arbor Day.” : ;

MONTANA. i 
Governor Leslie, in his report to the Secretary of the Interior for 1887, makes the 
following remarks upon education and school lands in Montana: ‘‘ Montana is justly 
t taxation 
for the support of public schools, and good buildings have been erected for these people’s 
colleges in all the populated portions of the Territory. Our cities and towns have sub- 
stantial, commodious, and even elegant school buildings, and the inost approved sys- 
tems of. graded schools, kept up for the larger part of the year. In fact, these schools 
will compare fay orably with the schools in towns of equal size in .any of the States. 
These public schools are supported by direct county and district taxes, and penal fines 
for violation of Territorial laws. 
“The county taxes can not be less than 3 mills nor more than 5 mills per dollar on 
the valuation of alltaxable property. Districts may vote additional taxes for building, 
apparatus, and salaries of teachers. 
“The amount of school money raised by direct taxation during the last year was 
23,871, and from fines in various courts $6,466, making for public schools, $230,337.” 
SCHOOL LANDS, 
      
“Montana has been the home of the white man only a fraction over a quarter of a 
century; her people have no school fund except as they draft upon their estates by the 
process of taxation, The GeneralGovernment has heretofore donated to our people for 
school purposes lands which consist of the 16 and 36sections of each township and 72 sec- 
tions for thesupport of aState university. Butthese lands are still held by thegiver, and 
Montana has no title to or control over them. ‘They have been selected and designated, 
so that the school mark isupon them. It therefore appears to be appropriate for me to 
ask your attention to this most sacred trust, involving the intelligence and virtue of the      
future population of this promising Commonwealth, 
“Tam advised, and believe the information to be true, that very much of these lands 
has been seized by certain persons, who have them fenced up and live upon them, and 
in this and other ways are appropriating and con3uminy their products, greatly to the 
injury and tending much to the destruction of this valuable school ‘property, and I am 
assured that this species of taking for private uses.of the wrong-doer has been going 
on for a number of years, 
“* Moreover it is a fact that already sonie portions of these school laffts have been lost, 
- in this, that a portion of them were found to have been appropriated before they were es 
  surveyed and designated for school or university purposes; and still another portion 
_ was taken as mineral lands. 
“T ask for the people of Montana that such action be taken as will insure the imme- 
diate expulsion from these lands of every person who is engaged in their occupancy, cul- 
‘tivation, or selfish appropriation in any way, and that ample provision be made for 
their oversight and protection against trespass and spoliation.’’

State Superintendent W. ©. Dovey writes as follows: ‘‘ During the year there has been 
a revival of interest in educational matters, both among teachers and the public gen- 
erally. é 
“The State teachers’ institute, held at Reno during Thanksgiving week, was the 
largest, most successful, and most profitable ever held in this State. | Many teachers 
eanie from a distance of more than 200 miles to attend the meeting. A State teachers’ 
asséciation was organized, which already embraces in its membership a majority of all 
the teachers in Nevada. From three to four meetings will be held each year in different 
parts of the State, besides State teachers’ institutes. One of the chief objects of the as- 
sociation is to arouse public interest in education, to the end that much needed legisla- 
, tion may be secured, thereby.

[From Report for 1836-87 of State Superintenttent J. W. Patterson’ 
RESULTS OF THE CHANGE TO THE TOWN SYSTEM. 
The'present State report affords material for a stuily of the results:of ‘the compulsory 
change from the districtto the town system, under the law of 1885. ‘It is found thatthe 
number of school districts ‘has been reduced from 11,890 'to 275, and thatthe numberiof 
districts organized under special acts is only 46, which is-six less than were reported ‘the 
previous years There has been a decreaseof494-schools numbering ‘12 scholars or less;— 
schools that were not needed, but were necessarily kept up at a wasteful expenditure of 
public funds under the old system. ‘Included im‘this number there were a few schools 
numbering more than 12:scholars. From ‘the same cause, the average length of ‘the 
schools for'the whole State the past year has been’ 22:39 weeks, while the previous ‘year 
we had but 20.37 weeks. ; 
If we multiply this average increase of 2/02 ‘by 2,276, the number of ‘schools ‘in the 
State, we shall have 4,598, which shows the total number of weeks of increase which the 
new law has given to the schools of the State. 
The length of the village snot materially varied from previous years, but 
the outlying ‘schools have incre in’ towns which have united ‘their-small schools, 
from one-third to double their former length. 
The number of enrolled scholars given in’ the report of 1886 is'64,219, while this year 
we have only 60,770. ‘This apparent decrease has resulted from the “opening of paro- 
chial schools, and from the’ more accurate returns of ‘the school boards. 
The number of teachers employed in the public'schoots under ‘the new law is'679 less 
than under the old. The average wages of male’ teachers per month’ the past year has 
been $41.03, The year previous it was $40.22. The average wages of female teachers 
the past year has been $24.46 per month, as against $2: the year’before, “There‘have 
been 154 towns in which teachers from normal schools have been employed ‘the past 
year, and only 142 the year previous. ‘The average attendance to each school of the 
State’ has increased from 16.16 in 1886 ‘to'18.73 in 1887. "These are some of oe results 
of the new law. 
        
      
   
    
    ‘The new school law has run the gauntlet of misrepresentation and abuse fora es and . 
has come forth stronger in itself and in the number of its friends than when it-entered 
upon its course. No law ever encountered, at the outset, bitterer or more groundless « 
prejudices than this, and none ever disarmed opposition more quickly, and demonstrated 
its power to benefit the State. 
The town reports, with hardly an exception,—and many of them were prepared by 
boards hostile to the law when elected,—comment favorably upon the results of the new 
system. There has been'a more equitable distribution of educational opportunities than 
formerly, and, as a rule, better teachers have been employed and:more noaceeli) be 
vision given to their work. 
FREE TEXI-BOOKS. 
By an act passed in 1883, any town or district may, at any lawfal meeting, raise money, 
by taxation or otherwise, for supplying the scholars in the comraon. schools-with snita- 
ble text-books free of charge. A number. of towns and cities in {he State ‘have adopted 
the law, and have been more than satisfied with the results. It has been found that 
school boards could . purchase books for all the scheols at less than two-thirds the cost 
to private parties; that the plan gave to boards an easy method of securing a uniform 
system of text-books; enabled them to reduce thenumber of classes to reasonable limits, 
and so enhance the educational value of a majority of the schools, 
  Superintendent Patterson recommends’ that the free text-book law be made compul- — 
sory instead of permissive, that the schools may become more absolutely free to the 
poor, and more efficient and beneficial to all. 
The law is popular with teachers, parents, and scholars wherever it has been tested, 
and would seem to be the next step in the line of progress. ‘With’ this system it will be 
easier to establish consecutive courses of study, now impossible by reason of amultitude 
of different books and classes, and the scholars will be ready for work on the first day of 
school,

SANITARY SURVEY OF SCHOOL-HOUSES, 
A sanitary survey of the school-houses of New Hampshire was commenced by the State 
board of health about 2 years ago. A blank book containing 50 questions was prepared 
and sent directly to the teachers. In addition to the questions, a sketch of the ground: 
plan of the house was asked for, and a page divided into squares was appended in order 
that the teacher might be able to draw the plan readily to any given scale. 
The questions embraced all the important points connected with school-house sanita- 
tion. The size of the school-house, also the size of the different rooms, was obtained by 
actual measurement, and by a comparison of these in the report their accuracy was ina 
meagure proved. Reports were received from 1,228 sthool-houses.- 
A study of these reports proves conclusively that the school-houses of the State were 
constructed without any reference to the amount of air space which science and experi- 
ence have proved necessary for the welfare of the pupil. The average cubic air space per 
seat for all the schools reported upon is 173.8 feet, whereas 250 is the smallest tolerated 
by any standard authority, and then should be accompanied by suitable provisions for 
ventilation, a condition not fulfilled by the school-houses of New Hampshire. The aver- 
age cubic air space per seat does not reach 250 feet in a single county in the State, the 
nearest approach to it being in Hillsborough County, where it is 244 feet. 
The amount of lighting or window area necessary for aschool-room has been variously 
estimated at from one-sixth to one-third of the floor space.. In 1,068 school-rooms in 
New Hampshire, however, the lighting area is less than 16} per cent. of the floor area, 
and in 488 rooms it does not exceed 10 per cent., and in 26 rooms it is 5 per cent. and 
under. Moreover, the windows are badly placed. If it had been the direct object to 
destroy the eyesight of the pupils, better plans could not have been produced than evi- 
dently exist in regard to location of windows in these rooms. Thearrangementin most 
of the rooms is abominable, and can not fail to have an exceedingly bad effect upon the 
eyesight of the scholars. In 402 rooms there are windows directly in front of the pupils, 
a condition which should be prohibited by the strictest law. In 271 rooms light is ad- _ 
mitted from all sides, and in 781 from three sides. 
It is universally conceded, continues Superintendent Patterson, by all experts in 
school hygiene that, whenever possible, light should be admitted from one side only, and 
in no case from more than two sides of the room. In the latter case it must be in such 
a manner as not to produce cross lights. 
Under the circumstances, then, it is no wonder that 600 near-sighted pupils are re- 
ported. 
The condition of the public school-houses with regard to water supply, privies, ccl- 
lars, heating, and drainage is equally unsatisfactory; in short, it may be said without 
exaggeration that the revelations of these reports are well calculated to excite alarm in 
the minds of persons sensible of the importance of good sanitary surroundings for school

[From Educational Report of Trinidad Alarid, Territorial Auditor, for 1888-87.] 
No complete statistics of education in New Mexico have been collected since the 
United States census of 1880. Those en in the educational report of the Territorial, 
auditor for 1886-87, a summary of which appears below, are not only very defective as 
regards the number of counties reporting, but bear internal evidence of unreliability. 
The school population (five to tweuty years) is less than that reported by the census of 
1880, one county reporting a school population of only one-fourth.of the enrolment. 
Sierra County reports an average daily attendance more than three times as large as the. 
enrolment. ; ’ 
Superintendent Parker, of that county, makes some very pertinent suggestions tend- . 
ing to more complete and accurate reports by teachers and school officials.

‘ GROWTH OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
The above figures, incomplete and unsatisfactory as they are, establish the fact that 
there has been within a few years a notable improvement in educational affairs in New 
Mexico. The enrolment in nine counties during the past year was nearly three times 
as great as that of the whole Territory in 1880, and a corresponding advance in other 
respects may be noted. Seven years ago there existed scarcely anything deserving the 
name of a public school system; only about 4 per cent. of the population were enrolled 
in the public schools against an average of over 20 per cent. for the United States. There 
are now probably about 1:2 per cent. enrolled, and a well-defined school law in operation 
which will serve as a pend na to the further development of an organized and unified 
system. 
PRESENT CONDITION. 
In regard to the present condition of the schools Governor Ross says in his annual re- 
port: ‘* There has been a marked improvement in the educational affairs of the Terri- — 
tory during the past year. ‘There is a growing appreciation among the native people of 
the necessity and advantages of acquiring an education in the English language, and 
in the American methods of thought and of business and general affairs. 
“4 compulsory school law was enacted by the last Legislative Assembly, which, though 
crude, is 4 step in the right direction, and its general effects will be good. ‘The number 
of public schools has been largely increased throughout the Territory, and the attendance 
improved correspondingly, as has also the general morale of the system, The public

154 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
¢ a school system is assuming a condition of coherency which has not characterized it here- 
tofore. The superintendents are generally intelligent, educated gentlemen, with good 
capacity for organization, and devoted to their work, and the good results of that work 
are manifest in the reasonably rapid improvement, often under adverse circumstances, 
which is observable.” . 
One of the most encouraging signs is the increased interest in education noted in the 
reports of the county superintendents. In San Miguel County “the attendance is two 
times, and in many places three times as much as ih previous years.”” In Sierra County 
the superintendent visited a school, and ‘‘ before the close of the afternoon session, not 
Jess than fifteen persons, parents, relatives, or friends of the pupils, visited the school. 
* * * With such sentiments prevailing among the people a proper enforcement of a 
good school law must produce great results for good in the near future.” 
  COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE, 
The compulsory school law contains no requirement as to age, leaving all the ‘‘school 
population,’’ i. ¢., those from 5 to 20 years of age, to come within its scope. With re- 
gard to the character and effect of this law Superintendent De Bann, of Socorro County, 
writes: ‘‘The new compulsory (?) school Jaw, although imperative, is having a good ef- 
fect in some districts. where it is thoroughly understood, and at least has proven thata 
proper compulsory law would have the desired effect and cause a better attendance. In 
many of the native districts it has been customary for parents to keep their children, 
* away from school for frivolous reasons, such as doing small chores, ete., and the teachers 
and directors have heretofore been unable to puta stop to the abuse; but now a threat to 
resort to the so-called compulsory law has the desired effect quite frequently, and com- 
pels a better attendance. While it is'true that many of these people are very poor and 
almost unable to live without the work of their children, especially of those who have 
reached an age when their labor is of some value, yet even the parents in many in- 
stances are beginning to appreciate the fact that in at least an ordinary education lies 
all hope for an improvement of their condition. It is possible that in the near future © 
- acompulsory law, not quite as crude as the last attempted legislation, will be passed, 
in which case the lawmakers might conclude that five years is too tender an age to com- 
pel children to regularly attend school. They will learn more at home, devoting even 
Jess than one hour a day to their simple studies; and when it is considered that some | 
‘districts aré milés in extent and but sparsely settled, such a law is not only cruel, but 
impossible of enforcement.’ . 
TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
Superintendent Parker also reports: ‘‘Only one pupil in the county has been in- 
structed in physiology during the year. . Instruction in this subject and in the effects of 
“alcohol and tobacco on the human system, I deem of the greatest importance, and in 
compliance with the recent act of Congress on this subject I have determined to require 
of teachers a thorough knowlédge of these branches.” 
PRIVATE SCHOOLS, 
The public school system continues to be supplemented largely by private schools in 
which all the branches of,a good English education ate taught. The Catholic‘Church 
supports fifteen such schools in different parts. of the Territory. According to Governor 
Ross the capacity of these schools ranges from 40 to 300 pupils. and they are generally 
well patronized and successful. 
* The value of private school property in Santa Fé County is $150,000 against $27,100 
for public school buildings. 
SCHOOL LANDS, 
“The ustial provision for school lands,’’ says Governor Ross, ‘‘ applies to this Terri- 
tory as to all others. But they, being in no sense the property of the Territory or under 
its jurisdiction, no steps have been taken or can be taken: for their utilization. Ordi- 
narily the Territory on admission into the Union would be entitled to 4,305,920 acres 
for school purposes, but this amount will of course be materially diminished by the 
appropriation of some millions of acres to the satisfaction of grants made hy the Spanish 
and Mexican Governments prior to the acquisition of the country by the United States, 
There will still be left, however, over 3,000,000 acres to the school fund of the State— 
sufficient for the very handsome endowment of schools, even after discarding from the 
estimate the worthless and inaccessible lands lying in mountain ranges, if the trust shall 
be honestly and propertly administered.”

ey NEW YORK. 
[lvom Report for 1886-88 of State Superintendent Andrew 8. Draper.) | 
The total expenditure for common schools excecded that of last yoar by neatly half a! 
mmillion dollars; nearly 97 per cent. of this increase belongs to the cities. Of the ittcrease 
in the value of school property, less than 1 per cent. is reported from the towns.   
CONDITIONS OF EDUCATIONAL WORK IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. 
In the citi would be expected, the greatest energy and vigot are manifest in the 
cities and larger villages. Here extensive buildings, with such modern appliances as ex- 
perience has shown to be most essential to school purposes, are provided; and instract+ 
ors, who enjoy what amounts to a life tenure of office with fair contpensation paid at 
regular and stated intervals, are employed. The terms cover about forty weeks each 
year.. The text-books are uniform in all the schools subject to the same management, 
and are the latest and best in the world. The courses of study are systematically ar- 
tanged: There are incentives to promotion and graduation. The schools are commonly 
supervised by competent superintendents, who perform ‘their work intelligently and 
thoroughly. ‘These superintendents form a sort of enthusiastic and progressive educa- 
tional brotherhood; they are in frequent communication, either directly or through ed- 
ueational journals; they hold conferences at least. annually for the discussion of matters 
involved in their work; and they are quick to seize upon suggestions which give promise 
of good results. The outcome of this is that in the schools under theit supervision there 
is very general similarity in the methods and system employed, and these are ordinarily 
of proved and acknowledged Hence, ‘ 
Yet school work in great cities is encompassed with innumetable perplexities. The 
conditions of life among the people are widely different in all localities, but these dif+ 
ferences are multiplied and intensified in great and thickly settled communities. AJL 
classes meet in the publicschools. The schools arelarge. The grading and classification 
of pupils are necessarily close and arbitrary. Individuality disappears, and there is 
small opportunity to bestow special care upon those personal traits of character and 
genius which in smaller and less mechanical schools are developed and cultivated so ad- 
vantageously. The exactions and cotitroversies of politics unfortunately encroach more 
upon the administration of school affairs in large places than in small ones. The people 
are farther removed from the schools, and they manifest less interest in them because 
they have less responsibility and power in managing and directing them. It not infre- 
quently happens, also, that the law gives the granting of appropriations for the exten- 
sion or even the maintenance of a city school system with the common council, or some 
board which, in either case, was chosen without any reference to the schools, and which 
seems bound to offset its extravagances in other directions with severe parsimony co 
the schools. 
In the country.—But nearly half the children of the State ate in the rural disttiots. 
Here the schools are very much smaller, and of course there are many more of them. 
There are 11,253 school districts in the State outside of the cities. Of these there are 
82 in which the entire property of the district has an assessable valuation of less than 
$5,000. There ate 407 districts in which the valuation is under $10,000; 1,578 districts 
are under $20,000; 2,423 districts have a valuation above $20,000 and wider $40,000; 
and 7,252 districts have a valuation above $40,000, It necessarily follows that in agreat 
many districts the tax rate inust be-large or the receipts must be excessively small and 
the people very commonly feel poorer than they really are. In many cases the school- 
houses are cheerless and entirely unfit for use, but it seems as though the legislation of 
Jast year must work a reform in this direction. In these rural schools the work done 
depends almost exclusively upon the character and capability of the teacher. There is 
“system ’’ to fall back upon, no machine which will turn out passable work, whether 
orno. If the teacher is discerning and bright and enthusiastic, results will frequently 
be attained which surpass any accomplished in the great. schools; if indifferent, the re- 
sults are of no consequence. Good teachers will of course soon find places in the larger 
and wealthier districts, All teachers are entitled to consideration, for their work is 
trying and exacting; but this is more strikingly so of those in the cross-roads districts 
than elsewhere. ‘Their pay is small; prior to the legislation of last year it was received 
only after many months of labor, and the wrong is not yet altogether set right. Their 
work is not confined to a single ‘grade; they. must meet the requirements of all grades 
and all classes. ‘They niust lay out their own course of study, if they have any.. Text- 
books are frequently antiquated; there is no uniformity, even in the same school, and 
frequently notin the same class, and the teacher finds it impossible to work an improve- 
meit. The school is very likely maintained only twenty-eight weeks in the year, just 
long enough to share in the public moneys. Attendance is irregular.” Trustees ‘drive     
   
       
-P-A-G-E-156
    156 “ EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87, 
hard bargains, for the number of young persons who want the place is very Jarge. Con- 
_, tinual change in the teachers is the order of the day. ‘The time of the employment is 
but for a single term, and. frequently the trustee undertakes to make it by the day or 
the week, in order that he may be free to make a change at any time, or that he may 
withhold pay, in violation of the spirit and intent of the statute, for the week occupied 
in attendance upon a teachers’ institute. Supervision amounts to little or nothing, for 
distances are great, during a good part of the year roads are impassable, and it is 
physically impossible for the commissioner, with generally more than one hundred 
schools under his charge, to visit each very frequently. 
In view of the foregoing considerations, Superinteadent Draper recommends for serious 
inquiry, first, whether it would not be well to lengthen the term of office of sole trustees, 
or to provide that in all cases there should be at least 3 trustees, 1 of whom only should 
go out each year; or second, whether it is not advisable to discontinue the district as the 
unit of school government and unite all the schools of a town under one management 
and support them all by a common tax; and third, whether teachers should not be em- 
ployed at the beginning of the school year for the whole year, unless removed within 
the year for cause, on account of moral delinquency, of improper conduct, or of being 
unable to properly fill the position. 
ATTENDANCE. 
There is a large uneducated class in the State, and our statistics show that it is grow- 
ing larger. The attendance upon the schools does not keep pace with the advance in 
population. Recent legislation forbids the employment of children under 13 years of 
age in any manufacturing establishment, but no adequate provision is made for gather- 
ing them into the schools, and the number of children in the streets grows more rapidly 
than the number in the schools. Indeed, nothing practical has ever been done in this 
State by way of compelling attendance upon the schools. The result is sadly apparent 
and the premonitions are full of warning. Some occurrences of the last year have par- 
ticularly aroused public interest in the matter and point to the wisdom of painstaking 
consideration and vigorous action. 
To be sure, we have a compulsory education law upon our statute-books, but it is a 
compulsory law which does notcompel. It has never been acted under to any consider- 
able extent, and, this being so after 14 years of trial, it is fair to presume that it never 
will be. In my opinion there are good reasons why it has never accomplished what was 
desired of it. In the first place it requires members of boards of education to look after 
and apprehend delinquent children, and it is unreasonable to expect that of elected 
only to manage the schools, and who serve without pay, will devote the ne ry time, 
or that they will engage in work which should devolve upon a policeman or constable, 
or some other officer specially charged with and paid for such service. Again, the pen- 
alties provided for in the actrun mainly against children, and no people will be swift to 
enforce penalties against children for delinquency, not amounting to crime, for which 
they are not so properly answerable as are their parents or guardians. The penalties in 
the act which go against parents are mere fines, so inconsiderable as to be ridiculous, and 
the machinery provided for collecting them is too cumbersome and expensive to be com- 
monly made use of. Moreover, the act requires that children under 14 years of age should 
attend for at least fourteen weeksin the year. Attendance for sosmall a part of the year 
is hardly of enough importance to justify any serious effort to insureit. Again, the law 
does not require communities to act in the matter, nor does it provide any adequate school 
facilities for the accommodation of delinquents if brought in. : 
ARCHITECTS’ PLANS FOR SCHOOL-IOUSES, 
Chapter 675 of the Laws of 1887 directed the State superintendent to secure and pub- 
lish the most improved designs for school-houses to cost from $600 to $10,000, to accom- 
pany them with appropriate suggestions in relation to the preparation of the grounds, 
and the arrangement of the building with reference to heating, ventilating, sanitation, 
ete., and then to publish for gratuitous distribution. In carrying out this direction, I 
invited competition among architects and secured the presentation of fifty-eight differ- 
ent designs distributed in six classes. The most artistic and perfect designs will be 
published as early as practicable, and it is confidently expected that as a result of this 
movement the coming years will witness a greatly improved class of school-houses in 
the rural districts of the State. 
PROMISE OF AN EDUCATIONAL RE-ORGANIZATION. 
There seems to be unmistakable promise of an educational re-organization and revival 
in this State. Public occurrences during the year have forced the subject upon the at- 
tention of the people. Our supervisory officers and teachers are coming more and more 
to realize the importance, as they are striving more and more earnestly to accomplish 
the organization of a comprehensive, symmetrical, and harmonious State educational

GENERAL STATEMENT. 
The general advance of the schools during the past year has been very satisfactory. 
Fifteen new school districts have been formed, making the present number 2,281. The 
increast in number of schools has been 379, making the total at present 21,062. The in- 
erease in number of graded schools has been 357, making the present number 9,444. 
Four superintendents have been added to the work of school supervision, making the pres- 
entnumber115, The increase in number of teachers has been 519; male teachers 340, and 
female teachers 179, making the present total 23,822. There has been aslight increase in 
the average monthly salary of male teachers, and a small decrease in the ayerage monthly 
salary of female teachers, The average monthly salary of male teachers is $38.53, and of 
female teachers $29.86. The length of school term is steadily advancing. The average 
term is now 7.75, an increase of 32, The increase in number of pupils, excluding Phil- 
adelphia, has been 9,235. Many new and excellent school buildings have been erected 
throughout the Commonwealth,

State appropriation. —The increased appropriation of $500,000 to our public schools ought 
to give great encouragement to our educational work, r moving the necessity of too severe 
local taxation, In our centres of advanced cnlture, it is true, schools will be vigorously 
carried forward atany cost. Here the public sentiment is suchas to enforce a proper at- 
tention to the young. But in the many sections of the Commonwealth where the bene- 
fits of intellectual discipline are not so fully recognized, schools will not advance if made 
to depend too largely upon local taxation. Here the absence of culture shows itself in’ 
the want of interest in the same. In our judgment, therefore, the increased appropria- 
‘tion will greatly aid the department in bringing the schools, especially of such sections, 
up to a higher Standard of efficiency. ‘There must he care, on every hand, that the in-

Minimum school term—six monihs.—We are gratified that at last the minimum school 
term has extended to 6 months. The teachers of the State have been urging this for 
years, By the Act of May 8, 1854, the minimum term was fixed at 4 months, and so 
it continued for 18 years. By Act of April 9, 1872, it was extended to 5 months, and so 
continued until this year. It is surprising thatduring all this time about 800 townships 
or school districts, embracing nearly 6,000 schools, failed to increase the term a single 
day. 5 
1 must not be supposed for a moment that the Legislature, in fixing-the minimum 
term now at 6 months, intended to favor so short a term or to establish it as a proper 
standard. . The aim of the Jaw is to lengthen short terms, not to shorten long terms; and 
it is an encouraging fact that our average school term is quite. beyond what has been 
fixed as the minimum term, and is steadily advancing. 
‘Fhe benefits of this law must be apparent to any one. It will give, during the coming 
year, one additional month of school discipline to over 225,000 children itt Peansylvania, 
We must guard against weakening the benefits of this law to teachers as well as to chil- 
dren. Directors should not make the teachers bear the burden of this effort to advance, 
by lowering their monthly salaries so as to make the cost the same as before. Any con= 
duct of this kind will rapidly show its evil effects. Good teachers will be driven to 
  other and more advanced districts, and a lazy indifference soon characterize the district | 
in which it is practiced. We are satisfied, however, that only in rare cases will any such 
eourse be pursued. On the contrary, we feel convinced that it will not be long before a 
school of only 6 months will be regarded as an anomaly. 
Employment of children.—The act prohibiting the employment of children under. 
12 years of age to work in or about mills, manufactories, or mines, should insure, in 
many localities, largely increased school attendance of children under the age named. 
'To be made properly effective, this law should be supplemented by legislation requiring 
a careful school census under direction of the authorities of each school district in the 
Commonwealth, and providing for the appointment.of inspectors, whose duty it shall be 
to see that its provisions are not violated by employers. _ Thus fortified, and the law 
properly enforced, it would prove a vast boon to the children and result in great good to 
the State. 
The act referred to is as follows: 
‘Suc. 1, Be it enacted, ete., That it shall be unlawful for any person, persons, firms, 
companies, associations, or corporations, to employ any child under the age of 15 years 
to do any work in or about any mill, manufactory, or mine in this Commonwealth. 
“Sc. 2. That any person, persons, or corporations who may violate this act shall, on 
conviction, pay a fine of not less than $20, nor more than $100, at the discretion of the 
court. Said fines, arising from the violation of this act, shall be paid to the treasury 
-of the proper county where said violation shall occur.”’

ATTENDANCE. 
The falling off in attendance the past year is due to two prominent causes: first, the 
prevailing sickness throughout the State, and secondly, the negligence upon the part of 
the authorities of certain places in enforcing the compulsory law. 
Seldom has a single year witnessed such widespread sickness throughout the State. 
In not a few. towns or localities schools have been closed for absolute lack of pupils, and 
in other cases the absentees for this cause have often numbered half the school.. The 
diseases have seldom been of a violent nature and but few deaths have occurred among 
the school children, bit the work of the schools has been very greatly interfered with, 
and the average attendance brought down quite low, 
' The average is also very materially affected by the rule, which is quite generally en- 
forced now, that when a child is sick with any of the ordinary zymotic diseases all of 
the other children of the same family are to be excluded from school. At first sight 
such a rule may seem rather harsh, but a little reflection will convince one that such a 
course is in the interest of the general health, and hence of every one. There is no 
question but that such a rule, strictly carried out, will tend to restrict such diseases to 
comparatively narrow limits, and even to aid rather than hinder the school work. 
. As regards compulsory attendance, the truant law is ignored and practically nullified 
in the city of Providence and some other places, This is due in the main to indifference, 
         
-P-A-G-E-160
  EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 150 
Dy the terms of the law its enforcement is made very largely dependent upon those who 
have had little or no interest in the question of education, and who, therefore, can be ex- 
pected to have but very limited knowledge of the issues involved and the necessity for _- 
action. Again, the enforcement of any such law will inevitably at times and in places 
interfere with the persdnal interests of parties holding prominent positions or exercising 
considerable influence, and the official finds it easier to yield to such influences than to 
withstand them. But back of these causes lies the fact that as yet the people have not 
become sufiiciently aroused to give voice to their belief. ‘There has not been a sufficient 
‘recognition of the necessity for action, or that any great number were in real need of 
the Jaw’s intervention in their behalf. When the facts come to light, public sentiment 
will demand a more thorough enforcement of the law. 
Asufiicient time has not elapsed since the enactment of the revised truant law to say 
definitely how beneficial the changes have been. It should have, however, the effect of 
guialating attendance, as did the original truant law enacted four years previously. 
in every town there is now at least one truant officer, and a truant ordinance has been 
enacted. The machinery for carrying the law into general effect therefore exists. But 
it is to be noted that in some places it is almost, if not quite worthless, for the lack of 
any suitable provision for the compensation of the truant officer. Still, if only the 
meagre amount of work be done, for which provision is made, that will have a very 
healthful effect, and if even that be maintained much good can be accomplished. Be- 
eutse the whole work can not be done is a very poor reason for not beginning it and 
doing what can be done. 
5 NUMBER AND SIZE OF SCHOOLS. 
The number of ungraded schools has diminished by 7 during the year, while the 
graded schools have increased by 32. This shows that the movement of the popu- 
lation is still from the farms and rural sections of the State to the centres, and that the 
advantages of education are being curtailed for those who remain. For it seldom hap- 
pens when a district becomes so sparsely settled as to be no longer able to maintain a 
school, that there are no children left there; hence, when the school is abandoned, the 
two or three who survive are obliged to travel two, three, or more miles, or go without 
an education. There is an evil here that can be met only by adopting some scheme or 
plan of school maintenance different from that which so generally prevails in the towns 
of the State. In such cases the locality or district is absolutely unable to make the 
proper provision for the children, and. unless the unity of interest and responsibility, 
which really inheres in the town and State, be recognized and acted upon, they will go 
uncared for. ‘ : 
The increase in the number of graded schools is partly accounted for by the fact that 
in several communities additional schools have been provided, thereby relieving schools 
greatly overcrowded. This has been done to such an extent as to reduce the average 
number belonging to each teacher from 35 to 33, 
TEACHERS. 
There has been an increase this year of 35 in the number of different teachers, and 
of 40 in the number regularly employed. It is an encouraging sign to note that 
the gain in permanent teachers is the greater of the two. It shows a tendency to per- 
manency that is desirable, and it also indicates that correct views as to the proper num- 
ber of pupils for one teacher are beginning to prevail. No teacher can do passable work 
with from 50 to 75 pupils, and it is an act of cruelty to both teacher and pupils to com- 
pel them to make the attempt. 
There has been an increase in the wages of teachers of $2.82 per month for males and 
53 cents for females. These results are probably due in great measure to the effects 
upon the smaller towns of the increased State appropriations. They have been enabled 
in many cases to offer sufficient inducements to normal graduates and teachers of ex- 
perience to hold them, and thus have been secured unusual advantages. One effect of 
this has been that at no time during the year have there been any such teachers waiting 
for places. The demand has always been ahead of the supply. 
FREE PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 
The number of public libraries has been increased by two, and there are now pending 
action for organization several libraries in various parts of the State, so that it may be 
safely said that the general interest in this branch of the work was never greater than 
at the present time. 
The total amount appropriated for the aid of the thirty-seven libraries was $3,950. 
The total number of books in all the libraries was 133,484, an increase of 10,442 vol- 
umes from last year. Lhe circulation is 298,212, or 6,004 less than for the previous
-P-A-G-E-161
  ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—RHODE ISLAND. 161 
year. The falling off is mainly in the two largest libraries, those of Providence and 
Pawtucket, while in the smaller libraries the circulation was fairly well maintained. 
It is impossible to explain these fluctuations in the circulation of the libraries, but un- 
less they are of a much more serious character than any yet noticed, they afford no cause 
of apprehension. It is probable that any series of years will show a gain, either for the 
whole number, or in the case of any individual library, unless some special circumstances 
have intervened to bring about a different result. 
The number of new patrons enrolled during the year was 6,422, about 400 more than 
last year. This shows that the libraries are interesting more and more of the people 
each year. ‘To besure they may not hold them all steadily, but having once availed 
themselves of the privileges, they will ever and again return. 
SCHOOL ACCOMMODATIONS, 
In connection with the subject of the enforcement of the Truant and Absentee Law, 
there has frequently arisen that of accommodations for the children. In a number 
of instances it has been openly claimed that the school-houses would not hold all 
that would seek admission if the law were to be thoroughly enforced, and that, there- 
fore, there was nothing to do but let it go. Again, it not infrequently happens that a 
school-house becomes utterly unfit for use, and still the majority of the voters will re- 
fase to make any provision for better accommodations, claiming that it is ‘‘as good as 
they had,’’ or that they have no use for it and they don’t care whether there is any 
school or not. It has happened that there was but one voter in a district where there 
were over fifty children, and if he declined to move, it was absolutely impossible to raise 
the necessary funds to make the school-house fit for occupancy. 
If the State is to make provision as she does for the education of all the children of 
suitable age within her borders, it would seem as though they should be furnished with 
the opportunity to obtain that education; that no false policy of economy on the part of 
a town, or selfish indifference on the part of a few persons who happen for the time to be 
in a majority in a district, should stand in the way of providing fit and abundant ac- 
commodations for them. 
From the beginning, the law of Rhode Island has recognized the importance of this 
point and has made partial provision for securing its proper care. Where the district 
system prevails, the town school committee are made the judges of the fitness of the 
school accommodations to the extent of determining whether they are suitable, but not ° 
as to their extent. If in their judgment a school-house is unfit for use by a school, they 
have power to condemn it, whereupon the district can no longer draw any portion of the 
“*public money’? for the support of its school. In this way the State has sought to compel 
districts to live up to their responsibilities, and it has unquestionably in many cases, 
both directly and indirectly, accomplished its purpose. 
But there are instances where even the alternative of the loss of the school would not 
move the hard-hearted tax-payer. Moreover, under the town system there is no’ such 
opportunity for compulsion, as there is no one between the committee andthe town. It 
is therefore necessary, in order to carry out the ideas of the founders of our system, that 
the laws be so amended that in case of obdurate municipalities or districts refusing to 
confofm to the demands of the properly constituted authorities in these matters, they 
may be compelled to give heed thereto. 
GENERAL CONDITION OF THE SCHOOLS. 
The general condition of the schools, in spite of many exceptions and some glaring 
ones, is probably better than at any previous time. The last two examinations for en- 
trance tothe Normal School have shown that the general standard of scholarship is rising 
in the State, the last one in particular being remarkable for the excellent showing made 
by pupils from the ungraded schools. 
Evidences of a more thorough and scientific teaching are to be found on every hand. 
‘Che graduates of the Normal School are being more generally employed in the district or 
ungraded schools. The new teachers’are not so much superior to the old ones in extent 
and character of acquirements oftentimes, as they are in methods of teaching, and in plans 
for classifying and systematizing the work of the school. Economy of time and labor ig 
introduced, and results are secured that are very gratifying.

    168° EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
[From Report for 1886-87 of Slate Superintendent James I. Rice.] 
‘Superintendent Mice visited every county in the State during the year, and delivered 
addresses upon the subject of free schools. He reports that the people are more thor- 
oughly aroused than ever to the duty of elementary training for their children. _ More 
money is devoted to this object than to any other department of the State government. 
The public school system in its present form has been the growth of a decade. Ten 
years ago a 2-mill property tax and a poll-tax were imposed. Since then much good 
work has been accomplished; the foundations for a system of universal education have 
been laid broad and deep. Such systems are a growth, however; they must take ‘into 
account the genius of the institutions, and be accommodated to the habits, resources, 
and hopes of a people. They cannot be forced except into an unhealthy development, 
Time must be given for adjustment. On this account progress has been slow, and hasty 
legislation avoided. The situation, however, is now clear, and the time has arrived to 
give to the children a good elementary school in every neighborhood in the State, The 
superintendent recommends the following legislation in order to accomplish this: 
(1) An annual voluntary district tax, sufficient to give 10 months’ school and free 
tuition to every child. Many school districts have been already formed under special 
Acts among the more thickly populated communities, and large sums of money raised 
for buildings and other purposes. A general law is now desired, to enable all the people 
of the State to organize into school districts and to tax themselves. 
(2) The amendment of the law relating to county school commissioners, requiring 
them to stand an examination conducted. by the State board of education before being 
appointed. Hitherto the office has been too often bestowed as a reward for party service, 
and as a consequence has fallen into disrepute. The county commissioner should either 
be a teacher, or one who has mastered the details and fundamental laws of the profes- 
sion. 3 
It is also recommended that his salary should be raised to $1,000, and that he should 
be required to devote every day to his duties. 
(8) The establishment of a State normal school or schools, at the same time fostering 
existing institutions. 
(4) The restoration of their pay to the examining boards. 
The statistics show a falling off in enrolment and average daily attendance as com- 
pared with the preceding year. This decrease is more apparent than real. ‘There was 
an error in the return of Berkeley County for 1885-86, doubling the figures; moreover, 
the schools of Georgetown County were closed during the scholastic year 1886-87 by 
an Actof the Legislature. Superintendent Ricesays that the returns for the next school 
year will demonstrate the fact that there has been an increase in enrolment and attend- 
ance. 
[vom the message of the Governor to the General Assembly. 
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
There is an apparent decrease in the enroiment, and, therefore, in the average attend- 
ance of the public schools for the year 1886-87. This is due to the closing of the schools 
of Georgetown County during the year, under the authority of an act of the General 
Assembly, and to an error in the last return from Berkeley County.: ‘There is beyond 
question in the schools generally throughout the State a gradual and constant annual 
inerease in the number enrolled and a corresponding increase in the average attendance. 
This desirable result has been reached notwithstanding the short crops and the low 
prices of the past few years. The people of the State are more aroused upon this im- 
portant subject of education than ever before in their history, and the next report of the 
superintendent will, in his opinion, vindicate this assertion. They demand longer terms 
-and more thoroughly trained teachers. There should be a general act providing for 
local taxation to supplement the school fund wherever the tax-payers of a community 
desire the establishment of schools of a higher grade; and liberal efforts should be 
made by the Legislature to give greater facilities for the training of teachers in schools 
specially adapted to that end. The constitution enjoins this, and the people demand it. 
The report of the superintendent urges the passage of an act to provide for more efficient 
superintendence, and the argument he advances is so clear and complete as to carry con- 
viction with it. A large amount of money is expended by the State for this most im- 
portant object—education—and it is the duty of the representatives of the people to see 
that the greatest possible amount of good is accomplished, and that a return in some 
degree commensurate with the sacrifices made by the tax-pay is secured. Nothing 
makes such a handsome return to a State as the provision made for the elementary train-

GENERAL CONDITION. 
While there are some serious defects in the public school system of Texas, it is still 
accomplishing much in the cause of education, and is making steady advances in the 
number of schools and the number of children attending them. With its large endow- 
ment in bonds and lands, half a million acres, it should become one of the most success- 
ful school systems in the United States. 
The entire number of schools maintained in the State during the year 1886-87 was 
8,987, an increase over the previous year of 267, or 3 per cent. The number of white 
children enrolled was 295,510, the number of colored children 113,150; total, white and 
colored, 408,660, an increase of about 3) per cent. The numberof teachers employed 
was 11,123, about three-fourths of whom were white. The average monthly salary of—

The entire amount expended for schools during the year was 
NEW LEGISLATION. $2,016,745. 
Teachers’ examinations.—By enactment of the last Legislature, examinations of teachers 
are to be conducted wholly in writing, and the county boards of examiners are required 
to report on oath the results of the examinations. These regulations have had very 
gratifying effects and have given universal satisfaction, Sets of questions for these ex- 
aminations were made out by the State superintendent and forwarded to the county 
examiners. The use of them, however, is entirely optional with the examiners. In 
order to sécure uniformity in the examinations throughout the State, the use of the | 
questions prepared by the State superintendentshould be required by law. 
County superintendents.—Provision was made by the Twentieth Legislature for super- 
vision of the county schools by county superintendents, and,about twenty counties have 
availed themselves of the privilege. ‘The county superintendents discharged their duties 
faithfully and efliciently, and, as the result of their work, the schools have been much 
improved, the teachers have been encouraged and enabled to perform their work more 
‘satisfactorily. Many of the counties did not appoint a superintendent because of their 
inability to secure a thoroughly competent one for the salary allowed. 
Children not enumerated.—The provision of the law that all children whose names had 
been omitted from the census rolls by the county assessors should be permitted to attend 
school in the district or community in which they live, has proved to be an eminently 
wise one, By this measure, a large number of children, who otherwise would have been 
deprived of all school privileges, through no fault of their own but on account of the 
carelessness of the county assessors, have been allowed to attend school. The number of _ 
‘names omitted from the census rolls was quite large, amounting in one county alone to 
about 1,000. 
     UNIFORMITY OF TEXT-BOOKS. 
There is a strong demand throughout the State for uniformity of text-books. In about 
25 counties much has already been done in this direction by the voluntary efforts of 
        
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
teachers and trustees, It is desirable, however, that uniformity be secured by law; at 
least in each district. 
2 FINANCIAL EMBARRASSMENT, 
The most unpleasant feature connected with the school operations for the year was the 
great deficiency of funds, or rather delay in the receipt of the funds. This deficiency 
amounted at the close of the year to more than $1,000,000, As a result, teachers were 
compelled, either to wait for weeks or months not knowing when their claims would be 
paid, or else to sell them at a heavy discount,—from 5 to 50 percent. This was a heavy 
drain upon a class poorly paid at best, and who, asa rule, were dependent upon their 
salaries for.a support, and therefore could ill afford either to hold their claims or to have 
them discounted. 
‘The causes assigned for this deficiency were as follows: 
(1) The annual apportionment is required by Jaw to be made about the middle of 
July for the scholastic year beginning September 1, not of money already in the treas- 
ury, but of money which is expected to be received during the year, and which, there- 
fore, must necessarily be a very uncertain quantity. The receipts from one source es- 
pecially—from school lands—is an exceedingly variable one. 
(2) Only a small portion of the available school fund is received before December, 
three months after the beginning of the school year. 
(3) County collectors are allowed either to pay over the school tax to the county treas- 
urer or to remit it to the State treasurer. The amount of school money collected in some 
counties far exceeds their apportionment, and consequently, if it were in the hands of 
the State treasurer, the excess could be used in paying the claims in other counties 
where the school receipts are less than the apportionments. 
(4) The postponement of the collection of the interest on land sales from January 1 
to August 1 is partly responsible for the deficiency. 
(5) There was no cash balance to the credit of the schools in the treasury at the 
beginning of the scholastic term. 
(G) The receipts from school lands for the last two years were less than in previous 
ears, 
q Superintendent Cooper recommends as a remedy for the financial difficulty either a 
Joan from the general State revenue, which was considerably in excess of the immediate 
necessities of the State government, or else a direct appropriation from the State funds, 
DEFECTS OF THE SYSTEM. 
I. One of the greatest defects in the operation of the school system of the State is the 
careless and unbusinesslike management of the school funds. This is shown by the 
discrepancies in the annual reports of the county treasurers and by the conflicting state- 
ments in the reports of the county treasurers and county judges. The amount brought 
forward on the books of the county treasurer at the beginning of the school year, Sep- 
tember 1, should correspond exactly with the amount carried forward the day before, 
August 31, the close of the last school year. But instead of being the same, it will be 
found different in eighty-one counties. In some counties this difference is quite large, 
and for all the counties it aggregates about $75,000. The amount paid to teachers, 
according to the county treasurers’ reports, is found to differ by $30,000 from the same 
amount as reported by the county judges. 
The State holds no vouchers whatever to show what has become of the school funds, 
except that so much has been paid to each county treasurer. The county treasurers 
have practically no check whatever. They are not required by law to report to any one. 
In many cases in which their attention was called to the discrepancies in their reports, 
they either gave the matter no attention or else failed to give a satisfactory explanation 
of it. 
Superintendent Cooper suggests three methods by which the disbursements of the 
public funds could be guarded more effectively. 
(1) The State superintendent might be required to inspect annually the records of 
each local disbursing officer, either personally or through inspectors appointed to assist 
him in the work. 
(2) All disbursements might be made directly from*the State treasury. This plan, 
however, would necessitate delay and some expense. 
(3) The third method is that the county superintendent or judge, at the beginning 
of each month, send to the Department of Education an estimate of the amount needed 
for that month, when the money will be forwarded to him, and at the end of the month 
forward the vouchers of the money paid out. 
II. The second defect is want of proper supervision. The town and city schools 
already have efficient supervision, but the county schools, which need it most and could 
be most improved by it, have practically no supervision at all. It is one of the duties 
of the county judges to visit the schools. but only’ three judges in the entire’State vis-
-P-A-G-E-165
ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—-VERMONT. 165 
ited all the schools in their division during the year; and, even when the duty is per- 
formed, it is done in the most perfunctory manner, so that no improvement results 
from it, It is to be hoped, however, that the legislation already made on this subject 
will correct this evil. : 
III. The third defect is lack of uniformity. There are four methods of organization 
in the county schools, four methods in the city schools, and four methods of taking the 
scholastic census. As a consequence, endless confusion and mismanagement have re- 
sulted, each officer depending upon the other for a performance of the duties. 
COMMUNITY PLAN. 
This is a feature of the school system peculiar to Texas, and a very objectionable 
feature it is. In the first place, the community has no definite geographical limits, the 
prime requisite of a school district. It can not elect its own trustees, and has no power 
to vote local taxes. It has no permanency about it, but is continually shifting from 
place to place with the population, and may entirely cease to exist. It has a tendency 
to foment local strifes and sectarian feelings, which result in the establishment ofa 
number of weak and inefficient schools, where only one strong, progressive school should 
be maintained. 
GENERAL SUMMARY. 
Although we find many defects in the operation of the school system of the State, 
they are only defects in management and can easily be corrected, so that there is every 
reason for expecting great progress in educational matters. SaysSuperintendent Cooper: 
“*Texas has some of the elements of one of the strongest free-school systems in the 
world. The endowment, in bonds and land notes, is already over $15,000,000. The 
landed endowment of the schools, if wisely managed, will yield early in the twentieth 
century $100,000,000. There are nearly half a million children, taught by more than 
10,000 teachers, enrolled in the schools during the present year. The State is rapidly 
advancing in wealth, population, and intelligence. No single element in the life of the 
people will conduce more to the progress of the State than an efficient system of public 
free schools,’?

Amended law relating to temperance instruction.—Instruction shall be given to all pupils 
in all public schools as to the nature of alcoholic drinks and narcotics, and their effect 
upon the human system. Such subjects shall be taught as thoroughly as arithmetic and 
geography, and given orally to pupils not able to read; those able to read shall be taught 
by text-books, of which at least one-fourth of their space, or twenty pages, shall be given 
to these subjects. 
Each teacher of a public school shall be required to certify that such instruction has 
been given in the school or grade presided over by him or her, before receiving any pay.

VIRGINIA 
  [From Report of State Superintendent John L. Buehanan for 1886-87.] 
Tn all the essential elements of growth, so far as they can be indicated by statistics, 
the school system of Virginia has reached this year the highest stage of development 
thus far recorded during the seventeen years of its history. More money has been ap- 
propriated and expended, more schools opened, more teachers employed, more pupils 
enrolled and in average attendance, than during any preceding year, and also a smaller 
aggregate amount due teachers at the close of the year than for the past ten years. The 
information derived from observation and the reports of school officers also indicate an 
advance all along the line. 
NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. 
. The total number of schools in operation during the year 1887 is 7,140; in 1886 it was 
6,763; increase, 377. This is regarded asa very gratifying and encouraging exhibit, and is 
due to the larger amount of money provided for the schools, the activity and fidelity of 
school officers and hers, and the larger measure of encouragement and moral sup- 
port accorded the system by the people. 
When, however, it is considered that only about 30 per cent. of the State school popu- 
lation (5 to 21 years) isin average daily attendance upon the common schools, it is quite 
evident that there is not a sufficient number of schools to meet the educational wants 
of the people. The number of pupils attending private schools does not amount to 5 
per cent. of theState school population. Therefore, for education in the common school 
branches, at least, the children of the State are dependent mainly upon the public free 
schools; and hence the only wise course to pursue is to extend their advantages as widely 
as possible. To bring the public schools within the reach of all, however, isa diffi- 
cult matter.     
DISTRICTS WITH SPARSE POPULATION. 
There are portions of the State which are but sparsely inhabited. In some sections 
there is not a sufficient number of families residing within convenient distance of any 
one point to furnish the requisite numberof puyils for a legal school, and hence they are 
practically without schools. In other neighborhcods families residing on the borders of 
districts are at too great a distance from the schools to patronize them. 
Again,as the population consists of both white and colored people, there are not a few 
districts in which there are enough of children of one race to form a school, and not 
enough of the other, and, hence, some for this reason are without schools. How to 
remedy these evils, how to supply these deficiencies,is a perplexing question. 
FORMATION OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 
It has been suggested that each magisterial district be divided into a number of school 
districts, containing approximately the same number of persons of school age (about 85), 
and receiving a proportionate share of the school funds. The principle herein involved 
is undoubtedly correct, but its practical application is attended with great difficulty. 
There is already in force a law which aims to effect this object, but itis permissive rather 
than mandatory, and for some reason has not met with much favor. 
Some sort of subdivision into school districts does and ought to prevail, but to so sub- 
divide that the same, or about the same, number of persons of school age would be con- 
tained in each district would be a difficult, though perhaps not an impossible, undertak- 
ing. But supposing such a subdivision to be made, it could not, of eourse, render scat- 
tered communities more compact, and could not, therefore, obviate the inconveniences 
above recognized. It would doubtless result in a diminished attendance upon some of 
the schools in sparsely settled districts. It would also necessitate a change in the loca- 
tion of a good many school-houses. School districts containing each the same number 
of persons of school age would vary largely in area on account of the varying density of 
population in different sections of the country. Hence, in many instances, pupils would 
be eut off by the proposed district lines from the schools which they have been attend- 
ing. Furthermore, a kind of double subdivision into school districts would be neces- 
sary in order to accommodate both the white and colored races, This necessity, it will 
be observed, constitutes a most troublesome factor in the problem, for each school dis- 
, trict of 85 pupils is entitled to but one school of the usual length of the school term. If, 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  ABSTRACTS OF SCHOOL REPORTS—VIRGINIA. 167 
then, a part of the 85 pupils are white anda part colored—separate schools being re- 
quired for the two races—the one part or the other must go without a school. To obvi- 
ate this difficulty, there must needs be one set of school districts for white children and 
another set for colored. Again, if the school districts should be so arranged as to con- 
tain, even approximately, the same number of persons of school age, a good many frac- 
tional parts of districts would be left which it would be hard to properly dispose of. 
Such are among the difficulties which would attend the effort to subdivide into school 
districts in the manner above indicated, and there are, therefore, good reasons for appre- 
hending that such a scheme would hardly prove practicable, at least, for the present. 
Possibly some other scheme of subdivision might be devised. But any scheme which 
would not require an approximately equal number of persons of school age in the sev- 
eral school districts could not furnish a basis for an equitable distribution of school 
funds, and would therefore be liable to the same objections as are conceived to lie against — 
the present system. 
Under existing laws, boards of districb school trustees, with the advice and counsel of 
the superintendents of schools, determine where and how many schools shall be opened 
in each magisterial district. Asa rule, they have gone to the limit ofthe funds at their 
  command, ‘and in not a few instances have opened schools in which the average attend- , 
ance has proved so small and irregular as to necessitate their suspension. But still 
complaints reach the central office that some neighborhoods and some families are with- 
out school facilities, and in some instances that citizens who have been paying school 
taxes ever since the inauguration of the system haye rarely, if ever, had the opportunity 
of sending to a public school. 
‘ NUMBER OF TEACHERS. 
The number of white male teachers in 1886-87, as compared with 1879-80, stands as 
follows: 
1879-80, 1886-87. 
   
      Number of white male teachers 2,416 Number of white female teacher: 2, 889 Excess of white male teachers ix 868 Excess of white female teachers in 1 
These figures show a large increase in the past ei   
ight years in the number of female 
teachers. At the same rate of increase the schools of Virginia in a few years will be 
pretty largely in the hands of female teachers. 
SALARIES OF TEACHERS. 
Superintendent Buchanan calls attention to the circumstance thatthe wages of teach- 
ers are too low, the average annual salary for the State being $173.46, 
In many rural districts the school term is not over twenty weeks (five months), and 
the monthly salary as low as $20 or $25, thus giving an annual salary of $100 or $125. 
For good teachers such salaries are far too small. But while it may be, and doubtless 
is, true that some teachers on small salaries are doing better work than ‘others who re- 
ceive twice as much, yet it can not be doubted that an increase of salaries would increase 
the efficiency of the teaching force. The laborer is worthy of his hire. ' 
But there is no possible way of increasing salaries without more money. If the num- 
ber of schools were diminished, more money could go to those that would be continued. 
But this would greatly increase the complaint about the lack of school facilities. It has 
been suggested that one teacher could teach two schools in a year—a five-month fall term 
in one place and a five-month spring term in another, and thus be oceupied twice as long 
and receive twice as much pay. The objection to this is the difficulty of securing the 
attendance of pupils. The first school would begin by the 1st of August; the last one 
- continue till the Ist of June. During a large part of each term the children in many 
places would be kept at home for work. If this objection could be obviated, the super- 
intendent sees no reason why a system of alternating schools might not work well. 
(It may be remarked that “ambulatory” schools have recently been abolished in 
Georgia. See page 127.) 
Suitable legislation is recommended to secure the prompt payment of teachers’ sal- 
aries. As few monthly school warrants have passed through the hands of shavers this 
year as formerly; perhaps less. In many counties teachers have been paid with reason- 
able promptness. ‘But there ought to be no occasion for discounting any school war- 
rant. 
The laws and regulations making the salaries of teachers in certain cases depend upon 
average attendance are cited, and the arguments pro and con as to the advantages of this 
system are given somewhat in detail’. In summing up Superintendent Buchanan doubts 
whether it would be expedient to withdraw this matter from the control of the board   
‘These arguments are quoted in another part of this Report. See Index under head of “ Teach- 
ers,

    BOS. 2 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
of education and make it a subject of special legislative enactment. The law authoriz- 
ing the board to prescribe the minimum number of pupils required to form a public 
school, is necessary to guard against a wasteful or useless expenditure of public school 
funds. A different policy in some of the States has worked badly. One annual school 
report, at least, noted the existence of schools with an average attendance of less than 
half a dozen pupils, and recommended prompt measures to correct the evil. While all 
proper effort ought to be made to guard against injudicious or useless expenditure of the 
public school funds, it would be both just and expedient to make such modifications of, 
or additions to, existing regulations as will tend to more carefully guard the interests of 
teachers, and support and encourage them in the discharge of their responsible duties. 
PHYSIOLOGY AND HYGIENE, 
The enactment of a law is recommended placing physiology and hygiene on the list of 
subjects required to be taught in the public schools. 
SENTIMENT IN RESPECT TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
Of the county superintendents reporting to the central office the state of public senti- 
ment regarding public schools, 99 report favorably, 11 report an improvement, and 4 re- 
port some opposition. 
NEW LEGISLATION, 
[From the Educational Journal of Virginia.) 
School trustee electoral boards. —Under an Act of the General Assembly, in force Febru- 
_ ary 20, 1884, the appointment of district school trustees was vested in county school 
electoral boards, composed of 3 citizens of each county, elected by the General Assem- 
bly. This law has been repealed, and the old law, providing that the county judge, 
Commonwealth’s attorney, and county superintendent of schools shall constitute the 
school trustee electoral board of each county, with power to appoint and remove trus- 
tees, has been re-enacted. 
Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, summer sessions.—Under the former law the 
summer session was fixed at 8 weeks, and county superintendents were required to re- 
yoke the license of any colored teacher in the public schools who failed ‘‘to attend one 
session, or any part of said summer course for 3 consecutive school years,’’ unless 
such teacher was excused by the board of education. The present act reduces the 
Jength of the session to 5 weeks, and relieves the teacher of the severe penalty im- 
posed for non-attendance.

WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 
The following is taken from the special report of Superintendent J. C. Lawrence to the 
Governor of the Territory: 
PROGRESS OF EDUCATION. 
“T take pleasure in reporting progress in the educational affairs of Washington Terri- 
tory for the past year. The interest taken in our public schools by patrons, teachers, 
and superintendents seems greater now than ever before. This is shown, first, in the 
amount of money raised for school purposes, in special tax and voluntary subscriptions, 
and in other means, aside from the regular tax levied in each county for the support of 
schools, by the increased amount of school furniture, apparatus, globes, dictionaries, etc., 
for the use of schools; second, by the interest teachers have taken in institutes the past 
year—a greater interest than ever before taken. Twenty counties of the 33 in the Ter- 
ritory have held institutes of from 3 days’ to 2 weeks’ duration. The majority of our 
teachers have attended these institutes. The counties failing to hold institutes were such 
as had fewer than 500 children of school age. In some instances the services of trained 
institute workers have been secured at an expense of several hundred dollars, and teach- 
ers have contributed from their own resources to meet these expenses. The new methods 
of teaching have been discussed and are being adopted. A large number of our teachers 
have had the best training the Eastern schools afford, and have had successful experience 
in the East prior to coming here. District clerks and county superintendents have taken 
pains to make full reports to this office. All these I take to be indications of greater in- 
terest in educational matters. 
“Tt is needless to say that the public schools of the Territory are in their infancy. 
Scarcely more could be expected. With 65,000 children, and a total amount raised for 
school purposes of only $500,000, only a portion of which has been used in teachers’ sal-
-P-A-G-E-169

aries, little can be expected. Indeed, I am surprised that we have made so much ad- 
vancement under the circumstances. The maximum tax for school purposes of 6\ mills 
on each dollar of assessed valuation is not sufficient, yet an increase in the tax would be 
felt.as a burden. Our hope is from another source. Until the school Jand is sold, and 
the interest on the purchase-money made a State fund, we can not expect to have our 
“schools rest on a sufficient financial basis. This alone should secure the immediate ad- 
mission of this Territory into the Union of States. - With the proceeds of the sale of the 
school lands used, as they will be when we are admitted, with the county tax now ley- 
ied, we will maintain an average of nine months’ school in each district. The present 
average duration of schools is but four and a half months. Admission means four and 
a half months’ additional schooling to 65,000 children now in the Territory.” 
SCHOOL LANDS, 
‘* The Government has set apart 2,000,000 acres for the use of our schools, but we have 
at present no control of such lands. A law, indeed, was many years ago passed by the 
Legislature, and afterwards re-enacted, authorizing the county commissioners to lease 
them to tenants, but this has naturally been but little acted upon, as there was no power 
in the premises. 
“The value of these lands varies a great deal, from $2 to $3 an acre in some localities 
to $50 and even $75 in others. I believe there is no law by which any title to these 
Jands can be vested in individuals, and I recommend that they be left in that condition 
“until the admission of the Territory as a State of the Union.”’

WEST VIRGINIA. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
[From the West Virginia School Journal.] 
Appropriations for State normal schools. —The maximum aggregate amount to be appro- 
priated to State normal schools has been raised from $2,000 to $2,200. The law in its 
amended form-does not permit any part of the amount appropriated to each school when 
not earned by it to revert to the State treasury, but authorizes the board of regents to 
use it for the payment of teachers in these schools. This provision will enable the 
board now to supply these schools with something like a sufficient corps of teachers, and 
do away with the scaling of salaries that has been suffered in the past. 
State board of examiners.—The State board of examiners is to consist of four com- 
petent persons, one from each Congressional district, to be appointed by the State super- 
intendent; their term of office is to be four years, and they are to meet at least twice in 
each Congressional district each year. 
The board thus constituted may issue two grades of certificates to such as are found to 
possess the requisite scholarship and who exhibit satisfactory evidence of good moral char- 
acter and of professional experience and ability, as follows: ‘First-class certificates, for 
twelve years; second-class, for six years. Any person holding a certificate of the first- 
class who shall have taught for eight years of said twelve years, shall be entitled, with- 
cut examination, to have the same renewed at the expiration of the said twelve years. 
The second-class, to be issued to applicants of satisfactory attainments in the branches re- 
quired for county certificates, and in addition not fewer than four other branches, to be 
determined upon by the board. 
The second-class certificates shall be issued upon application, without examination, to 
the graduates of the State Normal School and its branc! and of the State University 
when such graduates shall have presented to the board satisfactory evidence that they 
have taught successfully three years in the State under No. 1 county certificates, two 
of which said three years shall immediately precede the application for such certificates. 
Teachers who shall present to the board satisfactory evidence that they have taught 
successfully four years under second-class certificates shall be entitled to receive, with- 
out examination, first-class certificates at the expiration of the second-class. 
All certificates issued by such board shall be countersigned by the State superintend- 
ent; and such certificates shall supersede the necessity of any and all other examina- 
tions of the persons holding them by any board of examiners, and shall be equivalent 
to number one certificates granted by a county board of examiners, and shall be valid 
in any school district in the State, unless revoked by the State board for good cause. 
Sehool month.—The school month is to consist of twenty days, instead of twenty-two, 
as heretofore. j 
Temperance instruction.—The natare of alcoholic drinks and narcotics, and special in- 
struction as to their effects upon the human system, in connection with the several die

visions of the subject of physiology and hygiene, shall be included in the branches of 
study taught in the common or public schools, and shall be taught as thoroughly and in 
the same manner as other like required branches are in said schools, to all pupils in all 
said schools throughout the State. 
It shall be the duty of the proper officers in control of any school described in the fore- 
going section to enforce the provisions of this act, and any such officer, school director, 
committee, superintendent, or teacher, who shall refuse or neglect to comply with the 
requirements of this act, or shall neglect or fail to make proper provisions for the instruc- 
tion required and in the manner specified by the first section of this act for all pupils in 
each and every school under his jurisdiction, shall be removed from office, and the va- 
cancy filled as in other cases. 
No certificate shall be granted to any person to teach in the public schools of the State 
after the Ist of January, 1889, who has not passed a satisfactory examination in physiology 
and hygiene, with special reference to the nature and the effects of alcoholic drinks and 
narcotics upon the human system.

  WISCONSIN. 
NEW LEGISLATION. 
Maps.—Provision is made for distributing annually 1,400 railroad maps of Wisconsin’ 
among the schools of the State. 
Violations of the compulsory aitendance act.—Complaints for violation of the compulsory 
nttendance act may be made by any legal voter of the district, or of any town, city, or 
village, when the schools are managed by a board of education, and directly to the mag- 
istrate having jurisdiction; the section requiring school officers to prosecute under the 
act is repealed. 
Teacher’ s certificates. —(1) County superintendents are authorized to withhold certifi- 
cates from applicants known to them to be immoral in character, and are forbidden to 
give certificates to persons manifestly deficient in learning, or in ability to teach. 
(2) Second-grade certificates are to be in force two years, and first-grade certificates 
four years; the latter, however, may be limited to one year at their issue, if the appli- 
cants have had no experience in teaching, and the limitation may be removod when ex- 
perience evidences that the holders are successful and apt as teachers. 
(3) Papers of applicants for certificates written in one.county may, in the discretion 
of the county superintendent, be made the bases of certificates in another county, under 
the conditions and restrictions named. 
The State superintendent is authorized to countersign diplomas of graduates of the 
University of Wisconsin who have taken the course in the science and art of teaching in 
that institution, after the holders shall have taught public schools in the State success- 
fully eight months. Any such diploma when so countersigned shall be a certificate of 
qualification to teach in any public school of Wisconsin until annulled by the State 
superintendent. . 
School. census.—School district clerks, in addition to their present duties relating to the 
taking of the school census, will also report the names of the children from four to 
twenty-one years, and the age of each. 
Loans to districts.—School districts are authorized to borrow money to refund indebt- 
edness, so as to extend twenty years the pericd during which the loan is to be paid. 
Loans in school districts from trust funds of the State may now be made at the rate of 6 
per cent. per annum instead of 7 per cent., as heretofore demanded. 
Vote on free text-books.—Districts are required to vote directly at each annual meeting 
upon the question of providing the text-books for the use of pupils free, and levying 
a tax to meet the expense. 
Forfeiture of State school apportionment.—No apportionment will be made of school 
illage which failed to raise by tax during the preceding year 
an amount equal to that received from the State at the preceding apportionment. 
Teachers’ contracts,—Contracts with teachers are required to be in writing, and filed in 
the office of the secretary with copies of the teach certificates attached. 
Change from township to district system.—Provision is made for organizing independent 
school districts when a town having the township system votes to abolish the same, 
School libraries.—Provision is also made for a system of school libraries to be purchased 
and managed by the town officers under the direction of the State superintendent. The 
rer of each town may annually withhold from the several school districts of his 
town one-twentieth of the school fund income appropriated thereto, together with one-

WYOMING. 
The following, from the report of Governor Warren, for 1885, is the most recent gen- 
eral statement with regard to education in Wyoming in the possession of the Bureau: 
“Wyoming takes front rank in educational matters, considering her age as a Terri- 
tory. There is a strong and growing interest on the part of her citizens which cannot 
fail to keep the public schools up to the standard of our older and wealthier neighbors. 
“The Territorial school laws, among other provisions, provide for a Territorial super- 
intendent of public schools, appointed by the Governor, and a county superintendent in 
each county, elected by the electors ofthe county. Each school district elects its trus- 
teés, 3 to 6 in number, at a ‘spring meeting,’ and none can vote who did not pay poll- 
tax the fall previous. 
“The law also provides for a ‘ teachers’ institute,’ which shall hold annual meetings at 
some point in the Territory (usually in different towns in rotation), for not less than 6 
hor more than 10 days each session. Every teacher or supérintendent of public schools 
may attend, and his fare toand from the institute is paid by the Territory. When there 
are 15 or more colored children within any one district, the trustees, with the approval 
of the county superintendent, may provide fora special school. The law prohibits any 
discrimination as to pay or otherwise on account of sex in employing teachers. Although 
acompulsory law with penalty clause exists, obliging children from 7 to 16 years of 
age to attend school at least 3 months in every year, unless excused by physician’s cer- 
tificate or special excuse granted by the district board, yet not to exceed 65 per cent.    
of all the children are enrolled at public schools, because, first, in cities and towns’ 
many attend private, select, or parochial schools; and, second, outside the towns, where 
thinly populated, many families are so isolated from neighbors that schools cannot yet 
be established and maintained. This last eause is rapidly improving with settlement. 
At Cheyenne aconvent building is now being completed ata cost of between $50,000 and 
$60,000, by the Society of the Holy Child Jesus; there are also two branches of the Saint 
John’s Parochial School in Cheyenne, with about 250 scholars and valuable school prop- 
erty; also a kindergarten school with a few score of the younger children, and several 
private and select schools having from half a dozen to a score of pupils each. 
“At Laramie City the Sisters of Charity have an academy with 100 or more scholars, 
and appropriate school property of their own (they also ha ve an extensive hospital for 
the sick, at this place), and, as at Cheyenne, select and private schools are also taught. 
“Other places throughout the Territory have schools, other than public, according to 
the size of the city or town.”

  172 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
SCHOOL LANDS. 
Governor Moonlight, in his report for 1887, in common with other Governors of Terri- 
tories, calls attention to the circumstance that the school lands set apart by the General, 
Government are not yielding any revenue for school purposes, although largely utilized) 
for agricultural purposes by persons who occupy them free of rent, after fencing them 
in. The Governor makes the following recommendation: ; 
“*An act of Congress, authorizing the boards of county commissioners of the various 
counties, under the direction of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, to lease 
the school lands in their respective counties, for a term of years, and the proceeds to be 
applied to the support of the common schools of the respective school districts, pro rata, 
according to the number of school children in each district, and by the Territorial super- 
intendent of public instruction, would be the greatest boon which could be conferred upon 
the people of the Territories, and the greatest blessing which could befall the children. 
Those leasing the lands should be required to pay in advance to the respective county 
treasurers, who would he required to transmit the same to the Territorial treasurer, from 
whom it should be drawn by the Territorial superintendent of public instruction for dis- 
tribution among the school districts. The leasesshould be made to expire at the close of 
the yearin which the Territorial government terminated. The act of Congress could fix 
the minimum price for the three classes of land to be leased, viz, uplands, second bot- 
tom, and bottom or meadow lands; could prohibit the cutting of any timber for any 
purpose; prohibit the quarrying of rocks of every description, and the taking out of any 
coal, mineral, or other valuable deposit wherever found. Thus the lands would lose 
none of their original value, and in many instances would be made more valuable. 
Within the limits of the railroad-grant lands many of the school sections are now 
fenced in and used for grazing purposes and for the production of hay, which brings in 
no reyenue to the Government and no addition to the school fund, and upon which the 
* parties pay no taxes, 
‘An act of Congress placing these school landsin the hands of the county boards would 
create a local power and a local pressure, which would.compel the parties having the 
Jands fenced to pay a reasonable annual rental to the support of the public schools, or 
tear down their fences so as to give others a chance who were willing topay. The whole 
tax-paying population, outside of some of those holding the lands, and they are by far 
the fewest in number, would become the friends and allies of the Government and the 
law, and would force a compliance to the very letter. The land in Wyoming is being 
rapidly taken up, and of course the best land is usually the first taken. It is very likely 
that many of sections 16 and 36 have prior claims, and that many are deficient in area, 
and many others are so located as to be of almost no value, and as the law authorizes the 
selection of indemnity sections to be certified by the Commissioner of the General Land 
Office to the State, it seems to me that the interest of the common school fund would be 
best served by permitting this to be done during the Territorial form of government 
through the surveyor-general of the Territory, the registers and receivers of the land 
office, and the Territorial superintendent of public instruction. This would make it 
possible to select some of the good lands as indemnity before they were all taken up, and 
locating within each county its proper proportion. Iam informed that the Wyoming 
Territorial lines cut through townships so as to deprive the Territory of some 440 school 
sections, 
“The Yellowstone Park, the military reservations, and the Indian reservation deprive 
the Territory of about 200 more, and it would appear but just that the indemnity sec- 
tions be given in lieu thereof before all the desirable land shall be taken up. The grant- 
ing of the power to lease these lands would prevent the possibility of any monopoly 
control, as the people are keenly alive to the interests of education, and will sacredly 
guard and protect the common school fund, to supply which all are taxed. In this age 
of enlightment it is apparently anomalous that the Territories can not share the advan- 
tage equally with States of leasing their school lands, and at a time when this advantage 
would be most serviceable to them. I have made these suggestions with some diffidence, 
but believe they are worthy of a careful consideration.’’

  I,—ADMINISTRATION. 
The unwisdom of the district system illustrated.—Superintendent Kiehle, of Minnesota: 
“Noticing the defects of our system more in detail, I call \attention to the common 
school district. This may be known as the neighborhood plan, in which as many fam- 
ilies as can conveniently send to one school have their own officers and school-house, 
and tax their property for the education of their children. This plan prevails nowhere 
but in the country, although it is not a whit better adapted to it than to cities. The 
unwisdom of this plan would be fairly illustrated if our cities should adopt it, and pro- 
vide by law that every one, two, or more blocks might organize for the support and con- 
trol of their school affairs by a separate set of officers. If the two cities of St. Paul 
and Minneapolis should adopt the plan of the country, they would support over 500 dis- 
tricts and over 1,500 school officers; there would be some veryrich districts, with excel- 
lent schools supported at trifling cost, and there would be other very poor districts, with 
few children, poor schools and short terms, maintained at a burdensome expense. And 
this is the precise condition of things in the country. Some districts are large, rich 
and thriving; others are poor, sparsely settled, have few children, and can hardly sup- 
port a four-months school by levying the highest tax allowed by law. 
‘* There is nomore reason for having a set of officers for each school in the country than 
there is for making as many separate districts in a city as there are school buildings. 
The same rule should govern in the country that governs in cities. As the territory of 
the municipality is the territory of the school district, so the township should be the 
school district in the country; and as in the city a single board provides school privi- 
leges as they are needed, so in the township, under one board, school-houses should be 
located, teachers employed and all conveniences provided as the distribution of popu- 
lation and the progress of the children may require.’ 
Evwils of the district system in Arkansas.—Superintendent Thompson, of Arkansas, re- 
news his recommendation of a change to the township system, and says: ‘‘After two 
more years’ experience with the present law I am more firmly impressed with the wis- 
dom of the change recommended in 1884. * * * The present plan of separate, in- 
dependent districts divides the funds into such small parts, that the length of the school 
term is reduced to the minimum, and to maintain a school for three months it is neces- 
sary to employ the cheapest teacher. Theschool buildings are uncomfortable and poorly 
furnished. Some are even without any conveniences. This is the school the directors 
are forced, for want of means, to give the children in their districts. 
* Se a * * * * 
“Another‘reason for changing to the township system, is that under our statutes sep- 
arate schools must be provided for whites and blacks. In some. districts there are only 
five or ten children, for whom a school must be provided at a cost of from $25 to $40 
pert month. In the township system in the northern part of the State, schools could be 
maintained at much less cost for the few colored children who are in the township. 
The same conditions are found in many districts in the eastern and southern portion of 
the State, where there are not more than five or ten white children. There is an im- 
perative necessity for a change, if we expect to advance our schools to that degree of use- 
fulness that is desired and demanded by the spirit of the age.”

        174 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. ~ 
Not a mere passing notion.—Superintendent Raab, of Illinois, in renewing his recom- 
mendation for a change to the township system, says: ‘“‘It is not a mere passing notion 
which prompts me to urge this matter of school administration, and to ask such a sweep- 
ing modification of the existing laws, but an earnest desire to help to simplify and im- 
prove the school affairs of the State causes me to again propose a measure, which it becomes 
the more difficult to carry into effect the longer we wait. I mean the Change from the 
present district system to the township system in school administration,”’ 
Advantages of the township system.—The following synopsis of the advantages of the 
township system is given by Superintendent Thompson, of Arkansas: 
“1, The building of better and more convenient school-houses. 
“2. ‘Phe schools could be classified and graded with more ease. 
“3. Better teachers would be employed. 
**4. School terms would be longer. 
“5, Taxation would be equalized. 
“6, The school revenues would be more equitably distributed. 
“7, Equal educational privileges could be extended to all parts of the township. 
“8. Children could attend the schooi that was most convenient. 
“9, School-houses would be better furnished. 
“10, The per capita cost of education would be diminished. 
11. There would be but little uncertainty about district boundaries, 
“12, Reliable statistics and information could more easily be obtained. 
‘*13. There would be better management and supervision of the schools, 
“14, Text-books could not be so easily changed. 
“15, The school law would be simplified and better understood and obeyed.’? 
Consolidation of school districts. —Superintendent Williams, of Delaware: ‘‘There ean 
be no reasonable doubt of the practical benefits to be derived from the consolidation of 
small school districts. In district schools some of the difficulties which are met, and 
which tend greatly to impede the progress of the schools, are the large number of classes, 
in one instance numbering as high as 26 in a school of 35 scholars; the shortness of the 
school terms; the necessity in some districts of employing inexperienced teachers, owing 
to the small amount of money, and the frequent changing of teachers. These, and 
many others which might be mentioned, could be overcome by consolidating some dis- 
tricts and establishing graded schools. 
“The benefits of the consolidation of small school districts are seen in Sussex County, 
as the resulis of the commission appointed by the last General Assembly, and have been 
found highly advantageous to the cause of education.” 
Practical results of the adoption of the town system in Vermont.—Superintendent Dartt: 
“tAt the last session of the Legislature a law was passed requiring all towns having the 
district system to vote upon the question of abolishing the districts and adopting the 
“town system at the annual meetings in 1885 and 1886; the vote to be by ballot and op- 
portunity to be given for discussion. 
‘Tt will be seen irom the record that in the 2 years 16 towns voted to adopt the 
town system, and one voted to return to the district system after using the town system 
5 years.” 
‘Town superintendent of Bolton, Vt.: ‘Five years have passed since this town entered 
upon the town system, and when the people had an opportunity to return tothe old dis- 
trict system at the last annual meeting, not a single person, to all appearance, desired 
todoso. Surely a good argument for the town system, when almost a majority were 
at first bitterly opposed to it.’’ 
Of Middletown: ‘‘ We note a very decided improvement in our schools under the town 
system. It is working admirably with us and fast gaining friends. Itsadoption by our 
town is a long step in the right direction.” 
Of Grand Isle: ‘‘The town system has made many friends in this town since we 
adopted it one year ago.”’ 
Of Warren: ‘‘This is the first year under the town system, and I am satisfied that 
after we get settled into business and the people become accustomed to the new way, 
there will be no desire to return to the old district system with its unequal taxation. 
We have not had so much frictionas we anticipated. Our schools arein better condition 
than before.”?- 
A county system recommended.—Superintendent Lawhead, of Kansas: ‘‘ While there ap- 
pears to be some ground for the present agitation demanding the abolition of the district 
system and the establishment of the township plan, it is questionable whether that plan 
will he the panacea for all the ills of our school system that its advocates claim, It is true 
that under our present district system taxation is unequal; the district that is financially 
weak has, in order to secure anything like equal school advantages, to tax itself almost 
to the point of bankruptcy. Should the township plan be adopted it would not equalize 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  ; ADMINISTRATION. : Pe Pe | 
taxation fully, while it would create endless confusion in district lines, as no school dis- 
batch have been so formed as to have their boundary lines conform to the boundary lines 
l townships. It seems to me that if we are to destroy our present system 
, it would be wiser to resort to a county system, and thereby secure a 
greater degree of equalization of taxation and at the same time avoid all changes and con- 
fusion in. the boundary lines of districts, * * * Is there not danger of losing that 
general interest which we now have under’ the district system, should we pass to the 
township system and thereby place the control of our schools in the hands of afew? It 
seems to me that by a carefully considered law providing for a system of school taxation 
by the county, and the locating and building of school-houses by the same authority, 
the burden of taxation could be much more equally distributed, and the school-houses 
so located as to more fully accommodate the children than by any other system. Such 
a thing as a district financially weak would be unknown; hence, this man or that man 
would have no incentive in the way of escaping taxation to ask to be transferred from 
one district to another,’’ 
The district system the best at present for North Carolina.—Superintendent Finger: ‘‘The 
district system is, perhaps, not the best system, but as we have it, and our people are 
accustomed to it, I think best to retain it, at least for the present. The general ma- 
chinery of the system is working fairly well, and I suggest only such changes as seem 
to be necessary in the present condition of public sentiment, and considering the small 
amount of funds now raised under our statutes.” 
The State superintendent should be indepéndent.—Superintendent Baker, of Texas: ‘The _ 
superintendent of public instruction is selected with special reference to his fitness to 
conduct the educational interests of the State. The general public holds him responsi- 
ble, and it is fair to presume that he understands the duties of the position better than oth- 
ers who give those duties little or noattention. The people impose no higher trust upon 
the government than the supervision of the education of their children. I hold there- 
fore that the department of education ought to be made entirely an independent one, 
with a head not subject to the dictation of other officers, The Governor, comptroller, 
and secretary of state, the officers who compose the board of education, have enough to 
do to oceupy their whole time in discharging the duties particularly appertaining to their 
several offices, without being called upon to determine the correctness of the rulings of 
the superintendent of public instruction upon subjects with which they are in no way 
familiar. Such a power bestowed on a board cripples the influence of the superintend- 
ent, and in many instances renders him powerless to amicably settle the most trying differ- 
ences between inferior officers. The superintendent is selected by the people just as the 
Governor and comptroller are selected, and there is as much reason for a board to act 
upon the decisions of those officers as upon the decisions of the superintendent; better 
reason, if the boards were chosen with reference to their understanding of the matters 
they were to act upon. [ unhesitatingly state that the several boards of education since® 
1873, notwithstanding they were composed of gentlemen of distinguished ability and 
upright character, have been potent factors in retarding the advance of popular educa- 
tion and the successful administration of the school law.”    
    
Relation between superintendent and school committee.—Superintendent Stockwell, of 
Rhode Island: ‘‘It is extremely unfortunate for the welfare of our schools that, in the 
development in our State of the work and status of the superintendent of schools, the 
idea should have been allowed to gain a foothold that the office was in any way inde- 
pendent of the school committee, or that the occupant thereof was responsible to any 
others than the committee, for the whole theory of the office and of its duties has ever 
been to make it the medium of the committee’s actions, to give opportunity for so uni~ 
fying and simplifying the work of the committee as to make it more effective in every | 
respect, and thus to afford a éonstant and suitable medium for the expression of their 
will. 
‘* We are all aware how long it took to place the selection of the superintendent where 
it naturally should go, in the hands of the school committee, whose servant he is to be, 
and who confer upon him every particle of power or influence which he may exert. We 
have one more step to taixe before the office is placed in its true position of entire inde- 
pendence from any body or interest, save that to which-it is legitimately subject, the 
school committee. The salary of the superintendent should be fixed by the school com- 
mittee and paid upon their order, just the same as that of any teacher. In fact, the 
superintendent is but a principal teacher. Just so far as he fulfils the ideal require- 
ments of his place, does he do his best and most valuable work in teaching, both by 
precept and by example, the teachers of the town. To thoroughly discharge the duties 
of his place he must himself be a teacher. It is evident, therefore, that upon that 
ground alone the school committee are the only authority naturally fitted to determine 
the value of his services and the rate of compensation. It is to be hoped that the time
-P-A-G-E-176

    is not far distant when this change may be effected and another long step taken in the 
direction of simplifying our educational machinery and determining more clearly the 
nature and extent of the responsibility for its smooth and successful working.” 
~ II.—ScHoor CEnsus. 
The facts should be made known.—Superintendent Dartt, of Vermont: ‘‘It is a matter 
of regret surely that no provision is made by this State for the enumeration of all the 
children of school age. If there are those within our borders who are growing to man- 
hood and womanhood without any education, who do not attend school at all, the facts 
as to their number and where they are should be fully known, thateffectual means may 
be used to remedy this evil and remove the reproach from the Commonwealth.” 
We should know the facts,—Superintendent Powell, of the District of Columbia: ‘If 
education is of value as a factor in society, and if the schools are the only tangible 
measure of that value, we should know the facts by means of which an estimate may be 
made, so far, at least, as numbers of children are concerned, of the relations between 
what is accomplished and what ought to be accomplished.” 
III. —Co-EpucATIoN. 
Will become more sensible men and women.—Superintendent Fred W. Campbell, of Oak- 
land, Cal.: ‘‘ It seems to be the natural order of things that boys and girls should be 
educated together. They are together in the family, in the relation of brother and sister. 
In the co-education of the sexes in school, there are secured greater economy in instruc- 
tion, better discipline, more natural, and therefore more healthful, intellectual, and 
moral and esthetic development for both the boysand girls. The mingling of the sexes 
in the school-room checks the tendencies both to the romantic fancies and overwrought 
and unreal imaginings engendered by attendance on separate schools; and this it does 
by substituting for such illusions the every day commonplace reality of mutual rivalry 
in a common labor. Thus each forms correct and sensible judgments of the other. They 
learn that they are much alike in their natures, that they possess about the same ability 
to learn, with nearly everything yet to learn. By so much as all this is the effect of ed- 
ucating boys and girls together, by so much will they become more sensible men and 
women than by educating them separately.” 
IV.—ComPuLsory ATTENDANCE. 
A prowimate and provisional enforcement desired.—Superintendent Akers, of Iowa: ‘To 
say the least, there must be a strong presumption in favor of an educational measure in 
which all the leading nations of the world are enlisted, and which has.almost the unani- 
mous advocacy of the teaching profession, and of those public officials who are-best in- 
formed as to the necessities of the case. In face of this there is everywhere acknowledged 
difficulty in putting a compulsory school law into force. A close study, however, of this 
kind of legislation will make two things apparent, both setting aside any objection to 
the law on the score that it can not be enforced. 
“First, wherever boards of education have been empowered to employ a special officer 
or officers, whose business it should be under some systematic method of search and re- 
port, to find out the defaulters and get the children to school, the end contemplated by 
the law has been gratifyingly attained. It has been suggested that this officer be partly 
police and partly missionary in his functions, but mostly missionary, as being more in , 
keeping with the kind of work he has todo, And this suggestion brings us to the sec- 
ond most important lesson from the study we bave had in hand, namely that for the 
ends of public well being a proximate ‘and provisional enforcement of a compulsory 
school law is all that should be desired. In the language of one of our most eminent 
educators, Dr. Welch, compulsory education should not be reckoned of value simply to 
the extent to which it can be rigidly enforced, but in the main it should be prized be- 
cause of the ‘compulsory environment’ it throws round the ignorant and the dilatory, 
and the general public interest it arouses in the cause of education as lying also at the 
very heart of the national life.” 
The rights of the children should be secured to them.—Superintendent Stockwell, of Rhode 
Island: ‘‘I think the duty of the hour to lie in the direction of arousing and directing 
public sentiment to demand that the rights of these children, so many thousands of 
whom are practically dependent on the State forall the opportunity they will ever have, 
be recognized and secured to them. Our people need to be reminded that these children 
are the future voters; that in their hands will be placed the destiny of the State, and 
that we are responsible for the training given both to their hands, and also to the minds 
and hearts which will control them. We are trifling with tremendous issues, and we 
shall be fortunate if we do not pay for our folly by some terrible experience. Let ug 
awake from our lethargy ere it is too late.””
-P-A-G-E-177
    
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE. 177 
Reasons of failure in Minnesota.—Superintendent Kiehle: “I am not able to report 
any substantial aid gained from the law on compulsory education. Several superin- 
tendents have undertaken to enforce it, but the results have not been permanent. The 
reasons of failure have been: ; 
“1, Defects in the law. It very properly allows children to be educated in other than 
the public schools, yet leaves the condition so indefinite that there is not the least 
guarantee that the children are receiving the equivalent of a common school education. 
‘Whatever else is required, every school which is to be recognized by the law should cer- 
tify that it is conducted in the English language, and that instruction is given in the 
branches of a common school education, viz.: reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, 
and the geography and history of the United States. 
“9. The difficulty inherent in this method of improving the people. The more chil- 
dren there are in any given district who do not attend school, the more probable it is 
that no one in the district will take the trouble, or endure the odium necessary to the 
enforcement of the law. There should be a truant officer in the city, and a constable 
in the country, whose duty it would be to attend to the enforcement of the law.” 
The best possible compulsory law..-—Superintendent Jones, of Dakota: ‘The law for 
compulsory education in our Territory, which is intended to be provided for in sections 
119, 120, is notenforced. To enforce such a law requires first, that public sentiment be 
educated up to a proper appreciation of the principles involved. This may yetbe in the 
somewhat distant future so far as it interests those communities which are most negli- 
gent. I fully believe that a law which taxes the parent or guardian of every child, say - 
twenty-five cents per week, per capita, for-all children of school age under his care or con- 
trol; to be collected as are all other taxes, and the amouny collected to go to the support 
of the schools, would be the best possible compulsory law. The parent or guardian may - 
then receive a credit upon such tax of twenty-five cents, in favor of any particular child, 
naming it, for each week of school attendance, upon presenting the certificate of the di- 
rector showing the attendance. But the credits of one child should not be accepted from 
the parent or guardian in favor of another.’ 
Justification of compulsory atiendance laws—Limiis of the rights of parents.—Superin- 
tendent Hine, of Connecticut: ‘‘ There are many parents who assert what they call their 
right of governance. Such think it unjust that they must send their children to school, 
and thus lose the profitof their labor. Others, timid about interfering with the relation 
of parent and child, prefer that the child should suffer abuse and deprivation rather than | 
disturb the principle of parental control. 
“There is no necessity of confusion or hesitation here. That parents may have the 
governance of their children is not an unalterable principle upon which unchangeable 
Jaws are based. It is only a proposition based upon extensive experience and embody- 
ing the general conviction that parents inspired by instinctive love will treat their chil- 
dren wisely and humanely. There is a strong probability that they will so treat them. 
This presumption of good will yield to a certainty of evil. When it is certain that a 
parent is injuring his child a point is reached where society says his action is not reason- 
able, and the law says itis not lawful. It may be unreasonable long before it is unlaw- 
ful, but it is merely a question of degree when the legal limit is overstepped. 
“Responsibility for the education of the child is placed upon the parent. It is ad- 
_ mitted that the parent may and ought to understand what is the best education for his 
ownchildren. But at the point of no education or of limited education resulting in 
mental staevatiou, the law undertakes to make the parent do his duty. If in the exer- 
cise of his judgment and right of control, the parent gives no education he has over- 
stepped the reasonable limit of control and transgressed the positive enactment. He is 
now compelled to do what he ought to do. 
‘Similarly there is no principle which confers upon a parent the right to cause his 
child to work -for gain or for the support of the family. It is supposed that the labor 
which the parent compels the child to perform will [not] result in good to the child. 
If the mind or body of the child is injured by work in any industry, the limit of reason 
is again overstepped, and the law compels the parent to refrain from doing what he ought 
not to do. Both in depriving the child of education and in causing him to spend his 
early years in labor the parent is not conforming to what the experience and convictions 
of society regard as right. He is not acting in a reasonable manner, and the law says 
he is not acting in a lawful manner. 
“The enactments relating to attendance and employment have restrained and miti- 
gated in many cases the harshness of parental control. If they have accomplished noth- 
ing more their operation has been beneficent,”’

A course of study adopted for country schools in Indiana—Classified schools.—In Indiana, 
under the superintendency of Hon. J. W. Holcombe, a standard course of study for 
one-room country schools, prepared by a committee of the County Superintendents’ As- 
sociation, was adopted by that body in 1884. From that time a general effort has been 
made throughout the State to conform the district schools to the standard course. It is 
divided into three parts, known as the Primary, the Grammar, and the Graduation Di- 
visions. 
Diplomas, tastefully lithographed, are granted to pupils who attain an average of 75 
per cent. and who do not fall below 65 per cent. in any one branch. The graduating 
exercises are held in each township under the supervision of the county superintendent; 
these have been attended with a degree of interest far beyond expectation. 
Following are the courses of study referred to above, and a daily programme of study 
and recitations for a district school. The word year is used somewhat indefinitely in 
the arrangement of the work, and does not mean necessarily either the calendar year or 
the school term (since the latter is not uniform), but rather such a time as is necessary 
for the completion of the work allotted—in other words, the interval between the pro- 
motions. :

COUNTRY SCHOOLS—INDIANA SYSTEM. 181 
The following is an extract, relating to the above course of study, from a circular letter ; 
of State Superintendent Holcombe to township trustees and school boards: ‘‘All the 
one-room schools of a township should follow the same course of study, covering the 
eight ‘common branches,’ and not attempting to go beyond these unless additional 
branches are demanded by patrons, according to law. Schools of two or more rooms 
should divide the grades between the departments, and introduce additional branches in 
the highest department, as far as facilities permit.! Pupils should be classified in the 
course of study according to their advancement, and should be carried through it to grad- 
uation, and no pupil should be permitted to graduate until he has studied all the common 
branches. Trustees have the power to require pupils to follow the course of study, and 
no pupil should be excused from any subject appropriate to his advancement except by 
special permission of the trustee for good cause.’’

Remarks on the classified country schools of Indiana.—At a convention of the county 
superintendents of Indiana, Superintendent David N. Nelson, of Jasper County, made 
the following criticisms and suggestions regarding the course of study and programme 
of recitations, ete., given above: 
“The uniform course alluded to above is excellent, and with slight modifications may 
be operated in every county in the State. Its adoption should be made uniform at once. 
But a clear view of the characteristics of such a course is necessary to our purpose. 
“I, The course should state clearly and definitely the work intended. 
“II. This work should be divided into parts, and a definite time allotted for the com- 
pletion of each part. 
“TIT. These parts should be arranged in their logical and psychological. orders—con- 
sidering the parts themselves, in the order of dependence; considering the relation of 
these parts to the child, in the order of mind-growth. 
“Confusion very often arises from the fact that teachers do not know what work is 
required of them. The course is not specific. Details are not outlined, and the work is 
stated only ingeneral. It must be remembered that the district school is not subject to 
the same close supervision that is found in the city andtown. There the superintendent 
  
ee account of the Indiana graded school system is given in another part of this Chapter. See

  182 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
outlines the work in detail from month to month, and if any doubt exists in the teacher's 
mind it may at once be removed by consulting the competent, responsible head, whose 
thought is being worked out in each department. In the county in which I live, some 
teachers are at work in the school-rooms 25 miles from the county seat, and many times 
during the winter 35 miles from the superintendent. A question arises as to what work 
istobedone. It cannot be settled for weeks and perhaps months, when the emergency 
is passed and the question forgotten. In the mean time the teacher proceeds as best she 
can without the stimulus of settled convictions, and does an inferior kind of work, of 
an entirely different, character from that intended and from what is being done in an 
adjacent school. This is notconfined to JasperCounty. A similar circumstance within 
a few miles of the centre of this city came under my observation within the last school 
year. Again, itis true that the teachers most competent in carrying out a system of 
instruction find their way into the cities and towns, where they have less exposure and 
greater conveniences, where there are more opportunities for promotion, and where the 
wages are higher. These two discriminations against the district school make it neces- 
sary that the course of instruction in the country be more definitely and explicitly 
stated than in the towns and cities. My observation has been that the reverse is gen- 
erally true. The course in the district schools should be outlined in detail, making it 
easy for pupils and parents to understand, and thus aiding in its enforcement. 
_‘* Under our present school laws it is impossible for our schools to continue in session 
during the entire year, and with the present amount of labor and confinement required 
each day of the pupil, such long terms are not desirable. As the time for study is di- 
vided into parts, there should be corresponding divisions in the course of study, i. ¢, a 
definite portion to be accomplished each year. How much can be done in each of these 
divisions of time depends mainly upon three conditions: 
“T. The length of school each year. 
‘TI. The efficiency of teachers. 
“TII. The regularity of pupils. 
“Tf these three points be properly regulated, the problem of uniform gradation is 
easilysolyed. In them we find the greatest tendency to disintegration, and, consequently, 
the greatest obstacles to be overcome. In the consideration of these points we shall find 
many difficulties to be removed. i 
“The length of term in the various counties of the State varies widely. The longest 
for the year 1883 was 180 days; the shortest, 93 days. The longest for the year 1884 
was 172 days; theshortest, 77 days. Between the townships of most countiesa like con- 
trast appears. In my own county, in 1883, the term was 62 days in one township and 140 
in another. In 1885 the shortest term was 80 days and the longest 135. Under these 
circumstances, with equally good teachers in every school, nothing like uniformity in 
gradation can be maintained. Some pupils will complete the course in one-half the time 
itrequires others tocompleteit; or one pupil will do double the work of anotherin the same 
number of years, The course, therefore, which is adapted to one school is not suited to 
another, perhaps within the same county, to say nothing of remoter parts of the State, 
where different industries and physical conditions may hold trustees within still nar- 
rower limits. Nor does the remedy lie within the reach of all. In many counties the 
county board can arrange the local levy for tuition in such a manner as to produce uni- 
formity of terms in that individual county. This will greatly assist in gradation, and 
where it is possible it becomes the imperative duty of the county board and superin- 
tendent to see that it is speedily done. Butin other counties, if the levy be made to the 
greatest extent authorized by law, the longest term will be only 135 days, while the 
shortest will be 80 days. In ‘this case the only way to equalize is’to reduce the maxi- 
mum length tothe minimum, This would be unjust and exceedingly impractical. The 
only remedy here lies in new legislation. . 
“All teachers are not equally skilful in the management of their schools. One teacher 
will accomplish as much in 6 weeks as another in 4 months. This, added to the fact 
that the poor teacher falls heir to the short term, seriously disorganizes the work, for the 
good teachers, with the long term, can do at least four times as much work as the poor 
teachers with the short term. Again, teachers seldom succeed themselves from year to 
year, so that good and bad ones alternate, and, like positive and negative quantities, 
mutually destroy each other’s influence. To avoid these evils is the desideratum, If 
the teacher is inefficient, all fails—course of study, classification, methods of promotion, 
systems of instruction, all fall to the ground. The county that would carry into effect 
any settled line of policy, which is absolutely essential in order to sustain a system of 
graded sehools, must employ teachers who have made some ‘special preparation for the 
work, and who are reasonably familiar with the principles which must be observed in 
the formation and preservation of a graded course of study.’ 
‘The grades in the district schools are subject to disintegration from another cause— 
- irregularity in attendance. Whereno system of reports is used superintendents and school

officers generally are not aware of the enormity of this evil. Few parents understand 
that, they have no right to detain the pupilat home; and long, muddy roads, inefficiency 
of teachers, impossibility of close supervision, all operate against the school in this re- 
spect. Jasper County, being one of thelargestin the State, has suffered loss from each of 
the causes just enumerated. Last fall, during the first 3 months, only 70 per cent, of 
the enumeration enrolled, and 79.6 per cent. of the enrolment, attended every day. 
During the succeeding 3 months the attendance was considerably less, owing partly to 
the severity of the winter. I donot think these figures below the average, but that a 
like relation holds in other counties as well. In nearly every school are to be found a 
class of pupils who enter late in the fall, quit early in the spring, and are absent 1 or 2 
days each week in the meantime. This destroys thé classification, and where any con- 
siderable number are of this character, renders gradation well nigh impossible. If we 
carry into effect any system of gradation, we must secure the regular attendance of the 
pupils, 
“ Any course of study must be arranged in accordance with two things—ifrst, the 
organic relation of the branches and different parts of branches taught, and second the 
order of mind-development. These are co-ordinate thoughts, and are each primary. 
Studying history, geography, and arithmetic—in fact all study—is but discovering the 
relations which exist in the great order and system of things called nature, of which our 
minds, bodies, the earth, and all organized and unorganized beings are but parts. No- 
where in this domain is the rule of chance, or caprice; all is system. Certain things 
necessarily condition others, and render them possible. Whatis meant by arrangement 
in the ‘logical order’ is simply thatthe order which nature has established in the con- 
stitution’ of the thing should not be violated. The discovery and statement of these re- 
lations would form an excellent theme for an hour’s discussion, and cannot be attempted 
here. 
“In this day, when psychology is the hobby in education, it has come to be under- 
stood that even mindis a part of nature, and thatit, too, acts within the domain of law. 
That under all the phenomena of thinking, feeling, and willing, there are unchanging 
laws whose actions are in harmony with each other and with things. This harmony, 
adaptation, or fitness, is universal. The mimicry of the tiger adapts it to its native 
juagle; the eye is adapted to the beautiful green of earth and blue of sky, the ear to 
the vibrations of the air. So also the mind, in its secret constitution and working, is 
adapted to the other departments of nature which it must apprehend or know. As na- 
ture is always harmonious with itself, it follows that the mind must know things in 
their necessary and inevitable relations, and thus it is seen that the logical and psycho- 
logical orders coincide and are the same. That this should be the arrangement in any 
system, whether graded or ungraded, is beyond question. ‘That agraded system should 
be arranged so is doubly important, since the tendency to disintegration in any organ- 
ism increases with its complexity, and since only by such arrangement can its harmoni- 
ous operation be secured. 
“‘This brings us to the second branch of our subject—the classification of the school 
according to the course of study. Here the work before us is to give each pupil his 
proper work by placing him in the grade to which he belongs. 11 is a fact that in all 
schools the size of the classes steadily decreases as we pass from the lower grades to the 
higher. This is shown in both town and country, by the small number of pupils in the 
graduating classes as compared with the number that are doing first-grade work. Since 
this is so, a larger portion of time should be given to the lower grades of the school. 
Again, the time allotted for the completion of the course of study is 8 years. Each 
year brings new accessions to the school, and as these pupils are 1 year behind, it 
seems that the most natural division of the pupils is into 8 grades. But such a division 
in the district school is altogether impracticable, as it would necessitate at least 32 reci- 
tations daily. This would so divide the time of the teacher that but little would be 
accomplished. It is absolutely necessary, then, that in our district schools certain of 
these years be combined in the formation of the grades, and since the number of pupils 
decreases as we advance, these combinations must be made in the last years of the 
course. Thus, in order to decrease the number of classes, the years are combined as 
follows: . 
(a) First year pupils are kept by themselves. 
“(b) Second vedpapil also form a grade. 
“(¢e) Third and Surth years are placed together. 
“(d) Fifth and sixth years are placed together. 
(e) Seventh and eighth years are placed together. 
“With this arrangement all the pupils of the'school are classified into five grades. On 
an average each grade may have five recitations daily, without frittering away the time 
of the teacher, and with very satisfactory results. More recitations than these are not 
advisable. Several points require special attention just here: 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
      184. - EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. _ 
“J. With such an arrangement, how are promotions possible without destroying the 
classification of the school? Here is a most difficult question. If a difference of one year 
only existed between the grades, or if pupils were admitted to the school only once in 
two years, it could be easily answered. No trouble is found in promoting from the first 
to the second:grade; but it is observed that when they pass from the second fo the third 
grade, they must combine with pupils who have already done one year’s work on that ° 
part of the course allotted to the third grade. This, of course, where everything has 
been efficiently done, works detriment to the school. Were it not that the logical and 
psychological orders, stated above, must be followed on passing to the third grade, they 
could commence fourth year work, and the following year do third year work, and again 
the two divisions would combine at’ the beginning of the fifth year. With this arrange- 
ment the class that enters the school in the odd years would progress evenly and symmet- 
rieally through the entire course, while the class that enters on the even years would 
work half the time with the class which is a year ahead, and the other half the time 
with a class a year behind its true standing. ‘This is out of the question, and the close 
and rigid gradation here spoken of is impossible. The most practical way seems to be 
to make the gradation loose, to allow the bright, strong ones to pass on to a higher grade, 
while the dull, weak ones fall back where an opportunity is given to make up lost work. 
Some difficulty is experienced here, owing to a difference of advancement; butit is hardly 
to be expected that the pupils of any grade will be of the same degree of scholarship. 
“TT, When new pupils present themselves, how shall they be classified? Three things 
should be taken into consideration—age, ability, scholarship. Other things being equal, 
such a pupil should be placed among those of his age. If ability is good and scholarship 
somewhat less, he should be stiil placed there, allowing that with his good ability he will 
soon ‘catch up’ with those of hisown age. In deciding upon scholarship, reading should 
be made the basis for classifying primary pupils, while arithmetic is a more satisfactory 
basis for classifying advanced pupils. It is always best to place a boy of good ability 
among his superiors than among his inferiors. Care should be taken, however, not to 
class him so high as to make a change necessary. 
“TIT. Whose duty is it to classify, and is this duty imperative? Manifestly the pupil 
is not prepared to choose his studies or classify himself. He sees the school from below, 
not from above. He looks upon the school as an end in itself, and is not expected to 
know what constitutes the best and most rapid progress. Neither can his parents decide 
the question of his classification; for if they do, decisions will conflictand again classifi- 
cation is impossible. Certainly it is the duty of the teacher, acting under the direction 
and supervision of the county superintendent. This is an imperative duty upon the 
teacher, one that he should discharge without fear or favor. ‘Where does the pupil be- 
long?’ is the question, and his ‘duty to the child, to the parent, to himself and to his 
profession, demands a correct classification.’ It.is my opinion that, in the first place, 
teachers do not sufficiently understand the principles of gradation to act with confidence 
and decision; in the second place, they do not understand it to be one of their sacred 
duties; and in the third place, they fear the opposition of parents. The unpopularity 
which a teacher is likely to incur by assigning the pupils to the classes where they really 
belong, acts as a powerful barrier against the gradation of our schools. This is its nega- 
tive phase; its positive phase, though not so generally practiced, is another great evil. 
_ Teachers will curry favor with parents and seek popularity by classifying pupils too high. 
Such work has been appropriately termed ‘demagogic pedagogy,’ and has been charac- 
terized asa base, unprofessional trick. A great duty devolves upon the superintendent 
in properly directing the work of his teachers in this respect; also in visiting his schools 
the work of classification should be carefully inspected. 
“TV. Uniform text-books are necessary. This is absolutely essential, in order to pre- 
vent the multiplication of classes, The means of accomplishing this are in the hands 
of the county board, and should he exercised with great care. 
““V. The necessity of a suitable programme. _ It isnot the purpose here to state what 
the programme should be—to decide whether arithmetic or reading should come first in 
the day, but to determine some of its characteristics and show its value iu sustaining 
a graded system of schools. The programme should state atime for each exercise of the 
school; thus none will be omitted, none forgotten, and irregularity in this respect is 
avoided. It should also state the length of time for each exercise; thus none will usurp 
the time of the other; none will be slighted. A properly arrange ogramme is abso- 
lutely essential in securing these two results; and though they may*%seem little things, 
their violation has a powerful tendency to disintegrate and disorganize. A ‘lack of 
method and system here rapidly spreads until it infests every thread and fibre of school 
work, 
_ ‘‘ Having arranged a course of study and decided upon the classification of the school 
the promotions naturally follow. These have already been incidentally noticed under 
the head of ‘Classification of Schools,’ but a few points are deserving of special men- 
tion, Any perfect scheme of promotion necessitates—
-P-A-G-E-185
COUNTRY SCHOOLS—INDIANA SYSTEM. 185 
“T. A standard which must be reached. 
‘TT, An accurate, just, and uniform method of determining the standing of pupils. 
‘TIT. A permanent record of this standing for the use of school officers and sueceed- 
ing teachers. ~ 
“TV, A system of graduation. 
“Only those pupils should be allowed to pass whose work has been good, and a high 
degree of excellence should be required. Teachers and school officers fail, many times, 
by lowering the standard of scholarship. Thus pupils come to believe that accuracy is 
not desirable, and that hard work and faithful effort are not essential to success. Sev- 
enty-five per cent. at least should be the minimum in any branch. A higher standard 
would be still preferable. ‘This standard should be determined by the county board. 
‘That the standing of pupils should be made up from both the class;work and exam- 
ination will hardly admit of question. Baldwin, in his ‘Art of School Management,’ 
recommends that the class-standing be multiplied by 4 and the result added to the 
grade received on examination, and that this sum be divided by 5 in determining the 
standing of any pupil. This method seems eminently just. But while teachers differ 
so widely i in their methods of grading, and while such a difference exists between the 
questions used by one teacher and those of another, uniformity is not so easily secured, 
and pupils of one schooladvance more rapidly in the grades than those of another. The 
difficulty here again grows out of the impossibility of close supervision. Two plans for 
unifying the work: may be suggested: 
“1, The township plan, in which the work of preparing questions for examinations, 
grading manuscripts, and controlling promotions is in the hands of a township principal, 
who in turn works under the supervision of the county superintendent. 
‘9, The county plan, in which the superintendent prepares the questions for each 
school at least twice a year, and collecting the manuscripts, grades them himself. This 
_ entails an almost endless amount of work on the superintendent, but it has been suc- 
cessfully accomplished, I understand, in at least one county of the State. Either method 
if taken would greatly aid in establishing the fixed policy necessary to gradation. 
“The status of a school being once determined for a given month it should become a 
matter of permanent record, so that school officers and succeeding teachers may have 
something to assist them in maintaining the gradation of the school. Each teacher should 
be supplied with a grade-book, with definite instructions as to its use, where the stand- 
ing of a pupil, made up as suggested above, should be recorded monthly and in perma- 
nent form. At the close of the year a summary of these monthly standings should be 
made and the averages given. This average s standing should reach the standard already 
adopted by the county board before a promotion takes place. Where a township prin- 
cipal is employed, as stated above, he should have a record of the name, classification, 
and standing of every pupil of the township. Where no such principal is employed 
the county superintendent should have a similar record made from the monthly reports 
of his teachers. These records should be summarized and Published, for annual distri- 
bution to teacheys and parents. 
“Graduation is the last step in promotion, and is essential. No greater impetus has 
ever been given to the work of the district schools than that which has attended the in- 
troduction of this feature. It, like Janus of old, looks both ways, forward, backward— 
backward over the entire school course, and necessitates efliciency at every point. It 
is destined to work a revolution in that it strengthens the work all along the line. It 
secures better instruction, better gradation closer supervision. It looks forward to the 
high school, to which its diploma is a ticket of admission. It thus unites the district 
school and the high school, and as it marks a degree of success, is a powerful incentive 
to good. 
“To recapitulate: The essentials to gradation are course of study, classification, pro- 
motion. 
“The course should state the work in detail, should divide it into parts and allot a 
definite time to each, and should arrange these parts in their logical and psychological 
orders. The course for the district schools should be more definitely outlined than that 
for towns and cities. The amount of work that can be done in a given time depends 
mainly upon length of term, efficiency of teacher, and regularity of pupils. The logical 
  and psychological orders are the same, and are the inherent relations of the mind and ~ 
the thing studied. 
“Only five grades are practical. Classification should be loose; new pupils classified 
according to age, ability, scholarship. It is the duty of the teacher and the superintend- 
ent to classify. Uniformity in text-books is necessary; programmes are essential. 
‘Any scheme of promotion includes standard, test of scholarship, permanent record, 
system of graduation.’’ 
What the ungraded school demands.—Superintendent Raab, of Illinois, in speaking of 
the qualities demanded of the teachers of ungraded schools, remarks: ‘‘ Every one can 
     
-P-A-G-E-186
          * is adopted and the pupils classified. 186 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87.) 
see that to instruct 30 to 40 pupils of such various attainments as the difference in the 
ages between 6 and 21 years conditions is a difficult task, and that the teacher must 
possess a high degree of self-denial and energy to do this work well. He must occupy | 
silently three or more divisions while he instructs one. In order to make this silent oc- 
cupation of use to the pupils, how carefully must the exercises be selected, how well 
prepared beforehand, and how much time does their control and criticism consume? 
How must the teachers continually study the means of doing the work most thoroughly 
in the shortest possible time? It is self-evident. Zhe ungraded school demands the most 
skilful and thorough teacher and educator. 
“The communities with ungraded schools are mostiy far removed from larger towns ° 
and cities. Their inhabitants belong mostly to the less wealthy and cultivated. Not 
rarely there is a lack of intellectual incitement and esthetic refinement so essential for 
® young person to feel and imitate. Frequently the few refined are too far temoyed so- 
cially from the majority to encourage intercourse between them. A teacher who is to 
work in such a community has great difficulties to overcome,socially. His education 
may predispose him for the intercourse with the few cultured families, but he is rarely 
in such pecuniary situation as to mingle with them freely, socially, and familiarly. For 
the sake of his efficiency he can not withdraw from the society of the majority. Much 
tact and a strong character are necessary to do the right thing under all circumstances; 
to displease neither the one nor the other. The teacher of an ungraded school must not 
only bea thorough teacher and educator, he must at the same time be a man of wisdom and 
of character. 
“But what kind of a teacher do we find in many ungraded schools? Young people 
just dismissed from the same kind of school.. What is the cause of this? Because this 
class of school is considered the proper one for the beginners and it is the most poorly 
paid. When the latter have instructed in such a school for some time they either strive 
for a village school or they abandon the work of teaching altogether and other tyros take 
their place. 
“These young people enter upon their duties and find themselves before a gigantic 
task. Hardly any one of them has ever seen a school properly conducted; some will 
perhaps remember one thing or another from their childhood experience. 
“*Many a one would find it a difficult task to instruct one division properly and to 
gain its attention and interest, and now he is called upon to employ four or more divis- 
ions at the same time. If he loses all hope and grows dispirited is it to be wondered at? 
It is a wonder if he does not lose courage and succeeds in creating order and fresh life 
out of chaos.’’ 
‘‘As a rule there is little enthusiasm among the teachers of ungraded schools. How 
can there be any as long as the teachers do not know or even feel what great opportuni- 
ties for doing good to their fellow men are putinto their hands. Instead of creating fresh 
life and vigor they consider their work a drudgery from which to flee as soon as there is 
a chance seems natural. They know no better. No one has ever opened to them the 
portals of science or pointed out the blessings which may be conferred upon a community 
by conscientious, thorough work in ungraded schools. 
“School directors having charge of ungraded schoois should never employ teachers 
who have not at least served an apprenticeship of several years in a graded school under 
the supervision of a competent principal or superintendent. The salaries of' teachers in 
ungraded schools should, of course, be much better than those of subordinate teachers in 
graded schools. Teachers who have successfully taught in ungraded schools will form 
the best material from which to select principals and superintendents for village and city 
graded schools, because they are familiar with all the details of the entire course from 
the primary grade to the high school. 
‘A public school teacher, especially the teacher of an ungraded school, who success- 
fully leads the young to the high aimsof intellectual and moral culture, is certainly one 
of the most useful servants of the State; hence the community should do everything in 
its power to retain the greatest possible number of such men in the profession and to se- 
cure to them satisfactory and respected positions.” 
Grading country schools.—Superintendent Cornell, of Colorado: ‘‘Our country schools 
cannot bé made as thorough and efficient as they should be until a definite course of study 
* * # Jf the country schools are graded the 
work must be accomplished largely through the efforts of the county superintendents. 
They must see that the teachers properly classify the pupils of such schools, and’ keep 
proper records of such classification. From these records the teacher should make 
monthly reports to the county superintendent, which shall show the progress of the 
school. ‘The mere adoption of a course of study by a school board will avail but little 
unless some system is inaugurated for having it carried out and made permanent. It is 
not expected that any one course of study can he adopted in detail in every school. County 
superintendents must determine what course is best suited to the schools of their coun-

‘ties, Yet, if possible, it will be better to follow one general outline of work in every 
county.” 
A system of grading proposed for Kansas.—The subject of grading the common schools 
of Kansas has been recommended by Superintendent Lawhead to the consideration of 
the Legislature of that State. The objects to be sought and some of the advantages that 
would result he enumerates as follows: ‘‘(1) An ultimate reduction in the number of 
classes, consequently more time could be given to each class. (2) More systematic work 
‘could be done, hence each pupil taught by example the necessity and practical benefit 
of system in everything—a very important element. (3) Each pupil would realize that 
his advancement would depend upon the thoroughness with which he performed his 
work, therefore he would be stimulated to do everything in the best manner possible.”’ 
Organization of ungraded schools. —Hon. John W, Dickinson, secretaty of Massachusetts 
poard of education: ‘‘A serious hindrance to successful work in ubgraded schools is a 
large number of classes. A large number of classes seems to make necessary many ex- 
ercises during each daily session. Where there are many different class exercises in the 
day but little time can be given to each, and with but little time for an exercise, not much 
good teaching can be done. 
“Just as good teaching can be done in an ungraded school as ina school] that is graded, 
and it can be done in the same time and in the same way. 
“Tt seems desirable, therefore, that an earnest effort should be made by the commit- 
tees and teachers haying these schools in charge to make the number of daily exercises 
small enough to make good ‘teaching possible. , 
“This may be accomplished in the following way:— 
“ First. By uniting as far as practicable the classes in each subject. 
“The course of study [for ungraded schools in Massachusetts] is laid out for eight 
years of school attendance, but there are few schools in which all these grades of work 
are represented at one time. 
‘“By the use of supplementary reading matter, and by the topical method in other 
subjects, classes representing different grades may be brought together. 
“Second. By alternating the recitations of the older pupils in certain subjects. Thus 
the recitations in geography and history may occur on alternate days; so may physi- 
ology and grammar; writing and drawing may alternate. The reading exercises of the 
higher classes may alternate with each other. ; 
“Third. By frequent and regular substitution of written for oral recitations in most 
of the subjects. This will leave the teachers free for other .classes, and the written 
papers can be examined out of school. Such exercises are of great value to the pupils 
themselves. . \ 
‘A written programme should be prepared as soon as possible after the beginning of 
the term. This should contain the order of exercises for each day of the week, and 
should indicate the time at which each exercise should begin and end. It should be 
placed where it can be read by the pupils, that they may be guided in their study. If 
rigidly followed by the teacher it will train the pupils to habits of promptness and 
punctuality.’” 
VI.—EDUCATION, 
A man of more account than his trade.—Superintendent Hinsdale, of Cleveland, Ohio: 
“One of the most discouraging things that the teacher encounters is the erroneous views 
of the nature and objects of education that are so very common. An intelligent man- 
ufacturer tells me, for instance, that he is anxious to find out as speedily as. possible 
what trade or profession his son is fitted for by nature, and then to educate him to follow 
it. He says he can see the sense of a classical education for a minister or a physician, 
but evidently it would be thrown away on a mechanic or tradesman. No doubt it 
would be folly to give, or seek to give, a classical education to all mechanics and trades- 
men, or even to many of them. But that is not the point. After all the preaching of 
“sweetness and light’ we have heard the number of people who can not raise the ques- 
tion of a boy’s education above the level of the daily work that he will probably per- 
form is alarmingly large. These people think aman is merely a tool or instrument, and 
that he should be educated solely for the reason that a chisel or saw should be kept sharp. 
Now, it scarcely need be said that education should fit men and women for efficiency ; 
in work and business. Life has a physical basis; a man can do nothing without 
his breakfast, and a complete scheme of education must provide for bread-winning. 
How a boy or girl will be best prepared in school to earn money, and so to win bread, 
whether by general studies, by special studies, or by a combination of both, I do not now 
inquire. But Ido assert that a man is of more account than his trade. The life is 
more than meat, and the body than raiment. Man lives not by bread alone; his life 
consists not of the abundance of the things that he possesses. The human mindis capa-

ble of knowledge and of seeking truth for truth’s sake; capable of sublimity, faith, 
e : reverence, sympathy, and pathos; capable of happiness and joy and love, and to deny it 
the food that feeds these capacities, to try to appease its hunger with a mere business 
education, or with the husks of learning, is nothing short of starvation.” 
VII.—GRADED ScHOOLs. * 
THE INDIANA SYSTEM OF GRADED SCHOOLS. 
The State of Indiana furnishes a typical illustration of the American system of graded 
schools in its fullest development, in which every child may receive an education at 
the public expense, beginning with the rudiments of learning and continuing on by suc- 
cessive steps up through the highest grade of the university, State Superintendent J. 
W. Holcombe, in his last published report, gives an account of the system as it has been 
developed in Indiana, from which the following has been compiled. 
What the term ‘‘ graded school”’ isunderstood to mean in Indiana,—State Superintendent 
G. W. Hoss (1865), in interpreting the provision of the statute regarding graded schools 
said: ‘1st. A graded school is a school in which the pupils are placed in different rooms 
and under different teachers according to advancement. Consequently, the greater the 
number of rooms and teachers for any given school the more favorable the means for per- 
fect grading. From this it will be seen that a graded school as contemplated in the above 
section can not exist with less than two teachers. With one the school may be classi- 
fied but not graded. ‘Trustees will therefore have regard to this element when they 
put up buildings designed for ded schools. 2d. As to the time whena graded school 
should be established for any given township, no definite directions can be given. There 
are too many local elements to admit of any special directions. It is, however, safe to 
say that whenever there are pupils in the township whose advancement is such that the 
district schools can not furnish them instruction, at that moment begins the need of a 
township graded school furnishing instruction of a higher grade. The trustee must, how- 
ever, be satisfied that the number of such pupils issufficient to justify the establishment 
of such a school before providing the same. 3d. As to place, I would suggest that when- 
ever practicable the township graded school should be established in connection with a 
district school, thus economizing in building, perhaps in teaching, also furnishing the 
means ofa more thorough grading in at least one primary school in the township. It is 
suggested further that a village, if centrally located, is usually a favorable place for the 
township schoo).’’ 
“A graded school, it is therefore obvious [Mr. Holcombe says in continuation], may 
he extended from the smallest township school of two rooms, carrying its course of study 
no farther than ‘the eight branches,’ or including but one or two ‘additional branches,’ 
to the highly developed city system, which embraces elementary instruction in the 
higher mathematics, languages, literature, and science. The graded school develops as 
the population increases and as the demand for higher instruction grows. The cities, 
therefore, first established graded schools, and have, as a rule, extended their system in 
proportion to their size and wealth. All the cities of the State, and most of the towns, 
maintain graded school systems, terminating in a high school course of from two to four 
years.”? 
The course of study.—The law determining the subjects of instruction in the common 
schools of the State is as follows: ‘‘ The common schools of the State shall be taught in the 
English language; and the trustee shall provide to have taught in them orthography, read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, geography, English grammar, physiology, history of the United 
States, and good kehavior, and such other branches of learning and other languages as 
the advancement of the pupils may require and the trustees from time to time direct. 
And whenever the parents or guardians of 25 or more children in attendance at any 
school of a township, town, or city shall so demand, it shall be the duty of the school 
trustee or trustees of said township, town, or city to procure efficient teachers and intro- 
duce the German language, as a branch of study, into such schools; and the tuition in 
said schools shall be without charge: Provided, Such demand is made before the teacher 
for said district is employed.” 
Upon the extent to which the course of study may be carried, James H. Smart, State 
superintendent (1880), said: “‘It is fairto assume that the trustees must provide suitable 
instruction for all the children who may have aright to attend school; that is, they 
must afford them such instruction as their attainments demand. If a child has mas- 
tered all the primary branches, and, being less than twenty-one years of age, still de- 
sires to attend school, the trustees must provide suitable instruction for him. It is not 
reasonable 10 expect him to spend further time on branches which he has mastered. 
The fact that the law permits children to attend school till they are twenty-one years of 
age is presumptive proof that the trustees may be required to furnish such instruction 
         
-P-A-G-E-189
      a aa GRADED SCHOOLS. | 189 
as is suitable to their attainments till they reach that age. I think the argument here 
adduced equally applicable to trustees in cities as to those in townships, as the language 
of the statute applies to both alike.” 
Upon the power of the school authorities to arrange a course of study, the following 
- official opinion was given in 1883: ‘‘The school law provides that instruction shall be 
imparted in certain studies, the German language under certain circumstances being 
included in the list. The time at which these studies shall be commenced, the order 
in which they shall be taken up, and the length of time devoted to each are matters 
which are left to the trustee or school board.” 
In accordance with the statutes and decisions cited the local school authorities through- 
out the State have prescribed courses of study which are essentially similar, while 
differing in details. The importance of uniformity in the high school grades, which are 
immediately introductory to the university, has led to an effort on the part of the State 
Teachers’ Association to secure a uniform high school course. (See page 193.) 
High school commissions.—The country schools, the high schools, and the State univer- 
sities, which in many States form practically three distinct systems, are in Indiana hap- 
pily united. The work of the country school or of corresponding departments of the 
city or town school prepares the pupil for admission to the high school. The latter, if 
it be a representative one, prepares its charge for admission to Indiana University, Pur- 
due University, and the State Normal School. 
In the term of Superintendent Milton B. Hopkins, in July, 1873, the following reso- 
lution was adopted by the board of trustees of the Indiana University: 
‘<Tn order to bring the university into closer connection with the high schools of the 
State we recommend the following plan: A certificate from certain high schools (to be 
named hereafter by the State board of education) of a satisfactory examination sus- 
tained in the preparatory course, will entitle the bearer to admission to the freshman 
class.”’ 
At the meeting of the State board ‘in the following August, a circular letter was ad- 
dressed to the presidents of school boards and the superintendents of schools, with a 
view to determining how many and what high schools were qualified to perform the 
work of a preparatory department of the university. Froni that time, whenever a su- 
perintendent of schools has presented, proof to the board that his course of study and 
the attainments of his teachers were sufficient to prepare pupils satisfactorily for the 
university, he has received a commission to certify graduates for admission to that in- 
stitution. More recently a similar arrangement has been made by Purdue University 
and the State Normal School. The form of commission now in use is as follows:

This plan has had an excellent influence upon the graded schools of the State, stimu- 
lating many cities and towns to extend their course of study. Commissions were granted 
during the years 1885-86 to the schools of 83 cities and towns.

- Township high schools necessary to a complete system.—Superintendent Jones, of Dakota: 
“In my last annual report I suggested that authority be delegated to each township in 
the Territory to establish a central high school, and that it be made a connecting link 
between the common schools and the universities. It would Sot be expected of each 
township that it establish and maintain such a school at once; butif the power is granted 
to them those having the necessary wealth may move in that direction immediately, 
while the weaker corporations should either wait till they acquire the ability or unite 
with one, two, or three others for the purpose. I am of the opinion that while theState 
undertakes to provide for the collegiate education of our children in addition to the 
common school course, there should be no break in the connection between them. 
“‘No satisfactory reason can be urged for tolerating the ‘missing link’ which now 
exists, if there is a satisfactory reason that can be given for the establishment and main- 
tenance by the State of the universities, which provide for the higher education. In fact 
the high school course is of far greater importance to the people than is the university 
course. At all events, the pupil is now barred from the university by a yawning chasm, 
which should be bridged over by the same system which bestows the common school 
education, when the structure will be complete. The pupil who begins with the first steps 
will climb the intellectual ladder round by round, till he reaches the climax; and the 
complete idea, the perfect system, the unity and grandeur of the structure will be the 
glory of the Commonwealth.”’ 
Influence of the high school.—Superintendent Morgan, of West Virginia: ‘‘ As a part of 
the free schools the high school has become a factor of transcendent importance in the 
education of the people. 
‘*Tts influence is now specially marked in two directions. It is the crown and com- 
pletion of the free school system, and by its close connection with the intermediate schools 
and the system of promotion therefrom it not only encourages but compels thorough 
workinthem. The intermediate schools are in turn encouraged to thorough work by 
the prospect of advancement. In thesecond place, it affords the great body of the people 
the convenient means of academic training.’?

An improvement in heating and ventilation.—Superintendent Kennedy, of Wayne 
County, Pennsylvania: ‘‘The improvement made in heating and ventilating the graded 
school building at Honesdale deserves notice. The plans were made by William J. 
Baldwin, of the Sanitary Engineer, and are in successful operation. This system fur- 
nishes each of the 600 pupils 1,000 cubic feet of fresh, warm air per hour, and keeps the 
rooms at a proper temperature in the coldest weather. The air is introduced into the 
building through a cold air duct; from this extend smaller ducts, conveying the air to the 
heating-coils, of which there is one for each room. The air, when warmed, is passed by 
a separate duct into each room about 8 feet from the floor. Each room is provided with 
a foul-air duct (ventilating shaft), which starts from the floor and extends to the attic. 
Fach ventilating shaft is provided with two registers—one near the floor, and the other 
near the ceiling—the first for ordinary ventilation, the last for ventilation in summer. 
Each ventilating shaft is provided with a radiator, to secure perfect draught. The foul- 
air ducts are collected in a chamber above, and from this a large duct passes through the 
roof, allowing the foul air to escape. The air is introduced into and taken from the 
rooms without perceptible currents, is pure, and maintained at a temperature of nearly 
"72 degrees.”” 
Forcible removal of foul air necessary.—Superintendent Smith, of Syracuse, N. Y:: ‘We 
have not found the best results while depending on natural ventilation, and for this 
reason the’ power ventilation is contemplated in the High School-at the beginning of 
next school year, by which the cold and foul air is to be withdrawn from the building 
by means of a fan acting on the principle of suction, and forcing the air through venti- 
lating shafts into the open air in the roof. Drawing in the air in this manner from the 
rooms causes a partial vacuum, which is balanced by an equal amount of pure air, com- 
ing over steam-heated radiators in cold weather, or through the same apertures in warm. 
weather without heat, making it possible to have nearly perfect ventilation at all sea- 
sons. This school was built with these shafts just as they will be when the apparatus 
is completed, depending upon the natural flow of foul air through these shafts; but dur- 
ing all the years the building has stood there has been at times no ventilation, and never 
such as should be had. The newer buildings are better than the old, but, as has been 
found in respect to the High School, we shall not realize such changes in the air as the 
best sanitary conditions require, till some mechanical appliance is made use of for driv- 
ing out the contaminated and used-up school-room air.’” 
Speaking of buildings without ventilating shafts, Superintendent Smith says: ‘‘ Only 
the greatest care on the part of the teachers by opening windows or doors will protect 
"pupils, as well as themselves, from the effects of overheated and bad air. This is not 
likely to be attended to as it should be on account of the many duties requiring teach- 
ers’ attention and thought; and in many cases teachers are made conscious of the con- 
dition of the room by the complaints of pupils that they have headache, or by a feeling 
of exhaustion or prostration in themselves. The teacher at once opens into the outside 
air and exposes all in the room to such sudden change of temperature that there is even 
more danger than to have continued as they were. We hope for better things in the 
near future,’? 
Ventilation of rural school-houses.—Dr. D. M. Currier, of New Hampshire, suggests a 
plan for the ventilation ‘‘ of rural school-houses by constructing an incoming or cold-air 
duct under the timbers of the floor, reaching from outside and opening directly up- 
wards under the stove, and furnished with a valve to regulate the flow. Completely 
surround the stove bya galvanized iron case. Ventilation could be provided by placing 
a register in the chimney near the floor. The chimney should be large, and the smoke- 
pipe should pass through it to the top, thus creating a powerful ventilating draught.”” 
Headache in school children.—‘‘ Prof, N. J. Bystroff has examined 7,478 boys and girls 
in the St. Petersburg schools during the last five years, and found headache in 868, 
that is, 11.6 per cent. He states that the percentage of headache increases almost in a 
direct progression with the age of the children, as well as with the number of hours oc- 
cupied by them for mental labor; thus, while headache occurred in only 5 per cent. of 
the children aged 8, it attacked from 28 to 40 per cent.of the pupils aged from 14 to 
18. The author argues that an essential cause of obstinate headache in school chil- 
dren is the excessive mental strain enforced by the present educational programme, 
which leaves out of consideration the peculiarities of the child’s nature and the ele- 
mentary principles of scientific hygiene. The overstrain brings about an increased 
irritability of the brain and consecutive disturbances in the cerebral circulation. Pro- 
fessor Bystroff emphatically insists on the imperative necessity for permanently ad- 
miteing medical men to conferences of school boards. Of palliative measures he men- 
tions methodical gymnastics, mild aperients, in well-nourished children; steél in the

anzmic, bromides, inhalations of oxygen, and, in severe cases, a temporary discontinu- 
ance of all studies.’’—British Medical Jowrnal, May 15, 1886. 
A silent factor in education.—SuperintendentRaab, of Illinois: ‘‘I take this opportu- 
nity of once more calling the attention of school directors, and school officers generally, 
to this silent factor in the education of our children: clean, healthful, pleasant school- 
houses and surroundings. Not only is the health of the pupils thereby preserved, but 
also the esthetic and moral sense is aroused and cultivated.” 
X.—Scnoot LisRaRigs, 
The dime novel has disappeared:.—Superintendent Howland, of Chicago, Ill.: ‘‘The value 
of a well-selected library, wisely used, in a school can hardly be estimated. In more 
than one of our schools dime novels, once socommonly found in the desks of the pupils, 
or between the leaves of their geographies, have disappeared, and the neighboring dealers 
no longer keep them in stock, as the demand has gone. Nor scarcely can there be a 
stronger safeguard against the many evil attractions of city life than this love—this habit 
of reading good books—a habit and a love which must begin even in the primary grades. 
This is the sparkling fount from which will flow the healthful current of virtue, intelli- 
gence, and good citizenship.”’ 
No better investment could be made.—Superintendent Hinsdale, of Cleveland, Ohio: “‘One 
of the most formidable obstacles to carrying out any large scheme of work, in language, 
composition, and history, is want of books. ‘The books in private hands, both teachers’ 
and pupils’, and in the public library, are insufficient for the purpose. No better invest- 
ment of an adequate amount of the public funds could be made than the purchase of a 
well-selected library of books, history, travel, etc., for every one of the large school 
buildings.’ 
The most valuable part of the schcol.—Superintendent Kiehle, of Minnesota, in recom- 
mending State aid for the purchase of school libraries, says: 
“*At the age of 12 years every child ought to be a reader, and ought to begin to gather 
the harvest of knowledge found in good books. And especially is the life of the country 
well adapted to the improvement of this habit. The occupations of country life are 
quiet, and tend to thoughtfulness, and the lack of personal companionship and diverting 
amusements make the companionship of books the more enjoyable and profitable. 
“T consider the well selected and carefully distributed library the most valuable part 
of the school. It is very possible that intelligence may prevail where there are many 
good books with but poor schools, but it is not to be expected that any school without 
the help of books will furnish society with intelligent and well informed men and 
women.’” 
A most important factor.—Superintendent Lawhead, of Kansas: ‘‘From observation I 
am fully convinced that communities in which school district libraries are maintained 
are more intelligent, more progressive, and more law-abiding than communities that do 
not have such libraries. I believe them worthy the fostering care of the State as one of 
the important factors in the training of the young to become useful and intelligent citi- 
zens.’?

THE FUNCTION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. 
[From the report of the Committee on Pedagogies of the National Council of Education. %} 
** Reasons for their caistence.—The people in their corporate capacity have undertaken 
the establishment and maintenance of public schools for the following reasons: 
‘*], Private schools from their nature must be limited in number, while education 
should be universal. 
“2. The education of the young is indispensable to the State, and cannot be left to 
the contingency of the pecuniary and social circumstances of the family. Education is 
a need of the poor as well as of the rich, and a need of the State should not be allowed 
to depend on charity. 
“*3, The matter and form of instruction imparted in the schools of a nation cannot be 
Jeft to the contingency of private selection; they should be subservient to the objects, of 
the State, and, therefore, influenced by the State. The State could not tolerate, for in- 
stance, that doctrines subversive of its institutions should be systematically ineuleated 
in the minds of the young.

  PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ER 
“While the State may favor private schools, it cannot look to them to meet the gen- 
eral want of education. : : 
‘*4, Since the efficient government of the State requires the harmonious co-operation of 
the masses, it is a condition for the welfare of the State to provide schools in which the 
children of the people grow up together without class or sect distinction, so that a more 
homogeneous population may make the action of the Government harmonious and ener- 
etic. 
ot The aim of the public sehool.—The task of the public school is to co-operate with the 
family and the church, and to prepare for life in civil society. But the first two among 
these agencies are variable factors in the individual case, since family education may 
have neglected one child, and church education may be lacking in another. The scope 
of public school education is necessarily enlarged by this circumstance; it must not only 
complement, but supplement family and church education. The aim of public school 
training becomes thereby the development of relatively perfect manhood and woman- 
hood. 
“Since the power of the school is but a delegated one, and its prescribed function is 
instruction, the aim of public schools may be said to be the development of relatively 
perfect manhood and womanhood through instruction and through the guidance and 
discipline incidentnl thereto. 
“ Classification of the publie school.—In so far as the public school has for its function 
to impart that education which is indispensable for the perpetuity of the body politic, 
it is the common school, 
‘“The public school when erganized as high school or college imparts education which, 
while not indispensable to each intelligent citizen, should, for the general good, be pos- 
sessed by a considerable number of individuals. Such higher public education is de- 
signed to train that directive ability which is so important an element in the develop- 
ment of the material and intellectual resources of the State and in the administration 
and perfection of its laws. 
“The duty of the state. —The State has the duty of maintaining common schools, because 
the; are indispensable for its continued existence. 
“* Function of the common school.—The function of the common school is to develop more 
perfectly manhood and womanhood by educating children through instruction in that 
secular knowledge which ina civilized community is indispensable to the individual, and 
through the guidance and discipline incidental to such instruction. i 
“ The subjects of instruction in the common school.—The subjects of instruction in the com- 
mon school are, the acquisition of the means of civilized communication, language, read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, which supplies the measure for the exchange of the common 
necessaries of life and the more general economic values; a general knowledge of the 
country, its resources and position in the world, or popular geography; a knowledge of 
the institutions of the country, of their growth, and of the duties of citizenship. 
“Tn addition to these studies which refer to the duties of citizenship more particu- 
larly, there are others which may be incorporated into the curriculum of the public 
school, since its aim is to train and develop manhood and womanhood and to supple- 
ment family and church instruction. The child should learn the laws of health, and 
havea general knowledge of the most common objects and laws of nature. Since he should 
be prepared for the duties of civil life, the local conditions of asystem of schools may in- 
fluence the course of study. Thus in cities or manufacturing centres more attention 
might be paid to drawing than in rural schools. 
“ Singing, originally introduced to aid church education, remains an object of instruc- 
tion in most of the public schools, on account of the ennobling influence it has on the 
sentiments and the will, and on account of the assistance which it gives in the manage- 
ment of the school-room. 
“The common school should also attend to physical training. 1. By observing proper 
hygienic conditions. 2. By gymnastic exercises. 
“Instruction isa means to anend. The aim is the development of manhood and 
womanhood in accordance with the genius of national institutions. Instruction is im- 
parted because it educates. 
“Tnstruction educates because it gives exercise and thereby training to the faculties. 
The circle of subjects should, therefore, be sufliciently wide and various to appeal to the 
faculties in general. 
“Instruction educates by widening the views of life and supplementing the experi- 
ence of the child, thus extending the circle of his interests. Through the deeper in- 
sight into the relations of life he must learn to act on principle and intelligently. 
‘‘The moral training of the public school is, in a general way, to place the pupil ina 
position similar to those in which he finds himself in life; to accustom him to live with 
his equals, to make him reflect on his actions, to lead him to act according to fixed prin- 
ciples, intelligently,
-P-A-G-E-198
  198 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
‘*To state the moral influences of the public school more in detail: The moral agencies 
\ incidental to instruction are guidance and discipline. There is, in the first place, guid- 
ance in the moral school-room habits of silence, self-control, concentration of effort, of 
punctuality and regularity, of industry. There is also the preparation for civil life, 
which the child receives by being thrown into the society of his equals, hy which he 
learns to respect their rights and to maintain his own; the habitual submission to law 
and authority; experience of the evil consequences of wrong-doing; reverence for au- 
thority; reflection on moral rules and action controlled by moral intelligence as opposed. 
to impulse.”’ 
How far the State should go in educating a child.—Superintendent Baker, of Texas: ‘‘I 
believe that in this day the character of its public schools will determine how far a State 
has advanced in civilization. An intense desire for the ultimate success of the public 
schools of Texas makes me bold to call attention to a much mooted and very important 
subject. It has not yet been carefully considered by any Legislature so far as [ know, but 
there is no reason for longer delay, The object of providing free tuition for the child 
is to fit him for intelligent citizenship; to enable him to participate in the privileges of 
a citizen and discharge the duties incumbent upon him as a member of society. It is 
rather a duty the Government owes to itself than to the child. This, added to the fact 
that without free schools a great number of the people would be reared in ignorance of 
the privileges and duties of citizenship, I conceive to be the only argument in support of 
a free school system, Just how far the State should go in thus preparing a child is a 
question of much moment. Shall the line be drawn at what is commonly termed sec- 
ondary education, or shall the high school, having in its curriculum the higher mathe- 
matics, the sciences, and Latin and Greek, be supported? Is the high school necessary to 
mould the character of citizenship mentioned? I believe not. A thorough knowledge 
of orthography, penmanship, reading, English grammar, geography, arithmetic, and 
English composition I believe amply sufficient for the purpose indicated. A knowledge 
of the branches taught in the high school may better prepare one for advanced thought 
and exalted position, but they are not necessary to the performance of the simple duties 
appertaining to the citizen. If what is termed the higher education is bestowed at the 
public expense, the poor as well as the rich are taxed to bestow it. The children of 
these poor seldom go through the high school, no matter if the tuition is free, because when 
ready for the branches taught in it they have arrived at the age of breadwinners and 
must work. Those who attend the high school are as a rule (and there are few excep- 
' tions to the rule) the sons and daughters of people who are so fortunate as to be able to 
educate their children at private schools. The high school, therefore, is in fact a school 
only for the fortunate few, while the many are taxed for its support. Drawing, as it 
does, largely from the school fund, its teachers being paid higher salaries than other 
teachers, the terms of the primary and intermediate schools are shortened and the State 
is debarred from the privilege of increasing the scholasticage. They thuskeep out of the 
‘schools children under 8 and over 16 years whose education the State has made itself 
responsible for, and cause the Government to fail to comply with the constitutional 
provision declaring that a term of six months shall be maintained. These are potent 
reasons against the maintenance of high schools, but they are not more potent than the 
simple one first stated: ‘The State does not owe the child the character of education 
they bestow.’ 
The settled policy of the whole country.—Superintendent Buchanan, of Virginia: ‘‘ Edu- 
cation at public expense has become the settled policy of the whole country. Hence a 
system of public free schools is to be found in every State and Territory of the Union. 
In support of these systems the annual expenditures now reach $110,000,000. This 
vast sum is meant to be an investment in enlightened and virtuous citizenship, upon 
which depends the safety of society, State and nation, Virginia is endeavoring to fur- 
nish her proper share of this investment.’’ 
  A better sentiment in favor of public education required.—Superintendent Finger, of 
North Carolina: ‘‘ Education at the expense of the State is a part of modern civilization. 
It can not be successfully resisted. Especially is this so in a republican form of gov- 
ernment, such as that of the United States. If there is any one thing that stands out 
prominently in the history of the country, it is the stress that has all the time been laid 
upon the importance of education for the people. 
“The constitution of North Carolina says: ‘The people have a right to the privilege 
. of education, and it is the duty of the State to guard and maintain that right.’ This 
doctrine is fundamental and right, and therefore it must have recognition. 
‘There are now and always have been persons, in our State and in all the States, who 
say that it is wrong to tax one man to educate another man’s children, forgetful of this 
fundamental right; forgetful of the fact that the safety of life and property and the wel- 
fare of the State depend upon the virtue and intelligence of the people. Such persons 
 
-P-A-G-E-199
PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 199 
try to make it appear that the public schools produce crime, because in some communi- 
ties where they have flourished crime has not decreased, or perhaps hasincreased. They 
are not mindful of the fact that, ifin such communities crime has increased, as shown by 
the number of arrests, there has also been a large increase of criminal statutes which may 
account for them, Courses of conduct are now often criminal under statute laws which 
were not criminal before their enactment. They are not mindful of the fact that any 
increase of crime might be accounted for by a number of causes consequent upon the 
ever changing conditions of the population of such communities. 
“The facts are that if there is real increase of crime in such communities, which is to 
be doubted, figures to the contrary notwithstanding, it occurs in spite of all remedial 
agencies and not because of any oneofthem. It may be true, and doubtless is, that the 
public schools have not done as, much as they might have done, but this is no reason for 
wholesale condemnation, It is rather a reason why all good people should lend their 
active influence to make them come up to the full measure of usefulness. 
“If those who complain of poor results would actively join the public school work- 
ers and help to manage the schools, better results would everywhere be attained. The 
public schools are here to stay, and they will gradually be improved—so improved 
as more and more to command the respect and patronage of our people. It is the part 
of wisdom for all good people to recognize these things as facts, and take an active in- 
terest in making the schools better. Let us have a better sentiment in favor of public ed- 
ucation, to the end that the money we do pay may have the best possible application and 
results. ‘ 
“Tt is a common complaint that the public school terms are so short that they do 
not do much good. Of course all the friends of public education very much regret 
that we can not have longer terms; but how easy it would be for almost any neighbor- 
hood in the State to supplement the public funds by private subscriptions and have 
longer terms. Many districts are now doing this, and more will do it as sentiment in 
favor of educating the people improves. Legislation that tends to improve the teachers 
and lengthen the sessions will help to create fayorable sentiment,” 
What shall be taught in the public schools 2—Superintendent Draper, of New York State: 
“What shall be taught in the schools is a question of no small importance, and it is a 
difficuls one to answer. The law leaves it to each locality to settle for itself. The 
tendency of the times, particularly in the larger places, is to undertake too much. It 
ought to be remembered that it does not devolve upon the public schools to put into a 
child’s head all that he willever be expected toknow. It is useless to tax the memory 
with multitudinous pieces of mere information, no matter how worthy of note such in- 
formation may be. Of course some facts must be remembered, but the remembering 
of too many mere facts is now being insisted upon. It is better to create a desire for 
knowledge, and supply the implements with which to gain it. When searched out 
through effort, it will be retained without difficulty. The fact is, that the manner in 
which the school education is started, is of more consequence than the manner in which 
it is finished out. The people are not generally unwilling that the State should foster 
and support advanced education, but they will insist that it shall not be done at the 
expense of elementary work, well knowing that it is of far greater importance that the 
masses be thoroughly grounded in fundamentals than that the few shall be elaborately 
topped out and polished off. If school work is not well commenced, it never will be 
well finished. 
““More than 90 per cent, of all the children who ever comeinto the public schools never 
get beyond the study of the elementary branches, and there is a wide-spread feeling that 
the schools do not accomplish the results for this great mass of pupils which they-ought 
to produce. A wide-spread feeling ally rests upon some foundation. It seems to 
me that a State which is spending $15,000,000 a year for general education, can weil af- 
ford to enter upon a full inquiry which will determine whether the mass of children in 
this country of a given age can read and write and spell and figure as well as the mass 
of children of the same age in the monarchical governments of Europe, and if not, why 
not? My reading and observation, confessedly not jarge, raise grave doubts upon this 
question. A republican state can not afford to have any doubts about such a question 
as this. 
‘There has been much discussion during the year relative to the introduction of man- 
ual training as a regular branch of public school work, and several cities, notably New 
York and Albany, have undertaken a thorough trial of the experiment. It is much to 
be hoped that it may prove a wise undertaking. There will hardly be two opinions as 
to the advantages of industrial training, but it must be demonstrated, upon actual trial, 
that it can be made a part of our common school work with advantage to pupils, with- 
out detracting from the old-fashioned and essential work, to which reference has just 
been made, before it should be generally taken in hand by the school authorities. ‘The 
experiments which have been entered upon will be watched with much interest. The 
     
-P-A-G-E-200
200 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. \ 
test will be a severe one, but it must be met successfully, by a trial in good faith, before 
the already over-full courses of study in the schools should everywhere be opened to ad- 
mit what is commonly called industrial training. 
“There is a common misapprehension in this connection. Manual training need not be 
confined to carpentry work with boys, or making aprons or dresses with girls. Free- 
hand or industrial drawing may train the hand and the eye more effectually than 
handling a saw or a needle. It is easily taught, it is inexpensive, and it is practicable. 
It is the best possible preparation for further manual work. Every school in the State 
may undertake this without difficulty, and with good promise of excellent results, and 
then safely wait for the verdict of those who aré further experimenting upon the subject. 
‘‘Theschools must not only educate the mind but the heart as well. Schools are main- 
tained for the purpose of turning out good citizens. Character is forming while the in- 
tellectuality is being educated, “and the influence of the schools should be exercised to 
form and shape it rightly. We have had much discussion in this country in reference 
to the reading of the Bible and the observance of religious exercises in the schools, and 
it has been determined that these must be omitted because of the likelihood of their 
being used for the propagation of sectarianism. But thismust not be deemed to prevent 
all moral training in the public schools. On the contrary, there should be a strong moral 
influence exerted at all times, in every school-room, which will go continually to the 
sound training and preparation of boys and girls for the social duties and obligations of 
life and for the responsibilities of citizenship in a republic where the ‘ will of the people 
is the law of the land.’ 
“There is, unfortunately, but little done to stimulate patriotism among children in 
the public schools, or outside of them. A generation ago it was common to use the mas- 
terpieces of our national oratory for the purposes of recitation and declamation in the 
schools, and the resultant influences were of no small consequence in arousing and cul- 
tivating patriotic ardor in the rising generation. Then every child was required to take 
part in these exercises. But even this is no longer common. The modern fashion is to 
take pupils who give promise of special success as orators and readers and train them 
elaborately for show upon public occasions. The older custom might be revived with 
profit. The setting apart of an occasional hour for exercises which would lead children 
to revere and love their country, and the requiring of every child to take part in such 
exercises, is a thing which may properly and profitably be done in every public school. 
“The mission of the public schools is to best prepare the greatest possible number of 
children for the activities of life, for social and industrial relations, and for the respon- 
sibilities of citizenship under such a Government as ours. The few ‘must not be favored 
at the expense of the many. The beginners must have the most care and the best work. 
What is done must be practical. A philosophy is of small use unless it materializes. 
~ Children must be evenly educated in all directions. Just what shall be taught, in de- 
tail, must depend upon what, in a practical way, promotes the end for which the schools 
are maintained at public and general expense,’’ 
Necessity of public schools,—Hon. John W. Dickinson, secretary of Massachusetts board 
of education: ‘‘ The ends to be accomplished by a free state are the development of the 
people and protection in the enjoyment of their natural rights. The effectual means to 
be employed for the accomplishment of these ends are public educational institutions 
and a popular government, neither of which can exist without the other. For the exist- 
ence of a free state a common education of the people is necessary, that they may be 
trained to think alike and to exercise that common sympathy through which alone it is 
possible for human individuals to become a people. Burke says that ‘in a state of rude 
nature there is no such thing as a people. A number of men in themselves have no col- 
lective capacity. The idea of a people is the idea of a corporation. It is wholly artifi- 
~ cial, and made, like other legal fictions, by common agreement.’ A common agreement 
is the result of common thinking and common sympathy. The conditions of unity in 
thinking and feeling are public educational institutions where the young may be trained 
by common courses of study pursued in accordance with a common method. 
“Public schools, therefore, are necessary to the existence of a people in the true sense 
of that term, and especially to the existence of a free people who must labor together 
for common ends. But the existence of these institutions is impossible unless they are 
organized, controlled, and supported by the state. For in no other way can a plan of 
instruction be made common and in harmony with the constitution of the state, nor. 
universal and regular study be compelled, nor constant and ample means of support be 
provided. 
“The right, duty, and necessity of establishing public schools, and making the use of 
them universaland compulsory under the direction of the state, become evident by the 
same mode of reasoning as would be employed to prove the right, duty, and necessity of 
establishing the state itself, 
 
-P-A-G-E-201
  RELIGIOUS AND MORAL TRAINING. : 201 
‘‘The dissolution of a State has begun when any considerable portion of its citizens 
refuses to be educated into the spirit of its constitution and into sympathy with its im- 
» portant provisions. Loyalty to the State is shown in fidelity to those institutions which 
are adapted to make intelligent, loyal, and virtuous citizens.’’ 
XII.—RELiaious AND Mora TRAINING. 
The teacher who neglects it a signal failure.—Superintendent Finger, of North Carolina: 
‘* Besides practical intellectual training, we insist upon moral and religious development. 
Of course we cannot give religious instruction except in a general way, all denomina- 
tional or sectarian teaching being excluded. But there is common and undisputed 
ground for all to stand upon. No person rises to the full stature of manhood until he 
chooses to model his life according to the eternal principles of right, and this is only 
tantamount to saying, until he chooses to please God. Love and fear of Him must be 
made to result in reverence for Him and in obedience to His will. 
“Tn proper training at home, the child is brought to love and, in a sense, to fear its 
parents, the two principles of action working together to produce reverence and obedi- 
ence. So, too, when at school the pupil has proper treatment, he will love and fear his 
teacher and will choose, habitually, to obey him. 
“But all obedience in the family, the school, or the state should be insisted upon, 
because such obedience is in accordance with the fundamental principles of right. Ido 
not mean to discuss the foundation of obligation—whether a given course of conduct is 
right because it results in good, or whether it is right because commanded by the great 
Creator of all things. The ten commandments embody great principles, obedience to 
which results in good to those who obey and to all men, and at the same time they have 
the divine approval. 
“Tf it be said that these principles were eternal truth, binding upon men before they 
were commanded by God from Mount Sinai, yet He did sanction them because, as the 
Creator of all things, He did so constitute the relations between all men and their fel- 
lows and between all men and Himself, that these principles always result in good. And 
so we come back to the will of God as the foundation of all obligation and of obedience 
to all proper authority. 
“Tt is therefore the divine will that all teachers should strive to know and make the 
foundation of all moral teaching. A child may, at home and at school, be compelled by 
fear to keep himself within certain rules of action, but this course will afford him but a 
poor preparation for the duties of life asa citizen. Ifhe is not taught continually to 
choose his lines of conduct in accordance with what is right—right in this highest sense— 
so that he may grow up into the habit of choosing to do right, he will most probably be 
unfit to meet the duties and temptations of active life when they confront him. 
“It is the will that determines what any intellectual being shall do and what he shall 
not do, and hence the will must be so trained that what is right shall be habitually fol- 
lowed. The teacher who neglects to emphasize moral and religious training to this ex- 
tent makes a signal failure. 
“Tf it be said that this requirement excludes from the school-room the atheist and all 
whose lives are not directed in the love and fear of God, the ready reply is, for the chil- 
dren’s sakes so let it be; for the country’s sake so let it be. 
“Tf it besaid that we cannot apply religious tests, the ready reply is that the employ- 
ment of teachers is a matter of contract, and no committee is compelled to employ any 
particular person, no matter what his intellectual qualifications may be, if not satisfied 
with his character in this highest sense. 
“Tf it be said that this line of training involves the use of the Bible, the ready reply 
is that scarcely any one will be found to object to its use in the schools if used without 
sectarian teaching; and no one will object to the teaching of the grand and eternal prin- 
ciples of truth which it contains, that all religious people in this country hold in com- 
mon.’? 
Should never be omitted nor postponed.—Superintendent Welcker, of California: ‘‘The 
one great want in the public schools is a greater attention on the part of teachers and 
other authorities to moral instruction—to character building. To turn out good, honest, 
clean-liying men and women, is that which should be, not merely acknowledged, but 
Jelt to be the principal end and aim of the public schools; that nothing should come 
before or be allowed to interfere with this good design; that intellectual education 
should be subordinated to it, and that this instruction should be not merely incidental, 
coming to the front on all suitable occasions, but that it should have its regular and 
frequent place on the programme of exercises. It should never be omitted or postponed 
in favor of anything else.”’ 
The highest end of education.—The following resolution, among others, was adopted at 
a State convention of the county superintendents of Colorado: 
s 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
202° EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. ; 
“Resolved, That we consider the development of character as the highest end of edu- 
cation and the only safe basis of American citizenship, and we urge upon superintend- 
ents the duty of doing all in their power to purify the moral atmosphere of the schools 
and all their surroundings.” 
XTII.—REVENUE. i 
Remedy for inequality of school term.—Superintendent Finger, of North Carolina, also 
calls the attention of the General Assembly to the need of a State tax for the purpose of 
equalizing the school term throughout the State: ‘‘ While an increase of the rate in the 
school law could be made to provide an average of four months in the State, that would 
not afford all the counties that length of term. Some would have more and some less 
« than four months, according to their respective valuation of property and density of 
population, There is no way to remedy this inequality other than to have legislation 
that would distribute all or a part of the school money direct from the State treasury to 
the counties on a per capita basis, Our system as it now stands contemplates that each 
county shall furnish its own school funds. The State board of education has essentially 
no funds to distribute to the counties other than such as may be derived from the entry 
of public lands and from the sale of swamp lands, from which the receipts are very 
smal], Under our statutes, our system is a county system.’ 
The State should provide facilities, Superintendent Young, of Nevada: ‘‘I would re- 
new my recommendation of two years ago that the rate of State school tax be increased. 
Experience demonstrates that it is not satisfactory to leave this question of education so 
largely to the counties. The State should provide adequate school facilities for all of its 
children. Under the existing laws some counties have an average school year of ten 
months, while other counties have an average of less than five months. By increasing 
the State tax the terms of school might be made more uniform and the schools be made 
more efficient,’’ . 
Object of State appropriation.—Superintendent Higbee, of Pennsylvania: ‘‘The pur- 
pose of all State appropriation to the schools is to help the children of the Common- 
wealth, that they all may have every opportunity of securing that culture without 
which the possibilities of their personal being can not be realized. Any movement, 
therefore, upon the part of directors to weaken the autonomy of their districts by mak- 
ing them dependent upon the State appropriation, or to lessen, in any way, their sense 
of the necessity of vigorous self-supporting work, violates the very spirit and intent of 
the act of appropriation. Let the increased fund be used in granting better salaries to 
teachers now underpaid, in securing better teachers by a general advance of salaries, in 
lengthening the school term, and in increasing apparatus and libraries.’’ 
A State tax recommended for Minnesota.—Superintendent Kiehle, after showing how 
much shorter school terms some districts have than others, notwithstanding they tax 
themselves at a heavier rate and expend more per pupil, recommends a State tax, to 
be uniformly distributed. He says: ‘‘We have no State tax for the aid of common 
schools. The one mill tax is only a compulsory local tax, and what is called the State 
appropriation is only a distribution by the State of a government fund, just as the uni- 
versity receives aid from the university and agricultural college land grants, The State 
is aiding by direct tax all departments of education,—university, normal schools, high 
schools, reform school, institutions for deaf, blind, and imbeciles,—all, except the com- 
mon schools, the schools of the people. Still more, these districts are not allowed even 
the full local tax for the support of their schools, The railroads pay an income tax to 
the State, and are therefore exempt from all local taxation. his tax, which amounts 
to over $600,000 annually, is used for the support of every department of government, 
and is distributed to every educational institution except the common schools, The 
necessities of the situation compel me to urge upon the attention of the Legislature the 
importantinterests of these schools, which care for nine-tenths of the children of the State.” 
A uniform State and county tax needed.—Superintendent Pearsall, of Cameron County, 
Pa.: ‘‘ Many of our districts are paying a high rate of school tax, yet are unable to pro- 
vide first-class school-houses, furniture or apparatus and keep the schools in session over 
six months. 
“T do not know as this can be remedied. But if the common schools were founded on 
the benevolent plan—that the taxes of the rich might aid in educating the poor—why not 
extend the plan and let the taxes of the rich districts aid the poor districts. In other 
' words make the school-tax uniform through the county or State. 
‘* Again, we deem the present plan of distributing the State appropriation as clearly 
favoring the thickly-settled portions of the Commonwealth; were the distribution 
. rated upon the number of schools, or the number of pupils, instead of the number of tax- 
o, 
   
-P-A-G-E-203
REVENUE. 203 
ables, it would direct the appropriation where most needed—that is, to the poor and 
thinly-settled districts.” i 
The strong should help the weak.—Superintendent Buchanan, of Virginia: “They do in 
the matter of school funds, Upwards of $800,000 of State funds were apportioned dur- 
ing the present year. The school population is the basis of apportionment. To the poor 
child, therefore, is allotted the same amount as to the rich. Some counties, and the 
cities as well, pay into the public treasury more State school money than is returned to 
them by apportionment. ‘The excess goes to the weaker counties, * For illustration, 
county A pays $8,000 State school tax, county B only $4,000. But suppose the school 
population of the two counties to be the same. Then each is entitled to the same ap- 
portionment, say, $6,000. Therefore A helps B to the extent of $2,000. _ Furthermore, 
the State fund, when apportioned to the counties, is distributed just as is the county 
school money among the magisterial districts on the basis of the school population. So 
the stronger magisterial districts help the weaker in the matter of county school funds.’”’ 
Apportionment should be based on attendance.—Superintendent Holcombe, of Indiana: 
“The State’s school revenues are apportioned among the several counties and the sev- 
eral school corporations in each county, on the basis of the entire number of persons of 
school age residing within the counties and corporations, respectively, without consider- 
ing how many of these actually attend the schools. ‘he variation in the attendance. 
upon the public schools in different counties is very great. In a number of towns and 
cities, and in the rural districts of several counties, there are many private schools which 
receive a liberal patronage. Yet all the resident children attending these are enumer- 
ated, public revenue is apportioned for them and drawn by the corporations in which they 
live, Such a corporation, it is evident, maintains schools for only a part of its chil- 
dren; yet it receives revenue for the tuition of all. In other counties the people depend 
entirely upon the public schools, and must, ‘therefore, provide accommodations for all 
the children who desire to attend. Thus the communities that have to educate only a 
part of their children are placed at an unfair advantage compared with those that must 
provide forall. The former receive from the State enough money to maintain theirschools 
for as long a term as is desired, and sometimes even to accumulate a surplus from year to 
year; the latter can not keep their schools open a reasonable length of time without 
heavy local taxation. This establishes a kind of premium upon a small attendance in 
the public schools.”’ y 
“‘T think, therefore, that the revenues ought to be apportioned upon the actual at- 
tendance of children in the schools, as nearly as if can be ascertained. Such is the prac- 
tice in several States. This attendance could be reported by the teachers directly to the 
county superintendent, and by the county superintendent to the State superintendent.” 
‘The enumeration is now taken every year. It is the work of not less than one man, 
for several days, in each of fifteen hundred or more corporations. The expense of this 
work is considerable. I think $15,000 a year a lowestimate. This expense would be 
saved by the plan I have suggested. But as that plan involves a radical change in the 
system of apportioning our revenues, it may not commend itself to the approval of the 
Assembly. Should such be the case, I suggest that a biennial enumeration of the school 
children would be sufficient to secure a proper apportionment of revenue on the present 
basis.”’ 
Apportionment of township school revenue ; where compulsory charity should stop.—Super- 
intendent Jones, of Dakota: ‘‘The tuition fund of the township should be apportioned 
by the board in equal amounts to the various subdistricts, whenever the amounts to be 
apportioned do not exceed the sum of $180 per annum to each subdistrict. This ad- 
mits of hiring a teacher for six months each year for each school in the téwnship at the 
rate of $30 per month. If there is a balance in the tuition fund of the township after 
the above division is made, such balance should be apportioned to the several sub- 
districts in proportion to their assessed valuation. If any subdistrict fails to use its 
share of the funds for any year, the amount should be withdrawn from such subdistrict 
and divided among those subdistricts in which the fund has been used and six months’ 
school taught, as provided for in the apportionment. This provision would assist the 
weaker settlements in maintaining a reasonably fair school for a reasonable time each 
year and admit of hiring, at least, an average teacher. Further than this compulsory 
charity should not be required to extend, even from an educational standpoint. After 
this generous provision is made the remainder of the public funds should be divided 
according to the assessed valuation. This will admit of the maintenance of a better 
school for a longer time in the stronger subdistricts, and in many cases it will admit 
of the support of graded schools in small towns and villages where they are as much © 
needed as are the primaries in the rural settlements, Another benofit to be derived from 
such provision is the compulsory payment of fair wages to teachers, thereby inducing 
qualified teachers to seek and remain in the profession. Let it once be understood that 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  
204 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
‘the minimum of wages paid in Dakota is $30 per month and we shall soon have a corps 
of teachers who will work miracles, almost, in our educational advancement. Onevery 
excellent teacher writes me as follows: ‘I find many teachers of our county wide awake 
and interested in their work, but the majority are so poorly paid that they can not afford 
to buy books, travel to institutes, and otherwise improve themselves. I know of one 
who is getting $25 per month and pays $14 per month—or $3.50 per week—for board.’ 
Some good teachers are compelled to teach at such wages because they are forced into 
competition with non-professional and unqualified teachers. Thus, the professional 
teacher is forced into competition with farm hands who would otherwise be idle during 
the winter months, and who possess, as a rule, very few of the qualifications that go to 
make up the real teacher. It is here that we find an illustration of the most marked 
difference between teaching and keeping school.’

COUNTRY SCHOOLS. 
[From the School Laws of Oregon, 1887, pp.135-8.] 
Location, 
1. It is assumed that the school district has been accurately surveyed and the metes 
and bounds recorded. Without this the choice must be to some extent guess work. 
The location should be as near as may be convenient to the geographical centre of the dis- 
trict; butreference must be had to the roads by which it can be reached and the impedi- 
ments that may lie in the way. In rural districts the geographical centre when access 
is easy should be preferred to the centre of population, because the latter is liable to change. 
Site. 
2. Hollows and the edges of swamps should be ayoided. Hill-tops are also objection- 
able. A moderate elevation from which the ground slopes in all directions is to be pre- 
ferred. A piece of woods which would shelter the house from the prevalent winds of 
winter is a great protection; but no trees should be allowed to stand within 50 feet of 
the building. 
Orientation. 
3. This question has not yet been settled by theorists. So much depends on the loca- 
tion and the site and the kind of building that is erected that no general rule can be 
given. Considering that the country school-house is usually closed for about four 
months in summer, it will generally be most convenient to have the house built so that 
the pupils may sit facing the north; the windows should then be on the east and west 
sides, 
Plan and size, 
4, Let us for the sake of simplicity confine our attention to the country school-house 
with one teacher and an attendance of from 20 to 50 pupils. In such school-houses 
more than two-thirds of the people of the United States have received and will receive 
their elementary education. A square house is objectionable. The length should be 
about one-third greater than the width. This gives room for the teacher’s platform and 
for a recitatign bench, and places the desks in a square block in front of the teacher. 
There should be at least 12 square feet of floor space for each pupil. The ceiling should 
be 12h feet in average height; this will allow each pupil 150 cubic feet of air space, and 
under no circumstances should there be less than this amount. A house 24x18, inside 
_ measurement, will accommodate twenty-two pupils; a house 28x 21 will accommodate 
forty pupils, 24 x 32, fifty pupils. It is advisable to build a house large enough for an 
attendance one-fourth larger than the number usually going to school in the district. 
The new house attracts better teachers and the double attraction secures more pupils. 
Light, heat, and ventilation, 
5. If the teacher’s platform is on the north side of the house and the pupils’ entrance 
on the south side, the windows should be on the east and west, none on the other sides. 
The eastern windows should be grouped towards the north and the western windows 
should be grouped towards the south. If the windows are equally distributed over the 
walls, the lighting is bad for some purposes, and there is no good place for black-boards. 
If two-fifths of the length of each of the two walls (the eastern and western) is assigned 
to a group of windows, the remaining wall-space is ample for black-board surface, and
-P-A-G-E-205
SCHOOL-HOUSES. . 205 
each black-board is exactly opposite toa window. The placing of black-boards on the 
piers between the windows is very objectionable. Whether the black-board surface is 
wood, or slate, or plaster, it should be a permanent part of the wall itself. Slate is in 
the long run the cheapest, as it is also the best material. Movable black-boards in 
small houses are troublesome. 
A ventilating stove is the best available source of heat. It costs but little more than 
an ordinary stove. Almost any stove can be converted intoa ‘‘ventilator’’ by surround- 
ing it with a sheet-iron jacket, and bringing a tube from the exterior air to the space 
between the stove and the outer casing. The chimney flue should be divided longi- 
tudinally into two parts, one for the escape of smoke and the other for the escape of 
vitiated air. The opening for the latter purpose should be at or very near the floor. 
The best place for the stove is usually the northwest corner of the house. Two moder- 
ate sized stoves placed in different corners are better than one large one. Only one of 
them is needed in moderate weather and two will make the room comfortable in the 
coldest part of winter. A large stove in the middle of a school-room is an unsightly 
obstruction and tends to produce disorder. A ventilating stove placed in the northwest 
corner, with a stove-pipe extending almost to the ceiling and by a horizontal branch 
entering a flue in the southwest corner will give an almost equable temperature in all 
parts of the room. The opening into such a smoke flue near the floor will be a very 
efficient aid to ventilation, but the opening should be protected by a register which can 
be closed at pleasure. 
It frequently happens that such aids to ventilation as have been described are not suf- 
ficient. Our reliance must then be placed on the doors and windows. The windows 
should be within 12 inches of the ceiling and should come down to the level of the desks. 
They should be in two sashes, with cords and pulleys to move upanddown. It is quite, 
a common practice to lower the top sashes a few inches and keep them in this position 
while the school is in session. This is a double error, it lets out the pure, warm air 
which we wish to retain, and lets in a stream of cold air directly on the heads of the 
pupils. Ifthe ventilating flue with an opening at the floor, is not sufficient to carry off 
the impure air, the best plan is to open every door and window in the building for one or 
two minutes, not more than three minutes, and when the room has been thoroughly 
flushed with fresh air close all the openings. Ifnecessary, the operation may be repeated 
at the end of every hour. 
Wardrobes or cloak rooms, 
6. A place for depositing the outer garments in safety and in an orderly manner is a ne- 
cessity in even the cheapest and smallest school-house. Sucha place is often obtained by 
building a vestibule in front of the house. This arrangement improves the external 
appearance of the house, but it is comparatively costly and not free from other objections. 
The cheapest and best plan in a house of only one room is to cut off from the south side 
of the room two small cloak rooms, one for the boys and one for the girls. The pupils’ 
entrance is by a door leading into thé small passage between these two closets. There 
is no door to the closets; an arched doorway always open exposes the interior of the 
closets at all times to the eye of the teacher whose desk is in the north side of the house. 
These closets should be furnished with suitable clothes pins and with shelves to hold 
lunch baskets. ! 
Larger houses. 
7. If two rooms are needed they should be on the same floor and separated by a glass 
partition with movable sashes. A front room 24 by 32 and a back room 24 by 30 will 
accommodate about one hundred pupils. The flues shouid be in the walls adjoining the 
partition. For three rooms the building should be of a T shape, the perpendicular line 
representing a room 24 by 32, and the horizontal line two rooms, each 28 by 21. The 
flues may be conveniently placed in the angles where the front luilding adjoins the rear 
building. For four rooms place a corridor 6 feet wide between two sets of rooms, such 
as are described in the beginning of this paragraph. It is only when more than four 
rooms are needed, or where the ground is unusually expensive, that a two-story house 
should be built, 
Plastering. 
8. As most of country school-houses are closed during nearly half the year, the plas- 
tering is apt to be affected by the damp. The walls should be wainscoted to the height 
of 4 teet from the floor. If the rest of the wall were sheathed with wood of a lighter 
color than the wainscoting and the ceiling covered with the same material, it would be 
found much better than plaster, more ornamental, more durable, and not so much more 
expensive.

  206 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
Outbuildings. 
9. The health and comfort of teacher demand: : 
First, That a substantial woodshed be built, and a sufficient supply of good fuel 
placed therein at the beginning of each term. 
‘Second. Common decency always demands that water-closets be provided and placed 
in the opposite rear angles of the school-yard, or in some other convenient situation. 
Gravel, plank, or brick should be laid from the school-house to these buildings. The 
advantages of placing these closets in easy and convenient communication with the 
school-room are numerous. The fierce winds of winter, the wet and soft grounds in fall 
and spring are dangerous exposures to delicate children in leaving a hot room and who 
are compelled to traverse the length of the playground through mud and water toa 
mean and miserable shed, through which the wind constantly and freely blows. These 
water-closets should be simple and substantial in construction and not too large. Two 
feet and a half room is ample for each child, and never under any circumstances should 
there be two seats in the same inclosure. Each seat should be in an inclosure by itself, 
and the screens between each one should be 6 feet in height or more. In very many 
delicate and nervous children nature refuses to perform its usual functions, however 
great the necessity, in the presence of others or under unaccustomed circumstances, 
and a decent privacy in the school conveniences is necessary to save such from daily pain. 
and more often serious consequences. 
The promiscuous arrangement and condition of the ordinary school privileges urgently 
demand that these necessary appliances should receive at least as much care as the other 
circumstances of school life. 
. Apparatus, 
10. Globes, charts, numeral frames, outline wall maps, ink, paper, text-books, cube 
and square root blocks are necessary appliances for the efficient management of every 
school. 
Furniture. 
11. Among the indispensable articles of furniture are a few chairs, a teacher’s table, 
black-board and crayons, a clock, a dictionary, a water pail and cups, pointers, erasers, 
brgoms, and brushes. Each school should be furnished with a closet, in which the mova- 
ble property may be secured. 
Improvements in school-houses.--Superintendant Williams, of York County, Pa.: 
“Directors should exercise more care in the location of school buildings. A house 
should never be built on low, swampy ground, on the top of the highest hill in the 
district, or on a stony piece of ground that is of no value for any other purpose, nor on 
the rear of the lot, compelling children to wade to it through mud over shoe-tops. Houses 
should be built on dry ground, sheltered from the.cold blasts of wind, and the entrance 
should always be away from the sunny side. Housesare often built toosmall. A house 
should be long enough to afford ample room for seating, recitation, and black-board ex- 
ercises. The space between the last seat and the black-board is nearly always too small 
for convenience and satisfactory recitation work. The width of the room is very often 
insufficient, causing narrow aisles, and great inconvenience in passing to and from reci- 
tation. The centre aisle is often not more than four feet wide, making it inconvenient 
. and unsatisfactory. Ceilings are generally toolow. A house should be long enough, wide 
enough, and high enough to afford ample room and capacity for good ventilation. School 
grounds are nearly always insufficient. No less than half an acre should be given to 
every house. A few dollars invested for this purpose might save many dollars, broken 
limbs, and many other serious injuries. A few porches should be removed and built 
larger, more substantial, and closed at the ends. Several pupils have been severely in- 
jured, and, in one case, a pupil lost his life by neglecting so small a matter as closing the 
sides of a porch.” 
The grounds should be fenced.—Superintendent McNeal, of Dauphin County, Pa.: ‘‘Ar- 
bor Day has done much for the improvement of our school grounds. In many of the 
yards shade trees have been planted and are growing nicely, and in a few years will pre- 
sent the appearance of beautiful parks. Much more would have been done in this di- 
rection if the yards were all fenced. Let directors fence the grounds so that the trees 
and shrubbery will be protected, and the teachers and pupils can be relied upon to do 
the rest in the way of beautifying them.” 
A factor of more than ordinary importance.—Superintendent Hamilton, of Allegheny 
County, Pa.: ‘The school-room environment of the pupil is a factor in his educational 
development of more than ordinary importance. Nothing, perhaps, if we except good 
teachers, contributes more to the success of school work than well-planned and suitably-
-P-A-G-E-207
  SCHOOL SYSTEMS—STATISTICS. 207 
furnished school buildings. The proper heating, lighting, and ventilating of these build- 
ings, as well as the suitable fencing, grading, and beautifying of the grounds attached 
thereto, must each have its requisite attention before the highest results can be expected.’ 
Provide home-like altractions and conveniences.—Superintendent Strayer, of Cambria 
County, Pa.: ‘‘There is not, however, the interest taken in the improvement of school 
grounds and houses that there should be. Grounds should be inclosed with a neat, 
substantial fence and shade trees planted. It is an absolute waste of time and money 
to plant trees according to the instructions of the Governor and State Superintendent, 
unless grounds are freed from rubbish and placed in proper condition. Arbor Day exer- 
cises will never be generally observed until a radical change is made, and school officers, 
teachers, and patrons plainly see that houses and grounds should receive the same at- 
tention that is bestowed on other educational agencies. Is it not the duty of all con- 
cerned to provide home-like attractions and conveniences for our boys and girls if we 
would wisely expend the money given to the support of the common schools ?”” 
XV.—ScHoon Sysrems. 
The Minnesota system of education.—Superintendent Kiehle: ‘‘ Our system of education 
may be considered complete when a good common school, well equipped, and well taught 
for at least eight months of the year, is located within the reach of every family, and 
from which every boy and girl of promise and ambition may reach the high school. 
From the high school the way should be plain and practicable to any of the departments 
of the university. In brief, every child of the State should have the opportunity and 
encouragement to make the most of himself, to attain the highest degree of skill, intel- 
lectual and mechanical, of which he is capable, and therefore his highest usefulness. 
‘‘Moreover, a system of education does not consist in the aggregate of all parts, as 
when the elementary, the academic, and the collegiate are all formed within the State: 
without organic relations. 
“T believe that Minnesota may claim justly, and with some pride, not only that she 
has schools of all grades, but that they are so related that each department, grade, or 
class is adapted to and contributes directly to the efficiency of the others. The pupil 
who does well in the lower grade finds, when he knocks at the door of the grade above, 
that his record has gone before him, and is there set to his credit. He finds, too, that 
the work of the school above is adapted to the training already given, and the promise 
of all this’has been his encouragement from the beginning.’’

POINTS FOR CONSTANT CONSIDERATION IN THE STATISTICS OF EDUCATION. 
[Report of the Committee on Educational Statistics of the National Council of Education, presented by Hon. 
John Eaton,"] 
1. Statistics of education are not to be regarded as of greater value than the end for 
which they are kept. We do not educate that we may keep statistics, but we gather 
statistics that we may know better how to educate. 
2. Statistics of education can not give completely that wonderful work in man, At 
best they must come short of the whole story of what education does, and its results, 
We should not expect from them what there is not in them. 
3. We should neither overestimate them nor underestimate them, nor put them out 
of place in our plans or efforts. Ifa teacher may lay down his life for his pupils, he 
certainly should not, in a struggle simply to perfect his statistics. Better sacrifice the 
record of a school than the children in it, 
4, Numerals are not the whole of statistics. There must be description or descrip- tive texts enough for their correct understanding and interpretation; graphics may add 
much to their value. 2 
5, Whatever adaptation to local peculiarities with respect of what statistics include or 
exclude, the more they approach to a universal language the better. The progress of © 
Statistics towards the universal may foreshadow the international in law, commerce, and, 
generally, in intercourse among communities and nations and the possibilities of uni- 
versal peace. How long has the measuring of social and civil forces been subordinated 
to the problems of war? How long have war statistics been to the front? Why has 
not the time come to bring to the front statistics tending to peace, of which the educa- 
tional are the most central and significant of other conditions, showing the power in 
their individual or collective capacity in respect to all that pertains to human progress   
1 National Council of Education—Proveedings, 1887, p, 60.

  208. EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
in every department? Is not this precisely what has been going on for these fifty years? 
Compare educational statistics of to-day with those fifteen years old. The United States 
are in the way to lead in perfecting educational statistics. Are our institutions to be 
preserved? ‘The knowledge of their value, the signs which point out the causes and 
prevention of peril, must be in possession of the people. Our affairs are not to be di- 
rected by a king or a class, but by a majority of all the people. Therefore the people, 
all the people, should be constantly studious of the vital interests which these statistics 
represent. Do farmers and seamen watch the storm signals? Every citizen should 
watch the signals of sociology. How stands the barometer of intelligence? ‘Whither 
tend the currents? What are their velocity and force? No citizen should be ignorant 
or indifferent. He should not only see how his child or neighborhood stands, what the 
details of these facts are in themselves, but how they compare with others and with the 
best standards. This would have some effect on the universal boasting that my class, my 
school, my college, my city, my State is the best,—which we have ad nauseam. 
6. The aiming towards larger or more universal bearings of statistics in education 
need not, and should not, take from their local meaning or lessons; but should add to them 
by affording larger range of comparisons. Each school, each district, ward, town, par- 
ish, borough, or city or county, each seminary, academy, college, university, should 
keep its statistics so as to accord with all others of similar character in its State; and 
each State should so keep its records as to compare in certain important particulars with 
those of every other State in our Union; indeed, every nation may so keep its statistics 
that they may have some accord, some fair ground of comparison,-with those of every 
other nation. 
7%. Statistics of education should be, in form and nomenclature, not only to be com- 
pared with themselves, but with statistics representing other sociological conditions. 
‘They should not only show what the school attendance and the school work performed 
are in a given civil unit, district, ward, city, etc., but what the school population is; and at 
once furnish a safe basis of comparison, first as to illiteracy, second as to morals, crime, 
ete., third as to health, sickness, longevity, and so forth. 
8, It should not be forgotten that statistics of education in the United States are not 
primarily authoritatively secured by the same agency; and in bringing them into com- 
parison, all essential differences should be regarded. The nation has gathered certain 
facts about education for a series of decades; each State, also, now has its statistics of 
education; moreover, certain municipalities report special items for their own benefit; 
besides, private institutions, whether chartered or not, have their own way of making 
the facts about themselves known. The National Bureau of Education, an agency for 
collecting and publishing statistics of education, has issued annually a Report since 1870; 
all reports to it are voluntary. But it has sought to utilize all authoritative collections 
of educational data and to give to each statement or collection the actual value of the au- 
thority or source from which it was derived. The Bureau has drawn from the United 
States censuses, State censuses, city school reports, and the authorized statements made 
by all classes of institutions. During the time of half a generation in which this work 
has gone forward systematically year by year, the points for constant consideration above 
enumerated have been kept in mind, and greater and greater approximation to them has 
been secured. Is it not time to revise what has already been accomplished and to take 
a step forward ? 
9. In working toward any ideal of statistics, it should be remembered how much is de- 
pendent upon legislation, and under what a variety of difficulties it must be accomplished 
in Congress, in the several States and Territories, and in numerous municipalities. 
10. The great advantage of a national initiative is the last point that I wish io enu- 
merate in this preliminary statement of the points for constant consideration in the sta- 
tistics of education. If this council can agree thus far, may it not be prepared to go 
forward at a future time in a specific enumeration of what educational statistics should 
include, and in what periods and in what manner they should be recorded, collected, 
and published ? 
More accurate and reliable under a township system.—Superintendent Raab, of Illinois: 
‘What is true in mechanical affairs is equally true in intellectual affairs—the simpler 
the machinery the more effective it is, and the less liable to get out of order. The gath- 
ering of the general and financial statistics of the schools of the State, as at present con- 
ducted, is a difficult task, and their accuracy is in an inverse ratio to the difficulties 
under which it is accomplished. To most boards of directors, because it is an unusual 
task to them, the reports to the trustees cause a great deal of annoyance, and because 
the work is done unwillingly the reports are made late, thus preventing the boards of 
trustees from making their reports to the county superintendents in time. What an 
amount of time and labor could be saved, and how much could the accuracy and relia- 
pility of these statistics be increased, if one report from each township were to be made 
to the county superintendent, embracing in one document the data which now have to 
be collected by from six to ten boards of directors.’’

Registers not correcily kept.—Superintendent Bell, of Monroe County, Iowa: ‘‘In 1885 . 
a careful inspection of the school registers revealed the fact that about three-fourths of 
them were not correctly kept. As a consequence, at least that ratio of reports to district ‘ 
secretaries must have heen incorrect. What reliance, then, can be placed in the school « 
statistics of the whole State, if those from Monroe County are an average in point of cor- 
rectness?” 
Penaity for failure to report,—Superintendent Moody, of Idaho, writes to the Bureau: 
“T regret exceedingly that I can not give more complete statistics. “The neglect of 
the trustees is at the bottom of the trouble. The only penalty that I can inflict is to 
withdraw the apportionment of non-reporting districts, and I am loth to take sucha 
step for the reason that it deprives the children of educational facilities without making» 
the real cuiprit suffer.’ 
Private schools should be required to report.—Superintendent Orr, of Georgia: ‘‘As the 
private high schools, and perhaps to a small extent the-private elementary schools, are 
likely to remain in coming years a portion of our educational machinery, I think some 
mode ought to be provided whereby a report of what they are accomplishing may be ob- 
tained. Though they are private enterprises I can see no wrong in requiring them to 
give information in which the entire publie is deeply interested. This principle is ree- 
ognized in all census legislation. Private persons are required to give such information 
as is of vital interest to the public.” : 
  XVII.—SUPERVISION. 
Essential elements of supervision.—Superintendent Dutton, of New Haven, Conn.: ‘‘ Our 
schools could never have reached their present high rank had it not been for the careful 
supervision of the principals of all the school-rooms in their several sub-districts. The 
quiet, satisfactory, and thorough manner in which the schools are conducted from year 
to year is a sufficient proof of the excellence of the system. The only possible danger is 
that principals may suffer their time aud energies to be too much absorbed by clerical 
duties and by sundry details that are always claiming attention. To be much in the 
school-rooms, to bring judgment and experience to bear in weighing the merits of the 
actual teaching, and to offer suggestions and criticisms without reserve, as opportunity 
requires, —these constitute the essential elements of that immediate oversight which prin- 
cipals are expected to give. To help the weaker and less talented teachers to become as 
good as the average, and to deal frankly with all that savors of incompetency, is the best 
service that a supervisor can render his patrons. He will also endeavor to,secure a full 
and punctuai attendance of the pupils in his district. He will see that the programmes 
are so arranged that the several subjects of study receive due attention. He will conduct 
such examinations, oral and written, as are needed to keep him well informed concerning 
the advancement of the several classes.’? 
Well considered and thoughtful economy.—Superintendent Nelson, of Michigan: ‘As 
might be anticipated, experience demonstrates the efficiency and value of an enlightened 
supervision of any and every system of public instruction. Our cities wisely intrust r 
this supervision to a single person. The advantages of this method of organization are — 
quite obvious, and are well certified by prolonged experience. Itsecures unity, it inspires 
emulation, it promotes a nobler standard of merit, it commands more intelligent and 
competent teaching gifts. It seems rational to anticipate that a similar supervision of 
rural schools would tend to the accomplishment of similar results. Some system of 
county superintendence, well remunerated, and, so far as possible, removed from the 
petty jealousies and intrigues of political partisanship, would be undoubtedly, a measure 
of wise and needed legislation. Objections raised on the score of economy are scarcely 
pertinent. It may be doubted whether it would add a farthing’s weight to the burden of 
school taxation. Yet, if so, is the objection really valid and worthy of serious consid- 
eration? Not ina free commonwealth whose very existence depends upon the inteili- 
gence and virtue of its people. Extravagance in government expenditure is pernicious, 
no doubt; but unstintel and generous provision for the maintenance of free schools is 
not extravagance. The rather, itis well considered and thoughtful economy. As truly 
as ‘the lifeis in the blood,’ so free governments subsist by freeschools. Whatever they cost, 
itis the price which we must inevitably pay for our immunity from the evils of an- 
archy or despotism.”’ ~ 
County superintendents in IUinois.—Superintendent Raab: ‘‘ Whenever the teachers of 
the State had an opportunity of expressing their approval of the recent amendments to 
the school law respecting the county superintendency, they have done so in the most un- 
qualified terms, and the reports concerning the working of these amendments coming 
from the different counties are unanimously commendatory. * * * Heretofore only

a few favored counties gave their superintendents time to visit schools and pay therefor; 
in the rest of them the county superintendent was reduced to a mere clerk, who had to 
keep accounts, to conduct teachers’ examinations and grant certificates, and to make re- 
ports. Now, all over the State, the county superintendent is what his name implies—an 
overseer of the schools of the county—and this happy change for the better will be felt, 
I hope, in the remotest nooks and corners, thus tending to equalize the benefits of edu- 
cation and making the population of the State more homogeneous.’’ 
County superintendents needed in Arkansas,—Superintendent Thompson, of Arkansas, 
says: ‘t The more I see of the actual work of our schools, the more fully am I convinced 
that one of the greatest wants of the public school system of Arkansas is intelligent 
' county supervision.’’ 
Most fruitful of good results,—Superintendent Lawhead, of Kansas: ‘‘In school work, 
as in other departments, system is essential to the accomplishment of the highest re- 
sults, and this is best secured by means of a well-devised supervision. Our method of 
supervision by county superintendents is, in my opinion, the most fruitful of good re- 
sults that has been tried, and when our people shall come to appreciate the importance 
of that office and realize what a power it may be made for the improvement of our 
schools, I believe they will select their superintendent with more care than any other 
officer.’ 
Beneficial effects noticeable.—Superintendent Finger, of North Carolina: ‘‘'The bene- 
ficial effects of superintendence is specially noticeable in many counties in this State, 
* in which, even with small pay, activeand competent men have been induced to work in 
this line. Iam glad to state that much more progress has been made in such counties 
than in those in which superintendents have not been so active, but-have held their 
places mainly as examiners of teachers.”’ 
Tenure of office of county superintendents.—Superintendent Cornell, of Colorado: ‘‘ The 
condition of the schools is largely dependent upon the county superintendents. Thisis 
especially true of the country schools, and in no department of the educational work is 
there more need of able supervision than in these schools. A judicious, earnest, and 
capable county superintendent can do much toward improving the schools of his county, 
but it requires earnest effort. It is sometimes said that the office of the county super- 
intendent is not appreciated. It is called an unimportant office. The importance of 
the office depends upon how it is filled. The county superintendent has it in his power 
to render the office one of great value, and compel the people to acknowledge its im- 
portance. * * * Unfortunately, changes in this office occur too frequently for the 
good of the schools. When a county superintendent holds the office but two years, he 
has but little time to mature and carry out plans. It takes him one year at least to 
learn the wants and conditions of the schools of his county; then he has but little time 
left to carry out any methods for advancing the schools. For this reason, county super- 
intendents who are doing good work should be retained as long as possible.’’ 
Pay of county superintendents.—Superintendent Welcker, of California: ‘‘In every 
county the superintendent of the schools should receive a decent and comfortable sup- 
port, so that he may be contented, and able to give his whole time to his duties. His 
reasonable travelling expenses should be reimbursed to him. Certainly they should not 
be deducted from his salary, which, as said before, should be decent and comfortable. 
He should have certain days fixed for duty in his office, and the entire residue of his time 
should be given to continuous visitation of the schools. Then the teachers and trustees 
would know that they were being continually looked after. The teachers would feel 
that they had a professional friend to advise and sympathize with them—one capable of 
instructing and helping them. His frequent visits and constant supervision would cre- 
ate and preserve thorough organization; would infuse into the system all the new and 
valuable improvements evolved by experience everywhere, and would make the system 
consistent and homogeneous. His efforts would be those of an equalizer, to raise the 
lowest school on to a level with the highest, and to make them everywhere good. 
‘* Tt will be objected that many counties are too poor to pay their school supetintend- 
ent a salary which will engage his whole time in their service; that they are too sparsely 
settled, and that they must wait till more money shall have been invested within their 
borders. The ready answer is that to have good schools in the county is the best in- 
vitation to settlement and investment; with population comes wealth, the enhancement 
of existing property, and the production of more. Let it be well understood that any 
county, even the remotest and least developed, has superior schools, and the fact will 
give an immediate and great impulse to migration thither. Now, this great desidera- 
tum may be had by simply paying one officer a decent salary.”

Effect of politics.—A four years’ term for county superintendents recommended.—Superin- 
tendent Akers, of Iowa: ‘‘ The law should strengthen the office, and enlarge the powers 
of the county stiperintendent, keeping, of course, within safe and prudent limitations. 
‘The office is now greatly weakened by the political situation in many counties. 
However successful, competent, and faithful a superintendent may be, if the control of 
the county passes from one political party to another the experienced and successful 
officer is displaced, and a new and inexperienced man or woman, as the case may be, 
suceeds to the administration of the office. 
‘This is prejudicial to the interests of our schools and greatly retards progress. 
“The success of educational work depends very largely upon organization. A change 
in the system of organization and management of the schools of a county, is always at- 
tended with confusion, and not infrequently results in a relapse of several years. 
“Tt has been suggested from many sources that the county superintendency should 
be made @ non-political office. Just how this may be done so as to improve upon our 
present method, is difficult to determine. 
“The proposit! ‘on to make the office appointive, either by the board of supervisors or 
any other county authority, has not been favorably received. It is by no means certain 
that this would either take the office out of politics or secure more competent officers. 
The county superintendent should be elected by the people. If this could be done at a 
non-partisan election, as for instance, at the school elections in March, it would bea 
great improvement over ourfpresent plan. The term of office, as I have heretofore sug- 
gested, should be four years instead of two. This would tend more.to give the office 
strength and independence, than anything else that could now be done. Four years 
would allow sufficient time to develop and mature a plan of organization, and to test 
the fitness and ability of a superintendent. A system, if good and effective, would ob- 
tain a strong hold upon teachers and leave a lasting impression upon the schools of the 
county. Succeeding officers would find it more difficult to make radical changes in the 
work of the county, and in many cases they would adopt the system of their predeces- 
sors, and continue the work without material change or interruption. A term of four 
years would enable the superintendent to become well acquainted with school officers 
and the condition of schools throughout the county, as well as to become informed as to 
the character and teaching ability of teachers. He would become familiar with the 
school law, and his influence thus largely increased he would be able to settle amicably 
the petty troubles which are usually litigated to the great injury of the schools.” 
XVIII.—TEAcHERS. : 
Averageatiendance as affecting teachers’ salaries. Superintendent Buchanan, of Virginia: 
“Objections are urged against the principle of regulating salaries by school attendance. 
Where it entails loss it begets complaint. But how to wisely and equitably adjust the 
matter of teachers’ salaries is a difficult question. Interests are to be guarded which 
seem to be in conflict. On the one hand, it is urged that to subject teachers to reduction 
of pay for causes which they can not control, and without regard to the manner in which 
they discharge their duties, is manifestly unjust ; that the number of pupils in a school 
is not necessarily a test of the teacher’s efficiency or even popularity; that many causes 
affect school attendance, such as sparseness of population, indifference among patrons, 
real or fancied: need of children’s services at home, sickness, bad weather, bad roads, un- 
comfortable school-houses, etc. ; that non-attendance from such causes should not dimin- 
ish teachers’ pay; that making salaries depend on average attendance tends to make 
teachers less independent, and therefore less inclined to exact thorough work of their 
pupils, enforce proper discipline, and discharge all other duties without fear or favor. 
“The remedy suggested can be briefly stated. Place the schools where they ought to 
be, assign them the best teachers available, and pay the teachers the whole amount of 
salaries agreed upon. If a teacher proves inefficient, dismiss him and employ another. 
If the average attendance fall below a certain number, close the school. 
“On the other hand, it is maintained that our school fund, being insufficient to fur- 
nish all the school facilities needed, ought to be so managed as to reach as many children 
as possible; that this cannot be done except on some such plan of regulating salaries on 
the basis of school attendance as now exists; that the public interests are to be guarded. 
in the expenditure of public funds, as well as the interests of private individuals; that 
the principle which makes the amount of teachers’ salaries independent of an efficient 
discharge of duty is vicious; that, as a rule, good teaching attracts more pupils than 
poor teaching, and ought to be better’ paid; that as teachers of private schools are, as a 
rule, dependent wholly on their patronage for their income, it is not unjust that public 
school teachers should be partly so.’” 
Grading of teachers’ salaries. —Superintendent Jones, of Dakota: ‘‘'Teachers’ salaries 
in our public schools should be graded to correspond with their certificates of qualifica-
-P-A-G-E-212
  212 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
tion. The plan has been thoroughly tested elsewhere, and found to work to great ad- 
vantage. When schools are put up at auction—which is practically done in numerous 
instances—and teachers of the first grade are required, in order to secure a school, to 
underbid third grade and even probation teachers, it may well he concluded. that our 
educational system requires looking after. We may now be looking too much to that 
which is showy and ornamental, and slighting that which is of material, practical value. 
It would be well to establish these salaries by law, as is done in California, had wea 
permanent school fund of reasonable proportions; but this being wanting, it would be 
well to provide for the grading being done in each county by a proper board, composed, 
for example, of the county superintendent and the chairmen of the various school boards, 
in order that the salaries fixed may be in proportion to the tuition fund to be expended, 
these funds now being of local origin.”    
Proposed service pension for teachers.—Superintendent Welcker, of California, in speak- 
ing of the necessity of keeping experienced teachers in the service, especially a due pro- 
portion of male teachers, says: ‘‘ How shall we invite and retain the best of both sexes? 
How shall we secure the inestimable benefits ofexperience? By saying to the teachers, 
‘Here is a great and noble calling, which it has always been, but which henceforth will 
provide against destitution in old age.’ The teacher has at present no cheerful outlook 
to the future. He fears the approach of old age, hand and hand with poverty, and be- 
times he leaves and looks out for something else. Suppose that some reasonable pension 
after thirty years of faithful and successful service were granted to the teachers, say $25 
per month during the residue of his or her life. I mention a very low sum, indeed, to 
render this proposition, not merely to do justice, but to make a wise and economical in- 
vestment for the State, less startling. It might be that the liberality of the people, as 
expressed by the Legislature, would prescribe a largersum. But let us think of $300 
perannum. What a revolution that would create in the personnel of the profession ! 
“The intending teacher, man or woman, would say to himself or herself: ‘ Here is a 
noble calling in which for thirty years I can find a respectable living, and then when 
old age comes on, and possibly failing health, even at the worst I shall not starve!’ 
“They will be able to enter upon their life-work without fear and misgiving; they 
will be able to give themselves up to it unreservedly; to devote their whole energies to 
it, and to become year by year more and more valuable to the State. Could the State 
make wiser investment of its money? 
‘‘When we come to consider what would be the cost of so great a boon, we are sur- 
prised that it is so small. I have not the means of knowing exactly the number of 
teachers now on the rolls who have had 30 years of successful experience. But I think 
we may come pretty near it. The honor and advantages of a life diploma are so great 
that we may assume that as soon as a teacher is entitled to one he obtainsit. Of the 
life diplomas on the rolls at this time there are but 18 which will be 20 years old at 
the expiring of this year, showing but 20 who have had 30 years’ experience, even as- 
suming them all to have continued teaching, which is by no means true. Then to start 
this beneficial measure into operation would cost but $5,400 per annwm! A sum so 
small that it could not be felt in the taxes of the State. No tax-payer in the State could 
discover from his own tax dues whether the appropriation had been made or not, and 
yet not since the opening of the first public school has there been a measure so fraught 
with good to the public.” 
  The bane of ow common schools.—Superintendent Mann, of Clay County, Iowa: ‘The 
bane of our common schools is, we have no teachers that enter the work as a vocation. 
The salaries paid to teachers will not warrant any person of energy in entering the work 
for any length of time. Consequently, our best teachers are constantly dropping out, 
and their places are being filled by young and inexperienced teachers.”” 
Teachers should be able to rely with reasonable certainty upon employment.—Superintend- 
ent Buchanan, of Virginia: ‘‘Schools which experience frequent change of teachers are 
not the most progressive. Such changes are often inevitable, often expedient. Beyond 
this, they are to be avoided, as detrimental both to the schools and the teachers. A 
good many persons engage in teaching as a temporary expedient, looking in other direc- 
tions for permanent or more lucrative employment. These, after asession or two, drop 
out, leaving their places to be filled by others. 
“Again, there is a class of peripatetic teachers. They do not stay long in one place. 
Changes from these causes are unavoidable, and may also be expedient, At any rate it is 
always expedient to exchange an indifferent teacher fora good one. . But when a teacher- 
has proved faithful and efficient, has become acquainted in a neighborhood, has secured 
the confidence of the community, knows the capacities and temperaments of the pupils, 
and their different degrees of advancement in their studies, such teacher can begin a 
new term with manifest advantages over a new teacher, and for this reason as well as 
others, ought, in the interests of the patrons and pupils to be retained. But it is es- 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
    TEACHERS. 218 
pecially due teachers that they, having chosen teaching as a profession, and proven 
themselves competent, worthy, and efficient, should be able to rely with reasonable cer- 
tainty on employment, and thus be relieved as far as practicable of suspense and anxiety 
in regard thereto. If ability, skill, energy, and good character secure steady employ- 
ment in other pursuits, they ought especially to do soin that of teaching.”’ 
Length of service not always an advantage.—Superintendent Hinsdale, of Cleveland, Ohio: 
‘There is, no doubt, a considerable probability that a person who teaches many years 
will acquire considerable skill as a teacher; but when one remembers how many persons 
never make progress in any occupation beyond the initial steps, and how deadening to- 
the mind routine is when care is not taken to keep the mind fresh and elastic, as well as 
how many teachers fall into routine, he must see that time in the service and skill in 
teaching are very different things. Sometimes length of service is a positive disadvan- 
tage,owing to the influences just set forth; and there is reason to think the tendency in | 
this direction is especially strong in lower-grade work, where the field is narrow and 
routine benumbing. Some teachers are less efficient at the end of 20 years than they 
were at the end of 10. At the end of 1 year, some teachers have more experience in the 
best sense, than others at the end of 10 or 20 years; and, it may be said, some persons 
who have never taught a day are better teachers potentially than others are actually who 
haye served half a lifetime. In fact, one is often surprised to see how quickly young 
persons of scholarship, aptness for teaching, and character take very high rank as teach- 
ers as he is to observe how many of the greatest teachers have been very young men. 
* * * * * * * 
“Touching the teacher’s experience, then, the main question is not ‘How much ex- 
perience have you had?’ but ‘ What kind of an experience has it been?’ Not * How 
long have you taught?’ but ‘What have you learned about teaching?’ 
‘All this has an intimate bearing on a question now much discussed. That some- 
thing should be done to make teachers’ tenures more fixed and lasting, and so to protect 
them from the predatory habits of those who prey upon them, goes without argument; 
but those who are seeking to solve the problem should not overlook the danger at the 
other extreme. An arrangement to keep all teachers who are once elected in, is nota 
solution of the tenure problem. That solution also includes the protection of the public 
and the schools against teachers who have proved failures.” 
The one thing most effective. Superintendent Bayes, of Dubuque County, Iowa: ‘‘ Prob- 
ably the one thing more than any other that has enhanced the usefulness of our schools, 
isan unwritten rule of action among our boards of directors regarding the teachers’ tenure 
of office. It is generally understood among them that when a teacher is once employed 
in a district his claim for reappointment shall take precedence of all others, in case he 
gives reasonable satisfaction.’”’ 
Competent teachers should be retained. —Superintendent Williams, of Delaware: ‘‘Another 
obstacle to successis the frequent change of teachers in many school districts. This greatly 
embarrasses the work of our school system. It must be admitted that an incompetent 
teacher should be superseded by a better one, but other things being equal, pupils will 
learn more from a teacher with whose methods they are familiar; than trom a new one. 
Ifa teacher has succeeded well, has evinced skill, industry, and intelligence, it is, almost 
without exception, a decided detriment to change. When the services of a thoroughly 
competent teachér have been secured, they should be retained from term to term, and 
the question of wages, whether a few dollars more or less per month, is of small conse- 
quence.’? 
Cannot afford to stop the pruning.—Superintendent Preston, of Mississippi: ‘‘We must 
not look simply to the saving of money, and the consequent ability to lengthen the term 
of our schools. Our public school system improves only as the teaching force performs 
its function better, and there can be no doubt that with rigid, impartial examinations, 
with institutes, with real supervision and inspection of their work, our teachers will be 
stimulated to broader and more accurate scholarship, and toa more faithful performance 
of their duties. The sacred duty of the State is to see that the best possible corps of 
teachers is obtained, and she fails in her obligations to tax-payers and to her children in 
every instance where an incompetent teacher is placed in charge of a school. Every en- 
ergy should be utilized to remove the incompetent, and to stimulate the efficient teacher 
to his best efforts. We have vigorously used the pruning hook during the past year, and 
better fruit will be the result. We cannot afford to stop the pruning because of the 
clamor of the falling branches. They bore no fruit and we cannot stop to listen to them, 
or their friends, or their kindred.”’ 
There are reasons for preferring male teachers.—Suaperintendent Buchanan, of Virginia: 
“* At the same [present] rate of increase our schools in a few years will be pretty largely 
 
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
‘ 
in the hands of female teachers. No unfavorable comment is: to be made on this ten- 
dency, yet it ought not to go too far. Intelligent and careful observation accords to 
women, as teachers, the possession of equal tact, skill and fidelity with men. For in- 
structing younger children, especially, they are by natural endowments better fitted than 
men. They have met with good success also in more advanced work. But for schools 
* composed of older pupils, where a somewhat vigorous discipline is necessary, there are 
reasons for preferring male teachers.’’ 
No one has a *‘ right”? to a position in a school. Superintendent Stockwell, of Rhode 
Island: ‘‘One great obstacle in some of our cities and towns to the employment of a 
better class of talent, is that by a sort of unwritten law residents of the place are sup- 
posed to have a sort of pre-emptive right to the position of teacher, and so they present 
their ‘claims’ and they are elected. Now, no one should be allowed to entertain the 
notion that he has any ‘right’ to a position in aschool. ‘ Other things being equal,’ 
as is sometimes said, itis well enough to give a preference to residents, but even then 
there is a liability of a dangerous precedent creeping in and establishing itself. ‘The 
committee should always keep the matter of appointments so completely in their hands 
as never to feel bound to any one, except to the best one that can be found for the salary 
to be paid. : 
“Moreover, there is oftentimes great advantage to be gained by introducing into a 
system of schools teachers who have been trained in a different way, in another atmos- 
phere, under different minds. By so doing new ideas and methods, a new spirit and 
life are set at work, and progress is the inevitable result.” 
How security in position is to be attained.—Superintendent Stockwell, of Rhode Island: 
‘*Security in position for the teacher, not so much through a ‘tenure-of-office’ Jaw as 
by the fact that the power to hire and to discharge is in the hands of a board specially 
chosen for the work, and if not specially qualified at the outset, very soon becoming so 
in the discharge of their duties, and governed, as a rule, solely by the desire to secure 
the best service for the means at command, is the result to be looked for.’’ 
A teacher should not be allowed to learn to teach at the expense of the children.—Superin- 
tendent Preston, of Mississippi: ‘‘If a man should undertake to operate a machine shop 
with hands gathered in from the cotton fields, his speedy failure would teach him a 
pointed lesson of experience, viz, that he should haveselected skilled workmen. Can 
we, then, expect to operate the complex machinery of a school system without providing 
a reliable and strict test of the capacity of those artisans who are to labor in our great 
intellectual workshop? 
“In the expenditure of large means in any important enterprise, the worst and un- 
wisest economy is that which fails to provide the necessary agencies and appliances to 
utilize all the forces which contribute to successful results. Yet the State had ignored 
that ‘a poor teacher is worse than no teacher,’ a maxim which is embedded in the very 
heart of all educational philosophy, and which has been demonstrated by the experi- 
ments of all States that have developed a system of public instruction. 
“No person should be permitted to teach in a public school without a valid license is- 
sued by an agent of the State, after a careful test examination. A teacher should not be 
allowed to learn to teach at the expense of the children, robbing them of their time and 
opportunities by his futile experiments and fatal blunders.”’ 
XIX.—TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. 
Present status of temperance instruction.—In the autumn of 1887 the following inquiry 
was addressed to State superintendents: ‘‘Is the study of physiology and hygiene with 
special reference to the effects of stimulants and narcotics required by law, and in what 
grades?’ The following replies were received up to the time of going to press, the re- 
marks within parentheses being added by the Bureau:

Summary.—From the above replies it will be seen that instruction in physiology and 
hygiene with special reference to the effects of stimulants and narcotics is made compul- 
sory by statute in some part of their school life on all pupils in 24 out of the 38 States, 
viz: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New 
York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, South Carolina, Florida, 
Alabama, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Nevada, 
Oregon, and California; reference has been made to the statute whenever it could be 
found by the Bureau. The same compulsion exists in all the Territories and in the 
District of Columbia by United States statute. In Missouri the instruction under con- 
sideration is compulsory upon the demand of‘patrons of the publicschools and forbidden 
otherwise.     
Reports of Pennsylvania county superintendents on the operation of the new law.— 
Adams County: ‘‘The study of physiology and hygiene met with considerable opposi- 
tion in certain quarters, but it was owing mainly to a misapprehension of the intent 
and purpose of the law, and a want of proper judgment on the part of teachers and direct- 
ors in introducing it in the schools. The people everywhere entertain a commendable 
respect for law and authority, yet they are apt to chafe under supposed arbitrary exer- 
cise of power. Upon the whole the results of this new branch of study have thus far 
been most satisfactory.” 
Carbon County; ‘‘ Little or no trouble has been caused by the introduction of physi-, 
ology and hygiene into the:schools, and the teaching of the branch has been fully equal 
to that of the teaching of any of the other branches.’’ 
Clarion County: ‘‘ Physiology and hygiene has been taught in all the schools. The 
new study met with some opposition in places, but is rapidly gaining a foothold in the 
public schools of this county. Teachers are learning how to teach it better, and par- 
ents are becoming better satisfied with the results.” 
Clinton County: ‘‘The new branch of’ physiology and hygiene met with considerable 
opposition the past year.” 
Dauphin County: ‘‘The new law requiring physiology and hygiene to be taught has 
been obeyed in all the districts of the county. Text-books were not used by all the 
pupils, but suitable oral instruction was given in the subject where pupils were not com- 
petent to use the book. Iam of the opinion that in some cases text-books were used 
when oral instruction would have accomplished better results.’ - 
Monroe County: ‘‘About the only drawback experienced was in the introduction of 
the new branch of study—physiology and hygiene. It was not very favorably received 
by the people, and a great many parents refused to supply their chiidren with books, so 
that it became necessary, in such cases to teach it by the oral method. In fact this 
was the only way in which it could be taught to quite young pupils who had not yet 
learned to read, or to those who had been in school but a year or two. Such, I take it, 
is not the letter, nor indeed the spirit, of the law, but it is the best that can be done 
and it is the best that ought to be attempted.” 
Potter County: ‘‘That physiology sball be studied seems now to have become an ac- 
cepted fact, and with a few slight exceptions our teachers report no opposition in carry- 
ing out the law.”’ 
Susquehanna County: ‘‘Physiology and hygiene is growing in popularity with both 
schools and people. It is impossible, however, to act up to the letter of the law in 
some localities; the general use of the branch by oral exercises being the only under- 
taking practicable.’’ 
Wayne County: “Physiology and hygiene was taught in all the schools, with varied 
success. We believe much good will follow the study of this branch.” 
Recommended in Minneota.—Superintendent Kiehle: ‘‘In view of the alarming spread. 
of intemperance and the devastation it is working in the State and in the home, in the 
bodies and in the minds of men, fostering all vice and destructive of all thrift and 
virtue, in addition to the restraints imposed by law, the youth should be instructed 
in the natural and necessary effects of stimulants and narcotics. I recommend that a 
law be enacted requiring the teachers of youth to include in their instruction in hygiene 
careful teaching in the nature of narcotics and stimulants, and the evil effects of their 
‘use.’?   
1 Though the matter does not chronologically come within the scope of the present Report, it may 
be remarked that the General Assembly of Ohio enacted a law April 11, 1888, requiring “the nature 
ofalcoholic drinks and narcotics, and their effects on the human system, in connection with the sub- 
jects of physiology and hygiene,” to be “included in the branches to be regularly taught in the 
common schools” of the State, Oral instruction is to be considered sufficient compliance. 
      
   
-P-A-G-E-217
TEMPERANCE INSTRUCTION. : tao: 
  Over-teaching is perilous. Superintendent Nelson, of Michigan: ‘In my opinion, it is 
the design of the law to give to this class of studies the same statis it gives to other prac- 
tical topics, such as reading or grammar, i. e., that somewhere in his course, the pupil 
shall be taught the physiological and moral effects of narcotics and alcoholic stimulants 
upon the whole being of man. To my mind, this is quite enough. . Less would be in- 
sufficient; more would be unnecessary, and possibly harmfal. It is to be regretted that 
in any public school the full requirements of the law should suffer neglect; yet, it would 
be & mistake quite as serious, to give to these special studies a disproportionate, unequal 
place in the school curriculum—to co-ordinate them, as some extremists insist upon do- 
ing, with every other subject from the low zones of a, b, ¢, up to the high regions of 
calculus. Over-teacging upon a subject which relates to moral conduct, especially if it 
ns the appetites or passions, is really perilous. Too constant dwelling upon topics 
is character has a tendency to invoke morbid conditions in the mind of the youth 
which either provokes or fascinates him to attempt dangerous experiments. Were you to 
teach a boy the flagrant wickedness of burglary it would not be expedient, nor would it 
be necessary, to induct him into the mysteries of picking a lock. The specialist finds a 
peculiar charm in the ugly spider—he sees a thousand beauties in the bright colors and 
sinister eyes of a loathsome snake. We may well fear the consequences of making our 
boys and girls too familiar with nauseating details of any evil-which we desire them to 
shun. The teacher or parent cannot be too earnest to enjoin correct principles, to give 
warning of penalties, and to himself exhibit a blameless example ; which having done, 
he can effectively add nothing further, except to devoutly leave the result with God.” 
      In Kansas.—Superintendent Lawhead remarks: ‘‘A vigorous mind inhabiting a 
healthy body can do more for the State than the same mind can in a body that is weak 
and diseased ; and as the public school is sustained at public expense upon the theory 
that the permanency of the State depends upon the intelligence of its citizens, the State 
claims the right to have those branches taught in her schools that will best secure these 
results. Now a thorough knowledge of the human system is essential to its preserva- 
tion and highest development, which can only be secured by a study of its physiology 
and hygiene, and the effects of such substances as may be deleterious to its growth and 
the healthy exercise of its various functions; and it has been decided by the best medi- 
cal authority, as well as by universal observation of mankind, that both alcoholic stimu- 
Jants and narcotics exert a baneful and destructive influence, not only upon the body 
and its various functions, but it likewise destroys the intellect and deadens the moral 
sensibilities. In view of all these results, we, as school officers and good citizens, should 
unite to make the teaching of the effects of alcoholic stimulants and narcotics upon the 
human system a success. We should supply our teachers with all the necessary appli- 
ances to secure the best results, and furnish our schools with the best maps, charts, and 
books, to enable the teacher to perform his part in this great work. I am pleased to note 
that teachers throughout the State have, in most instances, taken hold of this subject 
with an earnestness that is full of promise for good results.’’ 
Action to seeure proper text-book ‘Report (1887) of Iowa State Board of Health: ‘‘ The 
law enacted by the Twenty-first General Assembly requiring physiology and hygiene to 
be taught in the public schools, with special reference to the effect of alcoholic drinks, 
stimulants, and narcotics upon the human system, was astep in the right direction toward 
the preservation of public health. Experience, since the passage of the law, has shown 
an important omission therein. No provision is made to protect the public “against the 
mercenary wiles of unscrupulous book-makers and the propagation of error. 
“Books on physiology and hygiene generally need no approval nor censorship, but when 
the law requires that they shall treat upon the effect of alcohol and narcotics upon the 
human system, it becomes important that the subjects shall be given truthfully. Itcan 
be readily seen that unless the approval of some reliable board or censorship be secured, 
a class of books might be introduced in the public schools, atleast in somesections, most 
pernicious and erroneous in their teachings. 
“Tn view of the apparent importance of this matter the State board, at its May meeting 
in 1886, unanimously adopted the following resolution: 
“Resolved, That a committee of three be appointed by the president to examine the 
various publications on physiology now in use in the public schools in Iowa under the 
provisions of Chapter 1, Acts of the Twenty-first General Assembly, and such other 
publications as they may deem proper with a view to recommend to the next General 
Assembly the adoption of a series on said subject best calculated to furnish correct knowl- 
edge upon the subjects required to be taught by said chapter, and to report at the next 
regular meeting of this board, with such recommendations as they shall deem proper. 
“It is not the purpose of the State board to select or recommend any particular publica- 
    tions, but to secure such supervision as will prevent the introduction into the schools of 
erroneous ideas.’

‘218 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
May be made interesting and profitable —W. W. Hyde, acting visitor of Hartford, Conn. : 
“While there seems to be good ground for regretting that this study is to be forced into 
our schools, and also good reason to doubt whether it will be of any advantage in the 
direction hoped for by its promoters, yet if we are to teach it at all, it must be in a sys- 
tematic and thorough way. The whole subject can easily be made ridiculous, and of 
no value; but we hope by the exercise of care to make this study, like all others, inter- 
esting and profitable to the pupils.’ 
For other information coming under this head consult the Index. 
XX.—TExt-Books. 
  An argument for State uniformity.—Superintendent Baker, of Texas: ‘I again most 
earnestly recommend that provision be made for uniformity in school books. I fear that 
gentlemen of the Legislature have not heretofore realized the enormous expense attend- 
ing the present mode of selecting books. Whatever interested parties may say as to the 
merits and demerits of the various publications, the best educators know that all school 
books now in use are nearly of equal merit, and that it is a matter of small importance 
which a child may use, It is rather a question of expense than one of the merits of the 
various books. My views, expressed in other reports upon this subject, have undergone no 
change. The years that have passed have strengthened me in the belief that the demand 
‘for uniformity is imperative. The sum annually expended for school books can not fail 
short of half a million dollars. Not only do the frequent and unnecessary changes in 
books help to make up this large sum, but the prices demanded for the books are unreas- 
onable and extortionate.. These prices are a grievous burden to the poor parent, and 
instances are not wanting in-which they have effectually barred the door of the school- 
house against the poor: I admit that other States have failed in efforts to remedy this 
evil, but I believe that the failures can be safely attributed to a want of nerve and per- 
severance. The State has assumed the power to maintain public schools, and the right 
to manage and make rules for their government follows. Itis said that the right of the 
parent to select the books his child shall study should not be taken away; that popular 
prejudice is against the proposition. The universal demand for uniformity shows that 
the argument is without foundation. Besides, it is a well known fact that it is not the 
parent, but the teacher, who selects the books. Other benefits would also arise from 
uniformity. The superintendent of public instruction, knowing ‘the books that would 
be in use in a certain county, would be able to prescribe a course of study for the schools 
of that county, and thus practically grade the country schools. As the matter now 
stands, with all sorts of books in every school, he can not do so; the result being that 
the cities with graded schools march smoothly on, while the rural schools seamper hither 
and thither without object or aim.” 
Superintendent Harvey, of Chester County, Pa.: ‘‘ While district uniformity is entirely 
proper, I have no faith whatever in State or county uniformity.” 
Uniformity desired in Arkansas. Superintendent Thompson writes: ‘‘The importance 
of this subject demands the earnest, thoughtful consideration of every friend of economy 
and progress in our public schools. All admit that text-books have ever been a source 
of annoyance to parent and teacher. Parents complaining because they are called on 
to buy some new book when they think their children have old ones that are as good, if 
not better, than the new ones. ‘Teachers complaining and discouraged because the chil- 
dren have no books, or, if they have, some are old and almost worn out and worthless, 
and others have an entirely different one. This want of uniformity in books, necessi- 
tates the forming of too many classes. The teacher knows at the time, he can not be 
successful in his work, when his time is so completely occupied with giving only a few 
minutes to each class. If these pupils had the same book, the classes could be consoli- 
dated, and more time given to each recitation. ‘Che complaint made by parents is rea- 
sonable, since there is no doubt that too many books are asked for by teachers—too 
many changes are required.’’ 
State uniformity in Indiana.—Superintendent Holcombe, of Indiana: ‘Several expe- 
dients for securing uniform text-books at the cheapest rates have been tried in other 
States. One of these is the State list, the books to be used in all the schools being pre- 
_ scribed by a central board or committee. This plan was tried for ten years in Indiana, 
but was never successful. The selections of the State board were generally disregarded 
in the more progressive schools, and the provision of the law requiring such selection 
was repealed in 1865. 
‘Another plan is the State contract system, by which the State controls the manufact- 
ure, distribution, and sale of books. The merits claimed for it are that perfect uni- 
formity in books is secured throughout the entire State, and that books are supplied to
-P-A-G-E-219
‘TEXT-BOOKS. 219 
the pupils at manufacturers’ wholesale rates. Experience and opinion, however, seem 
adverse to both these plans.” 
Township uniformity desired—Experience of East Saginaw with free text-books.—Superin- 
tendent Nelson, of Michigan: ‘‘ The adoption of the township system will, in my opini 
open a new way for the speedy adjustment of the difficulties arising out of the div. 
and expense of text-books. There can be no question that the variety of the text-books 
in use in our public schools is one of the most fruitful sources of dissatisfaction to the 
patrons of the schools and a very serious obstacle to securing the best results in school 
work. This is especially apparent in our ungraded district schools, where frequently 
the number of text-books on some one subject will equal the number of children enrolled 
in the school. The disadvantages of such a div: y are too apparent to need any argu- 
ment. How best to secure some degree of uniformity and at the same time reduce the 
cost of the text-books to a minimum is a question of great importance to the educational 
interests of the State. 
“After thoughtful consideration of the various plans and expedients suggested I am 
convinced that the solution of the problem lies in tue consolidation of the school districts 
of each township and placing all the schools under the control of a township board of 
education and having a uniform series of text-books for the township, all such books to 
be purchased by.the township district and loaned to the pupils under such regulations 
as the board of education may prescribe.. The advantages that would naturally follow 
making the township the unit in school matters are referred to elsewhere in this report. 
The best argument in favor of free text-books will be found in the universal approval 
that this plan has received in localities where it has been tried. 
# * * x * * * 
“East Saginaw is the only city in this State where the pupils of the public schools are 
- furnished text-booksand stationery. By special act of the Legislature of 1885, the board. 
of education was given authority to purchase text-books and all the necessary supplies 
for all scholars attending the public schools. The plan has therefore been in operation 
less thantwo years. That it has proved satisfactory is shown by the following statement 
from Mr. C. B. Thomas, city superintendent : 
“<The free text-book plan was adopted here in June, 1885. It has therefore been in 
operation about a year.and a half. In this time we have pretty nearly completed our 
plant—i. e., bought a stock of books, slate and lead pencils, pens and pen-holders, 
writing and drawing books, paper and pads, etc., etc., for two years. : : 
‘**Our total expense for the stock is about $7,000; about $4,500 last year, and $2,580 
thus far this year. Suppose we call it in round numbers for the two years $8,000. 
“*Our school enrolment is or will be 4,500. The figures then stand thus     
    
Amount invested in books, ete 
Number of pupils supplied Cost per pupil... 
““*Our books after two years’ service will be in excellent condition. Even the first 
readers, in the hands of little children six years of age, after a full year’s service, are 
sound, not much soiled, and good for a year or two more of similar careful usage. 
* “The advantages of the system may be summed up about as follows: 
“<4. A gain of from 25 per cent. to 40 per cent. on first cost. 
‘<¢9. A gain of at least 33 per cent. in the time the book will be usable. 
‘**3. I think, taking the last two items together, we make a gain of not far from 50 
per cent. in cost to community. 
‘**4, Classes are uniformly supplied, both as to time and material. 
“**5. No distinction between rich and poor. 
“*6, Tam quite confident that about $0.50 per scholar will keep the stock good, the children always furnished. 
“7. To insure care, we fine children who needlessly or maliciously injure books in their hands.’ 
“T would suggest that the law be amended so as to empower any district to authorize the purchasing of text-books for use in the schools of the district and am satisfied that pareve tried it will result in an increased attendance, better instruction, and cheaper jooks. 
_ Enforeed uniformity in every school of a county.—Superintendent Preston, of Missis~ sippi: ‘‘A law without a penalty is a mere exhortation and may induce the timid to comply; but it has no power to loosen the parental yrip on a dime which is asked for by the child who wants a new first reader—especially when there is on hand an old one which has served the father and possibly one or two of the older children. Sothe child goes 
to school and is ready to be classed with ten others who have books alike. The teacher 
tnust devote an undue proportion of time to this one pupil, or neglect him altogether, I cite this as a simple illustration of what exists in nearly every school in the State    
   
-P-A-G-E-220
    220 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
Every teacher has encountered this obstacle to successful work, and has been powerless | 
to removeit. If we determine to touch this subject by legislation, and I think no oné 
will question the propriety and necessity of doing so, we should pass a law with a penalty, 
and have enforced uniformity in every school of a county, except those of separate school 
districts. These should conform as nearly as possible tothe county adoption; but from 
the nature of their organization they should be allowed to select books suited to their 
particular wants.’’ 
A strong argument for free text-books. Superintendent Strayer, of Cambria County, Pa.: 
“The want of uniformity in text-books prevents classification in a few districts. Con- 
stant change of teachers and pupils from different districts hinders classification. Here 
is a strong argument for free text-books. Is it right that teachers and pupils should be 
required to purchase books when a change of school or residence is made? The same 
principle that makes tuition free should make every department of our common school 
system free. The plan is in sticcessful operation in the most progressive boroughs 
and districts in the county, and a few more years will doubtless witness a general adop- 
tion of free books and school supplies throughout the county and State.” 
The law should be mandatory.—Superintendent McNeal, of Dauphin County, Pa.: ‘‘Two 
districts, Conewago and Lower Swatara, have for several years furnished free text- hooks. 
Since the Legislature affirmed the power of school boards to do this, several other dis- 
tricts are gradually adopting the plan by furnishing the books in one or more branch 
each year. 
“Tn our opinion the Jaw should have been mandatory instead of permissive, and it is 
a matter of only a few years until it will be so amended. 
“The policy has been thoroughly tested in the districts named, and the people are 
fally convinced of its wisdom as a measure of economy. It has been proven that the 
average annual cost to each taxable in furnishing all the books used in the schools is 
less than thirty-three cents. While this is the most forcible argument in favor of free 
books that can be used with the tax-payers, those engaged in school work know that 
the plan has many more advantages. It is the only practical question pertaining to 
school text-books. With free books, county and State uniformity is neither necessary 
nor desirable.”’ 
In Colorado.—Superintendent Cornell says: ‘‘ There is a strong and growing senti- 
ment in this State in favor of school districts purchasing and owning the text-books. 
The frequent changes that our people make from one locality to another has caused the 
purchase of text-books to become a burden.”’ 
Give unqualified satisfaction in Minnesota.—Superintendent Kiehle: ‘‘The provision for 
text-books is usually borne by the pupils or their parents. 
“Tn the aggregate, the cost of books is not great when compared with the cost of in- 
struction, but to the individual it may be so heavy a burden that, when, to the cost of 
maintaining children, the cost of school books is added, it becomes a serious obstacle to 
prevent them from availing themselves of what is otherwise a free school. 
‘For this and other reasons, the plan has heen adopted in many cities and in several 
\ States, permitting the districts or townships to supply free text-books to all the children. 
The districts that have made thorough trial of this plan report their unqualified satis- 
faction. 
* * * * % * * 
“Tn view of the advantages to our education in increasing attendance, in cheapening 
the price of books, in improving the instruction and grading by a full and prompt sup- 
ply of text-books, all well attested by abundant testimony, I recommend the enactment 
of a law authorizing school districts to make purchase of such text-books and supplies 
as are necessary for the instruction of their pupils.”” 
How the text-book question will be solved.—Superintendent Raab, of Illinois: ‘* Various 
are the devices which have been proposed for the purpose of supplying cheap or free text- 
books to the pupils in our public schools, and every session of our legislature witnesses 
a number of bills for accomplishing this end. No doubt the text-book question may be 
a ‘burning one’ in some localities, but the remedy is to be sought in a different way 
than by legislation. Our text-book makers attempt too much; they want to make books, 
which, while they are manuals for the teacher, are also books for the children to study. 
These two ohjects can not very well be accomplished in one work. The teacher must 
know a great deal more than the pupil upon any subject to be taught, hence the book 
‘is unsatisfactory to him; and the book for the pupil need not contain what is intended. 
for the teacher, hence the pupil has to pay much more for his book than is just and 
reasonable. * * * Qurauthorsshould endeavor (1) to putno more into school books 
than is necessary for the pupils, and (2) should keep the matter for pupils and teachers 
separate, %, ¢,, publish special manuals for the teacher. But this will not be the practice

TEXT-BOOKS. 201" 
as long as teachers are not prepared properly for their work before they hegin to teach, 
and are not so trained that they can teach without the book constantly. belore their eyes. 
All defects in the results may be traced, directly or indirectly, to that one defect men- 
tioned above—the lack of properly prepared teachers. 
“Among the various plans for obviating a frequent change of text-books, the one of 
furnishing the books to the children at the expense of the district seems the most feasible 
and reasonable. It has been tried in the Boston schools with excellent results, and any 
one desirous of informing himself on the subject may read the Boston School Report. I 
do not consider the question of sufficient importance to make any suggestions further than 
what Ihavesaidabove. In fact this question, like so many others, will be solved by pro- 
visions for the better qualification of teachers and in no other way.”’ 
High school attendance increased through free text-books.—The committee on accounts of 
the Boston school committee report as follows: ‘‘ The free text-book act has undoubtedly 
been a large factor in jilling up our high schools and the upper classes of the.grammar 
schools, on account of the expense saved to parents by relieving them from the purchase 
of text-books, which, in these grades, requires quite a large sum. 
“This iftcrease in the upper grades not only adds to the cost to the city for books, 
which is a minor expense, bit adds considerably to the cost for instruction, as the teach- 
ers thus employed generally receive the larger salaries. 
“Two of the advantages thus far developed by the use of free text-books, are, first, 
avoiding delay in getting the schools into working order, and, second, in prolonging the 
school life of children.’’ 
Progress made in the introduction of free text-books. —Notwithstanding the almost absolute 
unanimity of the testimony in favor of the free text-book system wherever it has been 
tried, it has been adopted as yet only to a very limited extent. It is surely making its 
way, however, and as it appears to he one of those reforms that never move backward, 
its general adoption can only be a matter of time. 
The following table gives a brief summary of the extent to which the free text-book 
system has been introduced into ‘the different States and Territories, as reported to

PROGRESS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN CITIES. 
A review of the work accomplished by the organized systems of schools in our cities 
during the period covered by this Report, must afford real cause for gratification. That 
substantial progress and permanent improvement have been made is apparent. More 
effective organization, better buildings, the employment of larger numbers of trained 
and experienced teachers, more rational methods of instruction, greater enrolment and 
more regular attendance on the part of the pupils, are among the phrases which occur 
most frequently in the reports forwarded to this Office. Nor do these encouraging re- 
ports come from a single State or section. New England continues to manifest the zeal 
in the common schools that has so long distinguished that section, but the reports for 
the year indicate that in the interest shown by the people and in the manner in which 
they sustain the schools, New England maintains but scant supremacy over other sec- 
tions. In the newer cities of the West, and in the impoverished States of the South, 
where there was perhaps the greatest need for improvement, have appeared signs of 
marked progress and commendable interest in school affairs. The increased number of 
Southern cities represented in the statistical tables, and the number of new systems 
mentioned in the verbal summaries, possess a significance that can not be mistaken. 
The popular appreciation of the schools can not be better illustrated than by the diffi- © 
culty everywhere felt in providing new accommodations as fast as they are needed by the 
constantly growing schools. The cities in which the number of sittings is sufficient for 
all the requirements of the schools are rare; yet the cities that do not greatly extend 
their school facilities every year are much more so. 
In the pages immediately following may be found the opinions of experienced edu- 
cators upon many questions relating primarily to education in cities that have attracted 
the attention of the school world, with brief descriptions of the status of various im- 
provements suggested or undertaken. é 
SALARIES OF PRIMARY TEACHERS. 
‘“The impression has been somewhat prevalent in the past, that the candidate for the 
teacher’s vocation who has not the experience or attainments requisite for a position in 
grammar school grades, can be tried in the primary schools. This impression is de- 
eidedly wrong. The person who has not the literary attainments sufficient fora gram- 
. mar school, is not qualified to occupy the teacher’s desk of a school of any grade; and 
223 
 
-P-A-G-E-224
        224 i EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
certainly no position demands special preparation, peculiar tact, and the ability and fit- 
ness which come from successful experience, more than that of the primary teacher. 
“The trite saying, ‘the teacher makes the school’ is so readily understood that its 
truth needs no special argument to prove it. But its* truth applies nowhere with so 
much force as in the primary grades. The primary teacher, more than any other, must 
draw from her own resources to awaken and keep alive an interest in the minds of the 
children who are yet incapable of prolonged study from the exe Pooks: and have not 
acquired the power of independent, patient investigation, 
“The fact also has come to be recognized that our primary schools are really the 
foundation of our educational structure. In them are commenced the formation of thage 
habits which, gaining strength during the various stages of intellectual, moral, and 
physical growth, influence thought and action during the whole course of subsequent 
school training. Nor is this all. As ‘first impressions are the most iasting,’ so the 
habits thus early formed will not only affect the entire course of training to be acquired 
in the schools, but also will characterize, in a large measure, the person of mature years. 
‘Phe impression to which I have referred gave rise to the practice—which still pre- 
vails in connection with your schools—of grading the salaries according to consecutive 
stages in the classification of the schools, assigning the minimum salary to the teachers 
in the primary grades. This practice has the tendency on the one hand, to cause the 
work in primary schools to be regarded as an inferior order of service, from which the 
teachers gain promotion when they succeed in obtaining a transfer ‘to the grammar 
grades. On the other hand, its influence is to discourage the competent and faithful 
whose increased and superior ability and skill in their chosen line of work, have been 
shown by the sure test of experience; or else, perhaps, its effect is to lead them to ac- 
cept similar positions in other localities where better remuneration is given for the 
effective work which they have become able to accomplish. 
“The principle of grading the salaries with reference to qualifications and experience 
is right; but when the promotions to higher grades of salary are on the ground of suc- 
cessful experience they should be made for the double purpose of encouraging the teach- 
ers to aim at progressive efficiency, and of inducing those who have achieved a success 
to continue their service in our schools, in the very kind of work in which they have be- 
come adepts. A gradation of salaries on this principle need not involve great additional 
expense ; because, while the salaries for the experienced primary teachers would be con- 
siderably larger than now paid, those for the inexperienced would be less.’ » [From the 
report of Superintendent W. W. Waterman, Clinton, Mass. ] 
The force of arguments similar to those set forth above is generally recognized, and 
several cities have already recast their scheme of salaries in accordance with the plan 
which Mr. Waterman recommends for adoptionin Clinton. Theschool directors of Port- 
land, Oregon, say: ‘‘Our experience has demonstrated that we are obliged to pay our 
eighth or primary grade teachers a higher salary than some of the more advanced grades. 
The reason of this is obvious; it requires greater experience to handle and properly 
teach children of six years than to teach those a little older.’’ 
At Chelsea, Mass.: ‘‘The scale of salaries received a new adjustment and adoption by 
the board to take effect in September (at the beginning of the school year), by which 
the majority of assistant teachers now receive an increase of $50 per annum. Instead 
of maintaining longer a distinction in the salaries paid in the higher grades, it was 
thought that the duties and responsibilities of all were equal, and should receive like 
compensation, the high school and special teachers excepted.’’ 
In summing up the recent improvements made in the Philadelphia schools, the presi- 
dent of the board of education uses these words: ‘‘ The compensation of teachers was so 
modified as to lessen the distinction formerly existing among the assistants, caused by 
* the wide differences in their salaries. The tendency has been towards ati equalization of 
salary; and therefore in the direction of equal rank and honor. The plan of increasing 
the salary upon the basis of the term of service has become thoroughly established, and 
has yielded many excellent results.’’ 
A difference yet remains, however, in the salaries of the teachers between the lower 
grades and those in the higher. President Steel further says: ‘‘I trust that at the 
earliest opportunity this discrimination against primary and secondary teachers may 
be removed. The board will pardon me for reiterating my conviction that it is the 
duty of this board to equalize the compensation of assistants in every department of 
the schools. We shall never be able to get the kind of service that is needed in the 
lower schools until the salaries are made the same as those in the higher. Noone can 
‘blame capable and ambitious teachers, employed in primary and secondary schools, 
for seeking promotion to the grammar schools. The higher salary paid in the latter is 
the just reward for the better service which they are able to render; and the constant 
drain upon the primary schools must go on until a position in them is made equal in 
rank and salary to one in the higher department. I believe that culture, training, and 
experience are needed quite as much in the primary as in the grammar school; but    
 
-P-A-G-E-225
WOMEN AS PRINCIPALS—SCHOOL SAVINGS-BANKS. 225 
_we shall fail to secure these qualities in the latter until the pay is made the same as 
in the former. Make the salaries of all grades of teachers alike; and teachers will 
_then seek employment where they feel they can do the best and most satisfactory work, 
regardless of other considerations. The rules of this board require the same ac- 
quirements for primary teachers as for grammar school teachers. Taken all in all, 
no one can fairly say that the work required differs essentially as to difficulty or 
amount in any of the departments; and there isno just reason why the position of a 
teacher in a primary school should not be equal in honor and profit to that in any other 
department of the public school system. No duty of the board seems to. me more im- 
perative than this, and I trust that some action upon this important matter may be taken 
at an early day.” 
WoMEN AS PRINCIPALS. 
In August, 1886, the board of education of Columbus, Ohio, resolved that thereafter in 
-ease of a vacancy inthe principalship of a building of twelve or more rooms, a man ‘be 
employed. Since women had previously filled these positions, this action was an inno- 
vation of considerable importance, and provoked a great deal of discussion, Three such 
vacancies have occurred since the passage of the resolution, and in accordance with the 
determinativun of the board, men have been selected to fill them. 
For a number of years only lady teachers have been employed in the schools of Macon, 
Ga. The superintendent says: ‘‘Five years of close observation and a careful compari- 
son, as opportunity offered, of the work done by these ladies with that done in similar 
grades of public schools in other cities, have not made me feel that in the matter of 
instruction our pupils lost anything by the substitution of ladies for men in the highest 
grade of our grammar schools. * * * But in the general administration of these 
schools the directing hand and the personal presence of a man are also absolutely neces- 
sary.’? He therefore asks for ‘‘the appointment of a man whose duty it shall be to 
supervise these schools and make himself felt in every room and class.’’ 
Mr. Alvin F. Pease, superintendent of the Pawtucket, R. I., schools, believes in the 
superiority of male principals, for these reasons: 
‘“They have usually more executive ability than women. They have a larger, ace 
quaintaneg with practical business and a better knowledge of ‘the world.’ * 
Besides, if usually: occurs that boys of 13 to 15 years of age need the strong ianebes 
and restraining power of a man; and where that influence is felt, the occasion for special 
discipline is largely removed. In some of our best grammar schools it frequently hap- 
pens that there is no necessity for the infliction of punishment for weeks or even terms 
ata time; and the same influence over the larger pupils extends to the other rooms of 
the building, so that a majority of the cases of insubordination and serious difficulty 
occur in smaller buildings where there is no male principal.’’ 
  ScHoon SAVINGS-BANKS. 
- ‘The importance of teaching children to save, not so much for the amounts hoarded 
as for the educational value of the weekly lesson, has for many years been recognized 
with more or less earnestness by the managers of charitable and mission schools. In most 
of our cities various simple and practical methods have been used, in connection with vol- 
untary school work to help the waifs of our population to acquire habits of thrift; 
put it is a rather curious fact that the first public school (Third Ward Grammar Schooi 
of Long Island City, N. Y.) in the United States to adopt as part of its weekly drill the 
savings-bank plan only did so in 1885, and that during 1886 but six other publicschools . 
followed suit. Now, however, many school boards are moving in that direction, and 
there seems no reason to doubt that during this year more than one hundred schools 
will have introduced the plan into their curriculum. 
“Such an absolutely new departure in the education of American children must in- 
terest all mothers, and it behooves them clearly to understand what school banks are, 
the drift of their teaching, and its effect on character. 
“Fortunately school banks are no experiment, although a novel addition to the public 
school system of the United States; therefore those who advocate their general adoption 
in this country can support the demand by pointing to the experience of a great nation, 
France. The economic training of the French people was proved to the admiration of 
the civilized world in 1870, after the Franco-Prussian War, when the war indemnity was 
subscribed several times over, mainly by the bourgeoisie and peasantry, and this stu- 
pendous act of patriotic thrift, M. Gambetta said, was largely due to the industrious 
and saving character of the French women; therefore any national teaching in economy 
adopted by France must claim our serious investigation. 
“Until this year no special book or treatise on school savings-banks was published in 
English, and except in government reports little information was available in any 
15 ED

    226 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
Janguage; but Miss Agnes Lambert, of London, has just published a small School Bank 
Manual, and Mr. J. H. Thiry, of Long Island City, has issued a History of the Penny 
School Savings-Banks of the Public Schools of Long Island City, N. Y. Timely as such 
directions are for educators and school boards, reports and pamphlets do not tempt the 
general reader, who is almost always a busy, often tired, man or woman; so we propose 
for the benefit of all those interested in children, to state briefly what school banks are, 
and why they are yaluable helps to national education. 
“The modus operandi of a school bank is as follows: Having arranged with some sav- 
ings-bank to receive deposits, the principal of a school gives notice to the several classes 
that every Monday morning their teacher when calling the roll, will receive their small, 
savings (from 1 cent up to'50 cents). On making the first deposit, a pupilis given a card 
with his or her name, date, and amount deposited, receipted by the teacher; this card 
the pupil keeps, presenting it every time a deposit is made, the card having dates for 
the whole school year. 
‘A fter the first few collections, when, like any other new drill, children are awkward, 
‘fifteen minutes is sufficient to receive the savings of a class of 50,’ The teacher ap- 
points some bright pupil ‘collector,’ who takes the card and money from each child and 
hands it to the teacher, who counts the money, receipts the card, and returns it to the 
scholar. The ordinary roll-book serves asarecord book. For instance, a name is called— 
«Jane Smith.’ She makes answer, ‘ Three cents,’ and three cents is entered in the sav- 
ings column opposite Jane Smith’s name. If nothing has been saved, a cross so indi- 
eates, and merely ‘attenda nce’ is marked. The principal, who is the de facto treasurer, 
requires a special book for names of depositors and amounts saved, as the savings of all 
classes are handed to him, and he sends them each day to the savings-bank, getting a 
receipt for the whole amount. When a pupil has saved 25 cents (or any other sum 
agreed on) he is given a bank-book, and becomes a regular contributor—although inter- 
est is rarely paid on very small sums—and until he receives a book his name does.not 
go on the journal of the savings-bank, but his savings are kept to the credit of the prin- 
cipal in what is called a ‘general fund.’ These pupil bank-books, kept by the princi- 
pal, are sent to the bank monthly to be balanced. They can be taken home at regular 
dates to be shown to parents; and during vacation, or when a pupil leaves, he receives 
his book. Money can bedrawn out at any time with the consent of parents or guardians, 
by procuring the principal’s signature. After leaving school permanently a S¢holar can 
still continue to use the school bank-book for other savings. 
“This simple plan, insuccessful operation in several American schools, differs slightly 
in some of its details from that used in Europe; but it has been carefully worked out to 
suit our own school system, can be modified by any intelligent set of teachers or school 
directors to meet local views and needs, and fulfils the essential requisite of a school 
bank—that it should form part of the school course: 
“On January 1, 1887, 7 schools in the United States had ‘adopted’ school savings- 
banks, 6 of these being in or near Long Island City, and 1 in McCook, Nebr. What had 
they added to their curriculum? Strictly an object lesson in thrift, industry, self-denial— 
a practical lesson which, without pushing any theoretical instruction out of its way, can 
do more to undermine the dangerous communistic spirit of the age than any amount of 
mere book learning. 
‘4 woman is principal of the first American school with a school bank, and out of 
450 scholars 403 are depositors, having saved from March, 1885, to January, 1887, 
$2,382; of this amount $602 was withdrawn for use, and $1,780 remained ‘due depos- 
itors,’ an average of $4.16 per child. 
“Before passing to our second point—the educational value of school banks—a few 
facts in connection with their encouragement and growth in Europe may meet and an- 
swer in advance objections which will occur to many to whom the question of juvenile 
thrift is new and objectionable. 
“France, the only country with a national system of school banks, between 1874 and 
1886 established 24,000 of these banks, with nearly half a million of depositors, whose 
savings aggregated a trifle less than 12,000,000 francs, or about $2,400,000, 
“Spurred by this marvelous example, the educators of other nations turned their at- 
tention to school banks. Italy has 3,456, Hungary 700, and various Belgian cities have 
adopted them with success. Great Britain, with 19,000 elementary schools, teaching 
4,000,000 children, has only 2,000 school banks, but their unprecedented success in 
towns like Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester shows that where school boards 
and teachers understand the matter their growth is certain. In 1885 the Board schools 
of Liverpool had 74 banks, numbering 10,000 depositors, who that year deposited $20,- 
000, drew out $15,000, and left $5,000 in the Liverpool Savings-Bank. In that same 
year English educators showed their estimate of school banks in a circular for instruc- 
tion of the Education Department, addressed to school inspectors, where it was ex- 
pressly stated that where circumstances permit, a school must have a savings-bank if 
. it desires the aid granted to schools that are reported as ‘excellent.’

  2 PHYSICAL TRAINING. < 227 
“Tt has been well said that school banks are to the lesson in thrift what pen, ink, 
and paper are to the lesson in writing, and although much abuse has been heaped on . 
our over-education of the masses, few would seriously curtail the facility with which . 
every child born on American soil can learn to read and write. When. the equal value 
of the other lesson is understood, we will he no less reluctant to deprive our children, < 
the men and women who are to complete any good works begun by us, of instruction Sew 
in that high human office, economy, said by Emerson to be ‘a sacrament when its aim 
is grand.’”’ [Catherine Baldwin in Harper’s Bazar. ]- 
‘To this it may only be well to add the following, from the report of the superintend- 
ent of the Rutland, Vt., schools for 1886-87: “Phe savings-bank feature continues to 
operate satisfactorily, the total average deposit being about $75 per month. There =| 
are now 453 accounts among the scholars and an aggregate deposit of $1,323.26.” 
PHYSICAL TRAINING. 
This subject has not yet been accorded the attention it deserves. In a few instances 
gymnasiums have been provided for the students of high schools, but beyond the gen- 
eral calisthenic exercises that obtain in some localities, no provision has been made by 
any city for the systematic training of pupils of the elementary grades. An occasional 
recommendation or reference to the matter by some superindendent or school committee 
is the only evidence that the necessity of such training in the schools is felt. The fol- 
lowing extracts are taken from recent reports: 
‘*Too many principals and teachers mistake for physical culture the performance of 
a few dilatory movements once or twice aday. * * * Beyond all other things, at- 
tention should be paid: first, to the preservation of the functions, afterward to their j 
development; yet the unnatural focus, the cramped hand, folded arms, and contracted a 
chest are not hard to find, though they have no place in the economy of nature and cer- . 
tainly not in the school room. After these have been carefully remedied, it is time 
enough to think of training the eye, the hand, and the ear, to expand the chest, and ta 
strengthen the back muscles; but to attempt to undo in five minutes the harm that has 
been done in five hours is manifestly useless, Above all considerations develop a.sound - 
body, if possible, and then a sound mind, and ‘mens sana in corpore sano’ will be no i 
longer a mere formula.’’? [From the report of the superintendent of schools, New York . 
City. ] 
“Tn any system of education worthy of the name,, physical culture must be a promi- ’ 
nent factor. Muscle needs to be developed as well as brain. Indeed, mental power is, a 
to a great extent, dependent upon a robust physical development, ‘To cultivate one to 
the exclusion of the other is to disjoin things which the Creator never intended to he 
separated. * * * 
“Tt is too much to expect that our regular teachers, who have had no special instrue- 
tion in this subject, will be able to lay out and pursue a well arranged course of instruc- 
tion in physical culture for the children in their schools. It needs an expert, a special- X 
ist, one who has had a thorough drill in physical movements and who can direct the 
kind of exercises to which children should be subjected from the time they enter the 
primary school till they are graduated from the high school.’’ [Superintendent Wm. 
Connell, Fall River, Mass. ] 
“As the games are to the kindergarten course so ought calisthenics to be to the dis- 2 
trict school, namely, a timely alternation to physical training from mental application, t 
which in the young may easily be pushed beyond the limits of unflagging interest. Not 
only ought this exercise to be given a regular place on the programme of every school, 
but its occasional omission from the actual work of the day ought not to be excused ex- 
cept for very good and sufficient cause.’’ [Report of Board ‘of Public Schools, Saint 
Louis, Mo.] ‘ 
The pupils of the Rochester, N. Y., Academy three years ago obtained the permission of 
the board of education to fit up an unused chapel as a gymnasium. An advantageous 
arrangement was made by which the services of an instructor were secured without cost, 
and thus the benefits of physical culture were obtained almost without effort on the part 
of the board. ; 
It appears that the instruction has been extended in a measure to the children of the 
lower grades, since a late report states that _‘‘ physical exercises are carried more or less 
into every grade of our schools. * * * The exercises are varied in the upper grades, 
both with dumb-bells and swinging clubs, The competition in the several schools is 
great, and each school is trying to excel the other. The result of this training is such 
that the muscles are greatly strengthened, the body better developed, the mind increased 
in capacity, giving the whole system a tone of healthfulness heretofore almost unknown 
among school children,’’ 
The question of introducing general systematic instruction in gymnastics in the schools

of Cleveland, Ohio, is thus discussed by the president of the board of education in his 
report for 1885-86: 
“The object of educational training is the general preparation for life. Man possesses 
adual nature, soul and body; general and harmonious education therefore must embrace 
the body as well, and demands of the educator the furtherance of physical development 
and culture. In practical life a strong and well trained body is indispensable; labor 
and effort are abortive, when the spirit has not a storm proof physical instrament— 
when the shock that smites the spirit also prostrates the body. General culture and 
practical fitness for life both require gymnastic training, and therefore gymnastics have 
a just claim to our recognition in our system of public edueation.’” 
CoRPORAL PUNISHMENT. 
- The most important change, which these later years have brought, has been the com- 
ing in of more sympathetic relations between teacher and pupil; in less show of au- 
thority and more real power; in letting down the formal barriers of restraint, and letting 
in a sweeter and truer control; in bringing the teacher’s platform nearer the pupil’s 
desk, and the teacher herself closer the pupil’s mind and heart. In furnishing a mel- 
lower light and a purer air for the school room the teacher has fully kept pace with the 
architect.’? [Superintendent George Howland, Chicago. ] 
‘*One of the most important steps taken by the board of education—a step taken, as 
I believe, in good faith and in the interest of humanity—has been the permanent abolition 
of corporal punishment in the schools of our city. The resolution passed to this effect 
by the board was a general surprise to the faculty of teachers as well as to the citizens 
of Cleyeland. There have been not wanting warning voices in the public prints and 
among the people condemning the action of the board as premature, inconsiderate, and 
even demagogical. It is a matter of special pleasure and satisfaction to me to inform 
you that the discipline of the classes has not suffered through the abolition of corporal 
punishment. The question whether it will ever again be desirable may safely and 
calmly be submitted to posterity.’’ [President E. A. Schellentrager, of the Cleveland, 
Ohio, school board. ] 
‘“The by-law prohibiting corporal punishment of any kind is still an essential part 
of the system of discipline. ‘The severest punishment that may be inflicted is suspen- 
sion or expulsion, and the efiiciency of the system is clearly apparent in the constant 
cen of the number of these suspensions.’’ [Report of New York City school 
board. 
“The abolishment of corporal punishment has not added to the number of mischiev- 
ous or backward pupils. The unlimited use of the rod is certainly not desirable. It 
may be, however, that its use under some restrictions, to be devised by the board may 
be advisable, for it seems there are mischievous and ill-behaved pupils, who undoubtedly 
would be benefited by the application of it.”’ [Superintendent John Miller, Newburgh, 
Dots 
“Corporal punishment will be allowed only in exceptional cases, and then it must be 
ee in the presence of the superintendent.’”? [A rule of the Atchison, Kans., 
board, 
“No corporal punishment is permitted, except by request or consent of parents or 
guardians. While many object to the use of corporal punishment asa means of discipline 
in school, I would not recommend its abolition. Cases are likely to arise in any school 
in which corporal punishment, if applied in the right spirit and in the proper manner, 
is the-best and most effectual means to which a teacher can resort.’’? [Superintendent 
John Cooper, Leavenworth, Kans. ] : 
‘* As the State law explicitly forbids the infliction of corporal punishment in schools, 
' suspension or expulsion must be resorted to when moral suasion fails. Cases occasion- 
aily arise where it seems as though this prohibition was a mistake, where Solomon’s ad- 
monition, ‘Spare the rod and spoil the child,’ should be heeded. However, as long as 
the present law remains in force, parents should be the responsible parties in the ques- 
tion of ‘spoiling the child.’ _No law forbids their use of the rod.’’ [Mr. A. W. Edson, 
city superintendent, Jersey City, N. J.] 
“Your committee would report that in its opinion the law prohibiting corporal pun- 
ishment by the principals of our schools has had a bad infiuence on the pupils; that the 
ill-disposed scholars take advantage of it, knowing that the greatest punishment that 
can be meted out to them for their disobedience is either suspension or expulsion, which — 
in many cases is more of a gratification to them than a punishment.’ [Committee on 
visitation, Paterson, N. J.] 
HALrF-DAY SEssIons. 
This plan, originally devised as a temporary expedient to be utilized only in the 
absence of accommodations sufficient to permit the attendance of all pupils during the 
 
-P-A-G-E-229
  _ : 7d 
HALF-DAY SESSIONS. - 229 
entire day, has. been received with high favor in some localities. Mr. D. C. Tillotson 
says, in his last report as superintendent of schools at Topeka, Kans.: ‘‘The first grades 
have for a number of years been managed on the half-day plan—one setof pupils attend- 
ing in the forenoon, andjanotherin the afternoon. ‘This saves from eight to ten teachers, 
saving about $5,000 per year in running expenses. This saving has put the board ona » 
sound financial basis, and experience shows that the pupils lose nothing in scholarship. 
A child will do as much mental labor in a half-day as should be required in the twenty- 
four hours.”” 
The superintendent at Rockville, Ind., reports: ‘‘Since our last public announce- 
ment we have adopted and tested the half-day system for first year pupils. The plan 
has proved entirely satisfactory. While it maintains the interest and vigor of the school, 
it also sustains the scholarship and prepares the grade for promotion upon a record that 
the all-day plan can not secure. The continuance of the system is especially desired.’’ 
After an experience covering a year with half-day sessions in the primary schools, Mr. 
M. L. Knight, of Beaver Falls, Pa., thus states the disadvantages and advantages of the 
plan: ‘‘I find even in these lower rooms a class of older pupils, who have had but a 
limited opportunity of attending school, who have made but little advancement, but 
who are old enough to study. Some are found whose time when not in school is spent 
on the street, or in company with those whose influence is evil, and whose conduct is 
demoralizing. A few instances have also been reported where pupils were deeply inter- 
ested in school when permitted to attend all day, but when in attendance half a day 
they seemed to lose much of the former interest. In these instances I believe the half- 
day system has been a disadvantage. 
“On the other hand, I have found many advantages, among which I would mention 
improvement in order, fewer cases of discipline, a much purer and more healthful at- 
mosphere in the school-rooms, and consequently, better health among pupils, only one 
death occurring in eight months out of an enrollment of over 1,600 pupils. I found also 
a more intimate acquaintance and personal knowledge of the disposition and ability of 
pupils by the teacher, greater confidence and less restraint on the part of pupils, thus 
transforming the rigid government so often found in the school-room into the more per- 
fect freedom of the kindergarten or the family. 
“Thave endeavored to take an unbiased view of this system, and to formulate a report 
based upon facts. While I am notable from our brief trial of the system, to recommend 
the plan for permanent adoption in all of the rooms in which it has been tried, I will 
say, however, without hesitation, that for children the first year in school, whether few 
or many are in the room, I am satisfied that three hours’ drill each day, such as is given 
in our first primary rooms, is long enough. Pupils of this age can not study, hence they 
learn only while being taught, and if they can receive the same attention and instruc- 
tion in three hours that they otherwise would receive in six, I can see no advantage to 
be gained by the long period of confinement. The school-room is not a nursery, but a 
place to receive and impart instruction. 
“What has been said respecting pupils in school the first year is to a great extent true 
of children of the second or even the third year in school, and yet the exceptions here- 
inbefore referred to leave it an open question. If permission were given, and suitable 
provision made whereby those who desire the privilege and would be benefited thereby 
could attend both morning and afternoon sessions, I believe it would meet with favor 
and be open to but few objections.” 
Superintendent W. B. Powell, of Washington, D. C., looks with little favor on the plan 
which allows the pupils’ attendance but half the school day, and devotes a considerable 
part of his report to the subject. He says: ‘‘A half day at school is enough for a first 
or second grade pupil, if the school is not well taught or is in an unhealthful, uncom- 
fortable, or uninviting school-room. These conditions, however, ought not to exist. 
The school-room should be commodious, well lighted and well ventilated, clean and 
wholesome, and not overcrowded. Our teachers are competent to teach well, and where, 
oppportunity is given do teach well. * “* * The greater part of the moral effect of 
school life is lost to the child by the half-day school. ‘Time is an important element in 
good teaching, particularly in the primary grades, as it is a necessary element in the acqui- 
sition of knowledge and in the assimilation of thought. If knowledge is to be gained by 
effort, and its value proved by experiment and application before it can become a source 
of power to its possessor, teaching that is wholly didactic has but little in it that is purely 
educational. Yet the teacher who has 50 or 60 pupils to instruct in three short hours, 
shortened by the encroaching darkness of a winter day, can do little or nothing in the 
way of training. The primary pupil of six or seven years, who is learning to see, who 
is taking his first steps in language, cannot be properly taught didactically. He learns 
to see, to talk, to read, to write, by seeing, talking, reading, writing; he learns num- 
bers only by handling numbers of things; he learns forms by making and comparing 
forms; and he learns to represent forms by much practice in representation. The child 
himself must do,

    230 , EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
_ “The teacher’s office is to direct, to guide; and as the young learner is teaching him- 
self by self-activity, requiring much time, the exercises must be changed frequently, that | 
hhe may have proper recreation, and this also requires much time. The child’s school 
hours should be spent in doing or in activity for specific mental improvement, alternated 
by doing or physical activity for recreation, enjoyment, or specific physical improvement. 
This takes time. If the teacher has not the time to do this work right, she will dictate 
the scholastic part of the work and the child will suffer by loss of both mental self-activ- 
ity and the physical activity. The primary schools should take the child as they find him 
coming from the home, with all the perceptive faculties active, contributing to enjoyment 
and adding to knowledge, and should seek to teach him by the continued activity of 
these same faculties systematically directed for specific purposes, and should not so radi- 
eally change the child’s life as to make his school life a mere memory drill. But the 
‘short-time school conyerts the teaching into almost purely memoriter work. 
‘*Manual training begins in the kindergarten and should be continued in the primary 
school, but the child in the half-day school has no time to draw, to make forms of clay, 
or, by folding and cutting paper, or by laying sticks or other means; has no time to rep- 
resent forms. His time must be spent in committing to memory that which he may 
or may not understand, because the scholastic grade work must be done. 
* # * * * * * 
“That healthy, mental, moral, and physical growth that can come to childhood only 
by wisely directed, systematic, pleasing, and conscious self-activity can not be realized 
in a half-day school. That pure, natural, and earnest love for truth and knowledge is 
never known by the child who receives without question or investigation doses of facts 
as from the hands of one who has diagnosed and prescribed without explanation. Most 
of our teachers can do the legitimate work of the primary school properly, but they com- 
plain that the half-day school does not afford the time for doing it, and their complaint 
is well founded. Little time is allowed for calisthenic exercises, for games, for songs, 
and the repetition of mottoes; butall effort must be directed to accomplishing the grade 
work, that can be done only by continued pouring in, and a nervous, hurried, and too 
often meaningless memory drill. No one knows this better than the conscientious 
teacher, and no one speaks of it more frequently or more feelingly. That such memoriter 
work can be found in the schools is too true, That such work is found in the schools is 
not the fault of the teacher who is forced to do work on the half-time allotment. If we 
would have more and better training in school, and fewer home lessons to be studied by 
our small children, we must give more time and better opportunity to do the work. 
‘Six hours may be too long for the youngest child to go to school, but four hours—two 
in the forenoon and two in the afternoon, or five hours—two and a half in the forenoon 
and two and a half in the afternoon, for the child to be alternately working and play- 
ing, improving and resting, developing mentally and developing physically, by turn, are 
ane toomany. The child is better off in such a school than at play.’’ 
DIvIsION oF CLASSES. 
The following rule prevails in the schools of Washington, D. C.: ‘‘ They [the teachers] 
shail divide their schools, when all pupils are of one grade, into two sections, and shall 
have one section studying while the other is reciting, as far as practicable. In penman- 
ship, drawing, vocal music, and a few general exercises and explanations, the schoolshould 
be instructed as a whole.’’ : 
“This arrangement is in use in a number of cities. In many cities of smaller size in 
which semi-annual promotions are the rule, it has been necessary to assign two classes 
of different grade to each teacher for the sake of economy, and in nearly every case of 
this kind the results have shown not only that the financial interests of the city have 
been advanced, but that the quality of the instruction has actually been improved. 
At Steubenville, Ohio, ‘‘this has been the plan followed for the past seven years, and 
it is believed to be better than having all pupils in one class.’’ 
Mr. H. M. Maxson, of Attleborough, Mass., suggests that ‘‘in the arrangement of 
classes it would be an improvement to give each teacher 40 pupils of two nearly equal 
grades, rather than 40 pupilsofone grade. Nearly all the recitation work ina school of one 
grade should be done in two divisions; thus the number of recitations with one grade 
in a room is about the same as it would be with a like number of pupils in two grades. 
The higher grade would suffer no loss in consequence of each teacher having two grades, 
while many of the lower grade would gain much by what they heard of the recitation 
of the higher grade. There would also be a greater variety of work for the teacher, 
and no necessity for teaching the same thing twice each day, with the loss of interest 
which necessarily follows from such repetition.’’ 
Mr. Joseph O’Connor, deputy superintendent of San Francisco common schools, 
thinks that, ‘‘ the elasticity would be increased and the time and money saving made 
 
-P-A-G-E-231

greater if cach class were arranged to consist of two consecutive grades; for then, with- 
out at all disturbing the general order and classification, the teacher might at any time 
promote deserving pupils from the lower to the higher division of the class.’’ 
This gentleman quotes, in further support of his proposition, a letter from the prin- 
cipal of the Vallejo (California) High School, as follows: ‘‘For three years past the 
grammar schools of Vallejo have been arranged with two grades in each room. The « 
» teachers have all had experience of years with one grade in a room, and now three 
years’ experience with two grades in each room, and all prefer having two grades in 
each room; not one would willingly change to the one-grade arrangement.’’ 
The following method of division reported from Decatur, Ind., also finds support- 
ers: ‘‘The four grades of the primary department and the first two grades of the 
grammar department are each divided into two classes. The work of the two classes i 
is the same, the only difference being the thoroughness with which the work is done. 
Pupils are transferred by the teacher from one class to another at aay time on merit. _ 
By this means no pupil is held back on account of a dull class, but is permitted to go 
on as soon as he is ready. While this is no detriment to the indolent, it is of great ad- 
vantage to the industrious.’’ 
ReEcEss OR No REcEss. 
The recess question continues to be one concerning which men wise in school affairs 
disagree, The year has brought forth nothing new or important in the way of argument, 
for the main points in the discussion had been frequently elaborated in past years. It 
may be well, however, to add the results of another year’s experience to the supply of 
testimony pro and con, that has accumulated. 
Mr. A. P. Marble, rejoicing that the schools under his supervision in Worcester, Mass., 
did not discard the recess plan, says: ‘‘We may congratulate ourselves that we were 
left behind in this instance by the so-called car of ‘progress,’ The progress is the wrong 
way.’? 
The Mankato, Minn., superintendent does not believe in ‘‘no recess,’? and in the 
schools of that city the recess time in inclement weather is profitably employed by the 
teachers in teaching the girls to knit and crochet. 
The Danvers, Mass., school committee explain that an intermission in the school ‘ 
work at noon is better suited to the habits of the majority of the people of that town, tite 
and is for that reason, preferable, even if no other were urged. 
In New York City there are 2 sessions of 3 hours each, daily. ed 
In behalf of ‘‘no-recess’’ is the following from Albany, N. Y.: ‘‘The fifth year of 78 
_the no-recess system has corroborated the evidence of previous years, that, as promotive 
of healthfulness and moral and intellectual progress, it is a great step inadvance over © 
the old-fashioned mid-session recess.”’ 
The esteem in which the system is held in Muscatine, Iowa, is shown by this utterance 
from the principal of one of the ward schools: ‘‘ Another benefit from the no-recess plan 
is a fuller and more regular attendance in the higher grades. It gives more time for 
necessary ‘chores’ at home by shortening the school sessions, and hence more time to 
attend the regular school sessions.’’ > 
From Attleborough, Mass.: ‘*‘ For a year and a half the schools have followed the no- 
recess plan. Last year and also this I made inquiries of teachers as to its results. 
The universal testimony is that it is satisfactory to the teachers, and also to the parents, 
as far as their opinion is known. The only thing approaching complaint in this con- 
nection has been concerning excuses to leave the room, and the co-operation of parents 
with teachers will easily remove this.”’ 5 
. TRUANCY. 
In the requirements for an efficient system of schools the importance of regular attend- 
ance on the part of the pupils comes next to the necessity of securing competent teach- 
ers. There must always be unavoidable reasons which necessitate the occasional absence 
of a child from school. The occurrence of such reasons is recognized as unfortunate but 
necessary, and does not, therefore, cause concern., Save in exceptional cases, as during 
the general prevalence of disease, the proportion of absences from such causes to the total 
membership is practically uniform in all cities. It is not this proportion, but the num- 
ber of absences for which there is no legitimate excuse that school managers eyery- 
where exert themselves to reduce. The aversion of some children to the schools, and 
the indifference of their parents, are supposed to be the most common causes for need- 
less absences. . 
In those States where attendance is required by law the employment of special officers to 
seek out absentees and bring them into the schools, has become quitecommon. That plan 
has usually yielded excellent results in the cities, Such an officer being broughtin con-

tact with children who yield reluctant obedience to the law may be expected to discover 
facts which would not ordinarily be known to the teachers, and to recommend remedies 
that would not suggest themselves to those whose acquaintance with truants is limited 
, to the intercourse of the school room. 
There can be little doubt that the following from the report of the truant officer at 
Haverhill, Mass., might be said of the majority of cities: 
“In almost every instance the boys who give me the most trouble are those who have 
¥ the least care at home, both as regards their moral training and personal appearance. 
Some of the worst cases I have to contend with are those who are obliged to attend school 
with clothing so indecent as to make them ashamed to mingle with their well-clad as- 
sociates. There are some parents who utterly refuse to send their children to school, not 
being able to clothe them respectably, and there are as many pupils out of school from 
that cause as from any other.” 
The superintendent at Williamsport, Pa., is inclined to throw much of the blame for 
truancy upon the parents of the delinquent, and states that they are often ‘‘ willing to 
cover the fault of the child by lying to shield him from merited punishment.” 
At Hartford, Conn., the question of absence and excuses had grown to such import- 
ance that the board took decisive action upon the subject during the year in the form of 
a vote ‘‘ that no excuse be granted by the acting school visitor, excusing apy pupil from 
‘ attendance at the whole or any part of the regular session of any school in this town, or 
from any of the regular exercises of such school, except upon the certificate of a repu- 
table physician that such excuse is required by the state of such pupil’s health.”’ 
PUNCTUALITY. 
Closely related to the question of school attendance is that of promptness, Upon this 
subject Mr. Henry N. Mertz, superintendent of the Steubenville, Ohio, schools, thus 
sensibly expresses his views: 
““As regards tardiness there is a golden mean that the teacher should strive to main- 
tain. The evil effects both on the school and in the formation of thethabits of the child 
are recognized by all, and no reasonable effort should be spared to prevent all unneces- 
sary tardiness; but the fact should be recognized also, that sometimes the child or his 
parent has to choose between tardiness and absence. There mayarisesome combination 
of circumstances which make it impossible for the child to be at school on time. Now, 
tardiness may be made so odious by the teacher, and absence be so lightly passed over, 
that both parents and children prefer absence, and the child who might have been in 
school all the half-day except the first five minutes, stays away and misses the half- 
day’s instruction rather than be numbered with the tardy troop. After considering 
_ the effect of the interruption caused by a pupil coming in late, the moral effect upon 
the school, and the influence in forming the character of the pupil himself, we believe 
there is still a balance in favor of having the pupil come to school as soon as he can. 
No teacher should make tardiness so much greater offence than absence that children 
will prefer the latter.” ew 
Crawfordsville, Ind., a city of 7,473 inhabitants, with a school enrolment of 1,293 
and an average attendance of 995, is the only city in the country that has secured entire 
immunity from tardiness during the year. The superintendent says: ‘‘ The publication 
of the yearly catalogue with its faithful record of the attendance and punctuality of 
every pupil has had much to do toward putting our schools in the enviable position 
~ they occupy with respect to punctuality, as has also the kindness of the local newspa- 
pers in publishing our monthly roll of honor.” 
Another city in the same State, Warsaw, reports only 85 cases of tardiness, but 
13,252 half-day absences. The superintendent states that, ‘‘ with the high sentiment 
against tardies, quite a number, when they find themselves tardy, return home and 
come in with a quarter or a half day’s absence, thus increasing the evil.”’ 
The plan of rewarding classes perfect in attendance with a partial holiday has been 
tried in several cities with excellent effect. Mr. M. L. Hawley, of Gloucester, Mass., 
reports: ‘‘ This object is effected by our practice of allowing schools to be dismissed an 
hour earlier on Fridays for perfect class attendance during the week. ‘This privilege, 
with the generally admirable work of the teachers, has produced excellent results. Our 
school attendance is now at high-water mark.”’ 
At Chelsea, Mass., ‘‘ the plan of dismissing one hour earlier at the close of each month 
all who have been neither absent nor tardy during said month, has undoubtedly had a 
salutary influence upon the attendance, and if one half-day were the reward instead, for 
such constancy, it is believed that the actual gain in scholarship and the formation of 
good character would more than balance the loss occasioned by the extra half-holiday.”” 
The superintendent at Chicopee, Mass., thus bears witness to the efficacy of the plan: _ 
“The per cent. of attendanté for the year is 93.4, an increase of 2.8 over that of last 
year, which is largely due to the adoption of the plan of giving a half-holiday each 
 
-P-A-G-E-233

month to pupils, in all grades below the high schools, who are neither absent nor tardy. 
This plan, although in operation less than a half year, has proved to be a wise one, giv- 
ing us an increased percentage of attendance for each month, and consequently giving 
teachers opportunity to do more and better work in teaching; for it must be apparent to 
any one conversant with school attendance that more can be taught in thirty-nine half 
days with perfect attendance than in forty half days with broken and irregular attend- 
ance, which amounted previously in many cases to an-absence of from one-eighth to 
one-half of the entire number of sessions for the month. I would most earnestly recom- 
mend the continuance of this plan.’’ 
THE Errecr or COMFORTABLE ACCOMMODATIONS. 
“Commodious, neat, convenient, well lighted and ventilated class-rooms play an 
important part in promoting the moral, intellectual, and physical usefulness of a 
school. The school at Locust Point demonstrates the truth of this statement. When 
the school, numbering about 100 pupils with 3 teachers, was kept in a dingy, cheerless | 
old chapel, near its present location, it was small, difficult to manage, and although the 
teachers did everything possible to promote the efficiency of the school, yet the pupils 
were untidy, unpunctual, hard to discipline, and did not make satishictory progress. 
After the school was transferred to the new building in which it is at present accom- 
modated, great improvement was immediately apparent—the number of pupils in- 
creased from 100 to 333, and the number of teachers from 3 to 8. The neater appear- 
ance, better conduct and attendance, greater progress, and the increased efficiency of the 
school generally, is admitted by all.’? [From the report of Mr. Henry A. Wise, superin- 
tendent of Baltimore, Md., schools. ] 
Errecr or SCHOOL WORK UPON THE EYE-SIGHT. 
This subject, in the general discussion of school hygiene, has received its share of atten- 
tion. 
‘*Tn the old school-rooms, and we need not go far back for them, the light was often 
so insuflicient, that much harm undoubtedly resulted to the eyes of the children. But 
in our newer buildings so much thoughtful attention has been given to this subject, 
. that the evil no longer exists there. Pupils, too, have been allowed to study with too 
little regard to position, and with the object too near the eye; perhaps with the result 
of myopia in some cases, but by no means, in my judgment, to the extent often'charged. 
“The oculist is too definite, and too certain in his knowledge. Why should the book 
or paper always be ‘15inches trom theeye?’ Five feet seven may be the average height of 
a man, and 8 the right number for his boot; but is he to be considered deformed, ora 
monstrosity, who is 5 5 feet 6, or who wears a ‘number 7, or 9? 
* * * * * * * 
“OF over 80,000 children in our schools I have never seen one voluntarily take that 
distance, and have eminent professional opinion that such an enforced rule would 
work more harm than ever our neglect has done. Nothing will lie so unblushingly 
as figures. 
‘Much attention has been given to this subject, and in many of our schools the re- 
sult is all that good sense, or good science can demand.’’? [From the report of Mr. George 
Howland, superintendent of Chicago schools. ] 
The following, from the report of the board of education, describes the results of a recent 
examination of the eyes of the pupils of two of the leading public schools of Memphis, 
Tenn.: 
“The eyes of 681 pupils have been examined. Of these 588 had perfect sight, 60 had 
imperfect sight from general causes, and 30 had impaired vision from eye strain. It is 
interesting to trace the gradual increase of this form of impaired sight (near-sightedness) 
from the primary classes, where it is hardly noticeable, to the highest grade, where it 
reaches 15 per cent. In this particular my results are similar to those obtained by ex- 
aminers in this and other countries. Buta point which should not be overlooked is 
this—that my examinations were confined to pupils in two different school buildings, 
each of which may be taken as a sample of its class. The Market street building has 
been recently constructed and is well arranged, both as to illumination and ventilation, 
whereas the antiquated structure on Linden street is sadly deficient in both of these 
particulars. Now, compare the percentage of near-sighted children in corresponding 
classes (fourth, fifth, and sixth) in the two buildings, and you will find that while the 
Market street school has 2.8 per cent., the Linden street school has 5 percent. These 
figures commend the new building as strongly as they condemn the old, and no stronger 
plea can be advanced for new buildings, so constructed as to furnish proper illumination 
and a plentiful supply of fresh air than is furnished by these figures, whichoshow that

building with poor light and bad air,”

  234 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
In November, 1886, Dr. HP. Allen, of Columbus, Ohio, was appointed by the board 
of education of that city to examine the éyes of the pupils of the public schools. In 
his report he says: 
i “T examined between December 12, 1886, and June 6, 1887, the eyes of 4,700 pupils 
of the public schools, as follows: All of theshigh school classés, 12 in number; all of the 
grammar schools, 72 in number; all of the primary schools, 24in number; and 12 of the 
B, C, and D primary schools, making a total of 120 schools out of the 200 of the: city. 
This included all of the children above 10 years of age, with the exception of about 250, 
who were scattered through the various lower schools. I visited all of the school build 
ings and saw most of the school rooms. 
“The examinations were made chiefly to determine the condition of vision of the chil- 
dren, and find, in cases where vision was defective, the correcting glasses. The work was 
done in the school room during school hours. Each child was examined separately, its 
name, age, sex, nationality, Bomex 0a) color of eyes, condition of sight, and required 
glass noted at the time. * My records indicate the kind of trouble and the con- 
dition of sight with sufficient accuracy for all practical purposes, and enable us to draw 
certain well-defined deductions. * * * Thepoints to which I wish especially to call 
your attention are as follows: 
“First. The large number and percentage of pupils among the 4,700 with one dg two 
defective eyes—1,175 cases, or 25 per cent. of all the children examined. Ge 
“Second. Those with two defective eyes—936, or 20 per cent. of all the uilares ex- 
amined. * * * 
“Third. The increase in prevalence of near-sightedness as we go up the scale from 0 
per cent. in the D primary schools to 13 per cent. in the senior class of the high school, 
and 17 per cent. among the females of the senior class from 0 per cent. at the age 
of 6 years to 11.3 per cent. at the age of 17 years, showing the relation of this trouble to 
increasing age and increasing demands upon the eyes. 
‘Fourth, The about equal percentage of each of the other defects in the low, inter- 
mediate, and high grades, showing their independence of increasing years and increas- 
ing demands upon the eyes. 
“Fifth, The diminution in the percentage of good eyes as we ascend the scale, from 
80 per cent. in the D primary to 66,6 per cent. in the senior class of the high school.’’ 
A similar examination was made during the year of the eyes of pupils in the public 
schools of Kansas City and Nevada, Mo., and of the students of the State normal schools 
at Warrensburg and Kirksville, Mo., and the State universities of Missouri and Kansas, 
by Flayel B. Tiffany, M. D., of Kansas City, Mo. The results of this examination dif- 
fer in at least one material respect from those reported from Memphis and Columbus. 
The most important facts developed, with other matters of interest mentioned by the 
examiner, are here shown: 
“That perfect vision, perfect eye-sight, be enjoyed by our progeny depends largely upon 
the recognition of any defect, slight though it may be, in early life, timely correction of 
the same if possible, and care and proper use of the organ while in the school room. 
That many a boy or girl withsome anomaly ofrefraction or accommogation has been allowed 
to suffer day after day in order to keep pace with his class, and eventually develop more 
serious conditions or even blindness, is too evident; whereas if the trouble had been 
recognized in time and proper steps taken much suffering as well as serious consequences 
could have been averted. The object of these investigations is to ascertain the condition 
of the eyes of the youth, the effect of use of the organ for near and small objects, and 
the final consequences; and finall: ly, if possible, to correct the evils arising before itompar: 
able damage has been ‘done. 
* * * * * * * 
“In our investigations not only myopia but hypermetropia, astigmatism, spasm of ac- 
commodation, andstribismus were looked for, Every eye that was not upto the stand- 
ard of vision (that of twenty-twentieths) was not dubbed myopic. A careful examina- 
tion was made with the trial glasses, or optometer, and a more accurate diagnosis made. 
Our results show a much larger per cent. of hypermetropia and astigmatism and spasm 
of accommodation than myopia, there being nearly four times as many hypermetropic 
pupils as myopic. Of the whole number examined, 2,040, in the different grades and 
schools, 99 or 4.8 per cent. had spasm of accommodation. Now, spasm of accommoda- 
tion, or simple hypermetropia even, if not corrected. by glasses or relieved by rest from 
near and small objects, is likely to develop into myopia or possibly intraocular disease; 
hence the importance of these examinations. 
“In our examinations the increase of anomaly of refraction as we ascend in the grades 
is not marked. In fact, in some schools it seems to diminish; but this would not be a 
definite proof one way or the other, since from one examination, as a different set of 
pupils are examined in each grade and in each school, there is no means of knowing but 
that those of the higher grades started with the same degree of anomaly in the primary , ’

\ q 
departments as is found in the seventh year of the grammar school or the high school. 
In fact, it seems to be true that pupils with -anomalies of refraction, both myopes and 
hypermetropes, are closer students and fonder of books and study than the emmetropes 
or those of perfect vision, and hence these students remain in school while many of those 
with perfect vision drop ‘out before they reach the, higher departments. In our exami- 
nations we find a greater percentage of anomaly among the normal schools of Kirksville 
and Warrensburg than any other, but it does not necessarily follow that this is the result 
of a longer course of study and closer application with the eyes, although it is conject- 
urally true. The only way, to prove that study is the cause, or otherwise, is to watch 
the same set of pupils from the primary department up through the different grades, 
and see if John, Mary, and James, starting at 6 or 7 years of age in the primary de- 
partment with perfect emmetropic eyes finally later on develop myopia. In ow’ exam- 
inations this can be done, as we have the name in full, color of each eye, present amount 
.of vision, whether there is any hereditary defect or not; and now, should the examina- 
tions be continued and the same pupils called for as they enter the higher grades year 
after year, a very definite and satisfactory idea can be gained. 
‘* As to the lighting and-ventilation of our school-rooms very little neetl be said, as so 
much attention has been given to this subject by our efficient board that’the Kansas City 
school room is almost perfection in those particulars, In the Washington School, where 
we find the largest per cent. of defective eyesin the lower grades, I noticed first and sec- 
ond year pupils, for want of room, were crowded into a room calculated for older pupils, 
and hence the distance between the desk and the seat was too great, as well as that from 
the seat to the floor, compelling the little pupil to hang, as it were, upon the desk, his 
feet not touching the floor. This position of necessity brought his face too near his book 
or slate, and hence taxed the power of accommodation of the eyes to a great degree; and 
besides, this school from its location, on the north side of the hill, is not so well lighted 
and ventilated as others. In the Nevada school I found a less degree of anomaly among 
the same grade of students than in the Kansas City schools. This I attributed to the 
fact that the school is in a small country town, where the children have more freedom 
of the field, where they are not crowded so much as our city children are, and perhaps 
have better ventilated school-rooms. 
* * * * * * * ‘: 
“There were 2,040 pupils examined, embracing seven | different nationalities, besides 
seyeral of mixed nationality. 
“Of the 1,422 Americans, 300, or 21.1 per cent., have some anomaly of refraction. 
“OF the 129 Germans, 32, or 24.8 per cent., are affected; of the 26 French, 5, or 19.2 
per cent,; of the 15 Scotch, 3, or 20 per cent.; of the 67 Irish, 20, or 27.8 per cent.; of 
the 47 English, 8, or 17 per cent.; of the 11 Swedish, 3, or 27.2 per cent.; of the 93 
mixed, 22, or 23.6 per cent. 
“«The Irish, Swedish, and Germans have the highest percentage of affections; the Eng- 
lish, French, Scotch, and Americans the lowest percentage. Out of the whole number 
examined, 1,162 were girls and 878 boys; 458 had some ametropia (some anomaly of re- 
fraction). Of the 1,162 girls, 290, or 24.9 per cent., were ametropic. Of the.878 boys, 
168, or 19.1 per cent., were ametropic, being a larger per cent, of affection among the 
girls than among the boys, 
* * * oe * * * 
“Out of the 2,040 pupils, 13, or 0,6 per cent., had strabismus; 94, or 4,6 per cent., 
were myopic; 202, or 9.9 per cent., were hypermetropic; 42, or 2.06 per cent., were as- 
tigmatic; 99, or 4.8 per cent., had spasm of accommodation, and 63, or 3.1 per cent., 
had latent hypermetropia. 
“We find that hypermetropia predominates; if we add latent hypermetropia and 
spasm of accommodation, saying nothing of astigmatism, of which the majority was 
hypermetropic, we have 364 hypermetropes to 94 myopes, or nearly four times as many 
hypermetropes as myopes, or over twice as many as all the other affections taken to- 
gether. In the table, as seen, all the grades from the primary through the grammar 
school, high school, normal school, and university are represented, but in no instance, 
excepting the Kansas State University, is there anything like a gradual increase of my- 
opia or any of the anomalies simply or collectively. In nearly all of the schools there 
seems to be a higher per cent, of affection in the first years; then, a little later in the 
course, a marked diminution, and then again an increase. Probably many of those hay- 
ing some trouble after remaining in school for a short time drop out, which would ac- 
count for the diminution, and then, spasm of accommodation and latent hypermetropia 
becoming manifest later on, or perhaps developing into myopia, would account for the 
+ increase in this affection. 
“School life, however, as stated above, so far as I cangather by these examinations, 
has little or nothing to do in the development of these anomalies. That they exist, 
however, in a much greater degree than is generally supposed is very evident, and that

    236 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
continuous use of the eyes having these errors of refraction, whether in the school-room 
or out of it, if not corrected, is sure to have its evil consequences. The importance of a 
recognition of the existence of ‘these anomalies, of their extreme frequency, and of de- 
tecting and correcting them, isobvious enough. We should take into consideration that 
spasm of accommodation and latent hypermetropia frequently exist, and that these af- 
fections often develop into myopia, and if recognized early, and timely treated by rest 
_ and glasses, much suffering and irremediable troubles are averted. Cohn and others 
may have been able twenty years ago to trace the development of myopia to badly ap- 
pointed school rooms, but here in America ourschool rooms are so carefully arranged as 
to light, seats, desks, ventilation, etc., that we can scarcely attribute to the work in the 
schoo! room the cause of anomalies. In a very great degree these errors of refraction 
are congenital; frequently they are latent, and if the eyes were not overtaxed by near 
work they would never become manifest. The evil arising from work in the school- 
room is that these errors of refraction are not perceived, and hence not corrected. If the 
teacher could be made to understand that the little pupils complaining of headache, pain 
through the temples, and weakness of the eyes, or dimness of vision, arose neither from 
stupidity nor desire to avoid study, but that these complaints were symptoms of some 
defect of the organ of vision, or what would be better still, let a competent oculist.care- 
fully examine each child as he enters upon each year of study in the school work, and 
his anomaly, if he have any, corrected, anomalies would gradually diminish.’’ 
SUPPLEMENTARY READING. 
With the single exception of industrial training, no innovation has been made in the 
schools within the last few years for which so much is claimed, and from which such far- 
reaching results are expected by practical educators, assupplementary reading. To form 
a taste for good reading and thus overcome the evil influences of pernicious, cheap liter- 
ature is the highest object which it is hoped to secure; but, apart from this, the use of 
the works of standard authors in connection with the regular readers, furnishes, accord- 
ing to the testimony of many superintendents, an excellent means of testing the pupils’ 
ability to read understandingly, and at the same time impartsan interest toschool work 
which nothing else can. In some cities not only standard books but instructive and en- 
tertaining periodicals are provided. This is the case at Canton, Ohio, where the effects 
are thus described: 
‘These periodicals were used for class reading supplementary to the text book, thus 
giving freshness, additional interest and instruction in the reading exercises. Pupils 
were allowed to take the papers home for evening reading, and were also permitted to 
use them during school hours, providing they had any spare time after the preparation 
of their lessons. The teachers find this school literature a valuable help in moral in- 
struction and in the intellectual culture of the pupils. Providing reading matter so el- 
evating in tone, and so attractive, is the best and surest way of overcoming the habit of 
reading the trashy, demoralizing literature of the day. There is marked improvement 
in taste for reading noticeable in many instances. Some pupils who were formerly ad- 
dicted to dime novels and other sensational reading have voluntarily abandoned that 
since we are furnishing them something better.\ A knowledge of history, of current 
events, of familiar facts in science, and language culture are some of the benefits result- 
ing from this work.’’ 
At San, Francisco, Cal., ‘‘the principals as a unit want supplementary reading mat- 
ter.” 
The school committee of Southbridge, Mass., sey: ‘‘Supplementary reading, which 
has been gradually gaining ground for the past three years, is one of the most advan-- 
uate results of the system of free text-books. Its beneficial effects are plainly vis- 
ible. 
From Steuhenville, Ohio, comes the following: ‘‘Supplementary readers have now 
been in use long enough to enable us to judge of the results. These are very satisfactory. 
The children can read in any book of the grade of their reader, and not merely in the 
one which they have learned by heart from hearing its lessons read over and over, as 
was so often the case when but one reading book was used in a grade, and the reading 
is far better in every respect.’’ 
In New Haven, Conn., ‘‘ the method of teaching pursued requires much independent 
reading by pupils, and so the habit of reading is formed. Moreover, as supplementary 
to the school reading books, standard authors are being introduced and are read some- 
what critically. * * * We can well afford to teach a little less of arithmetic, if by 
so doing we can insure a love of good books, and a habit of reading that shall be a life- 
long benefit.’’ P 
The report“of the committee on books and supplies at Lowell, Mass., mentions the 
subject thus: ‘‘ With regard to supplementary reading for the different schools, a very 
small quantity was purchased, though had your committee acted according to its incli-
-P-A-G-E-237
  MUSIC. 237 
“nation a generous sum would have been expended in this direction, as it is assured of 
the good resulting from a plentiful supply of choice and suitable reading matter for all 
the different classes.’’ 
The Washington, D. C., teachers are told that “the supplementary books, to be read ” 
at sight, are second in importance only to the text books. They should be used at least 
for one exercise each week. This part of the reading will show the practical results of 
the efforts of the teacher and pupils.’’ 
The New York City superintendent says: ‘‘The good that has been already accom- 
plished by these supplementary readers suggesis a more comprehensive application of 
the same general idea.”’ 
A number of titles have been lately added to the list of books authorized for use as 
supplementary readers in the Boston, Mass., schools. 
At Bay City, Mich., a pupil must carefully read at least two books of a prescribed list 
before he is entitled to promotion to the next higher grade. 
The opinion of Mr. George Howland, superintendent of the Chicago schools, is thus 
expressed : ‘‘One of the most serviceable aids in the teaching of reading, enriching the 
pupil’s vocabulary, widening the range of his thought, and strengthening his grasp of 
words and their meaning, is a wise use of the supplementary readers, which to a limited 
amount haye been in use in our schools for four or five years. : 
“‘With these books, in which most of the words, though familiar, are employed in 
other relations, with a few new words interspersed, the forms and meanings of the words 
are more permanently fixed in the mind, the alertness of thought in seizing upon the 
new words greatly quickened, and an ever increasing interest and power, both of thought 
and expression, secured, admitting the pupils to more fruitful fields in the domain of 
history, literature, and science. 
‘No outlay of money, I think, can be more usefully incurred than in furnishing asuf- 
fictent amount of well selected books for supplementary reading.” 
Music. 
The value of music in the schools has been thoroughly discussed during several years 
past. That the utility of the study is generally conceded is shown by the fact that it 
is systematically taught in nearly every city school in the country. Here and there, 
however, there may still be found cities of importance whose school officers see no 
enough good in music to permit its study to occupy the time of the scholars. 4 
In denying the request of a number of citizens for the introduction of vocal music, the 
board of education of Dubuque, Iowa, adopted the report of its committee on course of 
study, which contained the following: 
“The regular and legitimate work occupies all the time now. * * * Your com- 
mittee is sure that the introduction of special matters to be taught by special teachers 
would seriously interfere with the regular work, and have the tendency to make such 
regular work superficial and of secondary importance with many pupils.’’ é 
A view of the matter, not infrequently taken is that of Mr. F. B. Richardson, super- 
intendent of schools, of Woburn, Mass. He says: ‘‘ That there are many advantages to 
be gained by means of the study of music is very evident, but it may be fairly a ques- 
tion whether it is the business of the schools to teach this subject as an art, and meas- 
ure the progress of the pupils by the amount of pleasing harmony they can produce at 
agiven time. As drawing is taught, not to make a finished draughtsman but to train 
the judgment and secure attentive observation, so musie¢ should be directed toward train- 
ing the mind in such a way as to give it more power, not merely in the production of 
sweet sounds, but in performing the ordinary duties of life. ‘There is no room in the 
curriculum for musical training; but training in music, properly directed, may be made 
of great value. If this distinction and the limits of this study are kept clearly in view, 
the efficiency of your educational system may be increased by devoting an hour a week 
to this branch, otherwise the time had better be spent on some other phase of mental 
development.”’ 
‘That singing is of great value in strengthening the lungs and developing the vocal 
organs is never denied; that it is of direct educational importance is proved by the re- * 
sults shown in the schools of New York City. In the words of the superintendent, 
“this subject is steadily gaining ground, not merely as regards proficiency in reading 
or executing vocal music, but in the improvement it is working in the perception of 
sounds and in the consequent softness and roundness in uttering ordinary speech.’’ 
Words of commendation for music appear in nearly every city report received by the 
Bureau, but the ground has been so fully covered by previous reports and circulars that 
farther extracts are unnecessary. It must be said, however, that musical instruction is 
not always satisfactory. Whereso many different systems of instruction exist, there must 
necessarily be degrees of excellence; it is even possible that systems thay be found in 
which defects largely counterbalance the excellencies; causes of local character some- 
   
-P-A-G-E-238
  238 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
times affect the results; indifference of teachers, which it appears to be impossible to 
overcome, is occasionally reported. It cannot be expected, therefore, that the most flat- 
tering results will be obtained in every instance; but lack of success is not often reported, 
and never without some substantial reason. 
__ There is a considerable difference of opinion as to the advisability of employing spe- 
cial teachers for music. Mr. John Jasper, city superintendent of the New York schools, 
recommends: 
‘“‘Tnasmuch as the by-laws now provide that all candidates for a teacher’s license shall 
be examined in music and in drawing, and as the teachers employed before the addition 
of these qualifications have had sufficient time to prepare themselves to teach these sub- 
jects, that the by-laws be so amended as to prohibit the further appointment of special 
teachers of music and drawing.’’ ‘ 
At Lowell, Mass., the committee on music of the school board two years ago decided 
to dispense with the services of the supervisor of music, the results of this work being 
unsatisfactory. In the year following no better success was achieved, and during the past _ 
year a supervisor was again appointed. According to the last report ‘‘he has succeeded. 
in the limited time he has been at work in bringing about a marked change for the 
better.’’ : ‘ 
Superintendent Taylor, of the Saint Paul, Minn., schools, says that ‘‘a superintend- 
ent of music was employed by the board of education, who continued in service until 
two’ years since, when teaching music as a specialty was suspended. Since that time, 
until the beginning of the last school year, music was a somewhat neglected branch in 
our public school. Some note. singing, some singing without note or system, was at- ~ 
tempted. These methods seemed more of a disadvantage than an advantage, as none of 
the principles which underlie a knowledge of music were understood. * * * It 
seemed wise that so important a matter of culture and refinement should no longer be 
neglected. Consequently the board of education engaged the services of Mr. C. H. 
Congdon, as superintendent of music, who entered on his work at the beginning of the 
year.”? 
ARITHMETIC. 
The ‘‘simplification ”’ of the study of arithmetic has been a much discussed subject 
during the year, Boston, Mass., has taken the initiative in action upon the question, 
while few other cities have done more as yet than discuss it. In April, 1886, the fol- 
lowing was introduced in the Boston school board: 
“Whereas, The study of so-called arithmetic in the grammar schools of this city covers 
much ground which does not come within the proper scope of arithmetic, which is the 
art of numbers, no small part of the time and strength of the pupils being given to 
‘merely technical applications of arithmetical rules; and 
“Whereas, The exercises prescribed are often difficult beyond the best conditions of 
mental discipline, the problems set for the pupils being really exercises, notin arithmetic, 
_ but in logic, such as pertain to a period of life several years later: 
“Resolved, That the committee on examinations are requested to inquire and report 
whether it is not practicable to reduce and simplify the studies and exercises now pre- 
scribed under the head of arithmetic.”’” 
The committee designated proceeded with a thorough investigation, obtaining the 
written opinions of all the principals of the schools concerned. ‘Their conclusions and 
recommendations were thus stated: 
“1, Home lessons in arithmetic should be given out only in exceptional cases. 
‘*2. The mensuration of the trapezoid and of the trapezium, of the prism, pyramid, 
cone, and sphere; compound interest, cube root and its applications; equation of pay- 
ments, exchange, similar surfaces, metric system, compound proportion, and compound 
partnership, should not be included in the required course. 
‘3, All exercises in fractions, commission, discount, and proportion should be con- 
fined to small numbers, and to simple subjects and processes, the main purpose through- 
out being to secure thoroughness, accuracy, and a reasonable degree of facility in plain, 
ordinary ciphering. 
‘*4. In ‘practical problems,’ and in examples illustrative of arithmetical principles, 
all exercises are to be avoided in which a fairly intelligent and attentive child of theage 
concerned would find any considerable difficulty in making the statement which is pre- 
liminary to the performance of the properly arithmetical operations. 
* “When arithmetical work is put into the form of practical or illustrative problems, 
it must be for the purpose of interesting and aiding the child in the performance of the 
arithmetical operations, and with a view to their common utility, 
5. In oral arithmetic no racing should be permitted; but the dictation should be of 
moderate rapidity. 
‘*6, The average time devoted to arithmetic throughout the primary and grammar 
school course should be three and a half hours a week; and in the third primary grade
-P-A-G-E-239
CIVICS—OTHER STUDIES. : 239 
not more than two hours, and in the first and second primary grades not more than 
three and a half hours each per week. 
“And also all examinations for promotion from primary to grammar schcols should 
be as simple as possible, and strictly confined within the limit of an hour in each 
subject.’’ 
The course of study was subsequently altered to include and conform to these recom- 
mendations. This was not done, however, without considerable opposition, the reduc- 
tion proposed in the time being the particular feature to which objection was urged. 
The board of supervisors, in their report for the year ending September 1, 1887, several 
months after the revision of the course of study, take a hopeful view of the new de- 
arture. 
: In Brooklyn, N. Y., the method of presenting the study has been modified, but the 
quantity of work remains undisturbed. The lower grade pupils will deal only with 
small numbers and perform such operations as may be readily understood by them, but 
the grammar school work has not been lightened. 
Syracuse, N. Y., reports “‘ more real advancement ’’ by the ptpils since a similar plan 
has been followed. In the revised course of study for the grammar schools of Somer- 
ville, Mass., “‘ the requirements in arithmetic have been reduced in all the classes whose 
work seemed excessive. This reduction was accomplished in the fourth class by the 
substitution of the brief course for the complete arithmetic; in the third class by the 
omission of denominate fractions; in the second class by omitting problems in interest; 
in the first class by omitting or making optional true discount, foreign exchange, com- 
pound proportion, cube root, similar surfaces, and similar solids.” 
Crvics. 
Instruction in civics, or the science of civil government, is eagerly called for in some 
quarters. Mr. Thomas Tash, superintendent of schools at Portland, Me., says: 
‘*The labor troubles frequently occurring, the financial questions’ that have arisen 
since the war of the rebellion, and the many instances of questionable legislation in State 
ong nation, have suggested to thoughtful persons the question whether or not the young 
be educated in the public schools preparatory to a better appreciation and perform- 
and of their duties as good citizens in a republic. Im countries where social distinction 
exists, such instruction is mainly confined to children of the governing classes; but here, 
where every man is a sovereign and every woman may soon become such, civic instruc- 
tion should manifestly be universal.’?” 
At Frankfort, Ind., ‘‘recognizing that social instability comes from popular igno- 
rance of law, of rights of persons and property, of the sound principles of political econ- 
omy, the following work has been mapped out, and was done during the last year: 1. A 
study of local government—officers, institutions, elections, local improvements. 2. A 
study of State goyernment—ofiicers, educational, benevolent and penal institutions, elec- 
tions, legislature. 3. A study of National Government—legislative, judicial, executive; 
comparison of, and relation between State and National Government; process of law- . 
making; reasonableness of obedience to authority; national institutions and improye- 
ments, 4. A study of business relations, wealth, exchange.” : 
OTHER STUDIES. 
In the teaching of geography great changes have been made from the methods of a 
few years ago. According to the more recent methods many details of doubtful impor- 
tance are omitted and considerably more attention is paid to local geography. The use 
' of the moulding board has become quite general. 
Nor is grammar now what it. once was. Technical rules are usually reserved for the 
higher grades of the grammar schools, while the younger children are taught to speak 
correctly by means of ‘‘conversation exercises,’’ ‘‘language lessons,”’ etc., in which 
rules as such are seldom, if ever, referred to. 
In history, Mr. John Jasper says: ‘‘ There are still a few classes in which the ‘question 
and answer’ method prevails, but these are fortunately the great exception. Still they 
exist, and in them the legends of Capt. John Smith and Pocahontas are deemed of 
vastly more importance than the ‘ Purchase of Louisiana,’ or the struggle of the Brit- 
ish and French for the possession of this continent. 
‘*All important in all grades is the constant recurrence to the skeleton outline, which 
should be the basis of all superstructure.’ 
The elements of geometry have been taught in the higher grammar school classes 
with success in some cities. Even a little drill in this study has been found to furnish 
an excellent idea of logical reasoning, and as such is particularly valuable to those pu- 
pils whose school lives end with the completion of the grammar school course,

» whose population contains an important Teutonic element, than in the cities of the East. 
In Milwaukee a ‘‘ superintendent of German’? has recently been appointed, and more 
. .systematic, effective arrangements made for instruction in that language than ever. 
In 1885-86 St. Louis employed 96 special teachers of German at a cost of $58,000, in 
addition to 75 German-English teachers who had charge of rooms. There were 21,990 
children, 40 per cent. of the total enrolment, who received instructionin that language.! 
The old methods of Jearning to spell are beginning to show the evidences of conflict 
from the attacks of educational reformers. A ‘‘spelling book ”’ is a thing unknown in 
several citysystems. ‘‘ Spelling is a means, not an end,’’ is a motto which appears to be 
gaining in popularity. 
EXAMINATIONS AND PROMOTIONS. 
The movement against written examinations, begun within the last few years, has con- 
stantly gained ground. The tendency at present is undoubtedly in the direction of 
greatly lessening the scope and importance of these tests. Comparatively few cities now 
rely implicitly upon them in determining the classification and standing of the pupils. 
‘The views of those school officers who are most emphatic in their opposition to the 
system of percentages, and the reasons given for limiting its importance are generally 
similar to those set forth by Mr. Charles H. Morss, superintendent of the schools of 
Portsmouth, N. H., in his report for 1886. The following is an extract: 
‘The chief end and aim of much of the teaching seems to be to pass examination, and 
great honor and prestige is accorded to the boy or girl who scores 100 per cent. What 
does this signify? What is the meaning of 100 per cent. inschool work? Does it mean 
that the pupil knows all there is to be known about the subject? Take two pupils in 
an examination, one receives 100 per cent. and the other 75 per cent.; does this imply 
that one has 25 per cent. less intelligence than the other? In another examination this 
might be reversed, and the perfect (?) one receive only 75 per cent. while the ignoramus (?) 
might in this case reach 100. A high per cent. means simply that one child has 
had the good luck to remember certain facts which, from lack of interest or a poorer 
memory, the other forgot. Examinations, then, are lotteries in which those minds that 
can be crammed with the most facts draw the prizes. How often do we notice that the 
ignoramus, so-called, develops in after life into the most successful and brilliant mafi of 
tke class and makes his mark in the world, while the pupil of marks is never again heard 
from. To attempt to grade the human mind in per cents., to estimate the comparative 
~ mental capabilities of pupils by a mathematical calculation, is an absurdity. 
* * * * * * * 
“Such considerations lead us to believe that the marking system as practised is an un- 
mitigated evil and should be abolished; that is, abolished as a means of obtaining data 
from which to make promotions. The good judgment and recommendation of those who 
know intimately the work of the pupils should be substituted as a basis for promotion. 
The whole theory of examinations is based on the supposition that pupils are made for 
the schools, and not the schools for the pupils.”’ 
Few superintendents admit the advisability of omitting examinations entirely from the 
school exercises, and even these whose ideas are as extreme as those of Mr. Morss agree 
that they exert a strong influence for good when used by teachers merely as written re- 
views. The principal of the high school of Fall River, Mass., though an advocate of ex- 
aminations in a narrowed sphere, states the following reasons, founded on his experience, 
against attaching as much importance to them as formerly: 
“(1) The efforts of many pupils are not distributed uniformly over the period inter- 
vening between examinations, but are often relaxed at the beginning and middle of the 
period and intensified near the close. : 
“(2) The great stress laid upon the examinations suggests to the pupil a wrong mo- 
tive for study. Many pupils—often by the advice of their parents—ask to be allowed 
to drop a study and to select from another course a substitute, on the ground that they 
cannot get a high per cent. in the study to be changed. Furthermore, at the beginning 
of the year pupils change from one course 1o another, influenced by the same reason. 
**(3) It is not uncommon to observe pupils—usually young ladies—who are of asensi- 
tive and nervous temperament, and are, perhaps, morbidly conscientious, so concerned 
regarding the approaching examination as to be quite seriously affected in health. 
““(4) There are certain exercises of the school in which no examination can be given, 
and these the pupils are inclined to neglect, for the reason, as they frankly say, they 
“don’t count.’ 
“((5) The written examinations fail to make a correct measure of the effort put forth 
by individual pupils. It is easy to pick out scholars in every class who have not been. 
oyer-industrious during the month, but who, nevertheless, produce excellent examina-

tion papers; while others, who in a daily work have been attentive and studious, 
present inferior results in their written tests. 
‘*(6) It is difficult in written examinations to so frame the questions as to test all the 
powers of the mind. The portative memory is the faculty chiefly called into action. 
““(7) Not only are the pupils led to study in a manner to meet merely the demands 
of the examination, but the teacher, unconsciously perhaps, but none the less certainly, 
keeps the examination in view as he shapes the character of his instruction. 
‘“(8) Since the results of the examinations have so important consequences for the 
pupil, he is necessarily exposed during the time of these exercises to extraordinary tempta- 
tions to seek improper means of information upon questions regarding which he feels that 
his knowledge is uncertain. The practice of cheating at examinations is a matter of great 
moral concern.” 3 
Actual experiments.—At Milwaukee, Wis., the superintendent may exempt pupils 
from examination upon satisfactory evidence that they are fitted for promotion. That 
this rule has resulted in the practical abolition of the system of examinations, without 
evil consequences, may be inferred from the following paragraph from the superinten- 
dent’s report for 1885-86 : 
“The change from the system of promotions upon examinations as carried out under 
the directions of the board, has not been followed by these calamitous consequences which 
some supposed would result from the abandonment of that modern fetich of the graded 
system. Classes have been promoted without examination on the teacher’s estimate. 
The standard of scholarship has not been lowered. Unmerited promotions have not em- 
barrassed the teachers who receive the pupils promoted on record or estimate. _Teach- 
ers have shown no diminution in zeal nor manifested any lack of energy since the sup- 
Peed indispensable spur of examination has been removed.’’ 
Regular written tests at stated intervals have been abolished at Lima, Ohio, on the 
ground that they have already accomplished the thorough grading of the schools and 
their further use will only tend to produce narrow, mechanical, and unprogressive work. 
It has recently been determined to consider the teacher’s estimate only in making 
promotions in the schools of Cincinnati, Ohio. The new plan went into effect in Febru- 
ary last, and though there has not been suflicient time to judge the results, the indica- 
tions are regarded as hopeful. Following this action of the Cincinnati board the princi- 
pals of the schools of Louisville, Ky., adopted a resolution commending the movement, 
and requesting their own board to take similar action. 
‘Shortly after the present board of education [of San Francisco, Cal.] entered upon 
the discharge of their duties they authorized the superintendent to notify the principals 
and assistant teachers that the yearly written examinations would be dispensed with,. 
and that all promotions would be made by the principals and the class teachers, subject 
to appeal to the superintendent on the part of parents dissatisfied at the non-promotion 
of their children.” 
The superintendent—the above was taken from his last report—thus continues: ‘‘ This 
method of determining the promotion or non-promotion of pupils was enforced, and so 
far as I have been able to learn, has met with general approbation. I have for several 
years been impressed with the defects of the written examination system, and conld see 
but one argument in its favor, and that argument itself a defect. Teachers, instead of 
exercising an independent judgment in reference to the fitness or the unfitness of the 
pupils for promotion, seemed to desire to shift the responsibility. I have invariably 
maintained that teachers could arrive at more correct conclusions as to the status of the 
pupils taught by them by taking into consideration the general standing of those pupils 
throughout the year, than they could upon asingle examination upon questions emitted 
from the superintendent’s office. Besides, this method of promotion gave greater op- 
portunity to take into consideration other circumstances, such as natural ability, faith- 
fulness of application, and general character of understanding. In addition to enabling 
teachers to arrive at more equitable conclusions, it has been to both teachers and pupils * 
a saving of much valuable time, and a freedom from the ordeal of trouble, vexation, and 
labor incident to written examinations. I am satisfied that the result of the present 
plan has conclusively proved the wisdom thereof, and that the promotions have been 
made this year with as much accuracy as before, if not more. Besides, nearly one month 
of actual school work and teaching has been added to the school year, inasmuch as the 
written examinations usually consumed nearly one month of valuable time. The teachers 
and pupils were thus enabled, too, to close the term without that worry and weariness 
heretofore noticeable.”’ 
Favorable opinions. —The sentiment opposed to examinations is by no means universal, 
however. Theconservative school men who believe regular, systematic, written tests to 
be indispensable, lack neither numbers nor ability. “In their report for 1886-87 the 
board of supervisors of Boston, Mass., devoted considerable space to the advocacy of 
rightly conducted examinations. They present the following:

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87.

“ (a) The subject may be regarded from the teacher’s standpoint. He has taught 
and trained his pupils in certain directions to the best of his ability. He wishes to know 
how well they understand what he has taught, and how well they can succeed in what 
he has been training them to do. How does he find out? He tries them. He finds, 
let it be supposed, that they stand very well all his tests. Whatmore natural than that 
he should desire to have them also tested by others? He may have overlooked some 
points; his way of putting things may not be the way such things will be generally put 
by others; his standard may be a little lower than usually prevails, or even a little 
higher—who more than he can be interested in knowing how his work will appear to- 
others competent to judge its worth? If he has taught toa right purpose, he has endeav- , 
ored to make his pupils independent of himself; to ‘put them, as it were, upon their own 
feet, and will most certainly welcome every fair trial of their ability to stand, * * 
“ (2) The teacher is a public servant. ‘They who employ him, to whom the people in- 
trust the oversight of the work he is to do, are not only by statute law, but by the higher 
law of faithfulness to trusts, in duty bound to know how he discharges the responsibil- 
ities ofhis office. This they can know only through inspection and examination. And the 
more thoroughly they inspect and examine, the more they know the spirit and methods 
of the teacher, the more justly and closely they apply their tests to his work, the better 
it is for him and his pupils, so long as he works in the spirit of his professi 
himself skilled in the delicate handling of youthful minds and hearts 
‘*(3) The examination is advantageous to the pupils. It has a bracing effect upon 
them; gives them confidence in themselves, makes them more careful to understand, 
arouses their ambition. Of course, a just examination is'referred to. It must be ad- 
mitted an examination may be discouraging in its effects, * But examinations 
of this kind have never much prevailed, and are rarer now than ever before, 
*(4) The schools of a city are an organized system of which each school ‘is a part, 
Certain schools of one grade prepare for schools of another grade, and these still for an- 
‘other. In all schools of a grade there isa like or corresponding classification. The 
second-class grammar in one school ought to match very nearly the second-class grammar 
in another school. ‘The exigencies of city life cause much moving of families from one 
part of the city to another. If schools are rightly classified the change of schools will 
not affect the standing of the transferred pupils. In all schools promotion depends 
mainly upon examinations. But these examinations are not uniform, nor is it essential 
that all should be; yet it is important that there should be some uniform examinations, 
in order to suggest uniform standards, and to hold like classes as closely as circum- 
stances will allow, to like work. * 
ny (5). Without pressing the matter very strongly, it may be stated that there is a eee 
dency in some quarters to teach with less thoroughness and persistency subjects'in which 
there is no examination than subjects in which an examination is to follow. There may 
be, then, in addition to the above reasons for examinations, another, in their effect upon 
the teachers themselves in holding them to systematic, precise, and clear teaching and 
training. By no means is this remark to be taken as general. It is believed that the 
teachers who are bent upon doing their best work for their pupils, examination or no 
examination, are in the majority. 
‘*(6) It is often said that thé examination too much influences the teacher in his 
aims and methods, hedges in his activities, and prevents him from doing the best he 
knows. _ That raises the question, Must it of necessity have that influence? It may be 
answered that in the public schools of this city the ‘course of study’ is binding upon both 
teachers and examiners. In following that, there is no restriction upon the teacher’s 
methods, no preventing the free outpouring of all that is greatest and bestin him. He 
is to do in a large’ way a specified work. He is concerned for the moral and in- 
tellectual growth of his pupils, concerned for their manners as well as for their ability 
to answer questions, * * * Absorbed i in this work he may well forget examinations. 
His motto may well be the old maxim, ‘Take care of everything but the examina- 
tion and let the examination take care of itself,’ There will be much more likeli- 
hood of his pupils passing an excellent examination than if he should work with 
that end in view. If they fail, so much the worse for the exa umnination, It would be 
pleasant to he able to say that there is no such thing in the schools as ‘cramming’ for ex- 
aminations. It is a lessening evil, but it is stillavisible one. If the influence of exam- - 
inations is to lead to “cramming” it is a heavy offset to whatever good may come from 
them. How can a teacher who has it before him to come into honest relations, with his 
pupils, to bring out all that is best in them, to increase their faculty and quicken their 
life, to give them real knowledge and a growing independent power of thought,—how 
can he turn from his high calling to the lower work of simply preparing his pupils to 
pass a specified examination ? Zligug | 
“*(7) The attitude of the teacher and pupils towards examinations has an important 
bearing upon results. The constant dread of an examination, the holding it up before 
       
    
-P-A-G-E-243
EXAMINATIONS AND PROMOTIONS. 
  the class as a terrible ordeal, the painting in vivid colors the dread consequences of a 
failure, and visiting with censure pupils who do not reach fall success, are only so many 
hindrances to the success desired. Pupils are thrown into just that nervous state which | 
weakens their confidence in themselves, deprives them, partially, of their control over 
their faculties, leads to confusion of thought, and takes away all pleasure from exertion. 
On the other hand, let the teacher look upon the examination as a matter of course, a 
very necessary and helpful part of the school régime, to be weleomed when the time for 
it has come; let his cheerful and hopeful spirit be infused into his pupils, encouraging 
them to undertake the test with thoughtfulness and patience, with no Damocles’ sword. 
hanging over their heads, and the results, even if not perfectly satisfactory, will be more 
creditable than under other circumstances, and will be the fair outcome of the ability of 
the class. Encouraging words, bracing up the will to undertake, are better in every way 
than the constant nagging to which some pupils are subjected. But suppose there are 
failures. In the nature of things there must be some failures, unless the class is a re~ 
markable one. They can easily be accounted for; some of them will be very suggestive 
in regard to future efforts, and ail will be robbed of their discouraging features. When 
work is carried on in a brave, hopeful, and conscientious spirit, even failures may be 
made helpful; and pupils who have failed may be made only the more determined towin 
future success.’’ 
Mr. George A. Littlefield, of Newport, R. I., thus renders his opinion in his report 
for the year just passed: 
“Recent discussion has made examinations one of the most conericidns of educational 
forces. They are standing the fire well. It is found that when wisely conducted they 
are a process of teaching as well as testing, are reviews pure and simple with the extraor- 
dinary power added to compel attention as nothing else can.” 
A complete and thorough system of examinations has been inaugurated in the schools 
of Philadelphia by the superintendent, Mr. James McAlister. ‘The president of the 
board of education of that city, in his report for 1886, says concerningthem: ‘‘Thein- 
fluence of these examinations in unifying the work done by the twenty- -three hundred 
teachers in the service of the board has been deep and far-reaching; and no other work 
undertaken by him [the superintendent] has tended more to the general improvement 
of the schools.” 
At Oshkosh, Wis., the examination methods have recently undergone modifications, 
and there appears to be a willingness on the part of several members of the board to 
abolish examinations altogether, and to substitute the marking of daily recitations. In 
regard to this the superintendent says: 
“T believe the adoption of this plan would be a serious mistake. Even thoroughly 
conscientious teachers would beinclined to ‘send up’ many incompetent pupils. It would 
give prominence to the feature of measuring a pupil in each recitation. Too much 
thought would be given to marking at the expense of teaching. The child would com- 
mit the lesson for the day, get his mark, and forget the lesson, there being no examina- 
tion ahead. Who would stand between the teacher and the parents ofsuch pupils as are 
not permitted to go forward? No two teachers mark alike. The annual classes coming 
to the grammar grades would represent six different opinions in reference to the worth 
of recitations. At present the teacher of the B grammat g grade makes the lists for ex- 
amination, thus securing a class of uniform capacity.’’ 
“The Golden Mean.?—The plan of promotion which has found favor in by far the 
greatest number of cities, consists of a combination of the examination and the no-exam- 
ination system. These cities might be said to occupy the middle ground, where, it is 
claimed, the defects of both are to a great extent avoided, and the benefits retained. 
Uniformity of instruction and close grading are secured by examinations, but they are 
made less formidable hy being deprived of a great deal of their former importance. On 
the other hand, the proficiency shown in the daily work of the pupils is taken into ac- 
count to encourage evenness of effort throughout the term, and to prevent the scholars 
from looking forward to the examination with unnecessary trepidation. 
The relative importance attached to the two factors is widely different in the various 
cities. In the majority, they are of equal value; but in some cities, notably Kansas 
City, Mo., the daily work of the pupils receives four times as much weight as the 
‘examinations in determining their standing. The marks of proficiency in daily work 
generally consists of the teacher’s estimate of each child’s work, expressed weekly or 
| monthly, and averaged at the end of the term or year. In some cities teachers are per- 
mitted to use their own discretion in the employment of methods in arriving at their 
weekly or monthly estimates; they may hold examinations on their own account, or 
mark daily recitations, or they may make the estimates upon mere opinion as to ‘the 
pupils’ work, or upon a combination of the three methods. This freedom, however, is 
' Tot often allowed. One method is usually officially prescribed,

  244 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
The plan which has been tried in a number of cities of : 
_ Exempting a portion of each class from examination for special excellence has been quite 
successful. The superintendent at San José, Cal., thus describes the working of the 
plan there, where it bas been in operation two years: 
“A monthly record of the standing of each pupil is kept by the teacher and a copy 
sent regularly to his parents, Those who reach 90 per cent. in their studies during the 
“year and an average of 95 per cent. in deportment were promoted as honorary pupils. 
Those ranking next to the honorary pupils were promoted on the recommendation of 
the teacher. ‘he honorary pupils and those who were recommended number one-half 
of each class, and were not required to take the final examinations. z 
“This plan of promoting has worked well in our schools during the two years it has 
been in operation. It may be assumed that one-half of the pupils at least will be pro- 
moted, and this half will include those who were most regular in their attendance and 
most attentive to their duties while in school. It is certainly an unnecessary labor and 
expense to examine pupils whose daily recitation and monthly record entitle them to be 
ranked among the better half of the class. This method of promotion has been a 
decided incentive to the pupils, stimulating them to greater studiousness and better de- 
portment; at the same time the annual examinations furnish the balance of the class 
an opportunity to show their ability to do the work of the next higher grade.”’ 
Mr. W. M. Crow, of Galveston, Tex., says: ‘‘Excusing one-third of the pupils from 
final examination on accountof excellence in class studying during the term, has proved 
to be a healthy and far-reaching incentive to good work.” 
The general scheme of promotion in use at Wilmington, Del., is well spoken of by the 
superintendent, Mr. D. W. Harlan; it includes the promotion without examination of 
the half of each class bearing the best recitation marks. 
Special or wnuswal methods.—A number of plans which have not found their way into 
general use, have been tried by various cities with different degrees of success. New 
Bedford, Mass., for several years promoted all,classes in mass. The plan is still in oper- 
ation in the lower grades, where it appears to work well, but its effects in the high 
school were disastrous. Pupils who were unprepared for the high school were admitted; 
and, conscious of their incapacity, soon became totally indifferent, and consequently a 
disturbing element in the school, affecting the more industrious scholars, 
Brookline, Mass., does not promote in mass, but the method of dealing with incom- 
petents is not far removed from the New Bedford plan. The following appears in the 
- last report of the school committee: z 
“There were the usual number of children whoare incapable of doing the work; and these 
were allowed to be promoted with the understanding that their averages should not affect 
the general average of the class. While, of course, a promotion under such circumstances 
is, in one sense, no promotion, yet when children attain a certain age and stature, there 
seems to be nothing else to do but to allow them to go on with a higher class and do the 
best they can, absorbing what benefit they may.” 
Age is an important consideration in the classification of the Portland, Me., schools. 
The superintendent says: 
“While fitness in studies will, no doubt, long remain the principal basis on which 
promotions are made, yet in graded schools age is by no means to be overlooked in clas- 
sification. This recognition of age in promotions was adopted by rule in the Portland 
schools earlier than in any other system of schools, so far as we have noticed.”? And 
ain: 
‘The attainments of children differ very essentially at the same age, but there isa 
common law governing the growth and maturity of the mind as well as of the body. 
“We should not be deceived by the physical appearance of children, and impose on a 
robust boy of fourteen years the labor and burdens which a man of twenty-five can 
easily bear. Mental, like muscular growth, requires time to develop. In graduating 
the tasks of school children, age must be taken asan approximate guide. The indiscreet 
assignment to children of studies or of branches of ¢ udy beyond their age and ma- 
turity, or the promotion of individuals or of classes to such studies, only produces 
harm.”’ 
Frequency of promotion.—The advantages of semi-annual promotions are generally rec- 
ognized. Questions of expediency have in many instances prevented the change from 
the annual plan, but in no case where the change has been made has dissatisfaction been 
expressed with the results. Cities in which changes of grade occur more frequently than 
twice a year are the exception. \ 
  EVENING ScHoors. 
Té can not be said that this important brauch of educational work has met with uni- 
versal success during the past year. The great obstacle everyw here reported has been 
irregular attendance.
-P-A-G-E-245
EVENING SCHOOLS. 245 
Upon the opening of an evening school the attendance for the first few sessions is almost 
invariably large, but when the curiosity of some is satisfied, and when others discover 
that hard work and not play is expected, an immediate decrease is noticed in the size of 
the classes. Amusements and other matters of equal importance so frequently prevent 
the attendance of even those who do not entirely drop off, that some have gone so far as 
to doubt that an evening school can be successfully conducted except in large cities. 
The following, from Orange, N. J., explains tbe situation there: 
“The evening school as a whole ‘has not met the anticipations of its supporters simply 
by reason of the small attendance. With the promise made for free instruction, with 
experienced teachers, with text-books furnished, those who have been willing to avail 
» themselves of the advantages of the school have been very few. .* .*.* The experi- 
ence of the two winters goes to prove that the return for the money appropriated is not 
sufficient to warrant a continuation of the school, except possibly in the special study of 
mechanical drawing, and in the class for colored adults. The few who attended regu- 
larly made fair progress.’’ 
At Salem, Mass., the registration in the evening schools was 279; the average attend- 
ance in November was 155; in the following February, but 40. ‘‘The committee en- 
deavored to induce a larger attendance at these schools, personally and by public notice 
in the papers at the middle of the term, but without success.”’ 
Even Milwaukee, Wis., a city with a population of 158,000, reports that ‘evening 
schools have been organized, but their lack of patronage does not encourage their con- 
tinuance.”” 
At Lewiston, Me., “notwithstanding the fact that excellent advantages are offered to 
pupils of evening schools, a small percentage of the boys who register derive any ben- 
efit therefrom.” 
The president of the Dayton, Ohio, board of inition says: 
““To my mind it is a serious question, and one worthy of the calm consideration of the 
board, whether the night grammar schools ought to be continued beyond the present 
year. It has been the experience of all the members of the committee having this school in 
charge that the attendance after the first few weeks dwindles to such a small number as 
not to warrant the board in the employment of half the teaching force usually appointed 
for that purpose. Then, too, the work of the few who do attend for the purpose of 
honest and conscientious study is disturbed by others who, coming to the school under 
the pretense of pupils, annoy teacher and school alike. Surely the substantial benefit 
derived from a school carried on under cir¢umstances such as have been described can 
not be very great, and can not and ought not to warrant the board in the expenditure 
of any considerable sum of money.’’ 
Turning to more encouraging fields, we find that in St. Paul, Minn., ‘‘the general 
success of these schools for the past four years has made them a permanent feature in 
the educational system of this city.’’ In Boston, ‘‘the order in these schools is now 
almost universally good. * * * Itis now possible to introduce considerable 
fication into the elementary ‘schools, thus utilizing to better advantage the teaching 
force.”” 
During the past few years, the night schools of Philadelphia, Pa., have greatly in- 
creased in usefulness as the result of wiser and more faithful management, and this has 
so commended them to the city councils that the appropriation of $10,000 for 1880 has 
steadily advanced to the sum of $35,000 for 1886. 
In the annual examination of the 27 evening schools of New York City, it was found 
that all but 1 were managed excellently; and of the 237 classes, 190 received excellent 
instruction, and 45 good; the discipline was excellent in nearly all the classes. The 
average attendance was 7,251, out of an enrolment of 19,832. 
Springfield and New Bedford, Mass., may be cited as instances of smaller cities in 
which evening schools have been successfully conducted. In the last report of the for- 
mer is found: ‘‘In both of these schools during the last two winters, as well as in the 
new evening school this season at Ouk street, work has been done that would compare 
favorably with many day schools.’ 
The evening school committee of New Bedford say: ‘‘The favorable anticipations in 
which we indulged a year ago in reviewing the work of the evening schools have crystal- 
lized into realities to-day, and we report with pleasure that the generousand enlightened 
action of the school board, in anticipating and supplying the wants of these schools, has 
been met by a full appreciation and use of the aids aifforded. e have passed the day 
    of experiment, and, on a broad and firm foundation, are building up our evening school 
system.’’ 
Even in those cities in which the success of these schools is assured irregular at- 
4) dance i is a great evil, which it seems to be impossible to overcome. Careful investi- 
gation on the part of the associate superintendents of the Brooklyn, N. Y., schools, led 
 
-P-A-G-E-246
      246 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87, =~ ‘ 
to the conclusion that the rapid decline which is seen every year may he traced to the 
following causes: - 
“First. Indifference on the part of parents. 
‘Second, Difficulty of notifying parents,who are nob indifferent,when their children 
are absent. 
‘Third. Admission of persons who seek amusement rather than instruction. 
‘Fourth. Retention of such persons until the demoralization caused by their conduct 
has driven many more desirable pupils from school. 
‘Fifth. Admission of pupils without the imposition of proper conditions as to regu- 
larity and continuance of attendance, or without the exaction of trustworthy guarantees 
that such conditions shall be respected. 3 : 
“Sixth. Discouragement of pupils consequent upon finding themselves graded lower 
than they think they should be. 4 
“Seventh. Dissatisfaction of individual pupils on account of the time devoted to 
studies which they consider of little value.’’ 
Of the plans of improvement suggested, the majority have been directed toward the 
removal of the third cause mentioned above. Upon the supposition that only those who 
appreciate the advantages offered them will comply with the condition, the Worcester, 
Mass., committee ‘‘ have decided to require a deposit of $1 from each pupil, as a guar- 
antee of promptness; it will be refunded at the close of the term to those whose attend- 
ance has been satisfactory.”” This plan has proved to be quite efficacious, and has been 
copied in other cities. 
An admission fee is used to keep out the undesirable element in Newport, R. I., and 
in some places a written pledge of good behavior and regular attendance has been re- 
quired of each pupil, with good effect. The objection urged against the ‘‘ admission 
fee’ plan is that such a school is ‘‘ not free.”” If the object of this and similar plans is 
to keep from the schools all save the earnest and studious, the plan in operation at 
Oshkosh, Wis., may commend itself. There each pupil pays $1 per month tuition, but 
with an enrolment of 80, the average attendance is 60. ‘‘ The results are satisfactory,” 
and the percentage of attendance is quite as high as in the average day school.

ALABAMA. 
Anniston.—Though the condition of the city’s finances made it necessary to reduce the 
teaching force in the fall of 1886, the prospect for greater usefulness. has recently been 
increased by the appropriation of $10,000 for the erection of a handsome four-room 
edifice. | ’ 3 ‘ 
Birmingham.—In a new city like this it can not be expected that the schools will make 
as favorable a showing as those of older cities, and it is not surprising to find an unusu- 
ally low percentage of average attendance. In view of the many difficulties encountered, 
the working of the system has been remarkably smooth and harmonious, A consider- 
able sum has been spent for additional accommodations. 
Decatur.—The school system is in its infancy, having been organized this year, A 
small tuition fee is necessary, to supplement the amount received from taxes, to prevent 
' the schools from falling behind financially. 
Huntsville has a graded school in a new, spacious, and comfortable building. 
Montgomery has expended considerable money during the past year in furnishing new 
buildings and furniture for the schools, and now owns one of the finest and best arranged 
‘school buildings in the South. The course of study is about the same as last year, ex- 
cept that physiology and supplementary reading receive more attention than before. An 
important change was made in the administration of the schools during the year, by 
which the board of education was abolished, and the city council assumed direct control 
of the affairs of the system. ‘ 
Talladega.—The system is a new one, having been organized at the beginning of the 
year just passed, The course of instruction at present covers only 6 years, but its ex- 
tension is contemplated. Lack of suitable quarters was the greatest difficulty experi- 
enced during the year; ample provision has been made, however, for both white and 
colored children for the ensuing term. One building recently completed cost $15,000. 
-  Pusealoosa.—The number of children in attendance has increased nearly 50 per cent. 
over last year, and the cost of maintaining the schools was nearly $2,000 more. Vocal 
music and industrial branches ave desired. This city, also, is building a handsome brick 
school-house which will cost $20,000.

ARKANSAS. 
Hot Springs schools, though lacking the supervision of a superintendent, have made 
fine progress during the last five years. -The board of directors and the principals of 
the schools have been earnest and thorough in the discharge of their duties, and the 
system is efficient and prosperous. A high school was established at the beginning of 
the year, opening with 44 scholars. ‘Two of these graduated in May last. A reason- 
ably complete laboratory and improved desks and seats, have been provided for this 
school, and its results have been highly satisfactory. One of the buildings of the board 
has been enlarged; the total seating capacity of the schools is now 950. The limit of 
indebtedness fixed by the constitution of the State is such that the usual expedient, the 
sale of bonds, cannot be resorted to for the erection of new school-houses. 
CALIFORNIA. 
San José, —The financial condition of the school system is excellent; though the city 
tax rate for schools is less than half the rate of 1884, the amount on hand at the end of 
the year was considerably larger. In regard to the kindergarten in operation during the 
year much difference of opinion exists; it is plain, however, that it is not appreciated 
as its merits deserve, and no demand exists for the extension of its facilities. An im- 
portant step has been taken in the establishment of a library in each ward school. 
‘San Francisco.—While the appropriations for the last year were more liberal than for 
several years past, the funds at the disposal of the school department were far from ade- 
quate to meet its pressing wants. Not only has the city fallen in arrears in the payment 
of its teachers, but it has failed to supply such buildings and school appliances as are 
necessary for the proper instruction of the children, The system of inspection inaugu- 
rated a few years ago has been an instrument of great good in the schools, Provision 
has been made for a limited amount of kindergarten work in the lower grades. The 
readers and arithmetics of the State series ave already been adopted. These books 
will be sold to pupils at the actual cost of publishing; earnest endeavors will be made 
to make the experiment successful. Yearly written examinations have recently been 
dispensed with, and all promotions are now made by the principals and class teachers, 
subject to appeal to the superintendent by parents dissatisfied with the non-promotion 
of their children. 
COLORADO. 
. Aspen.—The course of study and regulations of the schools were revised at the begin- 
ning of the year. The new.course provides twelve years’ study, three of which are to 
be devoted to the high school. 
CONNECTICUT. ' 
Bridgeport.—To provide for the increased number of children in West End, a building 
capable of accommodating 2U0 scholars has been rented. The increased number of 
teachers has made it possible to give more attention to individual pupils, and kept many 
from falling out of the classes. Evening schools for young men only were open during 
the winter. 
Bristol.—A. high school, established at the last meeting of the town, began its opera- 
tions at the opening of the spring term, with 77 scholars. Its teachers are capable and 
its prospects flattering. By a recent vote of the school committee there may be, in ad- 
dition to the regular branches laid down in the course of study, exercises in declamation, 
reading, and composition, at the discretion of each teacher. In the methods of teaching 
reading and geography special improvement is noticeable. ¥ 
Enfield.—The school-houses are in good condition, since considerable attention was 
paid to their improvement during the year. The three high schools lack efficiency, and 
should be consolidated. It is proposed to begin the teaching of music and to improve 
the character of the instruction in penmanship, during the next year, 
Greenwich reports show that the last has not been a year of satisfactory progress; 
indeed, many of the schools have fallen below their usual standard. For 17 years the 
public schools have not been as poorly attended as during 1886-87. This fact was 
mainly due to the opening of two private schools, one controlled by Catholics, the other 
by Germans, which took large numbers of children of these classes from the public 
schools. = 
Hartford.—The new buildings erected during the year, and the improvements in the 
hygienic condition of the old ones, have done much to advance the character of the school 
accommodations of the city. Irregularity of attendance had grown to be such an_evil 
that, in order to stop it, a rule was made that no absence or tardiness may be excused 
except upon a physician’s certificate that such absence or tardiness was caused by illness, 
A new course has been opened in the high school, embracing book-keeping, commercial 
arithmetic, instruction in business forms and commercial law as far as practicable.

  248 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. ~ 
This course was adopted in May for a year on trial, and as far as can now be judged, is 
going to prove a success. Again this year two evening schools have been conducted, 
oue of which was partly supported by private funds; only a moderate degree of success 
was attained in either. A kindergarten established in one of the districts has been a very 
successful experiment. 
Manchester.—Some of the school-houses have been very much improved in appearance 
and conveniences. Sufficient attention isnot paid to regular attendance by either teach- 
ers or parents. 
Meriden.—Vhe greatest needs of the schools are the abrogation of the district system, 
and the employment of a regular superintendent. The course of study is too much en- 
® cumbered with details, and should be abridged in order that essentials may be more thor- 
oughly mastered. The study of music was introduced a year ago, and has been taught 
by the regular teachers with at least moderate success. ‘The evening school of the past 
year was an experiment, and though not entirely s: factory, it has met with greater 
success than usually falls to the lot of such schools, showing an average attendance of 
249 out of a total enrolment of 498. 
Midd-etown.—Noteworthy improvement in the matter of tardiness is reported. The 
attendance shows an increase except in the high school, where a falling off is noticed. 
Buildings are in good order, necessary repairs having been made. 
New Britain.—The number enrolled this year was less by 109 than in 1885-86, a dif- 
ference explained by the increased attendance in the parochial and private schools. The 
evening school constantly increases in its usefulness. 
New Haven.—Increased attention to mechanical industry is the most important of 
the changes mentioned in the reports from this city. After considerable difficulty in 
procuring suitable rooms and a competent teacher for the new wood-working school, 
satisfactory arrangements were at last completed. The shop was properly fitted up and 
instruction was begun to 10 classes of 24 boys each at the opening of the school year. 
The boys were selected, by the principals of the various schools, from the two highest 
grammar grades, with the understanding thatif they failed to maintain their records in _ 
their regular studies they were to be dropped from the carpentry class. A systematic 
course of lessons was given, each class receiving instruction covering two hours in every 
week of the term. Good results are already noticeable, and decided gain of the pupils 
in manual power is manifest. Two thousand five hundred girls receive weekly lessons 
in sewing; several of the teachers state that the girls under them have perceptibly im- 
proved in deportment and tidiness since beginning the course. Some 3,660 garments 
have been made. An ungraded school, formerly used as a truant school, has been dis- 
continued, but to avoid the evil results of such action, incorrigibles are sent to other 
ungraded schools. The evening schools. suffer from irregular attendance, an evil at- 
tributed largely to the inexperience of the teachers. The training schools have grown in 
fivor with the graduates of the high school, and it may soon be possible to supply the 
demand for new teachers with home talent. The high school building is filled to its 
ulmost capacity. Something has been done toward improving the curriculum of this 
school; a course in English, covering two years, has been carefully planned, and the 
discussion of current events introduced as a part of the regular daily programme. The 
works of standard authors are being generally introduced as supplementary to the school 
reading books. A new course of study prepared by the superintendent and a committee 
of teachers has been adopted. 
New London.—During the year just passed the health of the children has been excel- 
Jent and the attendance in the schools larger than ever before; the corps of teachers has 
been slightly enlarged in consequence. Success in drawing has not been as uniform as 
jn some-other studies. The school houses are in better condition than they haye been 
for years past. The erection of new buildings, aggregating $25,000 in cost, has been rec- 
ommended by the board of education and the common council, and the appropriations 
therefor will doubtless be made at the next town meeting. 
Norwich.—Unusual prevalence of children’s diseases prevented the attendance this 
year from coming up to the standard of 1885-86, and the enlargement of the private 
schools lessened the enrolment of the city schools by 111. The teachers are interested 
in their work, and generally employ excellent methods. The houses and premises have 
been put in good repair. 
Portiand.—The showing made by the census this year does not compare favorably 
with that of last year. The enumeration is 39 less, and there are 5 more children not 
in school. The instruction and the character of the schools is good. ‘Two entertain- 
ments were given during the year by the school of District No. 1, netting nearly $50, 
wuich sum was expended for scientific apparatus and books for the library. The attend- 
ace in District No. 2 was reduced by the prevalence of scarlet fever during the last-term) 
ofthe year. Of the buildings, 2 are classed good, 4 fair, and 2 poor. 
. Rockville. —The irregular attendance of the pupils is the greatest obstacle in the way 
of success. A parochial school has been opened during the year with over 300 pupils,

drawn largely from the overcrowded primaries and intermediate departments of the east 
district. 9 
Stafford. —The schools have enjoyed more than their usual measure of prosperity during 
the year just passed. Improvement is apparent in the efficiency of the teachers and in 
the quality of the work done. 
DELAWARE. 
Wilmington.—There were no radical changes during the year. The work of the schools 
went on steadily and with quiet energy. The attendance has not been so good as last 
year, though the total enrolment was 137 more. It is expected that opportunity will 
soon be offered for the pursuit of high school studies in the colored schools. The build- 
ings appear to be good, supplied with good furniture, and generally well heated, but ven- 
tilation is obtained by most approved methods in but few of them. 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
Washington.—The liberal provision of Congress for the erection of 7 new buildings will 
relieve to a considerable extent the unfortunate state of affairs shown in previous re- 
ports. But even these extensive additions to the school facilities of the city will fall far 
short of supplying the whole amount of desk room absolutely needed. This may be 
more readily understood when it is stated that 134 of the 400 white schools were lim- 
ited to half-day sessions last year, and in the division embracing the colored schools the 
proportion of those for whom half-day sessions. only were possible, was even larger. 
This condition of affairs was not confined to the lower grades, but even in the high 
school 150 of the pupils were unavoidably denied the-privileges of the school, except for 
a half of each day of the. school year. Six night schools were in session 52 evenings 
each, with an average attendance of about a thousand, nearly equally divided between 
the white and colored races; the good that these schools do is unquestioned. The past 
year is particularly notable as that in which manual training was first introduced in the 
schools of the city. The appropriation for the purpose was sufficient only to equip a 
school of carpentery in the high school building. Two hundred and twenty-five boys 
elected to take the course arranged. ‘‘ The time devoted to the work was not sufficient 
to produce any marked results, but it is certain that it did not hinder the general progress 
of any boy who engaged: in it, and it is equally certain that the influence of the work 
was beneficial in various ways in the school.”” The appropriation of $5,000 for the pur- 
pose of industrial training for the next year has rendered a considerable enlargement of 
facilities for such work possible. It is proposed to establish three new shops in addition 
to that in operation during the past year. Instruction will be given in bench work, 
lathe working, moulding, and forging. Besides these four shops for boys, two cooking 
schools will be established. It is estimated that 1,300 pupils, male and female, may be 
trained, These will be taken from the classes between the seventh grammar grade and 
the last year of the high school. A clause in the appropriation bill restricting the 
number of teachers receiving salaries of $900 or more has caused considerable inconven- 
ience, and the uncertainty as to the intent of the restriction has given rise to some anx- 
iety. Very much to the dissatisfaction of the teachers, the appropriations for the year 
were not sufficient to make the usual annual increases in the salaries of new teachers, 
except for those receiving less than $500 per annum. ‘‘The abolition of the annual ex- 
aminations at the close of the term for advancement to the high school, and the substi- 
tution instead of the average standing maintained during the year, has proven wholly 
beneficial.” 
  GEORGIA. 
Americus.—Aitendance during 1886-87 was not as good as in the year before; an excep- 
tionally severe winter and the prevalence of measles of a virulent type for a considerable 
time, are adduced as causes. 
Athens.—This was the first year of organized school work. Five buildings were se- 
eured early in the year for the use of the schools until the completion of the two 10- 
room brick buildings that were at once provided for by the city council. Great care 
was taken in the selection of teachers, and an enthusiastic and well qualified corps of 
instructors was secured. All the desks and equipments provided are of the best obtain- 
able, and are abundant in quantity. Not only is the city government earnest and gen- 
érous in the support of the schools, but the citizens as well have shown their interest by 
donating $1,000 for the establishment of a library. Despite the disadvantages surround- 
ing an entirely new system, signal success has attended the year’s work. 
Atlanta.—This has been the most prosperous year in the history of the schools. The 
health of the city has been excellent, and no epidemic has interfered with school work. 
In'the general appearance of the children there has been noticeable improvement; they are 
better clad and neater in appearance than ever before; nor is as much trouble experienced 
in having parents provide necessary books asformerly. The schools are well established

  and the teachers proficient. ‘The great need of the gystem seems to be more school 
houses. The high schools are not prouaey: housed, and the accommodations for the col- 
ored pupils are not adequate. 
Columbus has solved the problem of ‘‘supernumeraries’”’ by the employment of a regu- 
lar assistant teacher, who shall supply vacancies when they occur, and, when not so en- 
gaged, shall assist the regular teachers, devoting one day ata time to each teacher. The 
seating capacity of certain primary grades being insufficient, it was necessary to resort 
to half-day sessions. Supplementary readers were introduced in January, and give 
much satisfaction. The plan of teachers’ meetings has been changed, so that now 
meetings of the teachers in the several schools are held regularly, and alternate with the 
meetings of the entire body of teachers. The enrolment this year was larger than ever 
before, and the schools were conducted at an unusually low cost per scholar. 
Grifin.—The public school system established two years ago has steadily grown in pub- 
lic favor. A department has been opened during the year for the teaching of high school 
branches. 
Macon school accommodations have been incréased by two additional rooms, one of 
whieh was built with funds raised by the efforts of the teachers. Five teachers more 
than last year are now employed, and the enrolment exceeds that of 1885-86 by 306, 
The colored pupils will soon be supplied with all needed accommodations by the erec- 
tion of a large new building upon a lot already provided. The bodrd of education con- 
trols not only the city schools but those of the county, and are thus compelled to divide 
their attention between the two distinct system’. A great deal of time must be given 
to the country schools by the superintendent, and in order that this may be done with- 
out injustice to those of the city, an assistant has been provided. 
Rome.—The chief want of the system is proper accommodations for the colored schools; 
the limited and somewhat embarrassed condition of the city’s finances has made it im- 
possible to provide for them properly. 
Savannah.—The work of the year has been more than usually successful. Considera- . 
ble increase has been made in the school accommodations of the city, and quite an addi- 
tion has been made to the number of the out-of-town schools controlled by the board, 
An additional story has been built upon one city school-house, a two story addition has 
been erected to another, and a building containing 21 rooms and a large hall, formerly 
used as a hotel, has been purchased and converted into acommodious school-house. With 
these, all complaints of overcrowding must cease. Corporal punishment has been for- 
bidden, and after a year’s trial the teachers differ widely as to the advisability of the 
step, but the superintendent is convinced that the general deportment of the scholars has 
been better than before. An assistant teacher has been employed for each grammar 
school, so that the principal may be able to devote more time to the supervision of other 
grades than his own. The number of high school scholars is greater than usual, neces- 
sitating an additional teacher. 
IDAHO. 
Boisé City estimates its school property to be worth $60,000. The instruction given 
embraces both the elementary and the higher branches. The total enrolment last year 
was 603, and the average attendance 506. 
Lewiston has a fine 6-room school-house, furnished with modern appliances, the total 
cost of which was about $10,000. 
ILLINOIS. 
Aurora,—A considerable sum has been expended for furnaces and general repairs. The 
school census shows that only 22 persons between 8 and 14 years of age attend no school, 
and only 2 between 12 and 21 can neither read nor write. The attendance has been 
fairly good during the year. 
Belleville teachers are not as well paid as they deserve, but suflicient explanation’ of 
this may be found in the fact that the system is under the cloud of a large bonded debt, 
upon which a considerable sum must be annually paid as interest. With an enrolment 
200 less, the average attendance was fully up to that of 1885-86, though the city was 
visited by an epidemic of measles during the year. A new building is being erected, 
_ which, when completed, will have cost $25,000. It will supply all accommodations 
needed for some time. 
Bement.—The grade of the school work has been perceptibly raised during the past 
year, and the scholars have improved in deportment and punctuality. 
Cairo schools are crowded, and new buildings are urgently needed. Owing tolimited 
accommodations for the high school, further additions to its library have been impossible. 
‘This school was recently placed on ‘the list of those whose graduates are entitled to ad- 
mission to the University of [ilinois without examination. The general sanitary ¢on- 
dition of the buildings in use is bad; out-houses and closets need immediate attention.

Elgin.—The course of study of the high school has been lengthened one year, and in 
consequence, the graduating class this year numbered only 5. ¢ 
Freeport.—All the school record books have been destroyed, and no statistical or other 
report can be made. 
Hyde Park is proud of a handsome new high school building, completed during the 
year. ‘‘ Great pains were taken tohave its arrangement, heating, ventilation, light, and 
construction as perfect as experience and modern science could suggest.’? 
Joliet. —The board owns 10 buildings, of which 7 are of stone and 3 of wood; 2 of the. 
latter have weill-nigh outlived their usefulness. The supply does not equal the demand for 
seats, and it will soon be necessary to provide more ample accommodations. The 
grounds need attention. Industrial work is encouraged by holding annually an ‘in- 
dustrial fair”? for the exhibition of the handiwork of the pupils. A small admission 
fee is charged, and the receipts are distributed among the children as prizes. The 
schools every year, for the last 5 years, made an exhibit at the State fair, and have in 
that time secured $250 in cash premiums and 18 diplomas. The work of the high 
school is fair. Changes have been suggested in its course of study which will tend to 
improve it. A two years’ business course is proposed. mie 
Moline.—The school board appreciates the value of ample accommodations, and has 
nearly completed a substantial new building of 8 rooms, which is expected to furnish 
all the room needed forseveral years. As a precaution against fire, as well as to conduce 
to the health and conyenience of the pupils, city water has been introduced in several 
    
of the buildings. A new form of repdrts to parents has been adopted, in which figures _ 
have been discarded, and words used instead, to show the pupils’ standing; the plan gives 
satisfaction to parents and relieves the teachers of much unnecessary work. The fourth 
annual handcraft exhibit held in April last was more successful than any of its prede- 
cessors. é 
- Perw schools have a manual training department, in which wood working and sewing 
are taught. 
Quincy school board has reduced its permanent indebtedness to $1,000, and hopes to 
still further materially decrease it during the next year. Improvements have been made 
in several houses, and steam heat was introduced in one. The numberof parishschools 
in Quincy is quite large fora city of its class, and the percentage of enrolment in the 
public schools to the school population is relatively small for that reason. For fully 
half the year epidemics of measles and scarlet fever have prevailed, seriously affecting 
the enrolment, attendance, and school work generally. The year, therefore, is consid- 
ered an unsatisfactory one, though much good work was done. 
Sterling.—The last has been a profitable year, with little interruption of the routine 
work of the schools from any cause. In March an ‘exposition’? was held under the 
auspices of the teachers’ association of the county, which developed, among others, the 
fact that the improvement of the children in drawing has been remarkable. 
INDIANA. 
Bluffton schools appear to be well organized and successful. An exposition of school 
work held during the year was decidedly satisfactory as an initiatory effort. 
Cambridge.—The work of the schools is laid out gvith great exactness. A great deal 
of attention is paid to the study of the English language. 
Orawfordsville seems to have solved the problem of punctual attendance, for with 1,293 
pupils enrolled, not a single. case of tardiness is reported. The regular publication of 
lists of ali pupils perfect in attendance has been an important aid in bringing about this 
result. It has been possible during the year to eliminate the ninth year from the gram- 
mar school course. This extra year had been added because, with the short sessions 
made necessary by limited appropriations, it was impossible to properly prepare pupils 
for the high schools in the usual 8 years. 
Crown Point also reports great improvement in the matter of promptness, the tardy 
record having been reduced from 753 in 1883, to 79 in 1887, The schools made a credit- 
able exhibit at the recent National Educational Exposition in Chicago. The buildings 
and premises were never before in such a perfect state of repair; they will supply all de- 
mands for several years to come. 
Decatur.—The new building did much to increase the success of this year’s work, since 
its arrangement is such that school government was rendered comparatively easy; and 
its excellent system of ventilation had a beneficial effect upon the health of the pupils. 
Every room available is crowded beyond its capacity; the city needs more teachers and 
more buildings. 
Frankfort.—Since the completion of the new 8-room building at the begiining of the 
year, the number of sittings has exceeded the number enrolled by over 200. Abundant 
accommodation is thus guaranteed for all pupils that may seek admission for a year or

two, at least, Much good has come of the teachers’ efforts to stimulate in the scholars 
a love of good reading 
Hagerstown.—The finances of the school board are in excellent condition. Theschool 
is liberally supplied with chemical and physical apparatus. 3 
Knightstown has a thoroughly organized and well-graded school with a course of study 
covering 12 years. 
Michigan Oity.—The crowded condition of some of the rooms made it apparent at the 
beginning of the year that more room was essential for the proper prosecution of school 
work, Accordingly, a dwelling house was purchased and converted by a series of alter- 
ations into aschool house. The study of language received more attention this year than 
formerly. 
Peru.—The feature of the system is the careful and systematic study of English liter- 
ature, extending through the whole course. German may be taken up in the fourth 
year, and when begun must be continued throughout the course. The high school may 
issue certificates of admission to the freshman class of the State University without ex- 
amination at that institution. 
Plymouth.—The work of the year has been pleasant and successful, with improvement 
in registration, attendance, and punctuality. Only 22 cases of tardiness occurred, and 
in nearly every instance the offense was committed by new scholars. An excursion to 
Chicago was given to the pupils and their parents, in addition to the regular commence- 
ment exercises at the end of the year. 
Richmond school statistics do not make so favorable a showing as last year, either in 
the percentage of enrolment to school population or in the tables of attendance. Much 
valuable apparatus has been added to the physical and chemical laboratories, and 30 fine 
microscopes have been procured for the use of the classesin botany and zodlogy. Draw- 
ing has been taught under the supervision ef a specialist for 2 years, and the progress 
made during that time has been remarkable. The plan of semi-annual promotions has 
also been in operation two years, and all expectations of improvement through its agency 
have been fully realized, 
Rochester.—A step has been made towards manual training by the introduction of 
drawing and clay modelling. ' 
Rockville.—The half-day system has been adopted for the first-year pupils, and has 
proved even more success{ul than the all-day plan. Drawing and music have been taught 
for 3 years, the former with success; the latter with such meager results that it.is rec- 
ommended that it be discontinued as a branch unless a special teacher can be secured. 
South Bend.—The ‘school fair’? held during the year was highly gratifying in its re- 
sults, and furnished the means with which to establish a reference library in each build- 
ing. The library and museum of the high school have received important additions 
during the year. Two flourishing literary societies, each of which supports a paper, are 
aids to this school. The progress in music has been very gratifying. ‘ 
Vincennes.—Particular attention is paid to supplementary and sight reading. Ger- 
man is optional, and may be begun after the second year. The high school instruction 
embraces an English and a Latin course. 
Warsaw.—The cost per pupil of the schools for the year 1886-87 has been slightly in 
advance of that for the previous year, principally because more experienced teachers 
were employed, at the maximum salary. The number of ‘‘tardies’’ has been reduced 
to a very low point, but the number of those absent a half day was so great as to lead 
to a suspicion that the sentiment against tardiness has grown to be an evil rather than 
a means for good. 
Washington.—While the schools have not yet attained the highest standard of effi- 
ciency, they are constantly improving. A good beginning has been made towards a 
school library, and the excellent plan prevails of requiring each child who reads a book 
to write an essay upon it. The main building is undergoing repairs. 
IOWA. 
Council Blug’s.—The financial year has been changed, and now ends August 31, instead 
of December 31, as formerly. 
Dubuque.—German is taught as an optional in the grammar grades, and outside of 
the regular school hours by special teachers. It is, however, a part of the regular high 
school course. The system utilizes 72 rooms for the graded schools and 1 for an un- 
graded school. 
Jowa City high school arranges its studies in three distinct courses, with considerable 
latitude allowed to students in the choice of studies in the last year. A course of read- 
ing is prescribed in connection with the English course. 
Lyons.—The system of grades and the course of study were amended before the be- 
ginning of the school year. The new course is arranged to cover 11 years, but under 
certain circumstances special promotions may be made, thereby lessening the time.

Muscatine.—The opening of the schools at the beginning of the year was delayed three 
wecks onaccountof the alarming prevalence of diphtheria. Forsome time after the open- 
ing the attendance in the lower classes was very scant, and the work done was of a frag- ” 
mentary nature. The higher grades made quite as good progress as usual during the 4 
year. : 
Oskaloosa.—-An exhii it in May of the handiwork of the school children excited a great 
deal of interest, It was the largest ever made by the children, and was regarded as a 
success and of great educational value. In addition to the usual teachers’ meetings, 
weekly ‘‘grade meetings’ have been introduced, affording opportunity-for consultation’ vi 8 
of teachers of like grade. These have been productive of much good. Prevalence of 
measles among the pupils of the primary grades. caused some interruption of the work 
of these grades in the spring, but when the epidemic subsided, the loss was almost, if not 
wholly, made up through the extra efforts of the teachers. The museum of the high 
school has received important additions, Music is skillfully taught by a specialist. 
Oltumwa.—Especial attention is paid to English in the high school; the writings of 
standard authors are critically read and discussed inclass.. Singing, drawing, and pen- 
manship are studied throughout the entire course. 
West Des Moines. —The most gratifying improvement noted is that of the high school; 
at the beginning of the year its course was carefully and judiciously revised, and its 
work put on a broader and more practical basis. A pupil may now choose a 2-, 3-, or 4- 
year course, or, under proper restrictions, may arrange a course tosuit himself. Theen- 
rolment of boys in this school has increased wonderfully, and is now 30 per cent. more 
than for either of the last 5 years. So great has been the influx that the building is 
overcrowded, and more accommodations are demanded. An evening school was opened 
for the first time in the city in November last, and its enrolment speedily increased from 
85 to 131. It was in session four and a half months, and its success was such that it is 
now considered a permanent branch of the system. Kindergarten methods are em- 
ployed in three of the buildings, and continue to find favor with the patrons of the 
schools. A manual training school is earnestly desired, and lack of funds is the only 
aindrance that prevents its estalishment. Twonew sites have been bought during the 
year, and $15,000 have been spent in providing heating apparatus for four buildings. 
Four new rooms have been opened, and the number of sittings increased to 3,540. 
      KANSAS. 
Atchison.—Low assessments caused the shortening of the school year by two months, 
and made it necessary to readjust the course in order that it might be completed in the 
shortened time. Despite this, inclement seasons, and the prevalence of disease, the ex- 
tra efforts of the teachers accomplished good results. For reasons economic and hygienic, 
the first year pupils will in future attend school only ahalfof eachday. The highschool 
has been reorganized and the course graded and extended. There are now two courses, 
one of which is intended for those preparing for college, and the other for those whose 
school life will end with the high school. During the year a literary and musical en- 
tertainment was given by the pupils, netting over $80. 
Clay Centre.—The schools are crowded in all the grades, and in the primary schools it 
-has been necessary to exclude all children under 6, and to make use temporarily of the 
half-day plan. A new 8-room building, soon to be completed, will remedy this con- 
dition of things. The attendance has been greater and more regular than in any previous 
year. 
Kansas City.—The school system is yet undergoing the process of formation, and can 
not be said to have done as good work as may be expected later. The city as at present 
constituted was recently formed by an act of the State Legislature, by the consolidation 
of three distinct corporations. A thorough reorganization of all the schools was neces- 
.Sary to secure a reasonable degree of uniformity. Complete order has not yet been 
evolved, but it is hoped that by the end of next year a well organized system may be se- 
cured. Some trouble was experienced in the sale of bonds on account of an old State 
Jaw, but a special act was obtained, which obviated the difficulty. 
Lawrence.—The schools ‘‘move forward without jar or confusion,” steadily growing 
in numbers and effectiveness every year. The belief expressed by many thatschool work 
is often beyond the powers of the children has induced the authorities to make a number 
of changes, ‘he primary schools have been in session only a half day ; studies have been 
arranged with a view of reducing home study to a minimum ; and an additional year has _ 
added to the course with but little increase in the work. 
Leavenworth.—A larger balance than usual remains in the hands of the treasurer this 
year, showing that the finances of the system are well cared for. The schools are 
crowded, and it will be necessary during the year to provide new houses, especially for 
the children living in the remote parts of thecity. A vacant building was leased for the 
use of the high school and occupied, but it being ill adapted to school purposes, no little

bse - inconvenience has resulted. Notwithstanding this drawback the school has done good 
work during the year; a small tuition fee is charged. 
iH Ottawa.—Though three more teachers were employed during the past year than-in 
ca _ 1885-86, the number of pupils in average attendance averaged 52 to each teacher. The 
half-day plan was adopted for the first-grade primaries and in other schools, but a rear- 
rangement of the grades made all day sessions again possible in all but the lowest classes. 
More attention has been g given to mental arithmetic, and some improvement has resulted. 
Topeka schools have been brought up toa high state of efficiency. That they have 
improved in attractiveness is shown by the fact that the average attendance has in- 
creased in greater ratio than the enrolment, and that tardiness hasdiminished, The in- 
troduction of drawing and music added much to the labor of the teachers, since it was 
necessary for them to qualify themselves to instruct in these branches, yet their work , 
has been highly commendable. Individual schools are encouraged to beautify their 
premises and to provide themselves with libraries and musical instruments; many of 
them are now quite well equipped in these respects. 
KENTUCKY. 
Hopkinsvitle.—The mildness of the last winter and the good weather that has gener- 
ally prevailed during the year have been very favorable to school work. Pupils and 
their parents do not appreciate the value of promptness, as the number of tardinesses 
shows. Drawing and vocal music were placed in the course of study this year. The 
heating apparatus is becoming old and defective, and the adoption of better methods of 
heating and ventilation is being discussed. 
Maysville.—The school board has abolished the office of superintendent of schools. 
Newport.—A new building, a model of convenience in all its appointments, was com- 
pleted January 1, and in two hours after its opening it was filled by over 500 pupils. 
‘The relief thus afforded to the other buildings made a thorough reclassification pos- 
sible, and all half-day classes were discontinued as such in all but two buildings. The 
high school is a source of especial gratification to the citizens. 
Owensborough is doing good work. edncaonally. - The citizens, by a ‘more than two- 
thirds vote, have increased the ad valorem tax for 2 years, in order to provide new school- 
houses. A $20,000 house has.already been erected. 
Paducah.—The regulations and course of study are undergoing revision. 
LOUISIANA. 
New Orleans schools receive an inadequate support. The appropriations made by the 
city are not in just proportion to those for other departments of the municipal govern- 
ment. The school houses are not what they should be in number or in quality, being 
not only badly crowded, but in some cases even unsafe. The teachers are poorly and 
irregularly paid. 
MAINE, 
Augusta.—Improvements over last year in many respects are noted. Fewer changes 
have been made in the teaching force, and the school year has been lengthened by two 
weeks. Teaching methods have also generally improved. Complaint is made against 
the district system; the supervisor states that it is impossible to obtain results commen- 
surate with the amount of labor and money expended. Changes have been made in the 
text-books.of arithmetic and grammar in use, the new books being considered far supe- 
rior to the old. An attempt has been made to make the English course in the high 
school more of a practical business course. The free text-book system has been in op- 
eration a year, and all advantages expected to result from it have been fuily realized. 
An evening gehool was requested by a class of 100 persons last winter, and the subject 
was brought up at a district meeting, but action was deferred, since the proper season 
for such schools had nearly passed. "Except during the prevalence of measles last fall 
the attendance has been better than ever before. This was undoubtedly due to the pas- 
sage of a more effective truant law by the city council and the employment of a truant 
officer. \ 
Bangor.—The prosperity of the schools is steadily advancing. This year’s class was 
the largest that ever graduated from the high school. Single-entry book-keeping has 
been introduced in the highest grammar grade. 
Caiais has been free from prevalent disease, but the average attendance for the year 
was only fair. When repairs already begun have been completed, the buildings will be 
in a very creditable condition. New stoves have been provided where needed, and the 
heating apparatus is, therefore, now generally good. Single seats have been substi- 
tutyl for the double desks in the high school—a. change for the better. 
Cape Elizabeth.—A review of the work done during the year discloses very gratifying 
results, The teachers have been cordially supported by the patrons of the schools, and 
no unfavorable incident has occured to mar the general harmony of their relations.

‘ : 
Decring has opened. two new schools, requiring the employment of four additional 
teachers, The average attendance for the year was lowered by the prevalence of con- 
tagious diseases incident to childhood. A year has been added to the grammar school 
course. 
Gardiner.—The free text-book system is being gradually introduced. The new 
$9,000 house is sufficient for all present needs of its section. With one exception, all 
the buildings are excellent. 
Lewiston.—The excellent condition of the schools is a matter of congratulation. The 
teachers are enthusiastic and well posted in educational matters, and the houses gen- 
erally area credit to the city. Their number has been augmented by the completion dur- _ 
ing the year of a neat and tasteful building of 6 rooms, which is to be used for primary and 
intermediate schools. Notwithstanding the excellent advantages that are offered to 
the pupils of the evening schools, only a small proportion of the 400 enrolled derived 
any benefit from their attendance; irregularity, the evil so common in such schools, was 
the cause. 
Portland.—The number of sittings has been considerably enlarged during the year. 
Five third-story rooms in different buildings have been fitted up for school purposes 
and will accommodate about 50 pupils each. An additional site has been purchased 
and a new house for a primary school begun upon it. Improvements are mentioned 
in the sanitation of the buildings ; in some cases still, however, sickness of teachers 
and pupils is charged directly to the bad hygienic condition of school-houses. The 
attendance of the pupils during the year has been excellent, and the deportment good, 
without too frequent resort to corporal punishment. The study of single-entry book-keep- 
ing has been introduced in the higher grades of the grammar schools, to take the place of 
exercises in penmanship. In the two months that have elapsed since the inauguration 
of the change it has proyed to be both interesting and profitable. A new system of 
teaching music has been introduced by the special teacher; it is highly spoken of. A 
school for the deaf is controlled by the city board, but is largely supported by the State, 
only $22 of the city appropriation having been used last year. 
Saco needs more schools, since those now established are badly crowded. Slight 
changes have been made in the list of text-books used in the high school, but some still 
in use were published over ascore of years ago. ; 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Adams schools are crowded and more buildings are needed. The need of an addi- 
tional teacher in the high school is so great as to impair the efficiency of the school. 
Double daily sessions have been necessary in thelower grades of some schools, and though 
first intended as a temporary arrangement only, no serious objection has been urged to 
the permanent adoption of the plan. ‘The percentage of attendance to school popula- 
tion, 75, is the highest ever reached in this city, 
Amherst.—Reduction of appropriations compelled the school committee to reduce the 
number of weeks of school and to neglect needed repairs upon school property. 
Arlington.—Harmony has distinguished the meetings of the board and the manage- 
ment of the schools. No material change has been made in the course, excepting the 
promulgation of a rule requiring the study of English three full years in the high school, 
‘The musical instruction is exceilent. School buildings are generally in good order, 
and the expense for repairs continues to be comparatively light. Thirty new desks have 
been bought for the high school. 
Altleborough.—The last was a year of quiet prosperity, during which no disturbance 
has occurred to excite public comment, as in former years. The excellent system and 
organization introduced by the superintendent has had the best opportunity yet afforded 
for showing its many advantages. So rapidly has the population of the town increased 
that there is again need of more school accommodations. 
Beverly.—The record of the year, as a whole, is a good one. A superintendent is 
needed to bring the system up to its best work. A new grammar school was opened at 
the beginning of the year, but its continuance is somewhat doubtful, since the number 
of children enrolled is not so largeas was expected. The entering class of the high school 
was unusually large this year, and necessitated the opening of a new class room. 
Boston.—The school committee have made only one considerable change in the course 
of study, and that in regard to arithmetic. The study has been abridged by omitting 
a number of subjects thought to be beyond the comprehension of children or of little 
practical good, and simplified by confining problems to small numbers and simple sub- 
jects and processes. The time has been shortened to from two to three and one-half 
hours per week. ‘The supervisors speak hopefully of the reduction now, though they 
opposed it at the time of its enactment. 
Blackstone.—The percentage of absenteeism and non-enrolment is entirely too large for 
the best good of the schools, and a potent cause of it is the lack of sufficient room in certain 
       
-P-A-G-E-256
    256 © EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
districts. Temporary quarters have been found for one new school in a church, and 40 
pupils are there accommodated. 
Bourne schools compare favorably with those of towns of similar size. Good discipline 
is secured with but little necessity for corporal punishment. 
Braintree.—As a rule the schools are well accommodated and the discipline is gen- 
erally excellent. The study of literature was systematically begun in the high school 
last fall. The wisdom of the free text-book system has already been proved, since it 
has resulted in a saving of time and money. 
Brockton.—The school buildings have been generally improved during the year. The 
method of employing janitors is such that they can not be compelled to attend to their 
duties properly, and a change is desired. Music is successfully taught, but no enthusi- 
asm is manifested in the study of drawing. The evening school is doing well. 
Brookline.—Lack of sufficient accommodations causes considerable trouble, and num- 
bers of transfers, involving some inconvenience to the children and a great deal of trouble 
to the school officers, have been necessary. A new building, however, is in course of 
erection, which will relieve the pressure. This building will be larger than any of those 
now standing, and will in addition furnish suitable rooms for industrial instruction. An 
experiment has recently been made, without cost to the town, of instruction in cooking. 
The plan has been successful as far as could have been expected, and the result of it is 
that the advisory board recommends the establishment of a vacation cooking school for 
girls, on the same plan as the vacation manual training school for boys. An evening 
school was opened in November and has continued so far with fair success, 20 scholars 
being in regular attendance. Slight changes have been made in the curriculum of the 
high school, less time being given to physical geography, and more to the study of English 
literature. Military drill has been introduced and has had good effect upon: the disci- 
pline of theschool. The number of teachers employed during the year is larger than ever 
before. 
Cambridge.—The system has lost an unusually large number of experienced teachers, 
whose resignations caused serious loss to the schools. The most important event of the 
year has been the division of the high school into two distinct schools. Of the 500 pu- 
pils, 335 remained, with 10 of the 15 teachers, in the old building, as the ‘‘ English High 
School.”” The others removed to a building specially fitted up for them and fo: med the 
“Latin High School.’’ Inthe English school the work in chemistry has beenextended to 
cover six months, and in physics to cover one year. Laboratories have been fitted up 
and pupils have been set to work under an experienced instructor. Latin is studied in 
this school for the first three years only; diplomas are given only after a full four years’ 
course. The ‘‘city school’? for pauper children has been transferred from the control of 
the school committee to that of the overseers of the poor, in order that manual training 
may be introduced without the specific appropriation which the city council failed to 
make. Seven classes of twelve boys each receive instruction in the use of tools in the 
‘rooms of the Cambridge Industrial Association. It is expected to make a trial of vaca- 
tion schools during the coming summer. Music and drawing are systematically tang it 
by specialists; decided improvement in the latter study is reported. The school com- 
mittee have no control over the janitors, consequently the buildings are not properly 
cared for; at one time it was necessary to close 20 rooms in the short period of eight 
days, because they were too cold to be occupied. 
Canton.—Through the generosity of one of its members, the board has been enabled 
to offer to the girls of the schools a course of lessons in cooking. One hundred and two 
pupils enrolled themselves as members of this class, and took lessons during school hours, 
making up the time thus lost from their regular studies. Besides the work done in 
class, the girls were encouraged to put into practical use at their homes the knowledge 
obtained; 2,557 dishes were thus repeated. The record shows that the instruction is 
such that it interests and holds the scholars, and so far from lessening the attainments 
of the pupils in other departments of school work, it tends to increase their interest in 
their regular studies. Instruction in sewing is also given by the approval of the board, 
but by ‘volunteer teachers and outside of “regular school hours. The no-recess plan 
adopted last year entails no hardship on the children, and gives general satisfaction. 
In the summer vacation all the buildings were thoroughly cleaned and put in good 
order, 
Chelsea.—The scale of salaries of all assistant teachers, excepting those of the high 
school and the specialists, has received a new adjustment, by virtue of which length of 
service, and not difference of grade taught, will be the standard of rank. German and 
zodlogy have been introduced in the high school, but otherwise the course of study re- 
mains practically the same as formerly. In vocal music the pupils are very proficient, 
a tact due largely to the enthusiasm of the teachers, many of whom received thorough 
musical training in the schools of the city. The laws respecting truancy are not :aliow 
gether effective. The evening schools have been in a measure successful, but irregu- 
larity of attendance is a serious hindrance. The drawing school is well conducted, and
-P-A-G-E-257

notwithstanding its poor and insufficient accommodations, the work produced is of a 
very high order. A large brick building will be completed in time for use in September, 
and will provide for the increase in the number of scholars, which is expected then. 
Chicopee.—The percentage of attendance shows a large increase, attributed to the plan 
recently instituted of giving a half holiday in each month to those perfect in attendance 
during that time. Thorough grading has been secured through the efforts of the super- 
intendent, who prepared the new and very effective course of study now in use. In 
the matter of charts, maps, and supplies of like kind, the schools were never better sup- 
plied than at present. ‘i 
Olinton.—The excellence of the heating arrangementsis a notable feature of the school 
buildings. Regularity of attendance was affected by the prevalence of scarlet fever. 
Danvers.—General improvement is noticeable, and in English and composition the 
progress is especially marked. The plan of examination for admission to the high school 
is believed to be faulty, and important changes are contemplated. The pernicious 
effects of competitive examinations for percentages are in future to be avoided by keep- 
ing the rank of the scholars secret. _The percentages will be used in the advancement 
of classes, but pupils will be told only if their standing is ‘‘good,’’ “fair,” or ‘bad.’ 
‘The classes of the high school are unusually large. 
Dedham.—Work of instruction in the high school has been carried on this year under 
serious disadvantages, but the completion of the building already begun will do much 
for the improvement of its condition, The attendance has been excellent—somewhat 
better than last year. The systematic study of music under a specialist was begun this 
year, and good results may even now be noticed. The evening school was conducted 
with a large but irregular attendance; it is notable that the average for the last week 
was the best attained. 
Everett.—Many unusual drafts have been made upon the funds of the school commit- 
tee during the year, and a deficit has resulted. The accommodations appear to be better 
than last year, as only one district complains of overcrowding. 
Fall River.—A special committee has been appointed to examine into the merits of 
the system of industrial education adopted in other cities and to report upon the adyisa- 
bility of its adoption here. A most encouraging sign of the progress of the teachers is 
found in the increasing popularity of periodicals devoted to professional subjects. ‘The 
primary schools form a particularly important part of thesystem. Though they require 
only 3 years’ study, they are attended by more children and require more teachers than 
all the other schools, which cannot be completed in less than 10 years. Single entry 
book-keeping has been introduced in the last year of the grammar school course, and has 
given the pupils excellent practice in penmanship, and some knowledge of business 
transactions without interfering with the other studies. ‘Twenty-one rooms for evening 
schools, each room in charge of two teachers, were opened in December last. The even- 
ing drawing schools are not attended as well as they should be. The importance of the 
study of music and drawing is appreciated, as is evidenced by the recent employment of 
special teachers for these branches. One of the finest high school buildings in the 
country has just been donated by a private individual, who also gave the school $50,000, 
the income of which will be applied to instruction in mechanical, chemical, and philo- 
sophical branches. 
Fitchburg.—With the growth of the city has naturally come a large increase in the 
number of scholars in the schools. During the year two new houses of two rooms each 
have been opened, and these, with the recently established Catholic parochial schools, 
have relieved the pressure in the portion of the city in which they stand. In other quar- 
ters, however, the crowding still continues. The school board has adopted a new 
schedule of salaries, based on length of service, putting a premium upon experience and 
continued service. The evening schools have not accomplished as much as their friends 
anticipated, for they have not been well graded, the attendance has been irregular, and 
experienced teachers could not be obtained. 
Framingham.—Among the improvements reported are a scientific laboratory with pro-    
  ‘vision for individual experiment, and 4 new school rooms. Interest in vocal music _ 
steadily increases. The number of teachers has been augmented. 
Franklin-has expended a considerable amount in improvement and repairs. The at- 
tendance for the year has not been up to the expectations of the committee, and the 
explanation is found in the eagerness of the children to earn money. 
Glouceste.—The year has been one of steady progress in school affairs, the suburban 
schools showing especial improvement. Parochial schools were opened in January, 
which withdrew a little over 200 scholars. from the public schools for the remainder of 
the year. This fact affords a reasonable explanation for the decreased enrolment and 
attendance shown by the statistics. An offer of kindergarten materials and a fund to 
partially defray the expenses of a public kindergarten was regretfully declined by the 
school committee, as the city could not arford the additional expense the acceptance of 
17 ED 
   
-P-A-G-E-258
  258 . EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. ° 
the offer would involve, The'old high school building, with all its furniture and appa- 
ratus, including the equipments of the military battalion, was consumed by fire in June. 
The city council has met the emergency by a liberal appropriation for a new building, 
immeasurably superior to the old one. ‘The new house will comfortably seat nearly 400 
upils. z 
z tiveat Barrington.—The principal schools are fuli to overflowing, and at the present rate 
of increase more buildings will soon be needed. The necessity for better supervision is’ 
felt, and a plan is suggested by which the principal of the high school may be supplied 
with an additional teacher and devote a part of his time to the supervision of the schools. 
Considerable difficulty is experienced from absence and tardiness. Special attention is 
paid in the high school to the study of local and national government and the duties of 
citizenship. In all the grades the instruction in mathematics is very thorough. 
Haverhiil.—The number of pupils connected with the schools during the year has been 
the largest in the history of the city. The affairs of the system have been economically 
administered, and the real cost per pupil was reduced by $1.70. The method of pro- 
motion has been altered and the daily work of the pupils and the judgment of the teacher 
will have an equal bearing with the two examinations. The no-recess plan was adopted 
for the primary and grammar grades, and after a trial of a year has proved itself to be a 
wise measure. The names on the registerof the evening school are constantly changing, 
and the result is little real progress. Excepting 2, the buildings are good; they will 
afford sufficient room for the increased numbers that will be enrolled in the fall. 
Holiiston.—The schools have been conducted during the past year without a superin- 
tendent ; attempts were made to join with some other town to secure one, but without 
success. Early in the year the committee arranged a more systematic course of study 
for the schools, and issued printed instructions forthe guidance of teachers. Instruction 
in music was more thorough and systematic than was possible in previous years. 
Hopkinton.—It is impossible to secure the best returns for the money expended under 
the circumstances that now prevail, since the districts are so numerous and small that 
effective organization cannot be secured. ‘The attendance during the past year was not 
all it should have been, one-seventh of the school time of the pupils having been lost by 
absence. 
Hyde Park.—By generous appropriations the committee has been enabled to main- 
tain in the schools a higher standard than usual this year. Fire-escapes and city water 
have been provided for the largest buildings, conducing both to the comfort and to the 
safety of the children. A number of carpenters’ benches with the necessary tools were 
presented to the committee by a public-spirited citizen, and with these an experimental 
school of carpentry was opened, and in a short session met with good success, resulting 
in the recommendation by the committee that it be made a permanent feature of the 
system. The evening school was conducted with success. 
Lee.—The school population of the town has constantly decreased for several years 
past, and naturally the school attendance has alsodiminished. A more marked falling 
off than usual, however, appears in the latter during the past year, as the result of the 
opening of a convent school. Instead of the lack of school room complained of in pre- 
vious reports, there is now more than is needed, and consolidation and reduction in the 
number of the schools will soon be in order. 
Leominster reports an improved condition of school buildings, and an enrolment in- 
creased by 150. Unforeseen contingencies have raised the expenses to several hundred 
dollars more than the amount received. Additional teachers and increased appropri- 
ations will be needed next year. 
Lowell.—The school committee complains bitterly of insufficient appropriations. The 
teachers are poorly paid, and the buildings in some districts are not adequate for the 
requirements of their localities, and many of them have become old, unhealthy, and 
useless. Music has not been a success, and little interest is manifested in the study. 
One thousand nine hundred scholars were instructed in the evening schools at a cost of 
$10,125. Six school-rooms and 4 teachers were added during the year. The equipment 
of the battalion of cadets has been greatly improved, and more interest than ever is 
shown in the military drills. 
Lynn.—The evil of truancy causes much trouble, and the establishment of a school 
for incorrigibles is recommended. Irregular attendance affects the work of some of the 
schools to an undesirable extent. Considerable attention has been given to the sanita- 
tion of the buildings, and in this respect their condition is better than ever before. Ad- 
ditional accommodations are needed. ‘This is especially true of the high school, where 
325 scholars are crowded in a building whose seating capacity is only 284. To provide 
the better for those scholars who expect to remain in the high school for 1 or 2 years 
only, it is proposed to establish an English high school, whose course of study shall be 
especially adapted to this class of students. The evening schools, especially those de- 
yoted to book-keeping and short-hand, are firmly established and successful. Special

instruction in penmanship has been discontinued, the regular teachers doing the entire 
work. A new system of teaching music was introduced this year, and has been highly 
successful. The subject of industrial training is under the consideration of a special 
committee. Its adoption is doubtful. : 
Marblehead has no superintendent, and the schools show the want of constant super- 
vision. The primary schools particularly are irregular in their instruction. The at- 
tendance is not as good as the best interests of the schools demand, and a truant school 
is sadly needed. : 
Medford,—A new building has been erected, which is the most inviting in appearance 
and the best appointed in the town. An appropriation is recommended for an evening 
school, none having hitherto been in existence here. 
Metrose.—The instruction given is of good quality, and the facilities for school work 
are excellent. The necessity for a superintendent becomes continually more apparent. 
Milford.—The division of the town and the incorporation of a part of it under a new 
name by an act of the Legislature took from the Milford school system four schools and 
considerably affected theschool statistics. ‘The evening schools are not successful, though 
every inducement is offered to secure regular attendance. Interest in drawing has been 
fully sustained. 
Montaque.—T wenty-¢ight per cent. of all the money expended by the town is devoted 
to the education of the children. A new high school has recently been established, and 
is doing well. 
Needham.—The regulations and course of study have been revised and printed for use 
at the beginning of 1887-88. 
Newburyport.—The schools are highly prosperous, the rooms well filled, and the pupils 
generally interested. ‘The high school isin a more satisfactory condition than for years 
past; the work done has been thorough and the discipline ‘excellent. During the year 
the teachers and scholats have established a library of 300 volumes, without cost to the 
town. 
North Adams.—After a series of transfers it has been possible to abandon two unde- 
sirable buildings, and, general repairs having been made on the others, the present school 
accommodations are better than ever before. Necessity no longer exists for a new school 
as at the latter part of last year, since a Roman Catholic school has been opened, draw- 
ing a considerable number of children from the public schools. Better success has been 
attained in the evening schools than inany previous year. Sufficient aid is not received 
by the teachers from the truant officers, 
North Brookjield has passed through a year of quiet, steady work with no great diffi- 
culties to contend against, and no unusualimprovements made. A school paper has been 
established and an entertainment given by the high school, for the purpose of buying a 
piano. 
Northampton is without proper arrangement for the confinement and instruction of hab- 
itual truants, and the law respecting them can be successfully resisted. All the school 
buildings, with a single exception, are in good repair and furnish comfortable accommo- 
dations. An evening school was opened with an enrolment of 84 pupils, but so irregu- 
lar was the attendance that not more than a dozen derived any real benefit from it, The 
evening draughting classes were quite successfully conducted. 
Northbridge.—The school work has been similar to that of previous years, presenting 
ne especial feature or noteworthy change. 
Peabody.—Both enrolment and attendance show increase over previous years. Greater 
thoroughness in instruction is desired, and with the object of securing this the commit- 
tee has directed that the length of the lessons be lessened. ‘The course in music used for 
several years is now being carried out with greater exactness than was ever before ob- 
tained. The need of a superintendent is felt. The building burned a short time since 
has been rebuilt with the money received from insurance. 
    sanitary condition of some of the houses is bad, and should receive immediate attention. 
Truancy has caused more trouble than ever before, a fact probably due to the failure of 
the judicial authorities to sustain the truancy regulations of the school committee. The 
efficiency of the drawing school has increased and a larger number of scholars have availed 
themselves of its privileges. 
Randolpk.—The corps of teachers still remains unchanged. The health of the children 
has been remarkable good, not a death having been reported. 
Rockland.—This has been a year of good, substantial work in the schools. The intro- 
duction of music in the primary schools has done much to enliven the work, and has 
been of great benefitto the children. The evening school has not been as successful this 
winter as last, the number in attendance being so small as to render the continuance of 
the school doubtful, eld schools are too small and too numerous to accomplish the best results. The :

  260 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87, 
Salem.—The study of book-keeping, and of physiology and hygiene, though authorized 
some time before, was begun this year in the grammar schools. . The second annual in-- 
dustrial exhibit of the children of one of the schools was highly creditable, and the judges 
were so well pleased that they contributed liberally to purchase a full set of carpenters’ 
tools for the use of the pupils of that school. 
Salisbury. —By an act of the State Legislature, a large portion of the town has been an- 
nexed to Amesbury, leaving only 6 schools instead of 20 under the control of the Salis- 
bury committee. 
Somerville. —The work of the grammar school has been curtailed in order that essen- 
tials may be more thoroughly mastered, and that the work may be accomplished, gen- 
erally, during school hours.’ A library has been selected and a catalogue prepared. An 
additional primary school has been established. Of the class entering the high school 
in 1882, 50 per cent. graduated last June and 25 per cent. have entered various colleges. 
‘Two new houses are being erected and will be finished during the coming summer. 
‘The cost of each will be $10,500, exclusive of land, heating apparatus, and furniture. The 
prevalence of truancy causes much solicitude. 
Southbridge.—The higher grades have been unfortunate in suffering from frequent 
changes in the teaching force. All the schools except the high school were in session 
one week longer than usual this year, increasing the expenditures by about $200.. A 
new course of study has been put in operation, which aims to be thoroughly practical as 
far as possible. Itis to be elastic, so that special promotions are permissible, and special 
students may be accommodated in the high schoo]. The houses are not in keeping with 
the requirements of the system. Their sanitary condition is bad, the heating apparatus 
defective, and the yards unattractive. The schools lack thorough discipline. 
Spencer is troubled with crowded primaries; some rooms that were intended for not 
more than 70 scholars have been packed with 100 or more, Drawing has been well taught 
by a special teacher, employed this year for the first time. 
Springfield.—The preparations for instruction in carpentry were completed at the be- 
ginning of the year, and 84 boys from the grammar and high schools volunteered to take 
the course of 15lessons. Oneanda half hours per week were devoted to the work, which 
was so arranged that no time was lost from the regular recitations... The school was suc- 
cessful to such an extent that the committee recommends that the city government in- 
erease the appropriation for this purpose from one to five thousand dollars, in order that 
manual education may be more extensively introduced, and upon a more satisfactory 
basis. The establishment of a kindergarten is being considered also. The schools gen- 
erally are not as efficient as they should be, and a great reason for their shortcomings is 
the badly overcrowded condition of so many of the rooms. The department system of 
teaching is on trial in one of the grammar schools, and its results have so far been quite 
encouraging. The evening schools are thoroughly organized and compare favorably with 
some of the day schools. 
Stoncham.—The general good condition of the schools is cause for congratulation, and 
to the earnest efforts of the teachers much credit is due. The discipline in the majority 
of the schools is very good. 
Taunton.—Floods during the spring reduced the percentage of attendance, but even 
had these not occurred the percentage would not have been as high as it might have been 
had parents been less lenient with their children. The hygienic condition of the build- 
ings has been investigated, and where defects were found the remedy was applied as far 
as possible. The cost of the free text-book system for the year has been $5,000—$1,000 
less than last year. The system, by the way, does not appear to give satisfaction here; 
the superintendent opposes it as taking too much of his time and that of the teachers. 
A scientific laboratory is being provided for the high school, $500 having been appro- 
priated for that purpose during the year. The evening and drawing schools are in good 
condition and are doing good work. ‘The high school offers four courses, with a consider- 
able range of electives. Flexibility is the distinguishing characteristic of the courses. 
Music is taught by a specialist and excellent results are attained. The superintendent’s 
report does not indicate a very high state of efficiency in the schools. 
Waltham.—Early in the year asub-committee of the board was appointed to investigate 
the subject of manual training, and to propose a feasible and economical plan of grafting 
it upon the public school system. The committee has devised a scheme by which ele- 
mentary manual instruction may be given to. those pupils who desire it, and which will 
in no way interfere with the regular school exercises. ‘The plan will receives fair trial. | 
Five hundred and thirty-eight girls received instruction in sewing during the year. The 
no-recess plan has been adopted for the high school, but sufficient time has not yet elapsed 
to judge ofits merits. The holding of elections in two of the school-houses causes serious 
interference with the work of these schools. The evening schools show constant im- 
provement; the drawing school is not yet as well attended as its excellence merits. 
Watertown.—The school year has been changed, so that it now contains two terms in- 
stead of three, as formerly. A training school for teachers has been established, and

young ladies may enter ag pupil teachers, receiving no pay, but improving themselves by 
observation and practice. Sewing has been introduced and is taught one hour per week 
by the aaealay teachers. A great deal of additional material for object teaching has been 
purchased. A new primary school has been established; transfers and reorganizations 
have been made where deemed expedient. 
Webster’s school committee has indulged in extensive repairs this year, which have re- 
sulted in the expenditure of more money than was'appropriated by the town. A few 
changes have been made in the text-books used, on advantageous terms. Neither draw- 
ing nor music has as yet been introduced; bat public sentimentseems to demand them, | 
and both will probably be incorporated in the course of study at no distant day. 
West Springfield.—The salaries paid to teachers are not sufficient to hold the best, and 
the schools suffer from constant resignations, All grammar school studies have been 
eliminated from the high-school course, thus raising the grade of the school. A new 
method of teaching music has been adopted, and perceptible improvement has already 
resulted. An evening school was conducted three evenings a week for twenty weeks. 
Westboro.—The method of supervision has been changed during the year. That re- 
sponsibility now rests upon one of the members of the board, while the principal of the 
high school, whohas hitherto acted as superintendentof the other schools as well, confines 
his attention to the high school only. In the large graded schools the year has been a 
prosperous one, with the average attendance considerably better than the preceding 
year; but the condition of the ungraded schools is neither satisfactory nor hopeful. 
Westfield.That popular interest in the schools is increasing is shown by the decrease 
in the number of parents applying for certificates of school attendance, and by the small 
number of cases of truancy. The evening schools are well conducted, but with the ex- 
ception of the drawing class are but poorly attended. 
Weymouth.—-The teachers’ meetings held during the year have been of more than usual 
interest. The superintendent considers the lack of musical instruction ‘‘ the one great 
weakness of the schools.’? Many long-needed improvements have been made in the 
school-houses. 
Woburn reports a remarkable increase in attendance. Two new schools were opened, 
and one was discontinued during the year. he course of study adopted in 1885 is now 
well understood, and so far from causing trouble, as it occasionally did for a time after 
its introduction, the work done under it is better both in quality and in quantity. 
MICHIGAN, 
Ann Arbor schools have suffered terribly from a widespread epidemic of measles that 
prevailed during last February and March. Nearly 200 pupils were daily absent on ac- 
count of sickness during that time, and 7,399 school days were lost from the total at- 
tendance. Some of the rooms were closed for a time and work was retarded in all. As 
a natural result, the character of the work accomplished during the year has been below 
the average both in thoroughness and in the amount. Nearly 100 of the pupils with- 
drawn during the epidemic did not return. The work of the high school has been 
fairly good, though the number in attendance exceeds the capacity of the building. 
The remedy for this was found in paying the regular teachers extra wages to teach the 
surplus classes out of the usual school hours. 
Bay City.—An excellent course of reading is arranged for each school year after the 
fifth, and the pupil must have read at least two of the prescribed books before he may be 
entitled to promotion to the next higher grade. A physical laboratory is in course of 
construction for the high school. By: arecent act of the State Legislature the limits of 
the school district were made to conform to those of the town. 
Coldwater.—Early in the year diphtheria prevailed to some extent, creating nneasiness 
among the patrons of the schools and necessitating the closing of all the schools for two 
weeks. This cessation caused serious interruption in the work. More attention is be- 
ing paid to English literature than formerly. The furniture and school apparatus gen- 
erally have been improved during the year. The high schoo! has four courses of four years 
each, arranged with special reference to the requirements for admission to the State 
University. 
Fenton.—The studies of the primary, grammar, and high school departments require 
four years attentioneach. Thehigh school is said to be one of the best in the State, hay- 
ing been on the ‘‘accepted list’? of the University of Michigan for 13 years. Besides 
the regular 4-year courses arranged for the double purpose of preparation for the Uni- 
versity and affording a practical business education, a two years’ ‘‘ teachers’ course’? is 
provided for persons expecting to teach, but who cannot devote more than two years to 
study. A short fall course in pedagogy may be taken by those who desire to teach dur- 
ing the winter. 
Grand Rapids.—Extensive additions to the school facilities are reported, but it appears 
that the work of providing for the increase in the school population is a never ending

task, for already 16 new rooms are receiving the attention of the building committee. 
The salaries of the teachers were raised somewhat by the adoption of a new schedule in 
May. The appointment of an assistant to the superintendent has been a great relief to 
that officer, enabling him to devote his entire time to the more important matters per- 
taining to the management of the schools. The high school building is not conven- 
iently situated, and in other respects is not well adapted to the needs of the school. 
The charter has been so amended as to permit the city to furnish text-books and sup- 
plies free to school children. 
Hastings boasts of ‘‘excellent school buildings, and efficient and thorough corps of 
teachers and the hearty co-operation of the citizens with the school authorities.” A 
teachers class, for the benefit of the teachers of the county, is conducted parts of the 
year, and members of the class frequently inspect the schools and witness the practical 
application of the principles studied. Annual examinations of teachers are no longer 
held, but teachers are required to pursue the course of study prescribed by the State 
Reading Circle. The percentages of enrolment and attendance show satisfactory increase 
over last year. 
Jackson.—A. physical and chemical laboratory has been recently provided for the 
high school. 
Marshail.—The schools are equipped with all appliances necessary for good instruction. 
The school library contains 500 well-selected reference and miscellaneous books, 150 of 
which were added during the year. Besides the general library, it is intended to place 
in each room a case of books especially suited to the age and advancement of the pupils 
of that room. Stenography is taught in the high school. ; 
Monroe,—The scheme of studies of the high school has been revised and ‘‘adapted to 
the latest requirements for admission to the University of Michigan. Care has also been 
taken to adapt the course to the wants of those not expecting to enter college.” There 
are four well-defined courses, each covering four years. 
Pontiae.—A commercial course, designed to be a thorough preparation for business, 
has keen added to the curriculum of the high school. 
MINNESOTA. 
Duiuth.—It is apparent that the progress of the schools has not been as rapid as in 
the previous year. Private schools have drawn away many who had previously attended 
the public schools, and contagious diseases have been quite prevalent. A high school 
building, completed in January last, is an excellent and handsome building 
Mankato.—It has been impossible to obtain a rigid classification of pupils 
the unusual division of the population and the unfavorable situation of the buildings. 
Small libraries have been established in several of the rooms, many ¢ by the 
efforts of the children themselves. ‘The success achieved in drawing has been very flat- 
tering. The facilities for doing high school work are not up to the needs of the town. 
The out-houses and closets provided are neither private nor comfortable. 
Minneapolis.—The growth of the schools has been remarkable. The enrolment in the 
day schools has increased by 2,000, and in the evening schools by 522 over 1835-86. 
The board has provided for this increase by erecting four new cight-room houses and one 
twelve-room building, besides extensive additions to those already standing. Even 
with these additions to the seating capacity it will be necessary to refuse admission. to 
several hundred children or to institute halfday sessions in several of the schools. The 
large addition to the Central High School, now in course of erection, will, besides sup- 
plying additional seating capacity, furnish the space necessary for the new manual train- 
ing department, a large and well-lighted room for draw: and a fine assembly room. 
The basement of this annex has already been fitted up with ail appliances necessary for 
instruction in carpentry, and in February the first class of 30 boys began the work with 
enthusiasm; all continued to the end of the year. The class spends 80 minutes daily 
in the shop and 40 minutes in the drawing-room. Nothing but wood-working and me- 
chanical drawing has yet been attempted. As far as may be judged in the short time, 
the experiment has been highly successful. Plans have been formed for the organiza- 
tion of a training class for teachers in September next; a course in pedagogy to cover a 
year has been arranged. - It is hoped to extend both the scope and the time of this work 
in the course of time. “Arbor Day’’ was celebrated by all the schools with appropri- 
ate exercises. Incidental to the study of music, a juvenile concert was given in April; 
it was a success in all substantial respects, tending to improve the singing of the chil- 
dren and to increase their interest in the study. The total expenditures of the system , 
were $23,213 more than last year, and closely approached a half million dollars. The 
regular work of the schools has progressed quietly and prosperously. 
Red Wing.—The rules laid down for the working of the system are complete and prac- 
oe and the course of study well arranged, though hardly up to the times in some re- 
spects. 
St. Cloud has issued bonds to the amount of $20,000 for new school buildings.

St. Paw.—An extension of the territorial limits of the city by act of the State Legis- 
lature has brought in the city 3 additional school districts, all of which are sufficiently 
provided with school facilities for the present at least. The high school department has 
been particularly prosperous during the year, and its growth has been such that the board 
has ordered the erection for its use of 14 additional rooms, comprising class-rooms, a 
chemical laboratory, and apartments for the commercial department and the contemplated 
manual training school. A great deal of interest has been awakened in the last-named 
innovation, and its results are awaited with high hopes. Special instruction in music 
was resumed this year after that branch had remained somewhat neglected for two years. 
New houses, aggregating $75,000 in cost and containing a total of 1,330 sittings, were 
added to the system during the year. Attention is being paid to school sanitation, and 
it will not be long before every building in the city is supplied with all proper appliances 
for furnishing heat, air, and water. 
Stilhwater.—The number of trustees has been increased from 5 to 7, 7, and their powers of 
taxation have been enlarged. The method of their election has also been altered, and 
they are now chosen directly by the people at a special election. 
MISSISSIPPI. 
Meridian.—The recently established public schools have continued the sound progress 
so well begun last year. A general superintendent has been appointed and several new 
teachers engaged. The inadequacy of the buildings is the greatest hindrance yet to be 
overcome. The curriculum has been materially changed by the introduction of indus- 
trial branches in the higher grades ; telegraphy, type-writing, drawing, and wood-work- 
ing are studies regularly pursued. A gymnasium has been provided, that physical ex- 
ercise may not be neglected. 
MISSOURI. 
Kansas City has made wonderful progress in the last few years, and the publi¢ schools 
have kept pace with the growth of the ‘ifty-five more teachers were employed in 
1886-87 than in the year before, and for 38 the number has been still further in- 
creased by 50, yet, notwithstanding these additions to the force, the problem of providing 
for all applicants for admission to the schools still remains unsolved. Three new build- 
ings have been finished since the last report, and others are in course of erection. Meet- 
ings of teachers have been frequent and fruitful of good results. A careful examination 
of the eyes of the pupils of the schools of the city and of those of neighboring educa- 
tional institutions during the year developed a number of interesting and important facts. _ 
It was shown that defective vision is more common in the Jowest grades than among more 
advanced scholars, and that in no instance, except the Kansas State University, is there 
anything like a gradual increase of optical affections from grade to grade. This fact i is 
taken as evidence that such diseases are necessaril ly aggrave ated by school work. 
Moberly has a well-selected school library of 600 volumes, purchased by a club organ- 
ized for that purpose. 
St. Charles issues its first printed report this year. 
St. Joseph.—The schools are well attended and prosperous. Notwithstanding the re- 
cently completed additions to three of the buildings, still further extension of the school 
facilities is needed. The colored schools are in excellent condition and are increasing 
in numbers and usefulness. 
Sedalia.—The average attendance has been unusually small this year, owing to the 
alarming prevalence of contagious diseases, An exhibit of examination papers and 
specimens of school work at the close of the term attracted a great deal of attention.    
     
NEBRASKA, 
Lincoln.—Eleven years’ work is minutely described in the manual of the public 
schools for 1886-87. The course includes music and free-hand drawing. — . 
Omaha practically tested the free text-book system this year at a cost of $12,000. The 
board of education has been increased from 9 to 15 members. The school elections will 
in future be held at different times from the city elections, and at school-houses. Women 
are now allowed to vote at such elections. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE, s 
Dover.—The system of marking and promotion has been radically changed, and upon 
the teacher the responsibility of promotion largely rests; an appeal may be made from 
her decision to the sub-committee in charge of the school, and the decision of the sub- 
committee must be final. Not enough attention was paid to light and ventilation in 
the construction of the buildings, and many alterations are now needed. Salaries of 
teachers are not sufficient to retain the best. 
Keene, Town District. —The condition of the schools is already fairly satisfactory, though 
the system is a new one. Much should be done in the way of repairs.

Keene, Union District.—The district has lost 317 scholars by the organization of a pa- 
rochial school. The withdrawal ofso many pupils disturbed the schools to some extent 
and required considerable labor to redistribute the remaining scholars. The system, 
however, has regained its equilibrium, but there are three fewer schools than before. 
The building of the new $1,300 house and the loss of so many pupils will render the fur- 
ther use of rented rooms unnecessary. An evening school was in session fourteen weeks 
during the year, and though the attendance was irregular, good progress was made. 
Rochester.—An experiment of the town system has been made during the last year. 
Not enough money is expended for repairs, and some.of the buildings are not in proper 
condition for use. Music is under the charge of a special teacher and is ‘‘an assured 
success.’” 4 . 
Somersworth.—Two marked changes have been made this year which go far toward 
perfecting the system. These are the furnishing of all text-books in the grades below 
the high school, and the introduction of the study of music. Both these innovations 
have shown themselves to be beneficial, facilitating school work and adding interest to 
the studies. 
NEW JERSEY. 
Elizabeth has organized a central high school. The high schools have hitherto been 
mere departments of the schools, and the change is regarded as a great improvement in 
the system. 
Morristown.—A_ $20,000 school-house was recently completed. 
Orange.—An evening class in drawing has been formed and is meeting with good suc- . 
cess; with this exception, however, the evening school does not flourish as its supporters 
hoped, and its continuation is not warranted by the results obtained. The heating ap- 
paratus of two buildings have been improved. The attendance in the schools was 1 per 
cent. better than in 1885-86, 
Rahway.—The schools are in good working order and are showing good results. 
NEW YORE. 
Albany, with exactly the same enrolment as in the year previous, reports the average 
attendance as 138 more; even greater improvement than this would have been shown if 
the accommodations had been more ampie. The condition of the schools in respect to 
discipline was never more healthy than during the past year. The drawing exhibition 
this year was more than usually interesting, and attracted thousands of visitors. In- 
terest has been awakened in manual training, and a committee appointed by the board 
to investigate the matter has rendered a report favorable io the adoption of a plan 
through which it will receive a thorough test. A number of changes have been made 
in the curriculum of the high school, the practical departments of mathematics and 
English being especially strengthened, and certain sciences, which in the time allotted 
to them could be only superficially studied, being eliminated. 
Auburn is erecting a new house for the use of the high school. Its total cost will be 
scarcely less than $75,000. Of this, $40,000 was borrowed upon advantageous terms 
from the State. An important departure from the former methods of teaching reading 
was experimentally tried in the highest grade of one of the grammar schools during the 
year. The old reader was entirely discarded, and Irving’s ‘“‘Alhambra’’ substituted in 
its stead. The pupils were allowed no previous preparation, and the books were dis- 
tributed just before the exercise was to begin. The plan was not successful at first, 
but as the pupils became interested in the subject-matter of the book they read with 
surprising ease and expression. The results were so satisfactory in the end that the 
plan will be extended to the other schools. The attendance of the children enrolled 
-continues to be regular and punctual as in former years, but the impression prevails 
that the number of idlers and truants in the city is constantly increasing. The sanitary 
condition of the schools is excellent. 
Binghamton.—During the past year the study of vocal music was added to the cur- 
riculum, and a marked degree of efficiency has already been attained. The usual good 
health of the children is the best evidence of the good sanitary condition of the build- 
ings and their surroundings. 
Brooklyn.—Substantial improvement has been made during the last 5 years in many 
respects, as the statistics show. Better grading has been secured, and although the re- 
quirements for promotion have been made more severe with each succeeding year, the 
proportion of those promoted to the average attendance is steadily increasing. Thor- 
oughness in the primary grades is an important factor in securing this result, and es- 
pecial precautions are taken in promoting the primary pupils. ‘The effect of this is 
seen in slightly decreased proportion of promotion to the grammar schools. By the use 
of judicious methods the numbers in the higher and lower grades have been nearly cor- 
rectly adjusted. Since 1882 a great deal of time and thought has been given to the re- 
vision of the course of study. The superintendent has visited other cities and examined   
-P-A-G-E-265

the methods and means in vogue in other places. The result of his labors has been sub- 
mitted to the board of education. The main object of the new course is to lessen rote 
work and cramming as far as possible, and to secure more thorough grading. In aly, 
1886, the curriculum of the Central School was extended by the adoption of a three-years’ 
Janghage course and the extension of the commercial course from 1 to 2 years. This 
school is not yet a full-grade high school, since no branches are taught save those neces- 
sary to fit young ladies for teaching, and to prepare young men for ‘the every-day affairs 
of life. The evening schools appear to prosper; the average attendance is greater by 109 
than last year. The training school for teachers, established in 1884, has achieved such 
success that the opening of another of the same kind is considered advisable. A change 
was recently made in the method of examining teachers for ‘‘A’’ or grammar school 
certificates. formerly those selected for promotion from the primary grades were sub- 
jected to a special examination, but by the late rule all eligible for promotion are ex- 
amined at stated times, and selections are made from the number who pass to fill the 
higher positions. The accommodations are fairly adequate, the whole number of sit- 
tings being greater than the whole number in average attendance, but the three lowest 
primary grades are overcrowded to such an extent that in some cases half-day classes 
have been necessary. Four buildings were erected during the year, and are said to be 
admirably adapted to their purpose. The annexation of the town of New Lots to 
Brooklyn gave the board jurisdiction over 6 new schools. The increase in enrolment 
over 1885-86 is 2,296. 
Canandaigua.—A board of education was elected in December last, but no radical 
changes were made until the close of the school year. Then the plans were perfected 
for a complete overhauling of the system. The schools were regraded and an academic 
department, introducing all the studies of the advanced regents, established. New and 
better text-books will be substituted in proper time, With school buildings in good re- 
pair, and with good laboratory facilities, the prospects of the re-organized schools seem 
particularly bright. 
Gloversville.—Instruction in drawing has been given in all grades with highly gratify- 
ing results. The regents’ advanced examinations have been introduced and the passing 
of two of them made a requisite for graduation. The enrolment and attendance for 
1886-87 exceeded those of any previous year. Many of the school-rooms are small and 
badly ventilated. 
Hornellsville.—The facts of importance mentioned in the report for 1886-87 are shown 
in our statistical tables. 
Ithaca.—A business department is to be added to the advantages offered by the high 
schoo]. The special instruction in penmanship in all the classes promises to become a 
marked success. The average attendance has been slightly below that of the preceding 
year on account of the prevalence of diphtheria in the autumn of 1886. 
Jumestown.—Prominent in the catalogue of the city schools appear the departments of 
physical culture and industrial training. Printing, stenography, type-writing, cabinet- 
making, sewing, and knitting are taught. 
Kingston.—The attendance has not, for various reasons, been as good as last year, but 
the character of the instruction given was better than ever before. By a new law, the 
district will receive over $600 more than at present from the State. The academy con- 
‘tinnes to maintain a high standard of excellence, and is practically self -supporting. of 
the five buildings, all save one are in prime condition. 
Lansingburg.—Accommodations are entirely inadequate. Not more than 1,000 pupils 
can be comfortably seated, while there are 3,131 persons of school age in the town. 
Thirteen hundred and five of these were enrolled in the schools during ‘the year. The 
free text-book system was adopted at the last town meeting and has proved to be a com- 
plete success, facilitating’school work and costing less than 45 cents per scholar. 
Lyons has employed a special teacher for writing. 
New York.—There are 305 schools under the supervision of the board of education, 6 
of which were added during the year to provide for the increase of 4,299 in the number 
enrolled. The corps of teachers has been increased by 104, and the average attendance 
was 2,619 more than last year. Three new buildings have been completed, additions 
to the 3 others have been furnished and occupied, and 6 houses owned by private parties 
have been leased, all of which has increased the seating capacity by 8,115. Improve- 
ments have been made in the heating and ventilating apparatus as far as the funds ap- 
portioned would allow. In pursuance of the fixed policy of the board, the number of 
2-department schools has been increased until now only 24 of the 83 grammar schools 
remain 3-department schools; a primary school, a male grammar, and a female grammar 
school being each designated a department. The examinations of the assistant superin- 
tendents, show that of the 2,982 classes in the primary and grammar schools, the instruc- 
tion in 2,376 is excellent, in 591 good, and in 15 fair. Of the principals whose man- 
agement is recorded, 94 per cent. are graded excellent. In most of the schools the order 
     
-P-A-G-E-266
  266 - EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87, 
and discipline are especially satisfactory, and the punctuality of the pupils is highly 
commended. The subject of industrial training has occupied a large share of the atten- 
tion of the board during the year; the committee on course of study and text-books has 
been directed to thoroughly investigate the subject and, with the aid of the city super- 
intendent, examine the working of the system in the various cities of the country where 
it has been adopted, as well as in the cities of Europe.' The elements of geometry 
have been introduced in the highest grammar grades to give pupils an idea of the purely 
logical arrangement of thoughts and to equip them with a few facts that will assist them 
in the study of mensuration. The use of supplementary readers is becoming common; 
their proper use is favored. The subject of physiology and hygiene has received in- 
creased attention during the year and much permanent good has been accomplished. 
Voeal music is steadily gaining ground, both in proficiency in reading and executing 
music and in the improvement it is working in the perception of sounds. Some 9,193 
pupils study German, and 2,029 are in the French classes, requiring for the two lan- 
guages 29 special teachers. With the increasing excellence of the instruction in modern 
Janguages in the Normal College, and the requirement that the regular teachers must be 
proficient in music and drawing, the need of special teachers becomes constantly less. 
Indeed, it is already recommended that the specialists in the two last subjects be dispensed 
with altogether as such. The Normal College is growing in popularity, and the pressure 
for admission continues to increase. Seventy-five per cent. of its graduates have held 
positions in the city schools. The establishment of a reformatory school is needed for 
the proper enforcement of the compulsory education law, and is earnestly reeommended. 
The evening schools continue to flourish; one-fourth of the pupils in attendance are 
foreigners studying the English language. Statistics of juvenile crime furnished by the 
records of the police department, before and after the passage of the compulsory educa- 
tion act; present a strong argument in favor of that measure. The number of offenses 
committed by persons between 8 and 14 has decreased nearly 50 per cent. 
Newburg.—The opening of the new academy building vies with the introduction of 
manual training and the free text-book system for the honor of being the most impor- 
tant event of the year. The academy was opened with interesting ceremonies in Sep- 
tember, 1886. With this important addition, the accommodations are more than suffi- 
cient for the accommodation of all pupils. There are now sixty-two rooms under the 
control of the board, and all are in good condition. Rooms have been fitted up and all 
necessary tools provided for instruction in carpentry. One hundred and fifteen boys, di- 
vided into ten sections, take one lesson each week, and are very enthusiastic. Sufficient 
time has not yet elapsed to judge the results. Though the free text-book plan has had 
as yet only an incomplete trial, it is clear that it teaches habits of care; one principal at- 
tributes the increase in attendance in his schaol directly to this cause. The abolishment 
of corporal punishment has not increased the number of mischievous children. 
Rome,—T wo additional teachers were employed this year, and these, with other extraor- 
dinary expenses, increased the total expenditures to more than $1,700 more than last year. 
The arrangement of the buildings is faulty, and the accommodations they afford are in- 
adequate. 
Saratoga Springs.—Diphtheria and measles among the school childten caused such a 
falling off in attendance during the winter that some of the schools were almost broken 
up. After a trial of six weeks the no-recess plan was adopted, and has been quite favor- 
ably received by teachersandpupils. The discipline of the schools continues to improve. 
Seneca Falls.—A niew school building has been erected, but the board claims that the 
terms of the contract were not fulfilled and refuses to accept it. A suit is now pending 
in the courts, Tho scientific apparatus, hitherto of little value, will soon be materially 
increased. 
-Syracuse.—The school system has been extended to take in seven additional schools in 
the suburbs and two primaries recently opened in remote parts of the city. One new 
pbuilding was opened during the year to replace the structure burned during 1885-86. 
The hygienic condition of the houses is not what it should be in the majority of in- 
stances. In only seven of the twenty-seven buildings are proper arrangements provided 
for heating and ventilation. The high school shows steady and decided improvement. 
The school library shows a net increase of nearly 800 volumes, and now numbers 18,062, 
Troy.—Though no protracted interruptions have occurred like those of the two pre- 
vious years, the progress and condition of the schools in 1886-87 can hardly be consid-   
1Sine¢ the publication of the report from which this information is obtained, the committee has 
rendered an exhaustive and valuable report, in which the subject is thoroughly reviewed, and the 
effects set forth. The committee estimates that the introduction of the system in all the schools 
would cost $128,500 the first year and $89,500 each succeeding year—this to include all the cost of in- 
struction of all boys in the grammar and primary departments in carpenter worl, of all girls in 
cooking and sewing, and of both sexes in modelling in clay, construction work in paper and paste- 
board, and drawing to scale. The committee favors the introduction of such training in all the 
_ gehdols. In October, 1887, the board decided to make the experiment in 6 schools before adopting 
_ the system for all.

ered entirely satisfactory. The school, law, and finance departments of the city govern- 
ment were not in accord, and the schools suffered. In the discussions that followed the 
stirring up of municipal affairs, the schools were subjected to much unjust criticism. 
The uncertainty concerning money matters during the winter also had a detrimenial 
effect. In March the entire corps of teachers was dismissed, but was subsequently re- 
engaged. These events created unrest, and though all ended well, the school work of 
the year was not as satisfactory as it would have been without their occurrence. The 
growth of the schools is slow and hardly commensurate with the growth of the city. It 
is estimated that there are 2,000 children in the city under fourteen years who receive 
no instruction. The enrolment for the year has been 113 greater than last year, but 
1,476 more days were lost by absence than in 1885-86. The accommodations are sub- 
stantially the same as last year, the only addition reported being one hundred new sit- 
tings. The methods of work in drawing and in vocal music have been subjected to re- 
vision and improvement. In drawing a course has been adopted which looks wholly to 
the industrial features of the study while continuing all the advantages of the system 
formerly in use. Physiology in the grammar schools, and English literature and natu- 
ral history in the high school have received increased attention. 
Utiea.—The schools show an average increase of 137 pupils per year for the last twenty 
years. The attendance also shows a constant and satisfactory improvement. The ac- 
commodations are not sufficient, and in too many cases the houses are ill adapted to the 
uses to which they are applied. The evening schools have been more than usually suc- 
cessful; good order has prevailed and excellent work has been accomplished. A special 
teacher was placed in charge of penmanship during the year, and the work done under 
her direction has been much more satisfactory than was ever obtained by the former 
method of instruction by the regular teachers. 
Watertown.—The schools are in a prosperous condition, with an enrolment increased 
by 196 and the average attendance increased by 157 over last year. ‘The number of cases 
of tardiness shows a considerable increase. The condition of the school property is gen- | 
erally good. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
Raleigh. —The patronage of the schools has largely increased during the year. A new 
school building has been erected by private parties and leased by the school committee 
for a term of 20 years. The use of the rooms rented in the business portion of the city 
will be no longer necessary. Additional teachers have been employed, and the force is 
now sufficient for the instruction of all pupils enrolled. The attendance in the colored 
schools has also increased, and it has become necessary to employ assistant teachers for 
several of the grades. The discipline steadily improves and isnow fairly good. A high 
school department is needed; the course at present covers but 9 years. 
OHIO. 
Alliance school facilities have been greatly improved during the last few years, and 
are at present in quite a satisfactory condition. ‘The teachers are as a rule well qualified 
and faithful. ; ‘ 
Ashtabula completed in time for use this year a handsome school-house whose total cost 
amounted to $33,000. 
Canion.—The event of the year was the dedication of a magnificent new high school 
building in April. Such a building had long been wanted, and when it was finally ¢om- 
pleted, elaborate ceremonies were arranged for its reception by the board and people. It 
covers nearly 15,000 square feet of ground, is 3 stories high, besides the basement and 
bell tower, and is believed to be one of the best warmed and ventilated buildings in the 
State. ‘‘ Nothing was left undone to make it what it ought to be in every respect.” 
The total cost was a few dollars less than $100,000, _ The enrolment and attendance each 
shows an increase of 1 per cent. over last year. The number of cases of tardiness has 
decreased by 46. In the high school an English course has been established and pupils 
may choose between that and the regular course. 
Chiilicothe.—-The school library contains over 10,000 volumes, and is supplied with 
standard periodicals, newspapers, etc. There are special German and writing depart- 
ments. 
Cincinnati.—The year just passed has been prolific in changes and improvements. Per- 
haps the most important of these regarded the appointment of teachers and the super- 
vision of the schools. Until this year, ‘‘local trustees’? nominated all teachers for the 
_ Schools of each district, and were charged with certain supervisory duties, The plan 
recently inaugurated entirely abolishes these local committees, and places the appoint- 
ment of teachers and the supervision of the schools under the direct control of the board 
of education. Another sweeping change was the abolishment of examinations as tests 
of fitness forprometion. According to the scheme now in use, pupils of the several grades 
are promoted primarily on their proficiency in the several branches, as shown by the 
       
-P-A-G-E-268
    268 — EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
teachers’ recorded estimates, duly approved by the principal. These estimates are made 
without the daily marking of recitations, and without the use of stafed examinations. 
The course of study has also come in for its share of the alterations, and an entirely new 
course has been outlined for next year’s work. 
Qolumbus.—The work done in the construction of new buildings has not kept pace with 
the rapid increase in the population of the city. Several of the school-houses are now 
overcrowded for the first time in 16 years. The growth of the school library is gratily- 
ing. Arbor day was observed with elaborate ceremoni The results of a thorough ex- 
amination of the eyes of the pupils of the schools indicate that 22} per cent. of all the 
children enrolled suffer some form of optical affection. 
Dayton.—The finances of the board continue to be in excellent condition, and the pros- 
perity of the schools is apparent and gratifying. The night schools_have met with only 
a modicum of success, and their results are not such as to arouse enthusiasm. Drawing 
has been discontinued in the high school. 
Lima.—Ground has been broken for a handsome building, which is expected to bethe 
most commodious and best adapted to school uses in the city. Natural gas as fuel has 
been introduced in the school buildings, and its use, it is thought, will be a material ad- 
vantage. The attendance during the year has not been up to the usual standard owing 
to the presence in the schools of a new element, which deems regular attendance a mat- 
ter of minor importance. 
Zanesville.—The high school course has been lengthened to four years. 
OREGON. 
    Portland. —Four new rooms have been opened and four additional teachers employed. 
All the school buildings in the city were repainted and repaired during the year. An 
. apparent decrease of 700 in the school population is explained by the defective methods 
of enumeration employed. - Theaverage number belonging was larger than in any preced- 
ing year. The plan of electing teachers annually has caused a great deal of dissension 
among the teachers, and undoubtedly impaired their work. It will probably be changed 
before the next year. 
Salem.—One of the finest wooden school edifices in Oregon has just been completed here 
at a cost of $50,000. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
Beaver Falls adopted the “‘half-day session’? plan for relieving overcrowding in primary 
grades this year. The plan was fairly successful and will be continued. Natural gas 
has been introduced as fuel, and the results are better heat and better ventilation than 
could ever be secured before. 
Chambersburg.—The new course of study put in operation at the beginning of the 
year has been found to be well adapted to the needs of the schools. The work done 
was satisfactory as a whole—many defects of former years having been remedied or re- 
moved. 
Harrisburg.—‘‘The board of control has dispensed with music in the schools and or- 
dered the same to be stricken from the course of study in all the grades.” 
Johnstown.—The schools suffered no serious hinderance to progress this year. The 
* course of study has been rearranged for next year’s work. Atthe fourth annual drawing 
exhibit at the end of the term there were displayed the most meritorious specimens 
yet exhibited. 
Norristown.—The year has been a profitable one to the schools of this city. Six hun- 
dred and five admission tickets were issued to new scholars; a fact that shows aconsid- 
erable change in the school population. A resolution has been passed to employ a spe- 
cial teacher for music. 
New Castle.—A small paper is issued quarterly, under the direction of the superintend- 
ent, in the interest of the schools. Tardiness causes a great deal of trouble. 
Philadelphia.—The results of the labors of the board of education for the past 10 years 
are becoming evident in the greatly improved and very satisfactory condition of the 
schools. Much of the progress made is accredited to the working of the system of super- 
intendence inaugurated 4 years ago. Perhaps one of the most important tasks under- 
taken under this régime, was begun during the year just passed—that of securing uni- 
formity of instruction in all the schools. ‘The preparation of all examination papers in 
the office of the superintendent is expected to go far toward the accomplishment of this 
desirable object. A general increase of $50 per annum in the salaries of teachers is 
another step which will undoubtedly lead to improved instruction; this may also be 
said of the adoption of the plan of increasing salaries in various departments upon the 
basis of term ofservice. <A difference yete: ists in the pay of instructors in the different de- 
partments, but it is probable that the time is close at hand when the rank of primary teach- 
_ ers will be equal to that of the secondary and grammar school teachers. Until recently 
the city has made annual appropriations for the support of kindergartens controlled by

NOTES FROM CITY SCHOOL REPORTS. 269 
a society of citizens, but within a few months the sub-primary schools have come under 
the direction of the board of education. They have been thoroughly reorganized, and a 
code of rules and regulations prepared that will effectually bring them into the city sys- 
tem. The instruction in sewing in the schools is believed to be more extensive and thor- 
oughly organized than in any other city in the country; the results have been of the most 
gratifying character. The system of training in the Manual Training School is excel- 
lent; a new brick building, fitted up asa blacksmith shop and foundry, has been added 
to the facilities of the school during the year. Material changes have been made in the 
exercises of the Industrial Art School, which have resulted advantageously to the instruc- 
tion and comfort of the pupils. The Girls’ Normal School, which really includes a girls’ 
high school with a 3 years’ course, besides a post-graduate course of 1 year for profes- 
sional training, is filled to its utmost capacity; 167 of its graduates were appointed to 
teachers’ positions during the year. Marked improvement continues to be perceptible 
in the evening schools; the annual appropriations for their support have Beast) in- 
creased from $10,000 in 1880 to $35,000 in 1886. 
Shenandoah.—The new course of study prescribed for next year shows careful prepa- 
rationand a judicious arrangement of studies. Considerable attention is paid tophysical 
exercise. 
South Bethlehem.—The schools have lately been re-graded. The free text-book system 
is favored and will probably be adopted during the next year. 
West Chester.—A handsome building of 12 rooms has been erected during the year and 
will be ready for occupation at the beginning of next term. Arithmetic receives espe- 
cial attention in the schools. : 
Wilkes-Barre.—A. satisfactory reduction in the number of tardinesses is reported. 
‘Two new primary schools have been opened and several changes have been made in the 
lowest grades, the object being to equalize the number of pupils to each teacher and to 
secure better instruction. The general order of the schools is excellent. The high 
school is crippled and its work made less satisfactory by the lack of a sufficient number 
of teachers. Fire escapes have been erected for 3 of the buildings and a system of elec- 
tric bells has been put in each of 3 others. 
Williamsport reports the organization of 3 additional schools, in one of which the stud- 
ies of the lower high school grades are taught. ‘The accommodations are ample, but the 
location of some of the buildings is objectionable, and it may be necessary to build new 
houses soon on that account. The practice of holding elections in school-houses causes 
much annoyance, as the schools must be dismissed two days in each term for that reason. 
The attendance is good and the number of cases of tardiness has materially decreased. 
‘An alumni association was organized by the graduates of the high school, and annual 
meetings will be held in the future.    
RHODE ISLAND. 
Bristol.—The primary schools were badly crowded during the summer term, and in 
order to make room for new scholars coming in at the opening of the fall term, the high- 
est primary grades of all the schools were placed in charge of teachers of the lowest inter- 
mediate grades, thus placing double work upon those teachers. This plan was not just 
to either teachers or pupils, but was the only remedy at hand. In December last a 
change was made in the high school course, making it simpler and more practical. 
Cranston schools have suffered considerably from various causes during the year. 
Measles and other children’s diseases have reduced the classes in some instances to a 
single individual. The residents of District No. 7 have erected a spacious and hand- 
some school edifice, which will be occupied at the opening of the next term. 
Cumberland.—Nearly $400, received from the city and State for apparatus, was in- 
vested in books, maps, charts, etc. It appears that the buildings are not properly cared 
for, since two or three comparatively new ones are in such a condition as to be hardly 
habitable. A resolution has been passed to pay teachers monthly. Drawing has been 
introduced and teachers are preparing themselves to teach it. 
East Providence.—Much inconvenience and trouble have resulted from want of school 
rooms, and resort has been necessary to temporarily rented-rooms, which were not suited 
to school uses. Drawing has been introduced, and its study has ‘awakened a great deal 
of interest in both teachers and pupils. 
Johnston.—A high school was organized in September last, and was conducted for 
30 weeks with an average attendance of 25. Its prospects are good for continued suc- 
cess, although in the absence of a well-defined course of study in the lower schools, it is 
quite difficult to prepare scholars for admission. Most of the buildings are old and by 
no means as good as should be furnished for school purposes. 
Newpori.—One of the old school-houses has been abandoned and sold, and its pupils 
were transferred to an elegant new building, whose use will also allow the reduction of 
the other schools to the proper size. A radical departure has been made in the matter    
‘

of school furniture by purchasing combined single desks and seats in all cases where 
new furniture has been required. More system will in future be observed in the em- 
loyment and duties of janitors. 
Pawtucket.—Substantial improvements, in more than one respect have annually been 
reported for several years past, and the last is not an exception to the rule. Perhaps in 
the general increase of teachers’ salaries appears the most important gain of the year; 
then, naturally following the improved work which must have been a result of such a 
measure, comes increased attendance and further expansion of school facilities. A new 
$25,000 edifice and another house containing 4 rooms were opened for the admission of 
scholars at the beginning of the school year, and next term will see the completion of 
_ still another handsome building. A training school for teachers has been established 
and is expected to add much to the efficiency of the corps. The work in music and 
drawing has been systematized and better graded. 
South Kingston schools do not appear to be worthy of the highest praise. The in- 
stru@tors are not all of that high professional character that the best interests of a school 
system demand, nor is the length of the school year sufficient for the accomplishment 
of the best results even under more favorable circumstances. A superintendent was 
employed during the year, but his labors were evidently not appreciated. 
Westerly.—Commendable progress has been made during the year and the general 
condition of the schools is highly spoken of. A well-appointed primary school-house 
has been completed and improvements of a substantial character have been instituted 
in older buildings. Truancy is too common and steps are being taken toabate it. The 
abolishment of the district system and the establishment of an evening school are among 
the improvements recommended. 
Woonsocket.—A proposition has been received from the conductor of one of the French 
parochial schools, offering to place his school under the supervision of the school com- 
mittee for four hours daily. ‘The superintendent thinks the acceptance by the town of 
this proposition would tend to improve the parochial schools, and sees no impropriety 
in endorsing it. The results of the evening schools are not entirely satisfactory, and 
means of improvement are being sought. The study of music under a special instructor 
was begun this year, and all are enthusiastic in its praise. The compulsory education 
law, with its provision concerning the employment of children, is not enforced universally 
in the State, and consequently in this town, where it is enforced, it operates unjustly 
to the schools and to the manufacturers. The latter are deprived of the child labor that 
those of adjacent towns get, and the schools are injured, because children ¢an work in 
establishments close at hand, but outside of the jurisdiction of the truant officer, 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
Columbia.—Constant improvement is being made in the schools from year to year. 
The attendance shows a considerable increase over last year, and the improvement in 
this respect would have been still greater had not lack of room obliged the superintend- 
ent to refuse admission to several applicants. The division of the lower grades intd 
morning and afternoon sections resulted in the saving of $1,000 without detriment to 
the instruction of the children. 
TENNESSEE. 
Chatianooga.—The schools are popular and prosperous; the percentage of enrolment 
to population is high. Two high schools are maintained, one for white and the other 
for colored pupils; sixteen graduates from these received diplomas last year. 
Jackson.—The city authorities cordially co-operate with the board of education to make 
the schools successful. The session just closed was the best in the history of the system 
in enrolment, attendance, and in the general average of the pupils for proficiency. The 
age for the admission of children has been raised from six to seven years. 
Memphis.—In school work this has been the most satisfactory since the advent of the 
present management. An examination of the eyes of the pupils of two schools has been 
made, revealing the fact that a large number of them suffer from eye-strain or near- 
sightedness. The proportion is much larger in the older building. Thirteen schools in 
the primary department were conducted on half time this session. 
Nashville.—Comparison with previous years shows a considerable increase in the per- 
eentage of attendance, but the enrolment has not increased in corresponding ratio with 
’ the scholastic population of the city, For this, the presence of a large number of excel- 
lent private schools is mentioned as the probable reason. A school building capable of 
seating 1,000 pupils, handsome in design, and modern in all its appointments, was com- 
pleted in September last. Another building:similar to this in design and Construction, 
though somewhat smaller, will be ready for occupancy at the coming session, ‘The in- 
struction in music, penmanship, and drawing is satisfactory and thorough. 
Union City no longer requires an incidental fee from school children,

TEXAS. 
~ Brenham.—The public schools have obtained such a hold that at the beginning of the 
year the German-American Union abandoned its private school, and rented the building | 
to the board ata nominal rate. The legal school age of the city has been changed from 
six to sixteen to seven to seventeen. 
' El Paso.—From a beginning of 68 scholars in March, 1883, the public schools have 
rapidly grown in importance, A handsome $20,000 building has been completed and 
furnishes excellent opportunities for successful school work. This building has been 
crowded this year, and atleast two additional rooms are needed. Itis said that the teach- 
ers are better paid than those of any other city in the State. 
Fort Worth.—It is expected to introduce drawing and vocal music next year. 
Galveston.—The condition of the public schools is entirely satisfactory. The first 
class to graduate from the high school received diplomas last June; it numbered 
twenty-two, all ladies but one. The proportionately small number of boys in the 
higher grades causes some solicitude. 
Houston teachers are enthusiastic in their efforts for self-improvement, and take great 
interest in their meetings and their library. A new building was opened during the 
year. 
Palestine school facilities are adequate for the accommodation of all the children in 
the city. Irregularity of attendance is still the greatest difficulty to be overcome. 
Sherman.—The schools were opened in September as usual, but owing to the preval- 
ence of dengue, regular work was not begun until November. Industrial drawing was 
made a regular study during the session, and the results obtained were such as to jus- 
tify its continuance. The appointment of one of the teachers in each school as princi- 
pal has provided the local supervision necessary to make each school a complete organ- 
ization in itself. 
Waco.—The year has been characterized by the rapid growth and improvement of the 
schools. The organization, discipline, and instruction are better with each succeeding 
year. An increase is noted in enumeration of 15 per cent., im enrolment of 13 per 
cent., in regularity of attendance of 3 per cent., and in the value of school property of 
100 per cent. A large sum of money has been expended for new buildings. Roomy ~ 
additions are nearly complete to two of the houses, and the fine central high school 
building, begun a year ago, will be ready for occupation at the opening of next session. 
The first class graduated from the high school last June, and was the occasion of much 
congratulation. A literary society was organized during the year and already finds 
great favor. 
VERMONT. 
Bennington.—Antagonism to the graded school system is fast disappearing and little 
opposition to the schools now exists. ‘The character of the instruction is generally satis- 
factory, and the schools are in good condition. Unnecessary absences and truancy reduce 
the average attendance at least 12 per cent. The course of study for all the schools has 
been carefully revised. In the high school more attention will be paid to the English 
language; a general course of three years and a business cqurse of two years are inno- 
vations. Vocal music was introduced in all grades. 
Rutland.—An additional building to cost $12,000 is soon to be erected, and by its archi- 
tectural beauty will be an ornament to the town. The course of study has been syste- 
matically revised. Important among the changes introduced are the study of music in 
all grades and of drawing in the primary department, and the extension of the grammar 
eoueey auaree by one year. Public interest in educational matters has greatly increased. 
recently. 
VIRGINIA. 
Richmond.—Three new buildings were -begun during 1885-86, and it was expected to 
complete them during the year just passed. 
Staunion.—The public schools are well organized and thoroughly graded. The sys- 
tem comprises primary, grammar, and high schools. , 
WISCONSIN, 
Baraboo,—There are seats in the three substantial school-houses for 1,000 pupils. A 
small library has been established. The scholars of the high school publish a monthly 
paper devoted to the interests of the schools. . 
Berlin offers instruction covering 14 years, of which the first is to be devoted to kin- 
dergarten and preliminary work before entering the primary school. Text-books are 
owned by the city, and may be rented by pupils for a year or term at moderate prices. 
Green Bay.—The adoption of the free text-book system is being considered. The 
evening school established 1885, and so sucessful that year, was but poorly attended

during the past winter. A committee of 14 citizens has been requested by the board of 
education to inspect the schools during the next year. 
Janesville.—A. steady growth is perceptible in attendance, though but 52 per cent. of 
the school population attend any school, public or private. A library of 164 volumes 
was provided by the board during the year. Preparation has been made for the erec- 
tion of a two-story steam-heated building of 6 rooms. The cases of tardiness and cor- 
poral punishment were much fewer than in the previous year. 
La Crosse.—The schools have been so economically administered this year that the cost 
per pupil was less than it has been for the last ten years. The experience of another 
year adds to the popularity of the free text-book system, no objection whatever being 
urged against it. 
Manitowoe.—A course of study has been prepared and adopted, and will be used from 
the beginning of the next term. 
Neenah buys all school books and sells them at cost to those pupils who are able to 
buy them, and furnishes them gratis to those who cannot afford to pay for them. This 
system has been in operation for seven years, and gives entire satisfaction, no change 
being considered advisable. The year has been marked by good, healthy progress. 
Oshkosh schools are nob as perfect in their organization as they should be; to the de- 
fective method of supervision is laid the blame for the shortcomings of the system in 
' this respect. The rule relating to promotions has been altered, so that the standing of 
the pupils in ‘‘ weekly oral reviews’? is of as much importance as the percentages ob- 
tained in the final examinations. Night schools were in session 4 months during the 
winter, with an enrolment of 80 and an average attendance of 60; $1 per month was 
charged each scholar. Supplementary reading receives considerable attention. A ref- 
erence library has been established for the high school. A new building, representing 
a cost of $20,000, was completed and occupied in September last; it contains approved 
appliances for supplying heat, pure air, etc. Exceptingin this building, the methods of 
heating and ventilation are at best of questionable utility. 
Racine reports the enrolment decreased by 43—caused by the opening of a parish 
school in the vicinity of one of the city schools—and an increase of 44 in the average 
attendance. The city limits have been extended and a newschool opened; the employ- 
ment of two or three more teachers will therefore be necessary. Salaries have not been 
sufficient to hold several experienced teachers. A new building has been provided for, 
and advertisements have been inserted in the local papers inviting bids upon it. The 
school discipline has been in general effective and praiseworthy. 
THE TABLE OF COMPARATIVE STATISTICS OF CITIES. 
[Table 19, Page 274.]   The following table, introduced in this Report for the first time, is intended to present, 
in the most available form for comparison, the statistics of the 518 cities and towns that 
have forwarded returns to this Bureau. The plan of its preparation is similar to that 
adopted in the table of comparative statistics of State school systems in the Report for 
the year 1885-86. The population of each city between the ages of 6 and 14 is taken 
as the principal basis for the calculations concerning thatcity. It is to be regretted that 
so many cities, especially in the States of Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, and Penn- 
sylvania, cause no school census to be taken; for unless the number of children of legal 
school age be known, it is not possible to compute with accuracy this all-important 
factor for comparison. 
In the main, the columns comprise averages and ratios that have been frequently util- 
ized before in school statistics, and the methods of calculating may be readily understood. 
Column 6, however, may have an unfamiliar appearance, and may require some expla- 
nation, as jt has not been previously used. The figures there shown were obtained by 
dividing the ‘‘ total attendance in days’’ of each{eity by the corresponding ‘ ‘population 
. 6 to 14.” The result formsa uniform basis upon which the amount of instruction given 
in all cities for which it is recorded may be compared. It shows the number of days all 
persons between 6 and 14 years of age in each city may have attended the schools, had 
their benefits been conferred upon such persons only. In importance this column must 
be ranked even above that showing the ‘‘ratio of average attendance to population,’’ 
for while the latter is an excellent test of the quality of the instruction imparted, it is 
powerless to show the quantity. The schools of a city may have heen in session for only 
80 days, and during that time may have maintained a high ratio of attendance. Yet, 
it would be manifestly wrong to rate the educational work done by such a city above , 
that accomplished by another whose schools were in session for twice as many days, even
-P-A-G-E-273
REMARKS ON THE CITY TABLES. 273 
if the percentage of attendance in the latter be somewhat smaller than in the former 
case. In indicating, then, both the length of the school year and. the attractiveness of 
the teaching. the value of Column 6 is apparent. 
To show what proportion of the sittings needed by a system of schools is actually 
provided, is a task of much difficulty. The number of sittings to each 100 pupils 
enrolled, and the number to each 100 pupils in average attendance, are shown, as be- 
ing nearer to the desired result than any other ratio available. It is not generally 
necessary that there should be as many sittings as there are pupils enrolled during the 
entire year, but it is essential that there should be a seat for every child who actually 
belongs to the schools at any one time, and naturally there should be more sittings than 
there are pupils in actual attendance. Then, when it is remembered that it is beyond 
the limits of possibility to always adjust the size of the classes and the capacity of the 
rooms with such nicety that there will be no surplus of either pupils or desks at any 
point, the importance of having a much larger number of seats than the number of 
children in average attendance will be furtheremphasized. While the figures presented 
do not afford a satisfactory answer to the question as to the adequacy of the school ac- 
commodations of a city, they are amply sufficient for purposes of comparison. 
It cannot be accepted as a rule that the instruction is best in those cities in which the 
‘number of pupils in average attendance to each teacher”? is smallest; yet, there is a 
point in the size of classes beyond which it is not well to venture. It may be safely as- 
serted that when the average for a full-fledged system of schools, embracing grammar 
grades and high schools, rises above 50 pupils to each teacher, the children lose, in the 
character of the instruction they receive, much more than the city’s treasury gains in the 
saving effected. From the nature of things, 50 pupils in average attendance per teacher 
for aschoolsystem generally means about 65 children in average attendance to each teacher 
in the primary grades; and 65 children in average attendance generally means the fre- 
quent attendance of fully 80 young children upon the instruction of a single teacher. It 
is not believed that any teacher, however efficient, can do full justice to this number of 
children. 
In view of the frequently expressed demand for a larger proportion of male teachers 
in the schools, Column 11 is of considerable value. It will be observed that as a rule 
the proportion of males is larger in cities of moderate and small size than in the largest 
cities. The reason for this is obvious. Male teachers form 3.6 per cent. of the entire 
force in Philadelphia; 4.2 per cent. in Chicago and Brooklyn; 5.8 per cent. in New York; 
5.9 per cent. in New Orleans; 7.5 per cent. inSan Francisco; 11.9 per cent. in Baltimore; 
16.6 per cent. in Cincinnati. The percentage in a number of the smaller cities is above 
30. In Baton Rouge, La., itrises to 42.9; in South Easton, Pa., to 44.5; in Union City, 
Tenn., to 46.2. 
It is well to consider Column 16 in connection with those which follow. The wealth 
of a corporation must be known in order that the schools it supports may be fairly 
judged. A difficulty arises in this connection, however, which it is not easy to ever- 
come. The methods of assessment employed vary greatly. In some cities, property is 
assessed at its full value, while in others the assessed valuation is not more than one- 
tenth the actual cash value. With such differences to contend with, it is apparent that 
comparisons involving this quantity must be made with caution, especially when the 
cities compared are of different States. 
Columns 20 and 21 indicate the direct cost to any city of its schools, per capita of 
scholastic population and average attendance. Column 22 shows, practically, the city 
tax rate for the schools, the costs of collection not being considered,

  3804 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
Tur SUMMARY, BY STATES AND DIVISIONS, OF COMPARATIVE STATISTICS OF CITIES 
[able 20, Page 305.] 
The difficulties and uncertainties that have surrounded the preparation in past 
years of the summaries, by States and divisions, of the school statistics of cities, have 
Jed to a radical change in the method of presenting them. It has not yet been possi- 
ble to procure returns from all the cities on the lists of the Office. Of 690 blank forms 
sent to as many different cities, 518 were returned with statistics available for the 
Report; 162 cities and towns were not heard from, though the efforts of the Bureau 
were four times repeated; ten of the returns received were rejected, as the informa- 
tion they contained did not properly concern any city system. It will be seen that 
nearly all the States are represented in the list of cities that furnished no statistics. 
Under such circumstances it is plain that no summary of absolute quantities could be 
peepee that would not do injustice to the State for which it is made. The “num- 
er of children enrolled” in 75 per cent. of the cities and towns of a State cannot, by 
any procesg now known to this Office, be made to represent the ‘‘ number of children 
enrolled in the public schools of the cities” of that State, without bearing on its face 
_apalpable error. Any summarized statement of totals concerning any number of 
cities, not the whole number in any State or division, would be for all practical pur- 
poses meaningless. 
For these reasons it has been decided to abandon the use of totals in the summaries 
of city statistics and present, instead, summaries comprising the same averages and 
ratios as are shown in the foregoing table. These are believed to be approximately 
correct, upon the hypothesis that the averages shown by any number of cities under 
substantially similar conditions will not materially differ from those shown by three- 
fourths of thatnumber. The statistics of the States are presented in a previous chap- 
ter, and furnish all information ordinarily desired as to totals. 
In the table 1t has been necessary to leave a number of the columns blank, for the 
reason that the items necessary for the computation were not reported by a sufficient 
number of cities to make an equitable average for the State. Two States—Florida 
and Vermont—are entirely without representation. Of the three cities in the former, 
the return of but one was available for use; and from the latter State, with seven 
cities and townson the list, only two returns that could be considered satisfactory 
were received. 
In instituting comparisons between the States as represented by the cities, it ap- 
pears that Massachusetts leads in two important respects: the average attendance 
is equal to 92.8 per cent. of the population between 6 and 14, and the total amount 
of instruction imparted is equivalent to the attendance of the population 6 to 14 
for 179.9 days. Tho same State excels in the amount ($20.75) appropriated for 
schools by the cities and towns per capita of population 6 to 14, and is second only to 
Colorado in the amount paid for supervision and teaching, upon the same basis. New 
York, with 149.8 per cent., heads the list in the ratio of total public and private 
school enrolment to the established basis, being 7.6 per cent. ahead of Massachusetts. 
The proportion of enrolment to the population 6 to 14 is remarkably large in Colo- 
rado, reaching 138.4 per cent.; the value of school property and thé amount paid to 
superintendents and teachers are also unusually large per capita. The children en- 
rolledin the cities of Georgia are most regular in their attendance, 82 per cent. of them, 
on an average, being present every day ; 163.7 represents the average number of days 
of each pupil’s attendance. Ohio has the largest number of sittings in proportion to 
enrolment, but Colorado again leads if the number be compared with the average 
attendance. The average number of sittings to a building is greatest in South Caro- 
lina and least in New Hampshire. The cities of Michigan are best supplied with 
libraries, there being 313.7 volumes to each 100 pupils in average attendance. The 
percentage of male teachers to the whole number of teachers is largest in Alabama. 
‘The number of pupils in average attendance to each teacher is largest in South Caro- 
lina and smallestin Minnesota. Michigan and New Hampshire share the distinction 
of having proportionally the largest high school enrolment, with the advantage 
slightly in favor of the former,

Tue SUMMARY BY CLASSES. 
[Table 21, Page 309.] 
It appears from the figures of the following summary thatif there is any advantage 
on the side of any class of cities, that advantage lies on the side of those whose pop- 
ulation is less than 10,000. In only two cases is there a marked gradation, but it 
will be noted that in some of the most important columns the superiority of the small 
city from an educational stand-point is manifest. The ratio of enrolment to the pop- 
ulation between 6 and 14, the amount of instruction imparted in proportion to the 
scholastic population, the average length of school life as shown by the number en- 
rolled in high schools, the ratio of total public and private school enrolment to popu- 
lation, and the proportional value of school property, may be mentioned as matters in 
which the cities of Class 6 excel those of the other classes. The statement that these 
advantages are due chiefly to the size of the cities would not be borne out by the sta- 
tistics, for, if such an assertion were true, it would be expected to find a gradual in- 
crease in every important column. Instead of this, it is shown that in the largest 
cities—those of Class 1—the averages attained are, in at least two important instances, 
more favorable than those of the other classes, and in the ratio of enrolment to popu- 
Jation, and in the proportional amount of instruction furnished, the largest cities rank 
next to the smallest. ! 
Column 7 plainly indicates that as the size of a city increases, the chances of the 
average child for a long school life diminish. To attempt to discuss the reasons for 
this fact would be to open a question concerning the social conditions of cities which 
it is not within the province of this Report to settle. It is evident, however, that it 
is not due to any failure on the part of the authorities of the larger cities to provide 
liberally for the schools, since it is proved by Column 14 that the proportional amount 
paid for supervision and teaching increases with the population, though not in reg- 
ular progression. 
The amounts apportioned to the schools are generally larger per pupil in average 
attendance in the large than in the small cities; and since the value of school prop- 
erty is greater per pupil in the smaller cities, it may be inferred that the authorities in 
the great cities prefer to devote the fands at their disposal to the improvement of the 
character of the instruction, rather than to the acquirement of property, and that in 
the cities of lesser population the tendency is in the other direction. It can only be 
a matter of conjecture to what extent these conclusions are affected by the well-known 
facts that the difference in the cost of living makes it possible to secure good teachers 
at lower salaries in the less populous cities, and that the more crowded condition of 
the large cities renders practicable the use of larger and therefore less expensive 
buildings. 
So fow of the cities concerned reported the items required for the calculations that 
Column 9 for Class 1, and Columns 8 and 9 for Class 2, could not be filled. It appears, 
however, that private schools are patronized t in the towns and smaller cities, 
and that the total enrolment steadily increases from Class 3 to Class 6.

[Table 22, Page 312.] x 
Tho arrangement of the table of absolute statistics in this Report differs in no ma- 
terial respect from that of the Report of 1885-86, Those columns that were of the 
nature of ratios have been eliminated from this table, but may be found by reference 
to Table 19, where they are presented with other statistical facts of like kind. . Ex- 
perience has proved that it is more satisfactory in every respect to make thé compu- 
tations necessary for obtaining these ratios in this Office, rather than to ask the vol- 
untary correspondents of the Bureau to furnish deductions that can be made here 
with equal accuracy and greater uniformity. 
The following table represents information received directly from the school officers 
mentioned in connection with the statistics of each city. An exception to this state- 
ment must be made, however, so far as Columns 5 and 6 are concerned. In but few 
cities does the school census taken show the population between 6 and 14 or that be- 
tween 4 and 21, and estimates of these items are necessary. The figures presented 
are the results of calgulations based upon the proportion which the population be- 
tween the required ages has been shown by previous censuses to bear to the school 
population of any city or State. The estimates calculated in this way are probably 
as nearly correct as can be obtained without an actual enumeration, and are cer- 
tainly more accurate than any conjecture could be under the circumstances that ordi- 
narily surround the school officers of large cities. 
In the matter of enrolment there is practical uniformity of method in all the cities, 
and little fault can be found with the columns devoted to that subject. Wherever there 
is any organization worthy of the name, a good account is kept of the pupils enrolled. 
‘This item is, therefore, of all those required by the table, the most easily obtained and 
the most satisfactorily reported. The only trouble experienced in this connection has 
been with those cities which support evening and special schools, for in a number of 
such instances it has been difficult to determine whether the reported ‘‘ whole num- 
ber enrolled” included the enrolment in the special schools. 
Improvement is noticeable in the columns relating to attendance; the attendance 
records of nearly all the cities are now kept in accordance with essentially the same 
plan. The evening and special schools are sometimes elements of uncertainty in this 
connection also. Thoughit is manifestly wrong to add two quantities so entirely dis- 
similar as the average attendance in evening schools and the average daily attend- 
ance in the day schools, this is often done and the result is called “ total average 
daily attendance.” ‘The records and statistics of evening schools should be kept en- 
tirely separate from those of the day schools, as long as there is as much difference in 
the character of the two branches of educational work as at present. Evenin 
schools are not usually in session more than 60 evenings, nor more than 3 hours each 
evening, while the day schools are generally open between 180 and 200 days for 6 or 
7 hours each day. When such wide differences in the value of the two quantities are 
considered, the impossibility of combining them upon equal terms is apparent, and 
in all cases whereit was evident that the records of evening schools had contributed 
to increase the ‘average daily attendance,” the proper diminution was made from 
the latter before the calculations for Table 19 were made, 
In Column 18 there are indications that many different methods of arriving at the 
“total attendance in days of all pupils” exist. Properly, it should be identical with 
the product of the average daily attendance multiplied by the number of days the 
schools were taught. In the manner of dealing with half-day and quarter-day ab- 
sonces is the disparity which explains the failure, in a number of instances, of the 
“total attendance in days” to coincide exactly with the product mentioned. Pres- 
ence at the morning roll-call is considered by many superintendents, in summing up the total attendance for the year, to be a day’s attendance, while in calculating the average daily attendance it occasionally happens that the same officers are so preciso 
as to deduct the time lost by tardiness as well as the longer absences. The reverse of this is sometimes true, and precision regarding the total attendance is exercised, while - 
presence for a part of the day only is equivalent to a day in reckoning the average 
daily attendance. This diversity of method will account for many of the seeming 
discrepancies that the careful observer may detect in this column. ‘To be strictly ac- curate only actual presence in the schools should be considered in compiling the rec- ords of attendance. The value of all school statistics would be enhanced if this rule were universally observed. 
Column 26, ‘‘ number of teachers necessary to supply the schools,” is an innovation whose value would have been greater had there not been some uncertainty in the minds of a large number of superintendents whose reports were received, as to the meaning of the inquiry as it appeared in the blank forms, Nevertheless, a sufficient number replied to the question to make the column one of considerable importance. 
It will be seen that in connection with the “ whole number of teachers in all public 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
  STATISTICS OF CITY SCHOOLS. 311 
schools,” this quantity should indicate the number of changes in the teaching force 
of any city during the year under consideration, in addition to its primary purpose 
of showing the number of teachers’ places provided. That this double object 1s se- 
cured in only a comparatively small number of cases is due to a cause that will, of 
course, speedily disappear. 
Certain correspondents have been doubtful as to the proper treatment of rented 
rooms and buildings in replying to the question for Column 27. The combinations of 
circumstances that arise are so numerous that it is difficult to form a rule that will 
be satisfactory for universal application; but generally, all buildings, rented or 
otherwise, that contain independent schools should be counted. When only 1, 2, or 
even 3 rooms are rented or built merely to accommodate the ‘ overflow” from an’ 
adjacent school-house, it would hardly be proper to consider the “annex ” as an ad- 
ditional building. The ‘number of buildings” is of value in that it tends to show 
the policy pursued by any city in the erection of school-houses, for it is by no means 
settled whether large or small buildings are most advantageous. If this principal 
object of the inquiry be remembered, superintendents will probably have but little 
difficulty in the exercise of their discretion, when the correct reply is involved in 
doubt. 
The systems employed in keeping the accounts of receipts and expenditures are 
nearly as numerous as the cities themselves, and it.was with the columns pertaining 
to finances that the greatest difficulties experienced in the preparation of this table 
were encountered. The methods of book-keeping of all the cities doubtless accord 
with local usages and needs, but for purposes of comparison with other school organ- 
izations many of the systems used are wofully deficient, for the reason that they fail 
to take into account many of the items that are generally considered essential.. The 
facts set forth in the accompanying table are commended to school officers as having 
been found by the foremost educators of the country to be of prime importance, and 
easily obtainable. Other items are often necessary to supply local wants, and in the 
larger cities further subdivision is desirable, but it is infrequent that circumstances 
occur to render objectionable a classification similar to that of this table. 
The attention of superintendents has been often drawn to the importance of uni- 
formity in this respect, and the improvement resulting has been constant and grati- 
fying, but much still remains to be done before comparisons, satisfactory in every par- 
ticular, can be instituted between any and all the cities in the country.

GENERAL RECOGNITION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF NORMAL TRAINING. 
In a review of the work for the professional training of teachers during the past 
year the conclusion is unavoidable that it has been one of marked advance and 
effectiveness. Froni all quarters come encouraging reports of increased interest and 
intelligent zeal in the line of the teacher’s profession; and the larger appropriations, 
. the thorough repair and enlargement of existing institutions and appliances, the 
establishment of new schools upon most liberal and approved patterns, the eager 
crowds of students seeking admission, as well as the growing demand on the part of 
_ the public for better and professionally trained teachers, indicate that pedagogy, as 
a profession, is beginning to receive the consideration due its usefulness and its prime 
importance. The pivotal question, after all, in discussing this subject, is the question 
of the teacher: ‘this question of learning, skill, and personal power in the teacher is 
- really that before which all others pale; and when it is fully settled, the knowledge 
which is of most value will find its way into the schools and the minds of the people 
as easily and naturally as the sunshine finds its way into every nook of the landscape.” 
Courses of study and methods of instruction lead quickly to the question, ‘Who are 
to do the teaching and the supervising?” Like other instruments of vast power, the 
‘public school system may be greatly abused, and whether it is or not will depend 
unainly on the intelligence, education, and devotion of teachers and supervisors. The 
teacher makes the school. If the teacher be abundantly competent, the school is 
aboundingly good. No improved text, no new apparatus, no Pestalozzian methods, 
no frequent examinations, no careful supervision, can take the place of the teacher; 
and in all discussion of the subject it is needful to bear this truth in mind. 
Norma ScHoo1s. 
Among the most generally approved appliances and methods in vogue for the fur- 
therance of this great end—the professional training of teachers—first in point of 
efficiency and value are the public normal schools. Much has been said, pro and con, 
by educators and the public in general regarding the true province and importance 
of these schools. It is now no longer a question, however, as to the necessity of the 
normal school to the well-being of a system of State public schools. Nearly all the 
States now recognize this fact, and in some of the older Commonwealths liberal sup- 
port is given to from two to eleven of these institutions. It is considered bad economy 
to expend millions for the support of common schools, and then Jeave the instruction _ 
of the children of the State in unskilled hands. Scholarship, although of primary 
importance, is no longer deemed a sufficient qualification. _There are laws under- 
lying the art of instruction and the science of teaching, the recognition and applica- 
tion of which are as necessary to successful practice as in the case of any other occu- 
pation.? Perhaps the most convincing proof of the estimation in which these schools 
are held is the fact of the large and increasing appropriations of money made for their 
support in those States where they have had a thorough trial. Experience has proved 
that a normal school under the care and direction of the State is a necessary part of 
a State educational system; that good schools cannot be had without properly trained

teachers, and to supply these no agency has been found so efficient as properly con- 
ducted normal schools where education is taught as a seience and teaching as a high 
art.! a 
Three new public schools are reported to this Bureau as having been established 
during the past year. The Territorial Normal School at Tempe, Ariz., owns grounds, pe 
buildings, and apparatus valued at $10,000, and received a Territorial appropriation of , 
$5,000. During its first session there were enrolled 53 students and 5 normal grad- 
uates, taught by 1 professor. The State Normal School at Clarion, Pa., was organized 
in the spring of 1887 with 10 professors and 147 students. This institution received a 
State appropriation of $30,000, and is valued at $100,000. The Winthrop Training: 
School at Columbia, 8. C., owes its origin to the liberality of the Peabody fund, hav- 
ing received for the purpose a donation of $1,500. One student from each county of 
the State is received free of charge for tuition, which gives it the semblance of a State 
school. Besides these new schools, enlargements and repairs are reported from many 
of the older institutions. A notable example is that of Pennsylvania, in which State 
ten out of eleven State normal schools have received important improvements and 
additions in the matter of buildings, ete. The Indiana Normal College, an institu- 
tion under private auspices, has been established at Covington, Ind., and reports 10 
professors, 105 students, and 10 normal graduates during the year. 
Three States will report additional normal schools next year. California is build- 3 
ing one at Chico, in the northern part of the State; Alabama is adding another at ote 
Troy; and Florida reports provision for a normal school at De Funiak Springs. Legis- * 
lative provision has been made for one also at Oneonta, N. Y., and one for colored 
teachers in Kentucky. Nebraska and other States need more schools, besides those 
already established; Michigan must provide increased accommodations for the stu- 
dents of that State desiring professional training; Nevada asks that its university be . 
conducted for the present as a State normal school; while North Carolina and South : 
Carolina are persistently demanding a normal school in their respective States for the 
education of white teachers. The demand for professionally trained teachers is still 
largely in excess of the supply. In some States the need of competent teachers is so 
urgent that many pupils remain only one year at the normal school before assuming 
the responsibilities of the profession. 
COURSE OF STUDY. 
In regard to the course of study in the State normal schools, the standard in many 
instances is being gradually raised. The tendency is to abolish preparatory depart- 
jnents, and to make the schools more strictly professional in character as fast as the 
higher graramar grades and the high schools can supply properly qualified candidates. 
In many of the schools there are two courses of study: an elementary—usually of 2 
years—for the preparation of teachers for the primary and lower grades of the common 
schools, and a higher course of 1 or 2 years additional to qualify teachers for positions 
in the grammar and high school grades. Satisfactory examination in the common 
school branches is the ordinary qualification for admission as regards scholarship. 
The age of eligibility ranges from fifteen years and over, though in a few cases, as at 
the Philadelphia Normal School for Girls, the limit is brought down to fourteen years; 
Tuition is mostly free to normal students, who are required to pledge themselves to 
teach after graduation. Text-books are furnished at some schools, and expenses of 
board, fees, and incidentals are brought down to a low figure at all the schools. 
Diplomas are awarded at these institutions, and are recognized in many States as 
first-grade certificates, obviating the necessity of further examination. 
No common pattern for all normal schools can be established, for they have at all 
times and in all places accommodated themselves to circumstances, teaching their 
pupils what they needed as teachers. These schools are created by authority of the 
different States, and to the scope and plan of organization prescribed by law they 
must conform. In the summary, by States and Territories, of the normal training 
provided for teachers will be found an indication of the need of each section and the 
provision being made to supply it. The courses of study at representative schools of 
the East, South, and West are herewith given.

In all the large cities the problem of supplying the schools with well qualified Ciry Trarina Scuoors. 
teachers is one of pressing importanee. The State normal schools, many of which 
have borne an honorable part in the educational progress of the last twenty years, 
are utterly inadequate to furnish teachers for all the schools. This fact, and the 
wish to give a systematic and homogeneous character to the instruction, have in- 
duced most of the large cities to establish normal schools or training classes to sup- 
ply their own schools with teachers. Theso two classes of normal schools act in per 
tect harmony, and, under somewhat different conditions, labor for the same ends. 
While the State normal schools are generally co-educational, the city training 
‘schools are usually for young ladies exclusively; and ag the professional course is 
seldom more than a year in len, 
usually equivalent to that of high school graduates, 
Mr. S. 8 gth, the scholarship required for admission is higher, 
A. Ellis, city superintendent of public schools at Rochester, N. ¥., has kindly 
furnished this Bureau with a statement of the plan of the normal training class of 
that city, an outline of which is here given: 
(1) Condifjon of entrance.—Each applicant for membership must be cighteen years of age, and must have received at least three years of academic training. 
(2) Zime.—The course embraces the forty weeks of the school year. Tho class meets for one hour each week to discuss the topic assigned the previous week. 
(3) Subjects.—The subjects studied are— 
(a) Education. 
(b) Teachers’ qualifications, 
(¢) School organization, management, and discipline, 
(@) Duties of teachers in reference to the physical, moral, and intellectual well- being of pupils. Z 
(e) History of pedagogy. 
(f) Psychology—its practical application to the work of teaching. 
(g) Mental philosophy in its application to the work of teaching, 
(h) Methods of teaching the various’school branches. . 
(i) Moral training. 
(4) Method of study 
tributed to the class a      Questions upon each topic are arranged, printed, and dis- eek or more previous to the discussion of that topic. Mem-

bers of the class are required to prepare for the discussion by the study of the books 
of any good author, by personal observation, by conversation with those who have 
given attention to the subject, and by their own thinking and reasoning. 
(5) Programme of weekly meeting : ; 
(a) Roll call. ‘ 
(0) Literary quotations from six or eight members of the class, these having been 
previously appointed for the purpose. 
(c) Reading of the minutes of the previous meeting by any one upon whom the 
leader may call, and additions and corrections. 
(d) The leader calls upon members of the class in turn (using cards) to answer 
and discuss the questions in the printed list, opportunity being given for 
voluntary remarks or questions upon each topic thus discussed. 
(6) Reference library.—Books of leading authors upon all subjects in the course of 
study, from a reference library for the special use of training class. 
(7) Examination certificates.—A second-grade certificate is given to each member of 
the class who passes succéssfully the examination given at the close of the year’s work, 
which is good for one year of teaching. At the expiration of that time, a!l who shall 
have demonstrated their ability to manage and instruct a class of pupils receive 
first-grade certificates, which entitle them to teach in any position in the public 
schools below the high school, except as principal. 
(8) Practice.—All substitutes and temporary assistants are taken from the training 
class, as well as nearly all appointments to permanent positions. 
MopeEL ScHOOLs. 
The value of practice schools has often been the subject of discussion. At the pres- 
ent time, however, all authorities are well nigh unanimous in recognizing the useful- 
ness and necessity of practice schools, or some other provision for actual school-room 
work for young teachers, before they enter upon the work independently. As a mat- 
ter of fact, provision of some kind for training, or practice teachtng, is made almost 
everywhere in institutions where teachers are educated. If the query arises: “Can 
these model schools be conducted successfully to the real benefit of the student-teach- 
ers and without injury to the young pupils?” the eviderce at hand would seem to 
answer in the affirmative. In spite of certain inherent difficulties of managing a prac- 
tice school with success, and although it is no doubt true that many of these schools 
are not model schools, experience has shown that it is quite possible for them to com- 
pete with the public schools of the respective localities, and even to surpass them in 
efficiency and excellency of management. Of the Toronto Practice School it has 
peen said by a very competent judge that ‘‘ the instruction is of the best kind. The 
fees of admission are higher than those of the high school. Notwithstanding Toronto 
is abundantly supplied with excellent schools, the model school has 400 pupils, all it 
can accommodate, and more than 1,000 registered applicants are waiting their turn 
to enter.” Careful supervision of the work of the young teacher, and conscientious 
preparation on his part under proper guidance, go far to make up for certain advan- 
tages which the regular public school may have over such a practice school; so that 
the latter ranks high relatively, if not absolutely. It is evident, however, that the 
value of practice teaching to the student-teacher depends largely on the criticism 
which follows it; in criticising, ‘reasons based upon a sound philosophy should be 
given for the opinions expressed and conclusions reached.” This condition is not 
always easily fulfilled, but it is by no means unattainable. 
Of 124 public normal schools tabulated for the past year, 84 report practice train- 
ing schools attached. These are of several grades, in some instances beginning with 
the kindergarten and including all the intermediate grades through pe grammar 
school. Many of the city training schools are model schools entirely, & primary or 
grammar school being assigned for the purpose, in which the pupil-teachers have 
daily practice under the supervision of an experienced instructor. Recitations and 
lectures on professional subjects furnish opportunity for acquiring knowledge of the 
theory as exemplified in the practice of the art. ; 
‘The system of ‘‘apprenticeship,” as practised by the pupils of the State Normal 
School at Worcester, Mass., is worthy of note: 
The student, after three terms, or a year and a half in the normal school, is allowed 
to go into one of the public schools of the city of Worcester to serve as assistant to 
the teacher of that school; to take part in the instruction, management, and general 
work of teaching, under the direction of the teacher; and even to act as substitute 
for the teacher for an hour, a half-day or a day, at the discretion of the latter and 
with the approval of the superintendent. Qne student only at a time is assigned to   
any one teacher; but each student serves in at least three grades of schools in the + 
course of his term of service, the duration of which is six months, or half a schooi 
year. After finishing his apprenticeship, the student resumes his course at the nor- 
mal school, spending another half-year there before receiving his diploma.

MODEL SCHOOLS. 401 
  During the period of apprenticeship, four days of each week are devoted exclu- 
sively to it by those employed in the work. One day of the week (Wednesday) is 
spent by them in the normal school, where they are employed, not in the ordinary 
study and work of the institution, but in the following manner: They hold such 
consultation with the teachers of the school and make such use of books as may be 
most helpful to them in their immediate work as apprentices; they make informal 
statements to the school of such facts of their experience as may be of advantage to 
the other students to hear,—concerning ways of teaching, cases of discipline and the 
like,—keeping in mind always the private character of the daily life of the school 
room, and under special warning against revelations that might seem objectionable, 
Each apprentice keeps a diary of the occupation and experience of every day’s sery- 
ice, and this record is inspected by the faculty of the normal school. He also makes 
out a report at the end of his term, in which he gives his own estimate of his success 
in his work, 8 
The apprenticeship is designed to give the student practical acquaintance with the 
work of teaching, and training in that work. It is founded in the conviction that, 
whether education be a science or not, teaching in the public schools of Massachu- 
setts is an art,—an art to the successful practice of which there is need of some ini- 
tiation under the guidance of experience and skill; an initiation akin to that which 
an apprentice passes through in learning his trade. 
A secondary purpose is to furnish the faculty of the normal school with more full 
and satisfactory data for their estimate of the teaching ability of students. How 
the recruits will behave under fire cannot be determined by drill in the manual, or 
by dress parade. ‘The apprenticeship goes far towards answering the important 
question. The apprentice is visited by the faculty of the normal school while en- 
gaged in his work, and is carefully observed and assisted by suggestions. The teacher 
of each school in which he has served makes out a report of the appréntice work 
of the pupil-teacher, on a scale of ten credits, showing the number of absences and 
tardinesses, power of control, power of interesting, skill in questioning, skill in ex- 
plaining and illustrating, enthusiasm, bearing, with remarks on weakness or defi- 
ciency, and what traits of excellence (if any) have been shown in teaching or man- 
agement. 
eThe additional 6 months of preparation required by the system under consideration 
secure to the student greater maturity of body and mind. The need of such matur- 
ity is apparent in the caso of the majority of those who enter upon the work of 
teaching. 
That a object of the apprenticeship is attainable by the plan adopted, is not 
merely probable, but is already matter of experience. The method, although be- 
lieved to be new in this country, is not in itself a thing new or untried. 
The German system of public education requires of the candidate for the oftice of 
teacher a season of service under direction, of probation under supervision, the es- 
sential elements of which are embodied in this apprenticeship. Something like it 
also prevails extensively in England. 
Moreover, the method is simply the extension of one that was for five years in sue- 
cessful operation in this school. The students are found to derive from their expe- 
rience a fresh interest in their chosen work. They realize the practical bearings of 
the principles and methods they have studied; they acquire the “courage of having 
done the thing before”; they test their remedies for the school diseases of inatten- 
tion, disobedience, and the like, by trial on actual patients; they acquire skill that 
is of vast moment to them at the critical period when they take charge, as teachers, 
of their first school. 
It is no small evidence of good results that the school board of the city of Wor- 
cester heartily approve the system on the ground of the benefit accruing indirectly 
to the city schools, through the greater fitness of the apprentices to become teachers. 
As the student of the normal school who passes successfully through the period of 
apprenticeship receives a certificate of the fact in connection with his diploma at 
graduation, the extra time required for the experience must in almost every case be 
more than made good by the greater probability of securing a position, and the 
greater likelihood of success at the outset of the teacher’s career. 
There are, however, individuals in the school for whom it is impossible or imprac- 
ticable to undertake this special preparation. The apprenticeship is not enforced 
upon any student; it is simply recommended. Individuals who do not enter upon it 
enjoy all the advantages of the school with this single exception.! 
PHYSICAL AND MANUAL TRAINING AT NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
In the matter of physical training, calisthenics and light gymnastics are the means 
most generally employed. Free movements, wands, rings, dumb-bells, Indian clubs, 
bars, chest-weights, etc., are in use, with out-door sports, and at some schools military

drill for male pupils. Well-equipped gymnasiums are provided at a number of the 
institutions, with special instructors, as at the Nashville Normal College, where an 
hour’s exercise in the gymnasium is required on alternate days, under the charge of a 
lady and a gentleman director. Manual training is furnished chiefly in the construc- 
tion of apparatus, with practice in the use of tools in schools where workshops have 
been established. At the Female Normal School at Salem, Mass., the use of carpen- 
ter’s tools is taught to those ladies who may desire such instruction. At most of the 
normal schools for colored pupils industrial training is provided in connection with 
normal instruction; and at Hantpton, Va., this is made compulsory, both as a matter 
of discipline and in order that the colored teacher may be self-supporting during the 
long intervals between the sessions of colored schools. 
At white State normal schools where such instruction is given, it isnot claimed that 
students are necessarily introduced to what is known as manual training, as this is 
not the primary object. The object is to enable students to futnish for themselves, 
at small expense, the apparatus which can be used for teaching elementary science 
in their future schools. This end may be fully accomplished, and none go out with- 
out an equipment which is ample at the beginning of their work. They also possess 
the ability to enlarge and perfect this equipment as occasion demands. Teachers 
thus supplied have the means of objective teaching no matter where they go, and 
the construction of such apparatus is stimulating to teachers, while the possession of 
it carries interest and delight as well as useful knowledge to the common schools.! 
In urging the necessity for manual and industrial training in the New York Normal 
College, where the course is four years, President Hunter says: 
Inasmuch as the chief difficulty encountered in engrafting manual training on the 
common school system is the want of competent teachers, 1 would suggest that such 
teachers could be easily trained in the normal college, and a sufficient number pre- 
pared in a year or two to enable your board to introduce manual training in all the 
primary and female grammar schools of the city. If manual and industrial training 
is to become a part of the public school curriculum, the normal college is the proper 
place to make a beginning. At the end of the second year in the college, at the time 
when the professional work is begun, the students, through their parents, could be 
permitted to select either of two normal courses,—a normal course (the same as at 
present), or a normal course for manual and industrial training. This change could 
be made at a moderate cost, aud the superior intelligence of our students would 
quickly enable them to master all the mysteries of manual training as far as it may 
be carried out in the common schools. ‘The change would have this advantage, too, 
it would relieve the pressure by the regular graduates for positions as teachers of the 
ordinary classes in the common schools; and, above all, it would provide excellent 
employment for that class of students whose aptitudes run in the line of handicraft 
rather than in that of purely intellectual work.” 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
In discussing the professional training cu teachers, next to normal schools in im- 
portance, we must notice teachers’ institutes, associations, conventions, and reading 
circles. For the great mass of teachers who either from lack of time, means, or op- 
portunity, have failed to acquire a special Use in normal schools for the work of 
their profession, there is no instrumentality so helpful and so potent for good as the 
teachers’ institute. This important feature of professional preparation has received 
recognition in this country for the last half century, and in the same year with the 
establishment of the two oldest normal schools in America, the first institute for 
teachers was held in the city of Hartford, Conn. So general is the recognized impor- 
tance of this work that the States, with few exceptions, and also several of the Ter- 
ritories, have incorporated in the school lawsa proviso for teachers’ institutes, making 
attendance compulsory, and, in some instances, withholding teachers’ certificates and 
imposing penalties for non-attendance. For two decades after their introduction, 
teachers’ institutes led a desultory sort of existence, tentative and fragmentary, ex- 
periencing rebuffs of fortune, apathetic consideration at the hands of teachers and ed- 
ucators generally, though most seriously retarded by lack of interest and the para- 
lyzing conservatism of legislators who failed to see the necessity or importance of these 
“neripateticnormals.” Credit isdue the New England States, however, for their early 
legislation on the subject, and the readiness with which the teaching fraternity ac- 
cepted these powerful and necessary aids to educational progress. ‘The Middle and 
several of the Western States, likewise, soon awoke to the practical value of insti- 
tutes, and as early as 1847 we find legislative appropriations for these in New York 
State, which have been continued uninterry; tedly since that date. 
» Dennison Olmstead, a graduate of Yale, projected a plan for a schoolmaster’s acad- 
emy in 1816; and Professor Kingsley, of the same institution, in 1823, proposed that 
intermediate schools be maintained in every county for thorough training of those

who desired to teach in the common schools. Rey. Thomas H. Gallaudet advocated 
teachers’ seminaries in a series of essays published in 1825, but the credit of the first 
regularly organized teachers’ institute was reserved for Hon. Henry Barnard, then sec- 
retary of the board of education of the State of Connecticut, who with a few friends 
conducted the first meeting of the kind of which we have record, in October, 1839, 
in the city of Hartford. A class of 26 young men was assembled, and for 6 weeks they 
were instructed by able teachers and lecturers, reviewing and extending the topics 
then usually taught in common schools, and receiving thorough instruction in peda- 
gogics with the advantage of observation in the public schools of the city. In the 
spring of 1840 a similar arrangement was made for female teachers, but for several 
years afterwards there were no meetings of asimilar character. New York held its first 
institute in 1843, which was the first so named, and which was conducted by J. S. Den- 
man, school superintendent of Tompkins County. This meeting lasted two weeks, and 
was a revelation of the new agent in school improvement. Rhode Island and Massa- 
chusetts took up the work in 1845; New Hampshire and Vermont in 1846, with Maine 
the year following. The western country, largely peopled by settlers from the more 
cultured eastern States, was not slow in building up schools and following out the 
lines of educational advancement as far as the sparsely settled districts would permit. 
Indiana reports an institute in 1846, believed to have been the first held in the State. 
Ohio had one in 1847, while Wisconsin held educational meetings somewhat like 
teachers’ institutes before it assumed the dignity of Statehood in 1848, 
Only meagre details of the form and scope of these pioneer institutes are accessible. 
They were often more of teachers’ conventions than what we now understand as 
normal institutes; yet they gave an impetus to educatienal work, and inspired a 
feeling of dignity and pride in the profession that has been invaluable in the results 
to the cause of common school education. It is not to be supposed that they were 
generally of as long duration, or as professional in character, as the first institute 
held by Dr. Barnard. They were properly experimental, and, doubtless, usually dis- 
connected and fragmentary, for at that early day the public school system itself was 
by no means efficient, and normal schools for the professional training of teachers had 
just made their advent upon the educational horizon. While in Wisconsin the present 
system of institutes grew out of the establishment of normal schools and pedagogical 
departments in seminaries, in Iowa the first statutory organization for the improve- 
ment of teachers in public schools was called a “teachers’ institute,” and for along © 
time these migratory academie supplied the place of schools of professional training. 
These early assemblies of teachers were purely voluntary, and grew out of ambitious 
endeavors to keep abreast of the progress of the age, and a conscientious desire to 
qualify themselves for the responsibilities of their position. Experience has corrected 
many of the evils of the earlier systems, and well-nigh perfected the teachers’ insti- 
tute as an essential factor in educational training. ¢ 
It is sometimes urged by those who have either insufficient knowledge of the sub- 
ject, or whose observation has comprehended only ill-conducted institutes, or those 
too ambitious in scope, and consequently superficial, that teachers’ institutes inter- 
fere with the work of normal schools. ‘They claim that the teacher students acquire 
only a smattering of the branches professedly taught, with a modicum of practical 
training; or else, by an energetic and systematic ‘‘cramming” process, they are enabled 
to pass the required examination and secure the coveted teacher's certificate, and 
thus swell the army of incompetents, whose chief work is the ‘artificial production 
of stupidity in schools.” This impression is erroneous, as may be learned from the 
testimony of principals of normal schools, who, from their opportunities of observing 
results as conductors of institutes and at the same time professors in normal schools, 
are the best authority on the subject. As a body they indorse the teachers’ institute 
as absolutely necessary to qualify the great mass of new recruits who each year enter 
the profession; and instead of creating the belief that the institute is a sufficient prep- 
aration for the work of teaching, as is sometimes alleged, these organizations, when 
wisely conducted, convince the teacher of his need of thorough training, and incite 
in many an ambition to pursue a complete normal course. Properly managed insti- 
tutes are useful auxiliaries to normal schools where such exist, and they are impor- 
tant, though not perfect, substitutes where none exist. Even with normal schools 
established and supported by law, it is absolutely impossible to confine instruction 
in practical pedagogics to these institutions. The increase in population in the United 
States will always create a demand for competent teachers which the normal schools 
will be unable to supply, so that the great body of reserves must rely upon the insti- 
tutes for practical training for their sphere of labor. 
The legitimate and formal province of teachers’ institutes, and their direct work, |   is practical and progressive instruction in methods and principles of teaching, and in, . 
organizing, conducting, and controlling schools. These objects are effected in a vari- 
ety of ways. The managers must consider the educational status of the locality in 
which the institute is held, as well as the most important needs of the teachers who 
are to be instructed. In a community where normal schools of approved excellence

  i ‘ 1 
404 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
have been in operation for some years, the institutes may be of short duration. Their 
aim, under such circumstances, is to revive the spirit and confidence of teachers, 
awaken a pride in the profession, stimulate to self-improvement, and by a progress- 
ive course of study and instruction review the branches taught in the schools, and 
increase the practical acquirements of the teachers. 
Where normal schools are few and small, or not yet established, where the public 
as well as teachers need to be enlightened, and where the attendance is voluntary, 
the institute acquires at once much greater importance as q factor in educational 
training. Under such conditions it assumes the proportion and duties of an itinerant 
teachers’ seminary, and very properly extends its sessions into weeks instead of days, 
enlarging the scope of instruction, and increasing the number of methods and appli- 
ances for promoting efficiency and retaining popularity. Many of the mistakes which 
occur in the management of institutes, as conducted at present, arise from want of 
policy in not allowing this difference to govern the amount, kind, and method of 
instruction given. 
Continued interest is manifest in the teachers’ institute. In some States, indeed, 
this method of preparation supplies chiefly and well-nigh exclusively the lack of 
normal schools. In Delaware, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Arkansas, Colo- 
rado, and Nevada, these ‘‘ migratory normals” are a power for good, and even in some 
* States having one or more well-appointed normal schools, a vigorous and progressive 
system of institutes is maintained, attendance being made compulsory. Some of the 
States while requiring institutes to be held, make no appropriation for the expense, 
though, as a rule, provision is made for this purpose from the public school fund. - 
Teachers’ meetings are held in nearly every town having a graded system of pub- 
lic schools. These are helpful in systematizing the instruction given in the schools, 
in strengthening weak teachers, in advancing and discussing both methods and mat- 
ter, and in stimulating a healthy ambition and professional pride in the corps of 
teachers. Educational conventions are held in every State and in nearly all of the 
Territories. New Mexico has recently formed an association for the express purpose 
of promoting the educational interests of the Territory, and the prospects bid fair 
for success. Few, if any, States are without a State teachers’ association, meeting 
annually or semi-annually for the discussion of educational problems. Sections of 
States, counties, cities, towns, and townships have their associations of teachers, all 
with one end in view—the improvement of the schools through the teacher, ~* 
TEACHERS’ READING CIRCLES. 
In the profession of teaching, as in other professions, the highest success must de- 
pend both upon a general culture and upon a technical training. General culture is 
_needed that the teacher may be kept from the narrowness of a merely professional 
life, and a technical or professional training is requisite that he may be successful in the 
details of his work. The most available means for acquiring this training, outside of 
normal schools and institutes, is attendance at teachers’ meetings, at State and local 
associations, visits of inspection to schools of acknowledged excellence, the formation 
of a teachers’ library, aud membership in a reading circle for the study of professional 
subjects as sét forth in books treating upon the theory and practice of teaching, in 
books upon applied psychology and physiology, and in educational periodicals. 
Of the value of reading circles as a means for general culture, Chancellor Vincent, of 
Chautauqua, says: ‘“ Reading circles give opportunities to those who cannot, or who 
think they cannot, attempt thorough study. If they once taste good literature and 
test their own capacity to appreciate and profit by it, under a system which requires 
nothing but ‘reading,’ they will be more likely to address themselves to the severer 
tasks of study. Reading circles, through the power of association, will promote en- 
thusiasm in intellectual and literary pursuits, increase popular interest in local courses 
of scientific and literary lectures, lead to greater care in selecting the books which 
find a place in the house, tone up conversation, elevate the standard of household 
decoration, and in many ways improve the social standing of the family. These cir- 
cles may embrace a wide range of literature, and thus bring within the reach of ‘the 
people’ the world of the learned, with its visions, pleasures, and inspirations. Read- 
ing circles may be organized to pursue courses in art, travel, history, current news, 
. and all other subjects which are involved in a broad culture and in wholesome living.”! 
As an aid to teachers the possibilities of this educational factor are very great. 
Though the methods now in vogue may not be all that can be hoped for, yet with 
its erudeness tho teachers’ reading circle is perhaps the most valuable agency in ex- 
istence to-day for the improvement of the rural schools, as these associations must 
supply the place of normal schools and institutes to a large part of the teachers of 
country schools. Whatever of knowledge they obtain of the theory and art of teach- 
ing, and whatever promptings they receive to enter upon the study of mind, and know 
something of the laws of its growth, may be set down largely to the credit of the

reading circle. As to the true significance of the reading circle work, President Allyn, 
of Illinois, says: ‘‘ The work of the teachers’ reading circles is inthe direction of health- 
ful mental and moral progress. Noone canreada food book without profit, and when 
such a book is in the line of one’s life work it is both aninspiration and motive power,” 
The first organized effort in the direction of the reading circle idea seems to have 
had its beginning in a London “society to encourage home study,” founded about 
1870. A similar society was organized in Massachusetts in 1873, followed in 1878-79 
by the most notable reading circle in existence—the ‘‘ Chautauqua Literary and Sci- 
entific Circle.” ! 
The State teachers’ reading circles are of more recent date. In Ohio,a common 
course of reading was marked out for teachers in 1882, and they were generally en- 
rolled in a reading club for the purpose of uniformity of work. 
Wisconsin claims to have suggested a similar plan at an earlier day, but to Ohio 
belongs the distinction of organizing the first State teachers’ association, which was 
perfected in the year 1883. Indiana followed in 1884, and at present more than 
twenty States have State teachers’ reading circles. It has been estimated that at 
least 75,000 teachers in the United States are reading methodically and systemati- 
cally works bearing upon professional and general culture. 
The objects of the State teachers’ reading circles are substantially the same, 
namely, the improvement of the members in literary, scientific, and professional 
knowledge and the promotion of habits of self-culture. This end is sought by pre- 
scribing a certain course of study, securing books at reduced rates, preparing lists of 
the best educational publications, by offering advice and direction to the methods of 
reading and study, by examinations of the work done, and by certificates of profi- 
ciency. 2 
‘The act of organizing the State circle has generally been accomplished at the an- 
nual assembly of the State teachers’ associations, and the work is usually carried on 
under the control of this association. Directors, boards of management, etc., are 
chosen, who map out the course and direct the work of the circle. County and local 
circles aré also formed, subsidiary to the general or State circle, and even individual 
members may pursue the course alone. r 
The conditions of membership are liberal, any teacher or other person being received 
who promises to pursue the prescribed course of study and pays the small fee—usually 
25 cents or 50 cents annually. Meetings of local circles for conference, discussion, and 
reviow are held once a week in some States, and biweekly in others. 
The course of study is usually outlined and published in the educational journals 
and in the county papers. In the preparation of these outlines a department of study 
is under the special supervision of some member of the State board. The object of 
this study is twofold, namely, professional and general culture. As for the promi- 
nence given to one or the other of these subjects, that will be determined by the 
actual needs of the teachers. The fourth year’s reading (1886-87) for the Ohio Teach- 
ers’ Reading Circle is given herewith, to indicate the general scope of such studies: 
I. Psychology.—Sully’s Teachers’ Hand-Book of Psychology. ef 
Il. Literature.—‘‘ Hamlet” and ‘‘As You Like It;” selections from Wordsworth. ' 
Ill. History.—Barnes’ Brief General History of the World, or Thalheimer’s General 
History. 
IV. Political Economy.—Gregory’s Political Economy, or Chapin’s First Principles of 
Political Economy; with at least one educational periodical. 
In a majority of the States provision is made for stated examinations of the work 
performed, and certificates are awarded with diplomas upon completion of the course. 
The Union Reading Circle, a paper published in the interest of this work, reports (June, 
1887) three new societies in Georgia, two in Kentucky, five in Iowa, and twelve others 
in as many different States. Memorial days are now the fashion, the poets Bryant, 
Longfellow, and Tennyson, with Dickens and other literary men, receiving their sharo 
of honor in various places. The Agassiz Society, of Philadelphia, promises tomake the 
summer vacation a grand opportunity for scientific research and study, and each one 
will contribute towards the common museum. The Gesenius, a new circle of Cleve- 
land, makes Hebrew a specialty, as the Xenophon Society carries on the systematic 
study of Greek. The Curtis Society, of Buffalo, N. Y., studies politics and discusses all> 
questions of reform. The Tulane Home Study and Reading Society is organized with 
headquarters at Tulane University, New Orleans, La. 
Besides the State associations, others claiming a national character have been or- 
ganized. In 1885 the Teachers’ National Reading Circle was legally incorporated 
under the laws of New York. Prof. W. H. Payne, of Michigan, was chosen president, 
supported by 18 directors, constituting the official board. This organization provides 
18 courses of reading, 6 being professional, 3 in general culture, and 9 non-profes- 
sional. In the first, 27 books are recommended. Each course includes 3 groups of 
studies, 2 books in each group, and any course (three books for the year) may be taken 
by the reader. Diplomas will be granted to members who pass the three different ex-

aminations in some one prescribed course, and who prepare an accepted thesis on some 
educational topic connected with the reading. 
The Chautauqua Teachers’ Reading Union is a recent department of the Chautau- 
qua University, and is under the personal supervision of Hon. J. W, Dickinson, secre- 
tary of the State board of education of Massachusetts and also principal of the de- 
partment of pedagogy in the university. The course of study covers three years, a 
certificate being awarded for each year’s work. The annual membership fee is 50 
cents. The first year’s reading includes (1) principles and methods of education, (2) 
general culture; the second year: (1) history of education, (2) primary and kinder- 
garten work, (3) general culture; the third year: (1) psychology, (2) school econom- 
ics and school supervision, (3) political science, (4) general culture. 
The educational department of Canada prescribes a course of reading for teachers, 
purely voluntary, and hence followed by no examination, The department provides, 
however, that, ‘‘should the teachers of any inspectorial division agree to read the 
course with this end in view, and should the county board of examiners make ade- 
quate provision for such examination, the department would recognize, by special 
certificate, this additional element of professional culture.”! 
SumMER ScHOOLS ror TEACHERS, 
Summer schoois are growing in numbers and popularity each year. Recreation, 
pleasure, and study are here combined for the tired, worn-out teacher, while new 
methods and improved theories are presented by some of the ablest educators the - 
country affords, Some idea of the importance of this work may be learned from the 
statement that there were in various parts of the country no less than twenty differ- 
ent summer schools in active operation, with, it is believed, more than 2,000 students, 
the State of New York sending the largest number, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania 
the next largest. ‘The educationally awaked South sent to one school in the North 
no less than sixteen teachers, seven of whom came all the way from Louisiana.® 
It is the work of the several summer schools, organized in different localities, to 
train teachers in the more rational and natural methods which have been increasingly 
adopted in the most progressive schools of this country during the last 5 years. The 
new system is better for pupils, but is harder for teachers. It requires more inge- 
nuity, a wider observation and culture, as well as good literary attainments and 
special training, but in compensation for more exacting work in teaching, discipline 
of pupils is easier, and “dull” classes are no longer the béle noire of the school room. 
The editor of the Journal of Education, Boston, July 7, 1887, says: ‘Thirteen 
years only have passed since Dr. J. H. Vincent valled together a host of earnest men 
and.women at Lake Chautauqua, and already forty-five assemblies are under the 
same general plan, influenced largely by the same general management. It is this 
unanimity of action that enables these gatherings to Grin to our country such a man 
as President Fairbairn, of Mansfield College, Oxford, England; to bring from the 
Pacific coast such a teacher and lecturer as Col. Homer B. Sprague; and to take into 
an educational gathering men of such popular gifts as the Hons. George W. Bain, R. 
G. Horr, and John D. Long. 
“The managers of these assemblies, the men who organize classes, teaching and 
inspiring teachers, are men whose knowledge of the art and science of teaching gives 
them deserved prominence as educators. Dr.'Vincent stands, by natural tact and 
experience, at the head of this list. while Dr. J, L. Hurlbut, Dr. A. E, Dunning, Prof. 
R. §. Holmes, Dr. B. T. Vincent, and Dr. A. H. Gillet have, practically, equal skill as 
instructors and directors. Under their influence, public school teachers and teaching 
have in the warm season been yery generally left for professional schools at Chautau- 
qua, Saratoga, Asbury Park, Gone. Lake, Martha’s Vineyard, Glens Falls, Niagara 
Falls, Amherst, Ann Arbor, Normal Park, ete., but they have furnished high literary 
inspiration, close study of Shakspeare, Milton, and other English classics, as well as 
created the science of Sunday School teaching on pedagogical principles. The as- 
sembly idea is a success, with permanency insured. The forty-five assemblies of 1837 
will certainly be largely increased in the near future.” 
Following is a list of summer schools held during the summer of 1887, compiled 
from available data furnished this Bureau. In addition to these, a number of col-

PrusENT CONDITION OF NoRMAL TRAINING. 
The following general summary, by States, of the system and progress of professional 
schools aud appliances for the training of teachers, is compiled from the latest acces- 
sible reports of State and city superintendents, school laws bearing on the subject, 
catalogues and returns from normal schools, educational journals, etc. : 
ALABAMA. 
Alabama has 6 normal schools, 3 for white and 3 for colored students. These schools 
are located at Florence, Jacksonville, and Livingston for white pupils; and at Hunts- 
ville, Tuskegee, and Montgomery for colored pupils. The last named school was 
formerly at Marion. Hon, Solomon Palmer, State superintendent of education, reports 
these schools in a prosperous condition, and doing an invaluable work in furnishing 
the public schools of tlie State with well-qualified and well-trained teachers. 
The course of study covers from 2 to 4 years, and comprises mental science, peda- 
gogics, mathematics, English literature, ancient and modern languages, natural 
science, and yocal and instrumental music. At some of the schools there are college 
preparatory departments and post-graduate courses. Any student of suitable age 
.and attainments may enter, and tuition is free to normal pupils signing a pledge to 
teach 2 years in the public schools of the State after graduation. Diplomas for the 
entire normal course authorize the holders to teach in public schools of any grade 
without further examination, All the schools have practice work in model schools 
or sub-collegiate departments. 
The last General Assembly established a white normal school at Troy, Pike County. 
The citizens of the town, as soon as the bill became a law and the location decided 
upon, at once raised funds to erect for the accommodation of the school a suitable 
two-story brick building, which has been furnished and is now occupied. The school 
began its first session in September, 1887, and under the same management and in 
connection therewith a high and graded school is operated, with 10 teachers and 
nearly 300 pupils in all departments, including the normal,+ 
The Legislature repealed the act establishing a normal school for colored teachers 
at Marion, and in the same act provided for tho establishment of a ‘ university for 
colored students,” with an annual appropriation of $7,500 for current pxrenaey and 
$10,000 to procure suitable buildings. This school, with normal and industrial de- 
partments, is located at Montgomery, and has a large attendance. Provision was 
also made for another colored normal school in Greene County. 
In the schools for colored penile already established, industrial departments are 
maintained, largely through the liberality of the Slater fund, in which the trades for 
each sex are practically taught, a certain amount of this work being required, At 
Tuskegee farming is added to other industries, and this school has recently received 
a donation of $6,000 from a few Boston ladies for the general improvement of the 
institution, 
In addition to the State appropriation of $26,000 for normal schools and teachers’ 
institutes, the Peabody fund has been more liberal than ever before in its contribution 
to the same cause. For this purpose alone, not including other gifts from the same 
source, during the past year the fund has contributed to the State in the aggregate 
over $6,000, divided among the 13 normal scholarships at Nashville, white and colored 
normal schools in the State, and congressional teachers’ institutes, Of the 13 Ala- 
bama students holding State scholarships at the Normal College, at Nashville, Tenn.,

3 graduated in the class of 1887. Applicants for these scholarships are required to 
stand a competitive examination held at the various congressional institutes. 
Birmingham has a training school with a special course of one year for the prepara- 
tion of high school graduates, and others of equivalent qualifications for the work of 
teaching, with special reference to the schools of that city. The course comprises the 
usual pedagogical studies, with lectures and practice work. 
Decatur.—In this town teachers’ meetings are held at stated intervals. The teach- 
ers are specialists of experience, and mostly graduates of approved normal schools. 
Montgomery.—In this city lectures and teachers’ meetings are arranged and success- 
fully conducted. ~ 
Talladega has a normal class meeting every two weeks. 
Tuscaloosa has teachers’ meetings at the call of the superintendent. 
A new feature in educational matters for the past year was the Congressional Teach- 
ers’ Institute. Under the inspiration vf the progressive State superintendent, the 
Legislature made a special appropriation for an institute in each congressional district. 
The legislative appropriation of $500 was supplemented by a like amount from the 
Peabody fund, and with this sum the State superintendent conducted 15 institutes, 
10 for white and 5 for colored teachers. The interest awakened in the community at 
large is shown by the fact that wherever such assemblies were held the people offered 
strong resolutions thanking the instructors, the Legislature, and the State superin- 
tendent for this new departure in Alabama education. In addition to the congres- 
sional institutes, the State superintendent held annual county institutes in twenty- 
two counties. In each of these he reports a growing interest in the public schools 
among the people, and in many instances earnest efforts are made to establish and 
maintain schools of higher grade, which was shown by the anxious inquiry for well- 
qualified and successful teachers, by building more comfortable school-houses, and by 
very large and attentive audiences at the institute and other meetings held for edu- 
cational purposes.! 
The white and colored teachers maintain separate State associations, which are 
growing in numbers and importance. The sixth annual meeting of the State Teach- 
ers’ Association (white) was held at Tuscaloosa July 5-7, 1887, and is reported the 
largest and most successful ever convened. A resolution was passed endorsing the 
movement to erect an Alabama teachers’ home at Monteagle, and each teacher in the 
State was requested to contribute 50 cents or more to this enterprise. 
The Colored Teachers’ Association met in Birmingham, April 14-16, 1887. The 
State superintendent, speaking of this meeting, says: “No one can witness a gather- 
ing of these teachers, as I have done for the past two years in their annual meetings, 
without being impressed with their burning desire to secure the benefits of an edu- 
eation for their race, and with their wonderful progress since the war. They deserve 
encouragement by the State.”? 
The Alabama Teachers’ Reading Circle received an impetus at the first State normal 
institute, held at Florence in 1886, and a large number of teachers were enrolled. 
The first year’s course of reading selected was Barnes’s General History, Page’s Theory 
and Practice, Watts on the Mind, and selections from Hawthorne’s works. 
ARIZONA, 
This Territory established a normal school in 1885, located at Tempe, in Maricopa 
County, central Arizona, The school was first opened for instruction in 1886, and re- 
ports 53 students and 5 graduates for the year 1887. The course of study comprises 
an elementary and an advanced course; the former requiring 2 years, the latter 3 
years for completion. At the conclusion of either of these courses a corresponding 
diploma is granted which permits the holder to teach in the public schools of the Ter- 
ritory. The requirements for admission are 16 years of age; a valid certificate, either 
Territorial or county, of any grade; a diploma of graduation from any public gram- 
mar or high school; and an examination in the common branches for those not pos- 
sessing either a certificate or diploma. Tuition is free to those intending to teach in 
the public schools of the Territory and also to those nominated by a member of the 
Legislature. Others are charged $4 per month. A Territorial appropriation of $5,000 
was made for last year. The school reports the beginning of alibrary, and estimates 
the value of grounds, buildings, and apparatus at $10,000. 
‘Teachers’ institutes from 3 to 5 days each are required by law when the number of 
school districts will justify. Attendance is compulsory, and the expenses are drawn 
from the county school fund. 
ARKANSAS. 
The Branch Normal College of the Arkansas Industrial University, at Pine Bluff, 
is intended for the education of colored teachers. This school has been in operation 
since 1877, and is designed for “the training of teachers for effective service in the 
public schools of the State,” the law establishing the same having been enacted with 
¢ 1State Repotr. * Ibid.

special reference to the “convenience of the poorer classes.” ‘Two courses of study, 
covering 2 and 3 years respectively, include the usual normal branches. There is 110 
charge for tuition for appointees, the only requirement for admission being suitable 
age and qualifications, an appointment from one of. the county judges, and the pay- 
ment of $5 entrance fee. Students thus appointed are entitled to 4 years’ free tuition, 
and by the apportionment among the several counties of the State, according to the 
population, 395 students are entitled to the benefit of this law. 
The chief provision for the training of white teachers isin the Peabody normal 
scholarships at the Normal College at Nashville, Tenn., and the Peabody normal 
institutes held throughout the State. Of the 10 students at Nashville to which Ar- 
kansas is entitled, 2 graduated in the class of 1887. The normal institutes are of 
one week each, and are required by law to be held annually in each judicial district 
of the State. They are so distributed as to reach every section, and make attendance 
comparatively easy. The work of these normal institutes is intended to be plain and 
practical, and instruction in the best methods of teaching the common school branches 
is imparted by performing the work of a teacher before the class. 
The State superintendent commends the summer work of the institutes and affirms 
that they are an indispensable auxiliary to the development of first-class teachers, 
and suggests that the school laws be so amended that teachers be required to attend 
institutes, present reasonable excuses for their absence, or forfeit their certificates. 
The Peabody fund being insufficient for this purpose, he asks that it be supplemented 
by a reasonable appropriation from the State, and recommends that institutes of 4 
weeks be held in each congressional district. There are separate institutes for the 
white and colored races, though in some instances both attend the same meeting. A 
noticeable result of the normal institutes is the formation in a number of counties of 
regular teachers’ associations. 
‘he twentieth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at 
Lonoke, June 22-24, 1887. The Southwestern Arkansas Teachers’ Association met at 
Lewisville, October 9, 1886. 
Arkansas has a State teachers’ reading circle, Pulaski County teachers haveinau- - 
gurated a reading circle with a membership of over 70, and are following a course of 
reading and study relating especially to their work as teachers. 
CALIFORNIA. 
The normal schools of this State at Los Angeles and San José are reported to be in 
a most satisfactory condition. In the present arrangement of the schedule of studies, 
night study is diminished somewhat by allowing more time during the day. Close 
individual discrimination as to the comparative standing of students is done away 
with, and those in the upper third of the class are now considered as honorary stu- 
dents, without individualizing any above or below the line of demarkation. The 
positions of salutatorian and valedictorian are also abolished, which will prevent un- 
desirable competition for the honors. To summarize the recent reforms, they may be 
stated as emphasizing the technical features of the schools, improving the status of 
the faculty by making the tenure of professorship permanent, diminution of the over- 
burden of labor, and ‘the prevention of unhealthy competition for honors. Three 
years are required to complete the course of study, which consists of the usual branches 
taught in all grades of the public schools with approved professional work. 
New laws relating to the State normal schools were passed by the Legislature in 
March, 1887, of which the most noteworthy features are given. The names of the 
schools are changed from branch State normal to State normal schools. Among other 
duties, the boards of trustees are required ‘‘to establish and maintain training or 
model schools, and require the pupils of the normal schools to teach and instruct 
classes therein.” Teachers holding State certificates of first and second grades may 
be admitted to the normal schools from the State at large. Residents of other States 
may be admitted upon letters of recommendation from the Governor or State super- 
intendent thereof. A declaration to teach in the State of California, or in the State 
or Territory where the applicant resides, is required of every candidate for admission. 
No charge is made for tuition. County and city boards of education may grant 
teachers’ certificates without examination to holders of California life diplomas, Cal- 
ifornia State educational diplomas, California normal school diplomas, the State 
University diplomas (when recommended by the faculty of the University), unex- 
pired State certificates, and city certificates granted in other cities of California, and 
State normal school diplomas of other States. Educational diplomas are granted to 
graduates of the State normal schools who have afterwards taught successfully for 
three years in the public schools of the State, and also to each pupil who worthily 
completes the post-graduate course at the normal schools. 
An act approved March 9, 1887, appropriated $50,000 for the erection of a normal 
school for the northern portion of the State. The site selected is at Chico, Butte 
County, on a beautiful tract of ground, 8 acres in extent, donated to the State by 
General Bidwell, of Chico. The value of this gift, with the water right, is at least

$20,000, and to this the town of Chico has added $10,000 in coin, The building is 
now in process of construction, and is to be of brick, three stories in height, and 
modelled somewhat after that at Los Angeles. It is expected that the school will be 
in operation within a year, 
In July, 1887, the normal school at San José completed a quarter century of its ex- 
istence. A history of the school is to be issued to show especially what the institu- 
tion as a normal school has accomplished for the State through its graduates. The at- 
tendance for the past session is the largest ever enrolled, ‘The school at Los Angeles 
is also largely attended and thoroughly equipped for professional work. Members of 
the senior class at this institution have the advantages of a training school composed. 
of five grades of the city public schools, under the charge of regular teachers, in 
weed normal instruction in methods of teaching and governing are practically ap- 
ied, 
The normal class in the San Francisco Girls’ High School has a professional course 
extending over one year, to which only graduates of the high school are admitted, At 
the beginning of the school year the pupils of this class are divided into two equal sec- 
tions, which alternate monthly from professional study to practical work in the school 
room, the members being distributed among the different primary departments of the 
city for practice work. - At the end of each month the principals of these schools are 
rakdired to make tothe superintendent a written report on the suecess of each pupil- 
teacher, and at the end of the year these reports are examined and due credit given 
for practical success in teaching, 
There are two inspecting teachers in this city, whose duty it is to thoroughly ac- 
quaint themselves with the improvements in the methods of conducting schools, and 
of teaching, and to exemplify these methods in the various schools. They are also re- 
quired to examine the work of the teachers and pupils from time to time, and report 
to the superintendent and the board, making such suggestions as may seem desirable 
or necessary for the greater efficiency of the schools. ‘The city superintendent reports 
this work of inspection as highly successful and promotive of zeal upon the part of 
both teachers and pupils.* 
New life has been infused into the institute work of the State, and county institutes 
are becoming more effective and popular, The institute held in San Francisco in July, 
1886, was attended by fully one thousand educators, besides many persons from the 
State and abroad, interested in the cause of education. The annual State institute of 
California teachers held its session at San José, December 26 to 29, 1886, Among the 
topics discussed were the proposed amendments to the school laws, and measures were 
adopted to compel more regular and general attendance at teachers’ institutes, The 
teachers of San José hold monthly meetings throughout the year, which are usually 
informal discussions of school matters, 
A State teachers’ reading circle was organized in March, 1887, and a course of study 
in professional works on education, history, biography, literature, and philology 
mapped out, Any teacher or other person in the State may become a member by for- 
warding his name, a fee of 50 cents, and his pledge to pursue the prescribed course of 
study to the board of directors of his county, 
: COLORADO, 
Colorado has as yet no pablis normal school, and since the supply of teachers in the 
State exceeds the demand, owing to large districts sparsely settled, the need of such 
professional schools is not pressing. The State University, at Boulder, has estab- 
lished and maintains a normal department, Concerning this, the State superintend- 
ent reports: ‘The only direct or special work done in, this department has been by a 
course of lectures on mothods of instruction. 'These lectures were given by the presi- 
dent and two members of the faculty. . The academic studies of this class have been 
the same as provided for the preparatory classes.” atts 
By amendment of the school laws in March, 1887, it is enacted that State diplomas 
shall only be granted upon public examination, ete, ; ‘Provided, That the State board 
of edneation may, upon the recommendation of the State board of examiners, grant 
State diplomas without examination to persons who, in addition to good moral char- 
acter and scholarly attainments, have rendered eminent services in the educational 
work of the State for a period of not less than 5 years,” For the purpose of organiz- 
ing and maintaining teachers’ normal institutes, the State is divided into six institute 
districts, and new counties formed within the limits of any institute district are to be in- 
cluded in that district. A normal institute may be held annually for a term of not less 
than two weeks in each normal district of the State, and each county superintendent 
is authorized to add 5 per cent. to the average standing in examination of teachers 
. who shall attend this institute from his county, The institutes receive county and 
State aid, in addition to the registration fees paid by the teachers. 
County superintendents may hold meetings and county teachers’ associations when- 
ever in their judgment the interests of the school work demand it. Local teach-

CONNECTICUT, 
The normal school at Now Britain is reported in a prosperous condition and steadily — 
improving in the quality of its work. The present corps of teachers is not only efti- 
cient and enthusiastic, but appears to make it a point to devise fresh and improved 
ways and methods of instruction from year to year. A special appropriation of $7,000 
for improvements about the building has resulted in better facilities for heating ani 
ventilation, which are now entirely satisfactory. In the third or attic story have 
been placed a commodious workshop and an exceptionally well-equipped gymnasium. 
A systematic, course of physical training is obligatory upon every student; and a 
regular instructor is employed, and classes give one period every day to gymnastic 
work, The number of pupils is as great as the school can accommodate and success- 
fully train, The graduates of 1887 numbered 62, constituting the largest class that 
has ever been sent out, All of them are teaching, and thus in one year the school 
has supplied about one sixth of the beginners in the State, The demand for these 
‘professionally trained teachers is far in excess of the supply, Every year it is esti- 
mated that not less than two thousand visitors inspect the school, many of them 
teachers, whose purpose is to observe the methods in use in the various model schools.! 
The course of instruction at this school occupies 2 years, but for those who find the 
work too difficult, because of inadequate preparation or defective training, a special 
course with an extra term is provided, The common school studies, the English 
Janguage and English literature and elementary science, are regarded as essential 
to intelligent teaching, and to these special attention is given. In all branches the 
topical method is chiefly pursued, and students are encouraged in independent in- 
vestigation. 
The training department is a distinctive feature of the school, and the course ex- 
tends over a full year. No part of this course can be omitted, whatever may have 
been the previous preparation of the student. The model schools comprise all grades, 
from an extensive kindergarten training department to the highest grammar grades. 
' Students of the normal school are introduced to a great variety of elementary forms 
of technical work, Kindergarten occupations, moulding, modelling, the use of tools, 
writing, drawing, coloring, gymnastics, and experimental work in physiology, 
chemistry, and physics, are the technical features in which instruction is at present 
given.? The advantages of the normal school are offered free to all who declare their 
intention to teach in the common schools of the State, und necessary text-books are 
provided without charge. 
New Haven has two training schools—the Cedar Street School, which is a practice 
rather than a method school, and the Welch School, with a normal course of one 
year. Two distinct lines of effort are carried on in these schools: (1) the teaching 
and training of the children who attend them; (2) the initiation of young teachers | 
into the true theory of education, and the application of that fheory to actual school 
work. The training school course has so grown in favor with the graduates of the 
high school that there is every reason to believe that the supply of teachers will soon 
beequal to the demand, Of the class graduated in April, 1887, more than thirty have 
signified their desire to take the training course.? ‘ 
The Welch School is of a twofold character. Standing on the same plan as the 
other grammar schools of the city, it has in addition the kindergarten and the training 
departments. During the first half-year the training class forms no part of the teach- 
ing foree, but during the latter half the young ladies in training go into the rooms 
to take their share in the actual work of the school. Through the generosity of a 
friend, the Welch School has received the nucleus of a teachers’ library. Cedar Street 
School, in addition to the work with teachers during school hours, has biweekly 
teachers’ meetings after school, with other work of a professional nature. 
Bridgeport has a training school, but no information has been received concerning 
it. During the past year more than one-half the teachers formed a teachers’ reading 
union, under the auspices of the Chautauqua Union, and held regular semimonthly 
meetings.

Enfield had a series of teachers’ meetings, which were informal home gatherings. 
Néw Britain held meetings, but the time is not stated. 
New Haven had several general meetings of teachers during the year, at which prom- 
inent educators of the State and elsewhere took part in the exercises. Something 
has also been accomplished in some of the subdistricts inthe way of systematic study » 
of some standard work on the science and art of education. The principals and su- 
perintendent held monthly meetings, when the various interests of the schools were 
discussed and improvements suggested. 
Norwich held regular teachers’ meetings. Studies in physiology and hygiene were 
continued for 13 weeks, with weekly recitations after school hours. A reading club 
was organized, meeting once in two weeks, at which portions of “Swett’s Methods of 
Teaching” and ‘‘ White’s Elements of Pedagogy” were read and discussed. 
.Salisbury.—The association of the teachers of Salisbury held ten sessions during the 
year, of which the most important result seems to be the esprit de corps developed in 
the teaching force.? ; 
Thompson had a series of meetings, introduced by the school board but maintained 
and carried on by the teachers. 
Institutes and teachers’ meetings are becoming more numerous throughout the 
State, and are more generally attended year by year. These are held under the di- 
rection of the State by local school officers, and also by voluntary association. Itis 
proposed by the State board to form a State teachers’ union, which shall have for its 
object the improvement of public schools through the teachers, a result to be ac- 
complished by teachers’ meetings, courses of study and reading for teachers, and in- 
vestigation of work done. A summer school for teachers is announced to be held at 
Niantic for 2 weeks, beginning the first week in July. The fortieth annual session 
of the State Teachers’ Association was held at New Haven, October 28-30, 1886. 
Connecticut has a State teachers’ reading circle. 
DAKOTA. 
There are two normal schools in the Territory, one at Madison, and the other at 
Spearfish, in the Black Hills region. These schools are supported entirely by Territo- 
rial appropriations, and aim to give thorough training and preparation for the pro- 
fession of teaching. Tuition is free to all residents of Dakota who signify their pur- 
pose to teach in the public schools of the Territory. The schools are managed by 
boards appointed by the Governor. 
The State Normal School at Madison was destroyed by fire in February, 1886, but 
its fine building and library were at once restored by the enterprising citizens of Madi- 
son. The Legislature at its last session made an appropriation to reimburse those 
who had contributed to the rebuilding.? This school offers an elementary course of 3 
years, and an advanced one of 4 years. Both normal and professional certificates 
will be given hereafter. 
The Territorial Normal School at Spearfish has received an appropriation of $25,000 
for a new building, which is to be ready for occupancy at the opening of the fall ses- 
sion in 1887. The school has an endowment of twenty sections of excellent land 
which can not be sold for less than $3 per acre. This school has at present only the 
elementary course of study of 3 years, but students entering the school prepared to 
pursue the higher branches will receive instruction in such of these subjects as they 
may elect. Both institutions have model schools attached. By a recent school law 
no certificates are issued to undergraduates, Those completing either the elementary 
or advanced course of study are entitled to the diploma of the Territory. . 
In addition to these a normal school has been established at Springfield, but no ap- 
propriation has ever been made to supportit. The last Legislature made further proyvis- 
ion for professional training of teachers at public expense in its act authorizing the 
Territorial board of education to designate 10 private or sectarian schools to give nor- 
mal training to classes of not less than 10 nor more than 25 pupils, the tuition to be paid 
from the Territorial treasury at the rate of $1 per week for each student. Seven of 
these appointments have thus far been made, as follows: Jamestown College, Tower 
University, of Tower City, Groton College, Redfield College, Pierre University, 
Mitchell University, and Scotland Academy, The board has prescribed the course of 
study and training to be pursued, and formulated the rules and regulations governing 
the conduct of the classes and admission to them. Besides these free normal schools, 
the Territorial universities have normal departments, to which admission is free. 
Nearly all the sectarian colleges and academies maintain normal! courses, and a pri- 
_ vate normal school has recently been established at Milnor, Sargent County, which is 
the first organized in the Territory by private enterprise.® 
In addition to the usual certificates of three grades granted by the county superin- 
tendent, the Territorial board grants upon satisfactory examination other certificates 
of two grades. These are the normal certificate valid for 5 years, and the professional 
certificate valid for 10 years. The standard of qualification is being gradually raised ‘

and weak and inefficient teachers are crowded out by rigorous examinations and the 
advancing standard of proficiency. 
Aspecial feature of the educational system of Dakota is the teachers’ institute. 
Much interest has always been manifested by teachers and school officers in this means 
of improvement, and the recent school law adds further to its efficiency by placing 
the work under one general head, thereby making uniformity and system possible. 
All institutes are now under the general control of the Territorial board, and the in- 
structors are appointed by the Territorial superintendent, with the advice of the 
board. Formerly one institute a year has, in general, been heldin each county. The 
board is now planning to hold two institutes annually in each county. They are ar- 
ranged for two courses, one in the autumn and one in the spring season, and the in- 
structors being given continuous employment during the course are thereby enabled 
to work for a lower rate per week. This reduction in the expense, with the increase 
of revenue for institute purposes, makes two sessions a year possible. The funds 
for the support of institutes are derived from three sources: (1) The Territorial Legis- 
lature has appropriated the sum of $50 to each county having ten or more resident 
teachers; (2) each applicant for a county certificate is required to pay to the county su- 
perintendent $1 to create an institute fund; (3) the county commissioners are em- 
powered to appropriate the sum of $50 or less for institute purposes. The institutes, as 
rule, are in session but one week. The law also provides for township institutes at 
least one Saturday of each month. Many of the county superintendents are using. 
these meotings as a means of unifying the county work by giving instruction in 
grading the schools and other work of the kind.! 
Numerous voluntary association meetings of teachers are held, and their discus- 
sions and deliberations are interesting and instructive. Among these the teachers’ 
associations of North Dakota and South Dakota are the most notably successful ones. 
They have a large membership of teachers in the common schools, high schools, and 
colleges, and hold annual sessions at various accessible points in the Territory. The 
South Dakota Association held its fourth annual session at Mitchell, June 28-30, 1887. 
Besides these, the Sioux Valley Association and numerous county asociations are in 
successful operation. 
A reading circle, with a four years’ course, has been organized by the South Dakota 
Teachers’ Association. The teachers are engaging in the work in many coanties with 
commendable zeal, and it is proving an efficient means of self-improvement. The 
reading circle is aided financially by all funds collected as fees for Territorial certifi- 
cates. Each member also pays the sum of 50 cents upon joining the circle. 
DELAWARE. 
One of the great needs of the State is a normal or training school for the profes- 
sional preparation of teachers.? Notwithstanding the urgent recommendation of 
the State superintendent that such an institution be established, and the assurance 
that no appropriations would be needed for buildings or current expenses of the 
school, the Senate of Delaware, in its session of 1886-87, defeated a proposed bill for a 
State normal school, though the buildings are said to have been offered free of ex- 
pense. The only expenditure necessary would be that of providing free tuition 
for a number of students. Sixty free scholarships continuously maintained at a 
school of this character, which ought to yield thirty graduates a year, would cost only 
$2,400, or about 13 cent. per annum for each inhabitant of the State.* 5 
Wilmington has a training school, four divisions of which are taught by pupil-teach- 
ers who are in training and on trial. There are 6 of these teachers, and they receive 
no salary. 
The value of the institutes in this State is almost incalculable, as the lack of a 
normal school for the training of teachers leaves whatever work is done in that direc- 
tion for the county institute. Each of the three counties of the State held an in- 
stitute during January, 1887. 
Delaware has a State teachers’ association. 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 
Normal instruction for white pupils is provided for by the Washington Normal 
School. The scholastic year beginning September, 1886, marked an increase in the 
number of pupils and in the work at this institution. The faculty consisted of the 
principal, two teachers of methods, two practice teachers, and the teachers of music 
and drawing. The course of study is chiefly professional and is limited to one 
year. Hand in hand with the work in theory and methods proceeds the practical 
application of both. ‘The manual training in the primary classes proved asuccess. 
The training of the eye and hand in making form and representing it, the oral de- 
scription of the work, followed by a written account of it, made a unit of physical

and mental discipline founded on universally acknowledged psychological princi- 
ples.” The importance of enlarging the library and the establishment of a reading 
room is trged as necessary to the better equipment of the students for their profession.' 
‘The Miner Normal School, organized on the same plan as the Washington Normal, 
prepares colored teachers, and. heretofore has received the support of the Miner 
fund. By the terms of agreement this aid terminated with the last session, and the 
school will hereafter be maintained by the District funds. The professional training 
is commended as having given to the teacherships a degree of efficiency that has 
aided most materially in the growth and progress of the schools.” 
Model schools are attached to each of these normal schools. The selection of pupils 
for the normal schools is made from graduates of the high schools, the number being 
limited to 40, of whom 10 may be male. Each candidate must be at least 18 years of 
age, and must pass an examination equivalent to that upon which teachers’ fourth- 
class certificates are issued. An examination of candidates is held in the month of 
June, and those standing highest in scholarship are admitted in the order of their 
rank. A pledge is exacted to continue the course until completed and afterwards to 
teach for a period of at least 2 years in the public schools of the District. Graduates of 
the normal schools receive certificates equivalent to fourth-class certificates, good for 
one year. After having taught satisfactorily not less than one year, they are entitled 
to receive diplomas which are equivalent to fourth-class certificates.3 : 
Teachers in the District are required to attend all meetings to which they are called, 
and all special classes for their instruction organized by the superintendent. i 
| FLORIDA. 
The superintendent of public instruction for this State reports that a normal col- 
Jege for each race has been organized and opened during the year 1887. The school 
for whites is located at De Funiak Springs, Walton County, the headquarters of the 
Southern Chautauqua. In a perfectly healthy climate, surrounded by a beautiful 
country, and having an excellent corps of instructors, the college looks forward to a 
course of usefulness and success. A school has been organized under precisely tho 
same circumstances and in the same manner for colored persons who desire to prepare 
themselves for the work of teaching. This school is also provided with an excellent 
and earnest corps of teachers, and is located at Tallahassee, the capital of the State. 
In both of these institutions tuition is free, and there is no expense except board, 
which may be obtained at moderate cost. Normal departments are also reported at 
De Land College, Volusia County, and ‘at Rollins College, Orange County. The 
Peabody normal scholarships at Nashville have been withdrawn. 
Teachers’ institutes have been well attended, and much interest is manifest among 
those for whom they are primarily intended, as well as among the citizens generally. 
The expenses of these meetings were greatly reduced by the liberality and economy 
of instructors and the favors of public carriers, as railroad and steam-ship companies, 
etc. Normal schools for colored teachers were organized and conducted at Tallahassee 
and at Gainesville, each for 2 months. Competent instructors were provided, and tho 
aim was to make the instruction practical in every sense and to inspire teachers with 
a proper ambition and impress upon them the dignity and importance of their profes- 
sion, ‘They were ‘deeply impressed and studious, evidently trying to take in all 
, that was possible to them. Those only were given certificates, as the law directs, 
who passed the examination required, fully up to the mark.” For the year 1886 the 
State Legislature appropriated $1,000 for the purpose of holding teachers’ institutes’ 
~ at such times and places as the State superintendent might designate. 
The first annual session of the Teachers’ Normal Institute was planned by the man- 
agers of the Florida Chautauqua, and held at De Funiak Springs, February 23 to 
March 31, 1887. 
A State teachers’ association has been organized. 
GEORGIA. 
The State school commissioner of Georgia reports increased interest in public 
schools among the members of the Legislature, but, as yet, no legal provision for nor- 
mal schools or teachers’ institutes. The liberality of the Peabody Fund makes the 
latter possible and efficient, and the normal scholarships at Nashville, received from 
the same source since 1877, offer some opportunity of professional training to the 
teachers of the State. A few academies alae announce normal departments, and sev- 
eral boards of education in the cities and larger. towns niaintain normal classes dur- 
ing the scholastic year. The lack of facilities for training teachers in the State is 
the subject of an earnest appeal by the school commissioner for normal schools for 
both races. He shows conclusively that the largest proportion of schools, those 
taught in the country, must be supplied by teachers who lack collegiate education,

and who must necessarily depend upon professional schools of training. Ho sug- 
gests, as a beginning, that the State university and the male and female colleges | 
make provision for pedagogical instruction, with special reference to those persons 
who expect to become country teachers. The trustees of colored colleges, it appears, 
have already taken steps in that direction, and with most valuable results. ‘The 
commissioner further suggests to the teachers of private high schools to prepare them- 
selves by special study to teach pedagogical subjects, and to make a feature of the 
curricula of their schools the preparation of young persons intending to teach in the 
country. : 
For the year 1887 Georgia held 14 Peabody normal scholarships at Nashville, with 
10 graduates in a class of 54. 
Americus reports a normal class comprising the teachers in the public schools of the 
town. Special assistance is given to those having charge of primary classes and to 
those having little experience in their profession. D 
Athens has weekly normal sessions of teachers, and the instruction seems to be 
appreciated as well as highly useful. 
Atlanta has a normal class for white teachers which meets weekly during the scheol 
year. A separate class for colored teachers will be organized when’ the number will 
justify such an organization. A general meeting of all the teachers of the city is 
held the first Saturday of each month. At this meeting the teachers are paid their 
salaries for the previous month, and institute work is practically conducted. The re- 
maining Saturdays are occupied respectively by the teachers of the high school, of 
the grammar grades, and of the primary grades. In these meetings regular lessons 
taught = the respective departments are recited, and methods of teaching them fully 
discussed. 
Columbus has a normal class for white and for colored teachers. The work consists 
of institutes and teachers’ meetings, the former being conducted by the superintend- 
ent twice a month with the whole class, and the latter by the principals of white 
schools, each in his own school, twice a month. 
Glynn County, including the city of Brunswick, has two normal classes, one for each 
race, and all the teachers of the schools are required to attend and take part in what- 
ever exercises may be held. 
Grigin.—The teachers of Griffin are required to meet as often as may be deemed ad- 
visable to receive instruction on the subject of teaching and discipline, the nature of 
the school system, and the best means of accomplishing its object. 
Rome has weekly normal classes for each race, conducted separately. Regular and 
special teachers’ meetings are also held. 
Savannah has a weekly normal class for the instruction of public school teachers, 
‘and of such other persons in this city and county as may desire to prepare them- 
selves to be teachers.” Members of this class always have preference in case of ap- 
pointments, and certificates from the president of the board and the superintendent 
are given to those who complete the prescribed course of study. 
In order to continue and to render more effective the institute work of the State, 
the school commissioner recommends an annual apporpriation of at least $1,500 to be 
made from the school fund and to be applied for this purpose, together with any ad- 
ditions from the Peabody Fund, the work of these institutes to be done under the di- 
rection of the State board of education. 
The Peabody State Institute was held at Atlanta for one month, beginning July 
18,1887. Arrangements were made for both white and colored students, in separate 
buildings, but with like instruction for each race. The work of the normal classes 
was wall arranged and thorough, and the attendance was large and the teachers 
enthusiastic. $

ILLINOIS. 
This State has two public normal schools supported by the State, and one by county 
appropriations, of which the State Normal University at Normal, founded in 1857, is 
the oldest and most largely attended by normal students. This institution includes 
besides the normal department, high school, grammar, and primary grades in the 
model department. All normal students have excellent opportunities for observa- 
tion, instruction in theory and practice of teaching, actual training work, and experi- 
mental and practical study of methods for presenting various subjects to children, 
with special reference to the use of apparatus. The course of normal study occupies 
3 years. By a vote of the board of education, all persous who by examination before 
tho faculty show themselves entitled to a first-grade certificate may be received mae 
a class for a year’s course, to be devoted exclusively to training, and those so wo 
ing in the training school shall be entitled to certificates of attendance. 
The Southern Illinois Normal University is located at Carbondale, and a new nor- 
mal building was opened and dedicated February 24, 1887. It was built and fur-

nished at a cost in round numbers of $152,000, in addition to the foundation of the 
old pbuilding, which was worth $8,000 additional. This institution has 3 departments: 
A normal university, with courses of study occupying 4, 3, and 2 years respectively ; a 
preparatory normal course of one year, and a training department. Male pupils who 
may so desire are formed into a cadet battalion under supervision of a U.S. Army 
officer, and aro drilled at stated times during the week. The pedagogical course of 
normal study embraces the science and methods of teaching in its application to all 
stages of education from the kindergarten to the college and university. The instruc- 
tion is chiefly by lectures, examinations, observations, experiments, and criticisms, 
somewhat similar to clinics in medical schools. 
Cook County Normal School, at Normal Park, has a professional training class and 
four high school classes representing the usual four grades in an English high school 
course. Pupils are admitted to the professional training class who have diplomas from 
colleges and high schools. Three or more years of successful teaching and a first-class 
teachers’ certificate are accepted as equivalent to a diploma from a high school. The 
professional study includes mental science, pedagogics, history of education, theory 
and practice of the kindergarten, manual training, elocution and the Delsarte system 
of expression, technical training in penmanship, drawing, painting, and modelling, 
with practice teaching one hour daily. The manual'training is devoted to moulding 
in clay and sand, pasteboard work, making apparatus for experiments in physics, and 
working in wood. The county superintendent holds an institute for county teachers 
in the normal school during the month of September. 
Aurora, Moline, and Springfield report normal training classes for their teachers, and 
regular institutes and teachers’ meetings are held in Belleville, Cairo, Elgin, Jackson- 
ville, Peoria, Quincy, and Rockford. In Belleville there is also a monthly institute for 
teachers instructing in the German language. 
Institute work in the State is general and usually effective. The Intelligence of 
September 1, 1887, states that ‘in 1887 an institute will be held in every county of 
the State for the first time in its history.” The Illinois School Journal of June, 1887, - 
contains a list of 81 institutes arranged by the State school authorities, beginning in 
March and extending to September, 1887. These are usually held by the several 
county superintendents with two or more assistants. A law involving possibilities of 
reform in county institute instruction was passed in 1887, providing that the teachers 
in a county can attend their county institute in term time and be paid for 3 days of 
the timeso employed. They are entitled to pay for 5 days in the year, but not to more 
than 3 days in a school term. 
Teachers’ associations are numerous and held at stated intervals. Besides those of 
the counties there are State and district associations. 
The thirty-third annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association convened at 
Springfield, December 28-30, 1886. The attendance numbered nearly 500 leading 
and progressive teachers from every section of the State. The annual meeting of 
county superintendents was held at the same time and place. The Northern Tn 
nois Teachers’ Association met at Aurora, January 28-29; and at Polo, April 29-30, 
1887, The Northern Illinois High School Teachers’ Association held a meeting April 
15-16, 1887, at Hyde Park. The association for the central part of the State held its 
third annnal meeting at Danville, March 25-26, 1887, which was one of the largest 
teachers’ conventions ever held in the State. Four hundred were enrolled as mem- 
bers and paid the fee of 50 cents into the treasury. The Southern Illinois Teachers’ 
Association held its sixth annual meeting at Du Quoin, August 24-26, 1886. 
The teachers’ reading circle, as a separate and distinct institution, seems to have a 
sure foothold in Illinois. The large assembly of county superintendents at Spring- 
field spoke with no uncertain voice of the importance of the circle as an agency for 
improving the schools, and of their determination to foster it and extend its useftfl- 
ness. The fundamental idea of the Illinois Teachers’ Reading Circle is the profes- 
sionai and general culture of its members. Certificates haye been given to 838 per- 
sons who have completed the first year of the elementary course. A portion of 
Barnes’s General History, Payne’s Theory of Education, and Hewett’s Pedagogy, with 
collateral reading, comprised the course for 1886-87. The Illinois School Journal for 
July, 1887, states that the reading for next year has been simplified and consists of 
Barnes’s General History and White’s Pedagogy. Full outlines are to be prepared 
and furnished to all readers connected with the circle, to indicate clearly the impor- 
tant topics to be studied. 
INDIANA. 
Normal instruction in this State is furnished by the State Normal School at Terre 
Haute, and other institutions under private management. In addition to these a free 
training class is reported at Indianapolis, and the system of institutes, teachers’ meet- 
ings, educational associations, and reading circle work is developing most satisfactory 
results.

    TRAINING OF TEACHERS. AIT 
The State school at Terre Haute receives liberal support by standing and occa- 
sional appropriations, and its buildings and equipments are of the best quality. The 
faculty numbers 17 trained normal instructors, while more than 700 pupils were in at- 
tendance last session; representing nearly all the counties of the State. The sole 
object of the school is the professional preparation of teachers for the common schools 
of the State. With that end in view it provides courses of study of 3 and 4 years in 
English and Latin, with special courses for high school and college graduates. Tuition 
is free, and residents of Indiana must promise to teach, if practicable, in the common 
schools of the State a period equal to twice that spent as pupils in the normal school. 
A training school of eight grades is attached to the institution. 
The Indiana Normal College was organized in September at Covington. This insti- 
tution reports a faculty of 10 teachers with an enrolment of over 100 normal stu- 
dents. Thecollege building contains ten recitation rooms, an office, a library, and a 
chapel with seating capacity for 600 persons; with a total valuation of grounds, 
buildings, and apparatus at $40,000. The course of study embraces ancient and mod- 
ern languages, professional normal and training instruction, commercial branches, 
and instruction in the fine arts. A teachers’ training class is maintained for practice 
work and observation. A valuable laberatcry offers advantages in the study of 
science, and pnpils are taught to manufacture most of the necessary apparatus used 
in experimenting. z 
The State University has established a course in the “science and art of teaching,” 
the design of which is chiefly to meet the demand for well-prepared teachers for the 
higher positions in the public schools and colleges.! 
Indianapolis has a training class connected with the public school system, the course 
extending over one and ahaif years. Hagerstown High School includes mental science 
and pedagogies in its course of study, and graduates are given certificates to teach 
after passing the required examination. La Grange County requires attendance at 
township institutes with forfeiture of pay for absence. Crawfordsville, Frankfort, 
Michigan City, Richmond, Warsaw, and Washington have stated teachers’ meetings. 
South Bend teachers are allowed a half day each term to visit. schools of similar grade 
for the purpose of observation. Terre Haute teachers, in addition to their regular 
meetings, levied a tax upon themselves for lectures by experienced educators on sub- 
jects pertaining to their profession. 
Indiana is not backward in the matter of teachers’ institutes, having inaugurated 
such assemblies in 1846, which is believed to be the date of the earliest teachers’ insti- 
tutes in the State. The law of 1865, requiring one to be held in each county at least 
once a year and making a small appropriation for this purpose, marks the beginning 
of the institute period. This means of professional improvement has been most effect- 
ual in elevating the standard of teaching, popularizing public schools, and fostering 
among the masses a healthy educational sentiment, besides creating a thirst for knowl- 
edge. A list of 61 counties hoiding institutes from July to November, 1886, is given.? 
‘The thirty-third annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at 
Indianapolis December 28-30, 1886. County and village school and high school sec- 
tions were held in connection with the associution. The enrolment was the largest 
ever made, and by the election of a Jady as its president, Indianais the first State, 
to take that step. The Northern Indiana Teachers’ Association met at South Bend, 
March 17-19, 1887, and the Southern Indiana Teachers’ Association held its tenth an- 
nual session at Madison, March 23-25, 1887. 
The Indiana Teachers’ Reading Circle was organized in 1884, and is under the care 
and direction of the State Teachers’ Association. This is the first organization to 
follow the lead of Ohio in establishing a State system of reading circles. The popu- 
larity of this movement is eviuced by the statement that one-fourth of the teachers of 
the State, over 3,000,3are reading the course prescribed, and 32 counties are repre- 
sented in the examination of 1887. A fee of 25 cents and a pledge to faithfully pur- 
sue the prescribed course of study are required for membership. ‘The books for 1886-87 
are Green’s Shorter History of the English People ; Watts on the Mind, for new mem- 
bers, and a part of Brooks’s Mental Sciense for those entering in 1885 ; with Hailman’s 
Lectures on Education. Examinations are held annually and diplomas awarded to 
all who successfully complete the work laid out for each of the four years of the 
course. As indicating the importance attached to this work and the general culture 
of teachers, the State board of education orders that after January 1, 1887, every ap- 
plicant for a teacher’s license must present to the county superintendent at the time 
of examination a review or composition upon one of the booksin a list which is given, 
said composition to contain not less than 600 nor more than 1,000 words, in the appli- 
cant’s own handwriting, with assurance thatit is the applicant’s original work. The 
list from which selection is to be made comprises poems, novels, sketches, ete., by 
classic English and American authors of recent times.

_ IOWA. 
The State Normal School at Cedar Falls is reported to be in a prosperous condition. 
Another teacher has been added to the faculty, and a new course of study prepared. 
This new course comprises, (1) the study for one year of the elementary branches as 
applied to elementary schools; (2) the study of elective branches the second year to 
fit students for doing high school work,tgiving them a review of such studies as they 
most need. Some modifications are also made in the regular courses to cover the 
subject-matter required for State certificates and State diplomas.! 
The regular course extends over four years, and includes scientific and didactic 
study, with professional departments for high school and college graduates. A dec- 
laration to teach in the State secures free tuition. The demand for trained teachers 
is so urgent that many students leave after one year’s study, and it is estimated that 
about 300 teachers annually enter the profession who have received partial or finished 
training at this school.? 
In view of this increasing and imperative demand for trained teachers throughout 
the State, the board of directors ask an appropriatién of $10,000 for a new building, 
to contain sleeping apartments and study rooms for not less than 100 students; $5,000 
are asked for a cottage for the president, besides other provision for repairs to old 
building, increasing the efficiency of domestic arrangements, electric lights, library, 
and apparatus; 
West Des Moines training school is established in connection with the public school 
system of that city, and is intended especially for the instruction of high school grad- 
uates. The course extends over 1 year, and includes the careful study of prescribed 
authorities, with actual school work. The Audubon school board grant the entire 
corps of teachers a leave of absence of 1 week, to be spent in visiting the Des Moines 
schools. Lyons, Muscatine, Oskaloosa, Sioux City, and Des Moines hold general, grade, 
and other teachers’ meetings. 
The majority of the teachers of the State receive professional training through the 
medium of the county normal institutes. These have annual sessions of from 2 to 8 
weeks, with abridged courses of normal work and study. The importance of these 
educational agencies may be inferred from the attendance, which has been steadily 
increasing, until it numbered over 18,000 for the year 1886. The difficulty now ex- 
perienced. in most counties is how to provide accommodations for the large numbers 
that attend. Review schools have been held in the counties of northern Iowa, meet- 
ing from 2 to 4 weeks previous to the session of the normal institute. These schools 
have for their object a careful and critical study of the elementary principles of the 
common branches, that methods and their application to the developing mind may 
be studied to better advantage at the normal institutes.® During the spring of 1887 
short sessions of institutes were held in many counties of the State, which proved of 
especial benefit to inexperienced teachers. 
In the fall of 1886 a large number of district educational meetings were held by 
county superintendents, and largely attended by teachers and patrons. The require- 
ment of the State law for scientific instruction regarding the effects of alcoholic 
drinks, stimulants, and narcotics was very generally discussed, and much accom- 
plished towards securing the faithful observance of the law.* 
The thirty-first annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at Des 
Moines, December 28-31, 1886. The enrolment was 403, being the largest ever made, 
with one exception. This association prepares a graded course of instruction for nor- 
mal institutes, covering a period of 4 years. ‘‘Schoolmasters’ Round Tables” have 
been organized in various portions of the State, furnishing opportunities for social 
and professional improvement. 
Iowa teachers are fully alive to the importance of professional and ‘general reading 
as a means for improvement. As an example, it may be mentioned that Superintend- 
ent Scott, of Oskaloosa, has secured statistics of the expenditures of his teachers for 
last year’s reading in these subjects, The total is $516.50, or an average of $24 per 
teacher. This is a good showing, and indicates wide awake and progressive teachers.> 
The State Teachers’ Reading Circle has marked out a 4 years’ course of study on 
the Chautauqua plan. The reading for 1887-88 covers a broad field and serves asa 
good foundation for the 3 years’ work to follow. The course for the present year 
consists of mediwyval and modern history, mental and natural science, literature, and 
the United States Constitution. There is a manager in each county, usually the 
county superintendent, who enrols members, organizes local circles, and distributes 
books. The reading eirele board reports 51 counties with working circles. 
KANSAS. 
Kansas has a well-organized State normal school at Emporia, with a total enrolment 
of nearly 750 students, representing 81 counties of Kansas and 16 States. The Legis-

lature provided for the erection of a new wing to the already commodious building, 
which will contain, with the addition, 50 rooms, exclusive of closets and wardrobes, 
especially adapted to school purposes. The cost of improvements is estimated at 
$25,000, with an additional appro: ion of nearly $10,000 for library, apparatus, etc. 
Tuition in the normal department is free to all regular students, and railroad fare in 
excess of $3 is refunded to all pupils fromthe State. The strictly professional branches 
are grouped in a single year, the entire course of normal study occupying 3 and 4 
years. Pupils completing satisfactorily the first 2 years of the prescribed course are 
granted teachers’ certificates good for 1 year in any part of the State, and the diploma 
of the school is equivalent ta a life certificate. The model department is organized 
into a graded school, from kindergarten to grammar grades, and in this all students 
are required to teach during the professional year. For admission to the normal 
school, first and second grade certificates are accepted in lieu of examination, also 
diplomas from 34 high schools of the State, while other candidates are required to 
pass a fair examination in the common school branches. The State superintendent 
highly commends the important work and beneficial results of the normal school, and. 
suggests that the ends of normal training might be better secured by making the 
present State normal school anormal university, devoted exclusively to training in 
the higher departments of normal work. For this purpose branch normal schools 
should be established, 1 in each Congressional district, in which academic would be 
combined with normal instruction, thus relieving the normal university at Emporia 
of all preparatory work.! 
Kansas City High Schoot has a normal course of 3 years, designed especially for the 
preparation of young ladies to teach in the graded schools of that city. The follow- 
ing cities and towns have regular institutes and teachers’ meetings, in some cases the 
teachers being allowed to visit schools of other teachers for the purpose of observation: 
Aitchison, Beloit, Concordia, Ellsworth, Emporia, Kansas City, Lawrence, Leavenworth, 
Ottawa, Paola, Topeka, Wellington, and Winjield. 
For the summer of 1887, eighty-seven normal institutes were appointed. The State 
superintendent speaks in highest terms of theso factors of educational training, and 
urges continued appropriations for increasing their efficiency. 
‘The twenty-fourth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at 
Topeka, December 28-30, 1886. In addition to the State organization, the North-west- 
ern Association meets at Beloit, the South-eastern Association at Fort Scott, and the 
South-western Association at Wichita. All of these associations are doing much in 
the way of stimulating professional pride among teachers and elevating the educa- 
tional standard of the State. \ 
Kansas has a State Teachers’ Reading Circle, with a comprehensive course of study, 
which receives the support of teachers and others interested in educational matters, 
KENTUCKY. 
No public State normal school has as yet been established for white students. Pro- 
vision was recently made by the Legislature for a normal school for colored pupils b; 
appropriating $7,000 for a suitable building, and $3,000 annually for its support, Tui- — 
tion will be-free to all colored residents of Kentucky, possessing the necessary quali- 
fications and signing a pledge to teach, as far as practical, in the colored common 
schools of the State, a period equal to twice the time spent as a pupil in the school. 
Certificates of proficiency will be granted to those who complete the prescribed course 
of study, and 2 years’ successful teaching after graduation will entitle teachers to ap- 
propriate professional diplomas, allowing them to teach in any of the colored common 
schools in the State.* 
The State College has a normal department also for professional training of teachers. 
Educational sentiment in the State is eminently in favor of such schools for whites, 
and the establishment of three normal schools is strongly urged, one each for the 
eastern, central, and western parts of the State. : 
Normal institutes for the judicial districts of the State are required by law, and 
many county institutes are also held. Three normal institutes, one for each of the 
supreme court districts, were appointed for the summer of 1887, with the understand- 
ing that at the close of each a district association would be organized to meet yearly 
at the same place as the institute.’ 
Louisville.—Normal classes for white and colored students separately are reported 
from Louisville. At Newport the senior principal convenes the teachers twice a month 
for normal instraction, Covington has monthly meetings of the teachers’ association. 
The State Teachers’ Association (white) inet at Louisville, July 7-9, 18875 and that 
for colored teachers at Lexington, July 10-12, 1887. 
The Teachers’ Reading Circle has a course of-3 years’ study in history and art, ped- 
agogy, science, and literature. No membership fee will be charged for the year 
1887-88, but teachers are expected to register their names with the secretary.

LOUISIANA. 
The Louisiana State Normal School at Natchitoches, during the few years of its 
existence, has become the centre of the public school system of the State. This 
school is assuming an individuality and independence that promise to make if a 
prominent institution in the South. Psychology is made the basis of all work in the 
\ normal department, and the plan of the institution, as now conducted, is essentially 
the same as that pursued in the best normal schools of the country. Reviews and 
methods of teaching the grammar studies, literature, science, civil government, and 
professional branches are prescribed in the course of studies. To this is added 
daily exercises in teaching in the practice school. The course of study covers 3 
years, and tuition is free. An annual appropriation of $13,000, allowed by the Legis- 
lature, with assistance from the Peabody fund, secures to the school the necessary 
means for its further growth. The Peabody fund donated $2,000 to the school and 
$1,000 additional for institutes. The State receives 8 Peabody scholarships at the 
Nashville Normal School. Two graduates from the State are reported in the class of 
1887. 
New Orleans has a city normal school in connection with the Girls’ High School. 
The course hereafter will extend over 2 years.. Daily sessions are held on at least 
three school days of the week, and on Saturday morning. The annual session must 
be at least 6 months, and the school is divided into a junior and a senior class. 
Tuition is free, and teachers holding certificates, graduates of the Girls’ High School, 
and other institutions of equal grade, and applicants who have spent at least 3 
years in systematic study after leaving the highest grammar grades of the public 
and private schools of the city, are admitted after examination. The course of study 
includes a comprehensive review of the grammar school studies, the Tulane lessons 
in drawing and physiology, and lectures on ether educational subjects by professors 
of the Tulane University and others. It is proposed to add, from time to time, 
elective courses of special study. Classes in stenography and Latin have been formed, 
and it is hoped that means will be found to open classes in book-keeping and solfége.! 
It is recommended that this school receive from the State a support at least equal to 
that given to the normal school at Natchitoches. 
The Southern University at New Orleans is a State institution which supplies the 
place.of the high and normal schools for colored boys and girls. There is also a 
Peabody normal school for colored pupils, in this city, with a course of 24 years. 
Monroe High School has a 2 years’ course, and in both years pupils receive normal 
instruction. Teachers’ meetings are held semimonthly, and the scholars of the high 
school who receive normal instruction are required to attend. 
Teachers’ institutes were successfully conducted in this State during the past year, 
through the liberality of the Legislature and the Peabody fund. 
The instruction was carried out under the direction of the president of the State 
Normal School, and the instructors were all members of the faculty. The institutes 
continued one week, and were conducted separately for the races. It is recommended 
that an annual summer normal of 6 weeks be held at the State Normal School. 
The annual meeting of the Louisiana Educational Association was held at Mans- 
field, May 6 and 7, 1887. 
MAINE, 
Maine has State normal schools at Castine, Farmington, and Gorham, with the 
Madawaska Training School at Fort Kent and Grand Isle. The course covers 2 
years, with an additional year of advanced study at Farmington for graduates of the 
regular course who may desire it. The common English branches in thorough re- 
. views, with such higher branches as are especially adapted to prepare teachers to 
conduct the mental, moral, and physical education of their pupils, are included in 
the curriculum. Tuition is free, and pupils are required to pledge themselves to 
teach in the public schools of the State for as long a time as they have been con- 
nected with the normal schools. Castine, Farmington, and Gorham report model 
schools. Farmington received an appropriation of $8,000 for enlargement of the 
school building. 
‘The Madawaska Training School is designed to educate teachers, in English specially, 
for the common schoolsin the French district. The legislative act providing for the 
school authorizes the establishment and maintenance, for a period of not less than 6 
months in each year, of two schools in the “‘ Madawaska Territory,” so-called. This 
training school takes from the schools, existing teachers and some of the best and 
brightest of the older pupils, and by means of reviews endeavors to give them a 
thorough knowledge of the elementary branches usually taught in the common 
schools. The results of this instruction are said to be most gratifying. 
Lewiston has a normal practice school which, having been discontinued for a term 
of 4 years, was reopened in September, 1886. The class numbered 12, and in addi-

  tion to practice work the pupil-teachers received comprehensive instruction in pro- 
fessional branches. The teachers united and took at their own expense some of the 
leading educational journals. Monthly teachers’ meetings are held, and also grade 
meetings at times. A teacher’s association has been formed for mutual improvement 
and the formation of a teachers’ library, and as a result nearly 200 books have been 
added to this library. The Chautauqua Reading Circle has also had recruits from 
the teachers. . 
Portland bas a city training school with a course of one year, and a model school 
with over 200 pupils. One of the primary schools of the city is utilized for this 
purpose, having 6 classes of primary grades. The school work has been done by the 
practice class, with two members in a room for the most part, under the immediate 
supervision of the principal. General and grade meetings are held in this city, and 
there is also a teacher’s association. F 
Augusta held seven meetings during the year which resulted in the formation of a 
teacher’s association, embracing the teachers in both the graded and rural schools, 
and holding monthly meetings during the school year. 
There are 18 county teachers’ associations in the State, Oxford and Aroostook 
having 2 each, and the other counties 1, The sessions are from two to three days, 
and are conducted by the State superintendent. 
The annual meeting of the Maine Pedagogical Society was held at Brunswick, 
December 30, 1886. 
MARYLAND. 
The State Normal School is located at Baltimore.- The law directs that 200 students 
shall be admitted free of tuition, but the apportionment of two students for each 
member of the General Assembly brings the number to 234, These students are also 
provided with English text-books and school stationery free of charge, and must file 
a written declaration of their intention to teach within the State. Besides the reg- 
ular appointees, a limited number of students are received, who pay $50 annual tui- 
tion and purchase their own text-books. Such students are not required to become 
teachers, The course of study extends over 3 years, and includes the usual English 
branches, without any ancient or modern language. A model school is attached to 
the institution. The young ladies of the normal school have practical cooking-school 
experiences. 
The Colored Normal School is also located in the city of Baltimore, and has a large 
attendance. In the normal class there were 30 students, of whom 3 were sent out 
into the counties to teach. The objection that young persons reared in the city have _ 
to the comparative discomfort of such boarding as a colored teacher can secure in a 
country district will account for the small number of teachers that this school has 
been able to furnish to the colored schools. It is recommended that a small addition 
to the usual State appropriation be applied to the travelling expenses of county stu- 
dents who should engage to teach in the counties from which they come, which would 
enable the colored schools to obtain a supply of well-qualified teachers.1 
An important step in the improvement of the public schools of the State is the re- 
quirement by the State board of education that teachers be examined in the science 
and methods of teaching, and of classifying certificates according to the manner of 
work performed in the school room, 
Caroline County has 3 teachers’ associations and a reading circle. Frederick County 
teachers, during the past year, purchased over 200 books on the science and methods 
of teaching, and subscribed for nearly 100 school journals. Kent County held 5 reg- 
ular meetings of the teachers’ county association, with large attendance. Monigom- 
ery County has quarterly associations for teachers. Somerset County has a white and a 
colored teachers’ association. In order to secure competent colored teachers, a colored 
normal class was organized during the summer, with an attendance of 18 pupils. The 
session lasted 7 weeks, and the course of study included all the branches required for 
teachers’ certificates. A similar class is announced for next summer. Talbot County 
held a teachers’ institute, and also a normal institute for colored teachers, lasting 6 
weeks. This class had a good attendance, and began immediately after the close of 
schools for the summer vacation. 
The twenty-first annual meeting of the white State Teachers’ Association was held 
at Old Point Comfort, Va., July 5-8, 1887. There was an attendance of over 300 from. 
Mend The colored State Teachers’ Association met at Baltimore, June 21-28, 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Normal schools in the United Statés had their origin in one of the first acts of the 
board of education of the State of Massachusetts, and the creation of the board itself 
grew directly out of a public demand that teachers should have better qualifications for 
their work. The object of the normal schools is to give teachers special training for

the responsible work of instructing and managing their schools, and, more especially, 
to aid them in directing the children and youth committed to their care in securing 
a correct and natural development of their powers, and in the formation of a well, 
rounded character. This work the State normal schools are doing well, and those 
teachers who go forth from them into the schools are, in good measure, improving the 
character of those schools, and are giving a higher and a more wholesome tone to the 
‘intelligence and morality of the rising generation of the Commonwealth.! 
Since the establishment of the board of education in Massachusetts, 6 State normal 
schools have been established, training schools in many of the cities and larger towns 
have been added to the system of public schools, and teachers’ associations are numer- 
ous and well attended. About one-fourth of the public teachers are normal school 
graduates, and nearly one-third have attended a normal school, Many more have 
had the advantages of such instruction as the training school can give, and all 
others have had their ideas and practices modified by the example of those who have 
been trained in the theory and practice of the best methods.? 
The normal schools are improving in the methods of training they practice, and in 
the results they produce. ‘The present entering classes of these schools are better 
prepared for a professional course of study than were those of former times, This 
previous preparation will in time relieve the normal schools of a large amount of 
academical work which is now required in connection with professional study. The 
State normal schools are the Normal Art School, at Boston, and normal schools at 
Bridgewater, Framingham, Salem, Westfield, and Worcester. The school at Fram- 
ingham is the first State normal school ever established on this continent. In 1838 a 
member of the board of education and an earnest friend of the public schools, the 
Hon. Edmund Dwight, of Boston, offered the gift of $10,000, to be expended under 
the direction of the board, for the training of public school teachers, provided the 
State would furnish an equal amount for the accomplishment of the same end.? 
Tho offer was accepted, and on the 3d of July, 1839, the school was opened at Lexing- 
ton, removed in 1844 to West Newton, and thence to Framingham in 1852, the re- 
moyal in each instance being caused by the increased demand for accommodations, 
~ The school at Westfield followed in September, 1839, and a year later the third school 
was established at Bridgewater. For nearly 50 years normal school graduates and 
under-graduates have been entering the ranks of public school teachers in their State,” 
* Two courses of study are offered at the State normal schools, one of 2 years and an 
advanced course of 2 years additional, The curriculum embraces the usual grammar 
studies, higher mathematics, natural and mental science, book-keeping, language, 
literature, didactics, civics, school laws of Massachusetts, drawing, vocal music, and 
ymnastics. In addition to these subjects the 4 years’ course includes advanced studies 
in mathematics, science, general history, Latin, and French, Greek and German addi- 
tional is optional with the principal and board of visitors of each school, At Wor- 
cester, German may be substituted for French, as the interests of the school from time 
to time demand. Graduates of the regular course who desire to prepare themselves 
for the higher departments of teaching are permitted to take an advanced course at 
some of the schools, occupying 2 years, and including instruction and training in the 
Latin, French, and German languages, the higher mathematics, and other branches 
required to be taught in the high schools of the State, 
Tuition, and generally the use of all text-books, is free to such students as pledge 
themselves to complete the course of study and afterwards to teach in the public 
schools of Massachusetts, irrespective of their place of residence. Those whose pur- 
pose is to teach in other States or in private schools are required to pay in advance 
$30 annual tuition, Pecuniary aid is furnished by the State to the amount of $4,000 
per annum for the normal schools, which is distributed among the several institu- 
tions and given to promising pupils from Massachusetts who are unable without 
assistance to meet all their expenses. This aid is distributed among the students 
at the close of each term in sums varying according to the distance of their resi- 
dences from the school, but not exceeding in any case $1.50 per week. At the normal 
school at Salem additional assistance is given from the income of the fund of $5,000, 
a bequest of Nathaniel I. Bowditch, Esq., of Brookline. 
The Massachnsetts Normal Art School was established by the State as a training 
school for teachers of indnstrialart. The intention and scope of the school are broad. 
It aims to fit pupils for two very different kinds of work, namely: (1) To train stu- 
dents to teach and supervise drawing in the public schools; (2) to fit pupils to give 
instruction in the various branches of study in the evening and other industrial 
drawing schools. It also aims to provide for high skill in technical drawing, and for 
industrial art culture. Candidates for admission are examined inthe common English 
branches of study, and in free-hand drawing of ornament from copy. Tuition is free 
to students residing within the State and intending to teach drawing in the public 
schools; for others, the charge is $50 per term. The school offers a 4 years’ course 
of training in the mechanical and artistic branches, and their practical application

toindustry, and a2 years’ course of training for the work of teaching and super- 
vising drawing in the public schools, A post-graduate course of 1 year is provided 
for graduates without payment of fees, on condition that if called upon by the princgi- 
pal they will devote some of their time to teaching in the school, 
The normal school at Bridgewater has of late years given increased attention to the 
study of natural and physical science as related to school work, especially intended 
to indoctrinate the pupils in those methods of scientific study which may be exempli- 
fied in the most elementary work, The institution has 7 laboratories—2 in the do- 
partment of physics, 2 for chemistry, a mineralogical and geological laboratory, 
a biological laboratory, and an industrial laboratory—furnished with the approved 
modern appliances for teaching how to teach and study the physical and natural 
sciences. This institution reports a ‘School of Observation,” which the students 
visit to observe the teaching of elementary subjects to children by a model teacher, 
Physical exercise is provided for by grounds for out-door sports and a pond for skat- 
ing. ‘ 
Framingham has a practice school which inelndes classes of all grades, from the 
lowest primary to the grammar. The work in this department is an important part 
of the training course, and occupies from 5 to 8 weeks in the last year of the course. 
Teaching exercises form a large and important part of the school work at Salem, and 
during the senior term object lessons are given to classes of primary school children. 
At Westfield the policy is to advance the standard of graduation from year to year, 
The most pressing need is a practice school, This need is partially met by frequent 
visits of the members of the senior class to one of the. best of the public schools of the 
town, and by bringing small detachments of children from the same school into the 
normal school building to be there taught by the normal school pupils. f 
The normal school at Worcester has no practice school connected with the institu- 
tion, but systematic observation of schools and actual practice in teaching, under 
the joint supervision of the city superintendent and the faculty of the Morne aatealh 
constitute an important element in the course of training, and is known as tho ‘ ap- 
prenticeship.”! The systematic, objective study of children has developed into a 
regular feature of the school, and its influence in bringing students into close and 
true relations to children is already apparent. It is the source of a new and fresh in- 
terest in the whole aim and object of teaching, and it gives at the same time valua- 
ble aid in forming correct habits of scientific observation and induction that may be 
applied to the pursuit of any object of study whatever. The records of these gbser- 
vations of children, now amounting to several thousands in number, are carefully 
classified and preserved, and are believed to contain much valuable material for a re- 
yised and improved psychology of childhood, that may in the future render impor- 
tant service to the art of teaching,? 
Boston.—The work of the Normal School is satisfactorily and judiciously carried on. 
The course of study extends through one year and is pursued with special reference to 
teaching. The curriculum embraces mental and moral science and logic, principles 
of education, school economy and methods of instruction, physiology and hygiene, 
natural science, study of language, elementary studies, vocal music, drawing and 
black-board illustration, observation and practice in the training school and other 
public schools of the city. Tuition is free to residents, $75 being the annual charge 
for others. Most of the graduates find employment at once as substitutes, temporary 
teachers, special assistants, or teachers in the evening schools, and some are fortunate 
enough to be early called to permanent positions, ‘he normal school is proving more 
and more its value to the city as class after class adds experience to knowledge. 
Cambridge has a practice school in which all the classes are taught by young teach- 
ers under the immediate supervision of a master and a female assistant, Tho object 
of this plan is to give the young women of that city, who so desire and have made 
special preparation for the work, an opnart anit to gain experience under conditions 
favbrable to their own success, and without prejudice to the interest of their pupils. 
Graduates of the English High School or the Latin School, who have also graduated 
from one of the State normal schools, or from the Boston Normal School, are preferred 
as candidates for the position of teacher in this school, though other persons of equal 
attainments may also be elected. The required term of service is 1 year, but teach- 
ers may be retained for a longer period. Compensation is paid at the rate of $150 per 
annum for the first 4 months, and afterwards at the rate of $200 per annum, The 
school contains all the classes of the primary grade with the fourth, fifth, and sixth 
classes of the grammar grade, the number of pupils being about 450. 
Stated meetings of primary and grammar grade teachers respectively are held once 
in each term, and their schools are dismissed for the purpose. 
Chelsea has a system of apprenticeship, with preparatory course, for pupil teachers. 
From 20 to 25 graduates have been elected to permanent positions, which they have 
held with more than ordinary success. The disposition of the school board to select

grammar teachers from this corps after sufficient experience in the primary schools 
will do much towards harmonizing the system and strengthening the teaching force. 
Fall River has a training school for teachers which is reported in successful opera- 
tion, both as regards the teaching power of the pupil-teachers and the attainments of 
the children. The course extends through one year of study, and tuition is free. The 
model school consists of 6 rooms. The floor-teachers are required to teach about one 
hour daily in the presence of the pupil-teachers to illustrate what they regard as the 
best methods of teaching the different branches of study. At other times théy have 
been required to watch the young ladies teach, and at some convenient time after- 
ward to make suitable suggestions to them, looking towards their improvement in all 
those things which go to make up the faithful and efficient instructor. 
Gloucester reports that the training of pupil-teachers in the schools has been entirely 
successful. The high school is the main reliance for the supply, although the normal 
schools are wellrepresented. All candidates are required to serve a year without pay, 
unless they receive an earlier appointment. 
Haverhill has a training school, and the advantages derived by the schools from its 
influence are marked and valuable. The course of study extends over a period of one 
year and a half, and graduates of the high school are given the preference in admis- 
sion. Teachers’ meetings for grammar and primary schools are held monthly, and 
teachers of the other grades meet about as often. The teachers of the city have formed 
an association known as the Haverhill Teachers’ Association, which meets monthly. 
Lawrence has a training school which is reported to be doing excellent service in 
the lines of work for which it was established. The subjects are taught on the topical 
plan, and teaching exercises by the principal and subteachers form a large part of the 
class work. The course requires one year and a half, and a high school education is 
necessary for admission to the school. The normal and practice schools are combined, 
the pupils acting as teachers when not engaged in normal work. The school consists 
of 7 rooms, 6 of which contain primary and middle grades of pupils, about 300 in all. 
More than 100 teachers have been graduated at this school since its organization, and 
72 are now in service as teachers in the city schools, 
North Adams has a training school with one year’s course of study. Daily recita- 
tions are held under the charge of the principal, in the approved professional branches, 
and good facilities are furnished for the proper training of those who have the natu- 
ral qualities and aptitudes of a teacher.’ Practice in teaching is given, and the train- 
ing class with other teachers attend the teachers’ meetings held alternate Monday 
evenings. Certificates of graduation are given upon the satisfactory completion of 
the course, but employment is not insured to the graduates. : 
Watertown has established during the past year a training school for teachers. 
Under conditions imposed by the committee, young ladies now enter the schools as 
pupil-teachers. They act as unpaid assistants, and find their compensation in the 
example and guidance of the regular teachers and the practice permitted to them- 
selves, ; 
Springfield reports that more than half of the teachers employed in the primary 
and grammar grades of that city have made special preparation for their work. Ap- 
preciating not only the increasing demands of public school instruction, but recog- 
nizing that special preparation is as essential to efficient teaching as to skilful work 
in other professions, the school committee has resolved to give preference, in the se- 
lection of teachers, to those having received training at somo well-accredited normal 
school, or who can bring satisfactory evidence of successful work in the profession.? 
The excellent and progressive spirit animating the teachers is manifest by the at- 
tendance of about 40 per cent. of the entire corps at the Saratoga School of Methods, 
besides attendance of many at the National Educational Convention at Chicago, and 
other educational associations. The benefits obtained from these opportunities, with 
teachers’ reading circles, and the study of professional educational literature, are ob- 
served not only in the school work of those who availed themselves of their use, but 
in a quickening of the general interest in advanced methods of teaching in the 
schools. The earnestness and industry of a considerable number of the Springfield 
teachers, and the spirit of inquiry that animates them, is perhaps at this time the 
most encouraging feature of the schools.? 
Adams.—In order to raise the standard of the teaching force without depending upon 
outside institutions, the superintendent of schools strongly urges the holding of an- 
nual examinations for teachers’ certificates of two classes, primary and grammar, these 
to be confined to high school graduates or those who have received an equivalent 
training. The great need is a training school for those residents who desire to teach, 
and the demand for teachers is now large enough to make such a measure feasible. 
Blackstone.—A course of professional reading is recommended for the teachers of 
this town, comprising psychology, principles and methods of teaching, and history of 
education.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 425 
Braintree.—A large per centum of the teachers employed in this town have received 
special training, and to further promote professional and general intelligence, and 
thereby increase their teaching power, the teachers have formed a reading circle, with 
meetings twice amonth. The plan of work, in their line, embraces readings and in- 
vestigation in the science, art, and history of education, with discussions and illustra- 
tions upon important topics. 4 
Brockton.—In order to sustain a uniformity in the work throughout the city, princi- 
pals’ meetings have been held monthly. In addition to these there have been meet- 
ings of all the teachers, at which have been considered the methods of teaching, and 
one meeting specially assigned for the consideration of physiology is worthy of men- 
tion as producing valuable results. Besides these, there have been grade meetings for 
the consideration of questions and methods which apply only to a few teachers. 
Framingham allows visits of inspection. Leominster teachers met once a fortnight, 
_ or oftener, for consultation and instruction, and during the last two terms a majority. 
of them met once a week to read and study the history of education. : 
Middleborough has had mouthly meetings of teachers. Milford teachers have formed 
‘a reading circle for the study of the history and philosophy of education, and the vol- 
untary attendance at these meetings gives promise of satisfactory results in the future. 
Needham teachers are allowed one day in each term for visits of school inspection. 
New Bedford.—During the winter of 1886-87 there was considerable professional 
activity among the teachers of this city. The Swain Free School offered two courses, 
in the English language and in Shakspeare’s ‘‘ Twelfth Night,” with weekly or bi- 
weekly lectures, which a large number of the teachers attended. An enthusiastic 
group were busy with practical work in zodlogy, several local groups followed lines 
of professional and more general reading, and not a few worked singly in special lines 
of self-education. Perhaps the most interesting feature was the series of public meet- 
ings held about once a month under the auspices of the Chautauqua Teachers’ Read- 
ing Union, in which there was first a principal address and then a discussion of the 
subject by others. The audiences were frequently large, and in the discussions lead- 
ing ministers and lawyers took part with teachers in forming and expressing an in- 
telligent public opinion on educational matters.! 
Waltham.—The school committee of this city accepts as candidates for positions as 
teachers in all schools below the high school only graduates of normal schools, or 
those who have had ‘a successful experience in the particular work called for. 
Weymouth had teachers’ meetings during the year, of unusual interest and conducted 
chiefly by the ladies, who brought a number of their pupils with them and gave 
practical illustrations of the methods to be pursued in taking up and developing 
certain subjects. : 
As early as 1846 provision was made in this State for teachers’ institutes. For 
several years it has been the policy of the school authorities to hold teachers’ insti- 
tutes principally, or wholly, in the smaller towns of the State. The limited means 
of these towns oftentimes does not allow them to employ teachers of high qualifica- 
tions, or of successful experiences, and hence educational meetings being seldom held 
in them there is a greater need for that stimulus and interest so often experienced for 
good in larger and more favored communities. During the year 1885-86 few insti- 
tutes were held, and only such as were invited by local school authorities. The time 
usually given to that work was spent in visiting the schools of the towns, in holding 
meetings of the teachers and committees, and in addressing the people on the educa- 
tional needs of the several localities. The schools of one hundred and fifteen towns 
were thus visited by the agents of the board in company with the school committees, 
and on the last day of the visits committees and teachers haye been called together 
for suggestions and instruction. These visits were usually closed by an evening lect- 
ure for the people, given by the secretary or agents. 
In 1837 the first county teachers’ association was incorporated, and since that time 
teachers’ associations have been formed in nearly every one of the fourteen counties 
of the State, for the discussion of those problems which present themselves in the 
every-day work of the public schools. These associations holding meetings of not 
less than one day annually receive assistance from the State. 
The forty-second- annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held in 
Boston, November 26-27, 1886. Thesum of $300 annually is paid to this association by 
the State, subject to the approval of the board of education. The twentieth annual 
meeting of the Massachusetts Association of Classical and High School Teachers con- 
vened in Boston, April 8-9, 1887. The eleventh triennial conclave of the State Nor- 
mal Association was held in Salem, July 1, 1887. The Lady Teachers’ Association, of 
Boston, is a mutual benefit society of teachers for the purpose of aiding such of its 
members as may be sick. Meetings are held quarterly for business and social pur- 
poses, and any one among the 1,100 lady teachers of the city is eligible to member- 
ship. The Schoolmasters’ Club meets bimonthly at the Brunswick, Boston.

MICHIGAN. 
Tho State Normal School is located at Ypsilanti, The present accommodations are inadequate for the large attendance, and provision is being made to supply this need. 
Each member of the Legislature of Michigan is authorized by the board of educa- ‘tion to appoint two students from his district, who are received free of charge for 
tuition, Hach appointmont is good for one year. Students are offered a choice from several courses of study, which have been arranged to meet the demands of the vari- 
ous grades of schools and the needs of the different classes of teachers; but all the 
courses of study demand an equal amount of professional training and instruction.. 
The four-years’ courses are the scientific, literary, ancient classical, modern classical, 
Latin and German, and scientific Latin ; the three-years’ courses are the English, and 
the special course with music, This latter has been extended to afford instruction in 
choral singing and in instrumental music. Pupils‘of the school who receive diplomas 
from any course are entitled to legal’ certificates of qualification to teach in any of 
Lic schools of the State. Diplomas of the English course are equivalent to 
certificates for five years; of the other courses, for life. The practice school con- . 
nected with the institution includes primary and grammar grades, and has an enrol- 
ment of 244 pupils, 4 
Adrian has a training class, for which, from a number of applicants, 4-are selected 
each year, with special reference to scholarship and fitness for the work of teaching, 
Both theory and practice receive due attention in the course, which. extends over 1 
Me Monthly teachers’ meetings are held, and days allowed for school visits of in- 
spection, 
Bay City has a training school, comprising the primary grades in one of the gram- 
mar schools. This department occupies 4 rooms and is in charge of a principal with 
6 assistants, chosen from the graduating class of the high school. These assistants 
serve 7 months without pay and 3 months with pay, and, if successful in their work, 
are eopolntes, as regular teachers for the following year. A general teachers’ meet- 
ing is held at the beginning of the school year; principals’ meetings and high school 
teachers’ meetings, each monthly ; and special meetings at the call of the superin- 
tendent, Visiting other schools is allowed, 
Cadillac holds monthly teachers’ meetings and permits school visits, 
Cheboygan, during the fall and spring terms, has classes for normal training when 
the number of pupils will justify the use of time for that purpose. 
Coldwater has weekly teachers’ meetings. 
Detroithas a normal training class, which is taught in the high school building. 
The salient features of this class are one half-year’s instruction in the science and art 
of teaching and one half-year’s observation and supervision of practice work of the 
class instructed during the previous half-year. The candidates for the training class 
are selected by competitive examination from the graduates of the high school and 
others who have pursued an equivalent course of study. The entire year spent in 
the training class is probationary, but pupil-teachers who prove efficient and valuable 
are assured of regular employment and precedence in appointment over members of 
any subsequent class. It is suggested to return to the original idea of depending on 
the training class for 80 per cent, of all appointees in the primary and grammar 
schools, and to add a new feature by the payment of $10 per month to the pupil- 
teachers during their 5 months of probationary service, 
Fenton.—At tho high school a teachers’ course of 1 year may be selected from the 
English course, and the student who completes the studies will be prepared to obtain 
a first-grade certificate; but it is expected that the student who does this work in 1 
year has completed the first years’ course of study in the high school. Teachers are 
allowed one day each half-year for visiting other schools. 
Grand Rapids.—The ‘cadet system” of training teachers has superseded the regu- 
lar training school for resident graduates of the high school in this city, This plan 
assigns young persons desiring to fit themselves for the profession as assistants to 
principals of schools, who supervise their practice work in the lower grades of the 
school, The city superintendent recommends that these “ cadets” be instructed, as 
a class, in the principles and methods of taisal | and then be required to work them 
out for themselves; and if the work of a year fails to develop fairly good teachers, 
they should be dropped altogether from the rolls, A teachers’ library has been started 
in this city, Regular monthly teachers’ meetings are held, with grade meetings ad- 
ditional. 
Hastings has a teachers’ class conducted during the first half of the fall and last 
half of the winter term. The pupils make frequent visits to primary and grammar 
departments for inspection, Tuition is charged at the rate of 35 cents per week. An annual teachers’ institute of 2} days is held before the opening of schools in Septem- 
ber, and absence from any part of it renders the teacher liable to dismissal. Regular 
and special teachers’ meetings are held additional, A teachers’ reading circle has been in operation some time, and receives unbounded praise from the city superin- 
tendens for its valuable work.

Ludington has normal classes during the fall and winter terms for the benefit of 
high school graduates, Monthly teachers’ meetings are held. 
nstitute work in Michigan is important and popular. The State superintendent 
reports that the institutes during 1886 rallied a large and enthusiastic attendance of 
teachers and school officers, and that their work has been, in the main, satisfactory 
and prolific of good, A manual of institute work is published in the superintendent’s 
report for 1886, which will be found useful in organizing and conducting institutes, 
The organization and work of the teachers’ reading circle is introduced and earnestly 
recommended as a most important means of the teacher’s growth and culture. 
The thirty-sixth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at 
Lansing, December 28-30, 1886. 
Michigan has a State teachers’ reading circle, During the year changes were made 
in jhe organization of local circles, by which they may be established directly by the 
State Reading Circle Council whenever five teachers unite in requesting such organ- 
ization A payment of the membership fee, 50 cents a year, will entitle to all the 
privileges of the circle.? 
MINNESOTA, 
The normal schools of this State are among the best of the kind in the country 
Preparatory, classes haye been abolished, which action was made necessary by the 
demands of the rapidly growing normal departments, The schools are taught by ex- 
perienced instructors and are thoroughly furnished with modern appliances and val- 
uable libraries and cabinets for instruction in academic and professional branches, 
Since the establishment of the first school at Winona in 1860, more than 1,300 pupils 
have graduated and many partial students haye received instruction, who afterwards 
entered the profession of teaching, The course of study covers 3 and 4 years, except 
for graduates of high schools and colleges, for whom a. professional course of 1 year 
is prepared, Excellent work is done in natural sciences, both by experiment and in- 
dividual collection and analysis. Jfankato has been for several years a United States 
signal station, and students at the normal school have opportunity of acquiring prac- 
tical knowledge of the subject of meteorology. The school at Saint Cloud is also 
connected with the Signal Service Bureau, and work of that kind is made tributary 
to class instruction in science, Five thousand dollars have been appropriated by 
the Legislature for the enlargement and improvement of the grounds at Mankato. 
The school at Winona has a special kindergarten training course, to graduates of 
which special diplomas are awarded, Candidates holding second-grade certificates 
are admitted to the normal schools without examination, also graduates of approved 
high schools and others with equivalent attainments, Other candidates are required 
to pass a creditable examination in the common branches, and to receive the benefit 
of free tuition, all pupils must pledge themselves to teach at least two years in the 
public schools of the State, 
Minneapolis has formed plans for a training class to begin in September, 1887, and 
Saint Paul has a training school with a course of one year, which is considered 
equivalent to the senior year in either course in the high school. 
Duluth,—Teachers’ meetings haye been held. biweekly in Duluth, with occasional 
model class exercises, and opportunity for visiting and inspecting other schools. 
Saint Cloud district has teachers’ meetings, and Saint Paul has weekly grade meetings 
and general monthly meetings, 
Teachers’ institutes are held annually in every county in which there are schools, 
and the sentiment is becoming prevalent that teachers should avail themselves of 
these opportunities for improvement.

MISSISSIPPI. £ 
This State has, as yet, no normal school for white pupils, but two such institutions 
are maintained for the colored race. By a recent apportionment of Peabody scholar- 
ships at the Nashville College, those formerly assigned to Mississippi have been with- » 
drawn. The State superintendent urges the establishment of a State normal school 
for white teachers, or a chair of pedagogy in the State University, and one in the 
Agricultural and Mechanical College.’ A normal course of 2 years has been established 
at the Industrial Institute and College for White Girls, with free tuition for residents 
of the State. By law the trustees of this school apportion to each county its.quota of 
scholars on the basis of the educable white girls in the State and several counties,

and these are admitted into the institution, with all its privileges, for the course of 
studies selected. The studies of the normal students are first directed so as to enable 
them to pass the examinations required by the State law. After this, those who re- 
main long enough are carried forward to the study of advanced subjects to prepare 
them to become teachers in high schools and colleges. A prominent feature of the 
normal work is the introduction of a well-arranged line of instruction in free-hand 
drawing and industrial drawing, so that young ladies will be competent to give boys 
and girls thorough instruction in drawing, in order that these may be able to read 
designs and plans, and to represent with the pencil any object it is desirable to manu- 
facture. This is intended to produce a large class of educated, skilled workers, and 
thus contribute ultimately to the general industrial development and wealth of the 
State. " 
Private normal schools are reported at Iuka, Duck Hill, Buena Vista, and Troy. 
The State Normal School at Holly Springs, for colored pupils, was abolished by 
the Legislature in 1886, and reorganized and reopened the same year. The standard 
of admission. has been raised, and the course of study covers 2 years. There is a 
model class taught in rotation by the normal pupils under the supervision of some 
member of the faculty. Tuition inthe normal school is free to students from the State, 
and text-books are also furnished gratis. Students are required, by way of compensa- 
tion, to teach at least 3 years in tho public schools of the State. 
Tougaloo University, at Tougaloo, which is mainly an industrial school, has also a 
normal department receiving State aid. There is an elementary, and an advanced 
course, of 2 and 4 years respectively. Tuition is charged at the rate of.$1 monthly. 
Alcorn Agricultural and Mechanical College trains colored teachers for the public 
schools; and most of the graduates and some of the undergraduates who are teach- 
ing in the State have first-grade certificates under the new school law. 
The new education is rapidly gaining ground in this State, and there never was a 
time in its history when such an interest was manifested in educational matters as at 
present. Five years ago there was not a normal institute for whites in the State, 
while now there is one in nearly every county.!_ The law requires teachers’ insti- 
tutes, separate for the races, to be held monthly during the school year. Each county 
is divided into three institute districts, or a less number, if such a division will not 
give 10 teachers to each district, and teachers are required to attend, with a penalty for 
unexcused absence. Superintendent John S. Lamkin, of Pike County,suggestsa change 
in the law requiring the county superintendent to hold semiannual institutes from 
3 to 5 days, for the races separately, not longer than 3 weeks prior to the commence- 
ment of the school term that follows.? The State superintendent recommends that 
counties be allowed to employ expert institute managers to hold county institutes of 
a week’s duration prior to the opening of the winter term. A summer normal insti- 
tute for whites was conducted at Pontotoc for 6 weeks during July and August. At 
the annual examination of teachers throughout the State, those averaging 95 per 
cent. receive State licenses for 5 years. The State superintendent suggests that the 
law be amended so as to provide life licenses for all teachers who, at the expiration 
of their first, obtain second State licenses and continue regularly in the service ; and 
also that licenses be valid for 2 years when issued to first-grade teachers who make an 
average of 90 per cent. on the regular examinations, 
Jackson.—The city superintendent of schools is required to organize a normal class 
of teachers, to meet as often as he may deem advisable. Meridian High School has 
a course of theory and practice of teaching in the third year. A normal class of 
teachers is also organized, similar to that in Jackson.

MISSOURI. 
The State of Missouri is divided into 3 normal school districts, with State normal 
schools ineach, These are located—for the first district, at Kirksville; for the second 
district, at Warrensburg; and for the third district, at Cape Girardeau. Saint Louis 
has a city normal school, and Lincoln Institute at Jefferson City is a State normal 
school for colored teachers, The revised course of study, constructed with special 
reference to fitting teachers for the common and high schools, is substantially the 
same in the three State normals, Embracing precisely the same range of subjects, 
each school adjusts the course to suit its special wants. The English language and 
literature, Latin, mathematics, science, history, professional studies, and art are in- 
cluded in the two courses of study. The elementary course occupies 2 years, confer- 
ring an elementary certificate which indicates the studies pursued and the grade ob- 
tained in each, with authorization to teach in any county of the State for a period of , 
4 years from date, unless sooner annulled. The advanced course occupies 2 years ad- 
ditional, conferring a diploma which authorizes the holder to teach in the public 
schools of the State without farther examination, until such authority is revoked.

TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 429 
To those holding diplomas and teaching successfully 2 and 3 years after graduation, 
masters’ degrees are conferred, after examination, if the prescribed post-graduate 
course of reading, or its equivalent, be completed. This course includes history, 
biography, science, poetry, fiction, and professional subjects. Tuition is free at the 
State normal schools, but all pupils are required to sign a declaration of intention to 
teach, giving preference to the public schools of the State. Kirksville and Warrens- 
burg have practice training schools. 
The Saint Louis Normal School, though intended exclusively for the education of 
young ladies intending to teach in the public schools of that city, is open to ladies 
from any section of the country. Tuition is free, and text-books are furnished for use 
free of charge. Graduates of the high school are admitted to the special course, which 
requires 1} years for completion. Applicants who have finished at least 2 years of the 
high school course take the general course of 2} years. The number of pupils is 
limited for the present to 150, and all are required to sign a pledge of intention to 
teach in the public schools of the city at least 2 years. The course of study embraces 
the usual English branches, Latin or German, calisthenics, and professional subjects. 
In the general course instruction is provided for those who wish to become German- 
English teachers, and who are far enough advanced in the study to conyerse in Ger- 
man. Diplomas of graduation are given upon completion of the normal school course 
to those students who have previously graduated from the high school. All other / 
students, upon completing the course, receive certificates of qualification, which, as 
well as the diplomas, entitle the students to positions in the Saint Louis public schools 
without further examination whenever their services are needed. Every student of 
the school teaches for at least 5 weeks, under supervision. 
Lincoln Institute, at Jefferson City, originated in a fund contributed by the Sixty- 
second and Sixty-fifth regiments United States Colored Infantry, when discharged 
from service in January, 1866. The institution has been a State normal school for a ‘ 
number of years, and receives appropriations commensurate with its needs. The . 
course includes preparatory and normal departments, the latter occupying 4 years. 
At a meeting of colored citizens of the State, held at Kansas City in January, 1887, 
it was determined to petition the Legislature for a manual training school and colle- 
giate department in connection with the Colored State Normal School, as at present 
there is no school of higher grades provided at public expense for colored students.! 
Although normal institutes in this State do not as yet receive State aid, depending 
on local effort and support, fully one-half of its 114 counties are reported to have : 
made arrangements for these meetings, with prospective sessions of from 1 to 6 weeks, 
for the summer and autumn of 1887.2, The exercises are conducted by county com- ” 
missioners, or special institute conductors, and year by year the teachers’ institutes 
become more prominent as a valuable factor in preparing teachers for the arduous 
and peculiar work necessary to success in the school room. Regarding the results of 
these meetings, it is observed as a noteworthy fact that those counties are making 
the greatest progress in which successful institutes have been liberally sustained for 
a term of years, while the poorest schools are found in those counties in which insti- 
tute work is discouraged and neglected.? * 
Carthage has monthly teachers’ meetings. Kansas City has regular monthly meet- 
ings, monthly consultations with principals and teachers, and special or grade meet- 
ings, Moberly has monthly teachers’ meetings, with model lessons, discussions, lec- 
tures, etc. Saint Joseph has a reading circle, which holds weekly meetings after school 
hours, and has entered upon a systematic study of the elementary principles of men- 
tal science. No person is appointed as teacher without satisfactory evidence of some 
experience in the profession, or of having attended an approved normal or training 
school for at least one school year. Teachers are allowed two days during the year for 
school inspection. ‘The Saint Louis Society of Pedagogy was formed for the purpose 
of discussing the subjects belonging to the science of pedagogy, and the collection of 
information in regard to the same. Monthly meetings are held from September to 
May, inclusive, and are open to the public. The work of this society has developed 
a greatly increased interest in school matters generally, as well as having been pro- 
ductive of mutual improvement in the science and art of education, Sedalia has 
regular monthly teachers’ institutes. \ 
The twenty-sixth annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association convened at 
Sweet Springs, June 21-23, 1887. The colored State Teachers’ Association met at 
Saint Louis, December 28, 1886. There are 4 district associations in the State; 3 of 
these—the North-west or Missouri Valley Association, the North-east District Associa- 
tion, and the South-west District Association—hold meetings during the Christmas 
holidays, while the South-east Association convenes in August. The Missouri School 
of Science and Pedagogy, established in 1884, is a summer school under the auspices 
of the State Teachers’ Association. The object of this school is the further education

of teachers in science (in its broader sense) and pedagogy. Thus far the teachers 
who have attended have been of a high grade, but special effort has been made to 
‘ provide for the common school teacher. ‘The presidents of the State normal schools 
¥ ‘and other distinguished educators are among the instructors.!_ The Missouri Teach-~ 
ers’ Academy, organized in July, 1886, and the Summer School of Science and Peda- 
gogy met in joint session at Sweet Springs, June 24-30, 1887, immediately following 
the State Teachers’ Association. 
The Missouri Teachers’ Reading Circle has a considerable membership. A fee of 
25 cents was charged during the past year. The entire course includes 4 years’ read- 
ing, 2in elementary and 2 in advanced work. The course is optional, but the State 
board urgesa regular course. Local circles are recommended. Certificates are awarded 
to those completing either course. 
MONTANA. 
Teachers’ institutes are the principal agency for the professional training of teachers 
in Montana. All the counties of the Territory now come under the law requiring 
institutes to be held once each year in every county having more than 5 organized. 
school districts. These institutes have become very popular with teachers and friends 
of education, and are wonderfully helpful to teachers. Attendance for the most part 
is willing and cheerful, and the few who absent themselves because the law does not 
prescribe a penalty for non-attendance, are those who have little interest in the pro- 
fession, and who, in most cases, should not be employed to teach at all. The super- 
intendent of public instruction recommends that teachers be required to obtain excuse 
for non-attendance, with revocation of certificate as penalty for failure to comply 
with the law. 
The Territorial Teachers’ Association has become a permanent institution in the 
Territory. Great interest is taken in the annual meetings, and it is.to be regretted 
that the distance to be travelled, and the consequent expense, keep many away who 
would otherwise attend. Attention is called to the benefits which would result to 
; the cause of education if some legislative aid were granted to teachers who attend 
the Territorial Association, such as paying a portion of the mileage. The favors of 
railroads in this regard receive complimentary notice. 
The annual session of the association was held at Butte City, December 28-30, 1886, 
and is reported as a very successful meeting. Among the resolutions adopted as 
recommendations to the Legislature on needed changes in the school law, was one 
asking that power be granted to the Territorial superintendent to issue Territorial 
certificates to all whom he shall find qualified to teach, on personal observation, or 
after personal examination by himself, or deputy appointed by himself, said certifi- 
cates to be of two grades, valid for 5 and 10 years, respectively, throughout the 
Territory.” ‘ 
NEBRASKA. 
The State Normal School at Peru is reported in a most flourishing condition, and 
, With its added facilities and the liberal legislative appropriations, it stands upon a 
footing surpassed by few schools of like character. There is pressing need for two 
additional normal schools. Though the present building was doubled in capacity 
one year ago, there is now scarcely room for those in attendance. The increase of 
pupils during the past 6 years has beon more than 200, or nearly double, while the 
average attendance has increased in even a greater ratio. Thirty-nine counties of 
the State were represented in the school last year.? An elementary course of study, 
occupying 2 years, is designed to prepare teachers for the common ungraded and 
lower grade schools. At the completion of this course a certificate of qualification is 
granted, which is equivalent to a second grade State certificate valid for 2 years. 
A higher course of 8 years’ additional study is provided for those intending to become 
strictly professional teachers, and to prepare them for any educational position to 
which they may be called. Besides the common English branches taught in the ele- 
mentary course, higher branches are included, with advanced professional study. 
Graduates of the higher course receive a diploma which is valid for 3 years as a State 
certificate of the first grade, and any graduate furnishing satisfactory evidence of 
success for 2 years will be granted an additional diploma, equivalent to a first grade 
State certificate for life. Tuition in the regular courses of the school is free to all 
students. Provision has been made for admitting students into a preparatory depart- 
ment and elementary classes, which will be mainly taught by members of the ad- 
vanced classes in the normal department under the eye of trained instructors. 
Hastings held regular ‘and special teachers’ meetings, and 2 half days each year 
are allowed for school inspection. ; 
Lincoin has a general meeting of teachers at the opening of the school year, and 
also grade meetings and others during the term.

  : TRAINING OF TEACHERS. — 431 \ 
Teachers’ institutes have proved of greatest value, and the growth of the work has 
been phenomenal. The clause in the law giving the county superintendent power 
to revoke a certificate for refusal to attend the institute has proved most efficacious. 
A more systematic and uniform course of study is desirable.! Of other educational 
helps, county associations of teachers, district associations, educational columns in 
public journals, and the reading circle organization, have been most prominent. 
Forty-two counties have associations and report 219 meetings. These are devoted to 
discussion of educational problems, methods of work, lectures, and exhibits of 
school work, etc. Three district organizations have been formed, in thé south-east- 
ern, central, and northern parts of the State. . 
‘The State Teachers’ Association held its annual meeting at Lincoln during the spring 
of 1887. The Northern Nebraska Teachers’ Association met in winter session at Nor- 
folk, December 28-30, 1886. The South-eastern Association met at Beatrice during the 
fall of 1886, . 
The State Teachers’ Reading Circle is subdivided into county circles, which may 
again organize local reading classes. An annual fee of 50 cents is charged. The 
course of reading oceupies 2 years and consists of professional subjects, history, 
science, and general literature. Thirty-five counties are reported as having circles, 
with a large membership, The historical and professional courses appear to give the 
most satisfaction.1 ‘ 
NEVADA, 
The State Soa pat, in his biennial report (1885-86), renews his former rec- 
ommendation that a normal school be established in Nevada. He suggests a normal 
class in the State University; or, since there is little demand at present for a univer- 
sity, while there is an immediate and almost imperative demand for a normal school, 
let the university itself be converted into a normal school, and the proceeds from sale 
of lands for the ‘university be devoted to the support of the normal school. 
The State Teachers’ Institute has exercised a potent influence upon the cause of edu- 
cation in Nevada. In July, 1886, two sessions of the seventh annual institute were 
held, one at Reno, July 27-30, and an evening session at Carson City, July 31, 1886. 
Ninety-three téachers were enrolled at this meeting. 
The State board of education is now authorized to grant State certificates, educa- 
tional diplomas, and life diplomas. The issuance of these State credentials to teachers 
has elevated the profession in Nevada, and is now generally approved by the people. 
Under this law, also, upon the recommendation of the county superintendent where 
the applicant lives, a first-grade county certificate may be made valid in any county 
in the State. 
A new law, understood to be an experiment, provides that on and after the first 
Monday in January, 1889, district attorneys, in addition to their other duties, shall 
be ex officio county superintendents of schools.? 
NEW HAMPSHIRE, 
The Now Hampshire State Normal School is located at Plymouth. The prescribed 
course of study is completed in 2 years, and includes the English language and litera- 
ture, mathematics, natural science, professional study, history, civil government, etc. 
A model school is connected with the institution, and training in teaching, beginning 
the first year, increases in amount with successive terms, according to the pupil’s 
preparation for it by study of principles and methods. Tuition is free, and all students 
are required to declare their intention to teach. 
Manchester has a city training school which requires of candidates for admission 
graduation in some high school, or an equivalent. The regular course of study for 
those intending to become primary teachers is 1 year; and an advanced course of 6 
months is further required of those desiring to teach in the higher grades. Pupils in 
the training class are paid at the rate of $10 per month after 6 months, and $20 per 
month after a year’s service for actual work in the school. In the selection of teachers 
graduates of the training school have the preference, if equally qualified. For several 
years more than 50 per cent, of the corps of lady teachers of this city has come from 
the training school, and this year it was 71 per cent. 3 
Dover has a teachers’ library which has proved of great value. The city superin- 
tendent urges very strongly the establishment of a training school. 
Porismouth had frequent and stated meetings of teachers, and in addition there has 
been a weekly class in psychology. The necessity for trained teachers has been recog- 
nized to some extent by requiring inexperienced teachers to go about among the | 
schools for three months and observe the methods. A class of pupil teachers was 
organized near the beginning of the autumn term, several members of which are 
rendering efficient service. 
Annual teachers’ institutes are required by law to be held in each county, the ex- 
penses being defrayed from the. proceeds of the sale of State lands. Manchester

reports, early in 1887, the largest and most successful institute held in the State. 
The registered teachers in attendance numbered 213. A State teachers’ institute was

‘ NEW JERSEY. 
The New Jersey State Normal School is located at Trenton. Thisinstitution stands 
high in value and importance to the cause of education in the State, as is shown by 
the fact that so many schools are under the superior discipline and teaching of those 
“who are graduates of the State Normal School, and that so many of its graduates are 
now applied for and sought to fill the places of teachers in the public schools of the 
State. The course of study is constantly kept at the line which will enable those per- 
fecting themselves for practical teaching to advance in the knowledge of the science 
of teaching, step by step. All known methods of imparting instruction which are 
really useful and advantageous are adopted, but nothing is allowed to interfere with 
the long-practiced, thorough mental drill, which is the daily, hard, plodding, and 
severe work of teachers and students. - 
Two courses of instruction are offered, one extending through 2 years and the other 
through 3 years. These courses include the usual English branches, book-keeping, 
musi¢, drawing, natural and mental science, history, literature, algebra, and geom- 
etry, with professional instruction and pedagogics. Lectures upon subjects connect- 
ed with school work are delivered before the schools during each year, as well as 
lectures upon other topics of interest to young ladies and gentlemen. In the model 
school attached to the institution the normal classes have opportunity for exercising 
‘ their talent and ability by active work, practically applying and testing their knowl- 
. edge, capability, and fitness as teachers in the common schools. During the last five 
months of their course of study in the Normal School the members of the graduating 
class are required to teach in the model school. 
Applicants for admission to the Normal School, who have successfully pursued the 
whole course of study prescribed by the county superintendent, upon the recom- 
mendation of the superintendent, are admitted without examination to the first year 
of the elementary course. Tuition is free to those intending to teach in New Jersey, 
and students must sign a declaration of intention to teach for at least 2 years in 
the public schools. Students in the model and Farnum Schools are admitted into the 
Normal School upon the certificate of the principals of those schools as to their fitness 
for admission. The model school connected with this institution, having boys and 
girls’ departments separate, besides including all the primary, grammar, and high 
school grades, offers special courses for business and preparation for college. 
‘ The Farnum Preparatory School at Beverly is intimately associated with the State 
Normal School in the work of preparing teachers for the public schools of the State. 
Pupils desiring to enter the preparatory class for teaching, and found qualified in the 
required studies, must sign an agreement to enter the Normal School to finish their 
training upon leaving the Farnum School. Pupils graduating at this school are re- 
ceived into the State Normal School without further examination. 
Jersey City has a normal training course which is taught during the second term of 
the senior year in the normal and English course at the high school. This term is 
devoted to pedagogical work, mental and moral science, history and science of edu- 
. cation, methods of teaching, and school economy. At the end of the senior year the 
students graduate with their class and receive diplomas from the high school. A 
post-graduate course is then required during which the work of the class consists of 
observation, teaching classes under supervision, practice in charge of aparticular class, 
practice in as many grades as possible other than in the practice school, and partic- 
ular study of the management and the working machinery of large schools. At the 
close of the post-graduate course pupils receive diplomas from the training school 
and are eligible to serve as monitors. Nearly all of the new teachers in the city 
schools are graduates of the high and training schools, though graduation at the 
training school implies no obligation of employment. All examinations for increase 
in salary when the teachers have completed their terms of service in a lower grade 
of salary, are held largely upon the theory and practice of teaching. This city has 
a teachers’ association and a reading circle, and visits of school inspection are per- 
~ mitted. 
Newark has a city normal and a training schoo]. The superintendent of schools re- 
ports the work done in the training class as very satisfactory. More room is needed 
for both the normal and training schools, and it is recommended that the course be 
extended to 2 years, and also that a kindergarten class be organized as part of the 
training course. The course of instruction consists of 1 year in the usual professional 
studies, and in addition each pupil in the normal school is required to spend at least 
8 weeks in practical class room work in the training school, under special direction of 
the city superintendent, principal of the normal school, and principal of the training

  school. No pupilis admitted to the training school without a certificate of gradua- 
tion from the high school, or upon examination equivalent to the high school course., 
Non-resident pupils are admitted upon payment of tuition fees determined by the 
board. All pupils entering must sign a written declaration of intention to teach in 
the schools of the city, if desired. Diplomas of graduation are given, which aro also 
certificates of qualification to teach. Three teachers’ institutes of 3 hours each are 
held during the year for primary teachers, and for teachers of grammar, high, and nor- 
mal schools respectively. 
Paterson has a normal training schoo! with a course of 1 year’s study. The entire 
year is devoted chiefly to class work and practice, with the constant study of meth- 
ods of teaching. Provision for manual training is reported as about to be made at 
this school. 
Union County has a teachers’ association, with four meetings annually. 
The teachers and school officers of the State, at a meeting in Trenton in 1887, 
organized a New Jersey Council of Education, to be composed of 48 members, divided 
into 3 classes, serving periods of 3 years each, The membership is to be limited to 
those engaged in professional school work, of recognized standing as educators, re- 
siding or teaching in New Jersey. Two regular meetings are to be held each year to 
discuss educational topics, disseminate information bearing on these topics, and con- 
  sider and recommend means of advancing educational interests! The State Teachers’ ° 
Association met in twenty-ninth annual session at Trenton, December 28-30, 1836. 
State, district, and local teachers’ reading circles are enthusiastically supported in 
New Jersey, except in county districts where bad roads and unfavorable weather 
prevent gatherings. Tho State circle has a membership of nearly 2,000. The course 
of reading for the second year (1886-87) comprises four books from a selection of 
professional works, history, mental science, Swinton, Hawthorne, Irving, and the 
Chautauquan. Plainfield is the headquarters of the Chautauqua University, which 
includes the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle and the Chautauqua Teachers’ 
Reading Union, both of which organizations have enrolled many teachers throughout 
the United States. 
NEW MEXICO. 
Efforts have been made from time to time to organize the educational forces of the’ 
Territory into an effective union. Circumstances, however, were unfavorable until 
last fall, when the Presbyterian Board, the American Missionary Association, and 
others, impelled by the wretched condition of public schools, determined to attempt 
an organization. This effort was cordially aided by the Governor and other public 
officials, and resulted in the formation of the Educational Association of New Mexico. 
The first meeting was held at Santa Fé, December 28-30, 1886, and proved a decided 
success. Important educational topics were discussed, papers read, and class exer- 
cises conducted in the presence of the assemblage. An interesting feature was an 
exercise in numbers by a class of Apache Indian girls, who, previous to last Septem- 
ber, had never been inside of a school-house and did not know a word of English. A 
committee was appointed to urge upon the Legislature needful changes in the school 
law.? ‘     
   
NEW YORK. 
The normal schools of this State, although doing most excellent work, are totally 
inadequate to supply the pressing demand for trained teachers. These schools as 
now operated do not fill one in ten of the vacancies occurring in the ranks of the 
30,000 common school teachers of the State. The system of teachers’ training classes 
in high schools and academies is doing something to meet the needs of the service in 
some of the cities and villages, where those classes have the advantages of actual 
practice as well as of instruction in methods, but in the greater part of the State, 
outside of these favored localities, the need of well-trained teachers is not properly 
met. ' 
Under the present laws of the State the normal school system has little or no organie 
connection with the public school system, or with the systems of secondary and higher 
schools supervised by the regents of the university. It is recommended that the laws 
be amended (1) so that regents’ certificates and pass-cards could be accepted by the 
normal schools for their face value, and (2) so that union schools and academies could. 
establish courses of study approved by the local boards of the normal schools and by 
the superintendent of public instruction, and pupils holding diplomas from those 
courses of study should be admitted without examination into the normal schools of 
the State, to enter at once upon professional work, which would enable those students 
to be graduated from the normal schools in a year from the time they enter. All the 
union schools, high schools, academies, and seminaries of the State would thus become

‘ ; uninterruptedly to their peculiar province of professional work. 
Seen New York stands next to Pennsylvania in the list of States having formal schools. 
There ate nine State institutions of this character, located at Albany, Brockport, 
Buffalo, Cortland, Fretlohia, Geneseo, New Paltz, Osivego, atid Potsdam. The school 
é at New Paltz is the latest addition, having begun operations in February, 1886. A 
5 new school lias been sanctioned by the State atithorities, and has elected its officers 
and undertaken preparatory work on buildings at Oneonta.! 
In order to meet the necessity fot some normal instruction among the large class of 
young persons desiting to teach, but who eat not afford the time or expense of a nor- 
mal school course, the superinténdent suggests a normal institiite lasting from 4 to 8 
weeks in any county where a suitable number of such persons might indi¢ate their 
desire for such instruction. It is estimated that from 3,000 to 4,000 teachers in the 
common schools drop out every year, and their places are stipplied by 4s many more 
without previous experience, niné-tenths of Whom have no adequate preparation for 
s the responsible work which they are taking up. The necessity of taking steps which 
’ will at least show them how little they do know and give then some realization of 
the need of better preparation, and then start them in the way of securing it, is press- 
      ing.? 
"Eho courses of study at thé nortal schools vaty in length. Albany has a 2 years’ 
course, Now Paltz 2 and 3. years, and the others 2, 3, atid 4 years’ coutses. The stud- 
ies required for a diploma authorizing the holder to teach in the public schools of 
the State consist of tho usual grammar strdies, higher mathematics, natural and 
mental science, civics, English Rterature, ancient ifstory, didacties, drawitg, and 
vocal musiv, with practice work. All the schools teach these studies, most of them 
having in addition classical and scientific courses. In the normal course proper only 
English is taught, with ancient and modern languages in the classical and scientific 
courses. Model training departments are reported at all the schools, with grades 
ranging from kindergarten throtigh primary, intermediate, and advanced depart- 
ments. The normal schools are practically open to any properly qualified and duly 
appointed candidates who may desire to avail themselves of such advantages. Per- 
sons desiring to attend consult the school commissioner of their district, and his rec- 
ommendations are made to the State superintendent of public instruction, whose ap- 
proval constitutes an appointment. Entrance’ examinations are required of all stu- 
dents. Tuition and the uso of all text-books are free, and the aniount of fare neces- 
sarily paid in coming by public conveyance to the school is refunded to those who re- 
main a fullterm. Normal students pledge themselves to teach in the public schools 
of the State for as long a period, at least, as that spent in the school. Appropriate 
diplomas are offered on the satisfactory completion of each course of study, which 
serve as licenses to teach in the public schools of the State. 
The Normal College of New York City reports an enrollment of 1,620 female pupils, 
with 66 instructors, being the largest normal school in the United States, The de- 
mand for admittance has been so great that a rule was passed limiting the number of 
admissions to 600 in any one year. In the admission of students it was deemed wisest 
“to institute a purely competitive examination and admit the 600 in the order of merit, 
without regard to any fixed per centum, except that no candidate could be admitted 
¥ unless she answered three-quarters of the questions aoe A high standard, how- 
. ever, with comparatively easy questions was established, but the result proved a dis- 
appointment. It was subsequectitly determined that the entrance examinations should 
consist of comparatively dificult questions, and to admit all who feceived an average 
of seventy-five. Of the total number of graduates since the establishment of the col- 
lege (3,700), about one-half ate now doing good work in the common schools of New 
York City, in which they occupy all positions from that of the lowest primary teacher 
up to that of principal. When deaths, matriages,\and removals from the city are 
taken into account this is an excellent showing, and clearly proves that almost all 
the graduates sooner or later obtain positions. 
The course of study covers a period of 4 years, and titition is free to all students. 
The instruction is comprehensive and thorough, and includes, in addition to the 
studies in Hnglish, Latin, French, Getinan, histoty, higher mathematics, drawing, 
- * music, natural, mental, and moral science, with methods of teaching and practice R 
the training department duting the last two years. In the tio modern languages, 
French and Getinan, the work has been so thoroughly done that there is now no dif- 
fioulty in obtaining graduates well qualified to instruct: children in the common 
schools in these subjects, and thus dispensing with the services of special teachers, 
Special mention is also made of the marked success achieved in the department of 
free-hand drawing and otiginal design. Beautiful work has been done by the grad- 
uates, which some of them have sold for fair prices.*

    TRAINING OF THACHERS, 435 
New York City has a teachers’ mutual benefit association, which received in June, 1887, a donation of $3,000 from a friend of the catise. Hereafter one-half of the receipts Of this association are to go to retired members, women that have taught for 35 years and men that have taught for 40 years.) ~ . 
Albany has a teachers’ training’ class, which has become an indispensable adjanet to the system of schools in that.city. The city superintendent reports that the good 
effects of the training school, are felt to-day in every school room in the city; for, aside from the direct benefit given to its graduates, the principles and metltods incnl- 
cated have permeated the whole corps of teachers.? The school was organized for 2 terms under the direction of the office of the regents of the university, who appro- 
riated the customary amount of $500 fot maintaining the class. The certificate of — 
hat body is issued to the graduates. The course of study extends through 1 year, and 
there is practically no instruction in subject matter, the whole time being giveti to 
the theory and practice of teaching. The instruction for the past year included musie, 
rawing, school economy, and civil government, United States history, and physiology 
for members of the class who had not passed the regents’ examination in these studies, - 
with methods in primary branches. Each member of the class has given lessons in 
the class on assigned subjects, and has observed 1 month and taught a number of 
weeks in a primary and a grammar school designated for the purpose. All the men- 
bers of the class have voluntarily given extra time to teachi 
elass of the primary school in periods of from 1 we 
iting a commendable desire to obtain all the 
résidents of the city, while others are charged $75 annually. 
Meetings of teachers for the purpose of discussion and mutual improvement have 
been. held regularly during the school year, to tho great advantage of all who at- 
tended. 
Brooklyn has a training school, occupying 4 rooms in ono of the primary schools of 
the city, which constitutes the model primary school. One year’s course of study is 
devoted to strictly professional subjects, reviewing only the elementary studies, and 
doing this for the purpose of exhibiting improved methods of instruction. The wotk 
of the pupil-teachers embraces, first, the study of tho principles of education, school 
government, and methods of instruction; second, the observation of work done bi; 
the model teachers in the primary classes; third, actual experience in teaching, eac 
pupil-teacher being required to successfully instruct a primary class for at least 10 
weeks before receiving a diploma. Tuition is free, and only holders of “B” certifi- 
cates are admitted to the training school as pupil-teachers. These certificates are 
granted after examination in the grammar studies, with algebra, geometry, astron- 
omy, and natural philosophy. Graduates of the training school may be appointed to 
any primary grade, and their experience in the training school shall entitle them to 
be credited as having had 2 years’ experience as teachers in the public schools. 
Although the pupil-teachers have no guarantee of an appointment upon the comple- 
tion of their course in the school, yet the number seeking admission is larger than 
can be admitted, and those in attendance seem to be controlled by a single purpose, 
that of properly fitting themselves for positions as teachers.$ ‘ 
The city superintendent is required to call the principals of the schools together 
atleast twice in each year for the purpose of consulting with and directing them 
in tho discharge of their duties, and he has also authority to call heads of depart- 
ments and teachers together at such times and places as he may think proper for the 
purpose of instructing them in the principles and methods of teaching. There is a 
teachers’ association in this city. x 
. Rochestor.—Regarding the normal class in this city the stpérintendent says: “A 
sufficient number of those who have received training class diplomas have already 
been émployed in our svhools to give opportunity for judging of the practical results 
of this preparatory training; and facts prove, what reason would indicate, that the 
average graduate of the training class gets an intelligent hold of her work in very 
much less time than was required by those of eqital scholarship and ability who used 
to enter the teacher's calling without any special preparation.” A more extended 
notice of this training class isfound elsewhere. ‘Tho only certificates now recognized 
by the school board of this city, besides those issued to graduates of the training class, 
are New York State College and Normal School certificates. ‘ ‘ 
Syracuse training school admits only graduates of the high school, or others having 
had equal literary advantages, the required standard being 75 per cent. upon the 
entrance examination. The course extends through one school year, and is divided 
into two terms’ work. The first term comprises a course in history, mental philosophy, 
methods of teaching arithmetic, geography, language, history of education, with 
something of practice in teaching. The second term’s work comprises more fully the 
theory and practice of teaching with the study of methods. The practioe of teaching 
is under the criticism of the training teacher, and is thorough. ‘The philosophy and             eral months, thus exhib-

history of education is continued and applied. At the end of the course the candi- 
dates are examined upon these subjects and upon their ability to haudle classes and 
conduct recitations. To all who are able to stand the required test the board of edu- 
cation grants certificates of qualification to teach in the city schools. Tuition is free 
to residents, and others are charged $34 annually. At present not less than from 25 
to 50 per cent. of the teachers in the city schools are graduates from this training 
school.t 
Monthly teachers’ meetings were held according to regulations during the year with 
more than customary regularity in attendance. The meetings have usually been in- 
teresting, and such topics have been considered and discussed as should call for 
earnest consideration of every one engaged in teaching. During the year teachers 
have had the privilege of listening to five or six addresses from prominent men en- , 
gaged in work similar to their own, and of participating in the discussion of those 
topics which are intimately connected with the every-day work of the school room. 
This feature of work has existed from the beginning of the city organization, and 
has been an important aid in building up the school system, and in unifying the work 
of the various schools and departments.! 
Appropriation is provided bylaw for the instraction in academies and union schools 
in ae science and practice of common school teaching. Each scholar instructed for 
the full term required by law in such classes, who has passed the pee exami- 
nation and also the final examination prescribed by the regents of the nniversity, is 
considered competent to teach in the common schools of the State. A testimonial! is 
granted to such a student, which, when endorsed by any school commissioner, con- 
stitutes a certificate to teach in the district for one year, which certificate, at suc- 
cessive expirations thereafter, may be re-endorsed and made valid for a period not to 
exceed three years after each endorsement. . 
Auburn.—Theory and practice of teaching is an elective study in the fourth year at 
the high school. Canandaigua.—Provision is made in the academical department for 
a normal course of one year, with free tuition to non-resident pupils. Corning has 
monthly teachers’ meetings. Gloversville had monthly teachers’ meetings and also 
a teachers’ association for reading and discussing standard educational books and for 
the study of English literature. Ithaca has general teachers’ meotings on the first 
Saturday of each school year, and at other times thereafter. 
Jamestown.—The Jamestown Union School and Collegiate Institute has a special 
normal department, which is organized at the epening of the fall term. The course 
of instruction consists of lectures semiweckly by the superintendent and class reci- 
tations in those subjects required by the regents. Three terms are required to com- plete the course, two terms for those who have taught ono or more terms successfully, 
‘'wenty-five members of the class will receive their tuition free for one term. Stu- 
dents completing the course of instruction receive teachers’ diplomas of the first or 
second grades according to qualifications. At least twelve teachers’ meetings aro 
held each term, at which all the teachers are required to be present. Kingston Acad- 
emy has a normal class, taught during the fall and winter terms. Zansingburg had 
teachers’ meetings aversging two a month; also a local teachers’ association, which 
met monthly for ceass work and discussion. ‘Two meetings of the Rensselaer County 
Teachers’ Association were held, and the schools were closed during institute week. 
“Newburg held general monthly teachers’ meetings, and also monthly grade meot- 
ings. Oswego Fas general teachers’ meetings during the first week of each term. 
Lome Free Academy has a teachers’ class, the State paying for the instruction of all 
the members. Teachers’ meetings are held monthly. Saratoga Springs has a train- 
ing class with daily practice in actual teaching throughout the year. Troy has 
monthly teachers’ meetings for primary, intermediate, and grammar gra eparately, 
and also general meetings, with attendance obligatory on the part of the teach- 
ers, and the forfeiture of one-half day’s pay for absence from any meeting. The 
teachers of each school are required on one day in each term to visit other publio 
schools of the city, and to send a written report of their observations to the superin- 
tendent within one weck thereafter. Ulica dcademy has a 2 years’ normal course, 
with certificate.of the studies pursued, Frequent teachers’ meetings have been held 
during the past year, and all teachers are required to attend the meetings of the Utica 
Teachers’ Association, as well as meetings called by the superintendent. Watertown 
held 63 grade meetings for teachers during the year. Yonkers has monthly as woll 
as occasional teachers’ meetings. 
The institute work in the State is one of vast importance. Although difficultiesin , the way of organization exist, no other plan has been suggested for keeping the great body of teachers up to the front in methods of instruction. For more effective work 
the Stato. superintendent proposes to change from county to district institutes, and hold but one a year; insist that every school in the district shall be closed while an 
institute is in progress, teachers required to attend and prompily paid during such 
attendance; adapt the work as far as possible to the needs of the particular district,

and distribute a programme of the same to teachers 2 weeks before the institute; sup- 
ply the best and most practical instruction possible, and bring the normal school facul- 
ties into active codperation in institute work, thereby securing their invaluable aid 
and leading them to a fuller appreciation of the needs of the system, 
The forty-second anniversary of the State’ Teachers’ Association was held at Eliza- 
bethtown, July 6-8, 1887. The second annual session of the State Association of 
Academic Principals convened at Syracuse, December 28, 1886. The State Association 
of School Commissioners and Superintendents met in the same city, January 19-21, 
1887, 
New York has a State teachers’ reading circle which was determined on at the 
meeting of school commissioners and city superintendents in 1885-86. This circle is 
reported to have formed subordinate circles in most of the counties of the State, 
teachers in Jarge numbers pursuing the prescribed course of reading, which extends 
through three years, and relates to the history, scionce, and art of teaching and of 
school government, 
NORTH CAROLINA, 
The University of North Carolina has a limited normal course of three months, to 
which teachers are admitted without tuition by recent act of the Legislature. Con- 
nected with the city schools of Charlotte is a training school, from which most of the 
teachers are chosen. Raleigh has several private schools with normal departments, 
and teachers’ meetings are held at stated intervals during the school year. The aid 
from the Peabody fund has done much to create a eee public sentiment in favor 
of public education The scholarships at the Normal College at Nashville are eagerly 
pees after, North Carolina receiving fourteen, Six students graduated in the class 
of 1887, 
State normal schools for colored pupils are established at Fayetteville, New Berne, 
Plymouth, and Salisbury. The normal course covers three years, during which the 
pupils receive training in the art and methods of imparting instruction in the several 
branches of study taught in the public free schools of the State. The curriculum 
includes the common English branches, book-keeping, Latin, history, literature, sci- 
ence, algebra, geometry, and theory and practice of teaching, Tuition is free to all 
residents of the State, and the text-books required are furnished as far as possible 
from the school library without charge, Salisbury reports a model department with 
33 pupils last session, ‘ 
The professional training of teachers is chiefly through the agency of State normal 
institutes, called ‘‘normal schools,” which have annual sessions of several weeks. 
The State appropriates $4,000 for each race, there being eight schools for white and 
five for colored teachers. The State superintendent urges the necessity for a regular 
normal college for white pupils, to be so conducted as to allow the professors time 
to hold county institutes from two to three months every year.2 A State colored nor- 
mal institute of 10 weeks was held at New Berne in the summer of 1887, with an attend- 
ance of 80 in normal and secondary grades. More than the usual number of county 
institutes are reported, and the impression seems to be gaining ground that the county 
institutes are worth more to the State than are the normals,° 
The North Carolina Teachers’ Assembly met in fourth annual session at Morehead 
City, June 14-29, 1887. This meeting was one of the largest and most intelligent 
assemblages of teachers ever seen in the South, with a membership of nearly 2,000. 
The object of this assembly is ‘to enable teachers to meet for discussion of educa- 
tional questions, to give an opportunity to hear the opinions and methods of distin- 
guished specialists in the various departments of teachers’ work, to aid teachers in 
securing situations, and to afford the means of combined action in obtaining such 
educational legislation as the best interests of the State may demand.”* Meetings 
are held annually, with fees of $2 for males and $1 for females, the fund thus ob- 
tained to be used solely in defraying incidental expenses and in securing talented 
instructors for each assembly. The chief topic discussed at the last meeting was the 
need of a State normal college for both sexes. The committee appointed to present 
this matter before the Legislature was continued, with instructions to keep the subject 
before that body until the school was established. A resolution was adopted to estab- 
lish a school for the critical study of literature in connection with the assembly. 
Through the liberality of some special friends of North Carolina education, a build- 
ing is to be erected at Morehead City for the use of the assembly, and is expected to 
be ready for the session of 1888.6 
Teachers’ councils have been organized in many counties of the State. The colored. 
teachers met at Raleigh, November 11, 1886, to consider the importance of a State 
institution for training colored teachers and for the higher education of the colored 
youth of the State.

There is no State normal school in Ohio. The establishment of a normal depart- 
ment at the University of Ohio at Athens, and the appointment of a professor of 
pedagogies, is said to be the first thing of the kind ever begun by the State Legisla- 
ture in Ohio.! 
There are several cities having training classes, and a number of private institutions 
which offer professional instruction for teachers. : 
The course of study at the Cincinnati Normal School has been extended to 3 terms, 
covering @ peri; . of 14 years, or 15 school months. Tho subjects include the usual 
professional studios, with practice. teaching under ceritic-teachers during the second 
‘and third torms in the practice dopartment of the school. .A course in German is 
ofiered in which the pupils receive the same instruction in the department of theory 
as the English pupils, with the exception of one hour a day, which is devoted to the 
study of theory in German. 
The subjects considered are pedagogics, including didactics, discipline, and methods 
of teaching German in the several grades, attention being given to German grammar 
and composition and methods of teaching these branches; German literature, in- 
cluding history of the German language, some of the most colebrated authors, their 
liyes and writings; German edueators and their methods, ‘fhe pupils in the German. 
course have practice also in the four grades of the practice school. 
Tuition is free to residents of Cincinnati, who must be graduates of the high schools 
or pass satisfactory examinations in all the branches included in assistant teachers’ 
certificates, the theory and practice of teaching excepted. Non-residents are charged 
an annual fee of $40. ° Pupils who complete the course of instruction and training and 
pass satisfactory examinations receive certificates of graduation which entitle them 
s preference, other things being equal, for positions as teachers in the public schoolg 
of tho city. 
Cleveland has a training school for graduates of the high schools of that city or 
some other academic institution of equal grade. Regarding the value of this school 
the city superintendent says: “There can be no question that the training school 
has strongly tended to raise the average level of general culture and of professional 
ability of the teachers.”? The course of study extends over 1 year and comprises 
history of education, mental and moral science, and school management, with reviow 
studies, to which constant attention is paid as to the methods of teaching the various 
subjects. Practical work is provided for all students under the direction of practice 
teachers, Instruction in German is provided for pupils who have graduated in the 
German course in the high schools, which is provided for pupils of German speaking 
arents. Practice is likewise afforded in the German department of the model school. 
Tuition ig free to residents, while others are charged an annual fee of $40. The 
aduates of the training school do not have preference over others in appointments 
fo schools. There is a pedagogical society in this city holding regular monthly meet- 
ings from Octobor to May. : 
: ‘olumbus has a normal school which consists of a scparate department of one year 
with two divisions—a department of theory and a department of practice. A class 
of 13 female pupils is reported a6 the normal school for 1887, of whom 11 received 
diplomas at the end of the course. There are 3 practice schools connected with 
the normal school, and each normal pupil taught 10 weeks. Tuition is free to resident 
‘aduates of the high school and others of equivalent qualifications, who pass satis- 
factory examinations and declare their intention of becoming teachers—to teach, if 
practicable, in Columbus cchools for three consecutive years, provided their services 
are needed. Non-residents of tho city pay a tuition fee of $40. A diploma from tho 
training school exempts the holder from further examination, provided the person 
has zeasonable success in teaching and governing a school, and the term of service 
ig understood to be for a consecutive number of years. Graduates of the normal 
school have no preference in appointment over others of equivalent qualifications, 
Separate teachers’ meetings are held for English and German teachers, 
ae Normal School continues to do excellent work in indoctrinating true theo- 
ties of education and modes of teaching, and in the arts of management suited to the 
grades for which the young ladies are trained, and in which they have 0; porinnily 
to practice. The minimum course of study covers a period of 1 year, nae uition is 
free, The practice rooms consist of a first grade room and a mixed second and third 
grade room, and in immediate connection there is a German room of first, second, 
and third grades in charge of a regular teacher. Dayton teachers hold a gocial 
meeting once a month, and for the literary part are studying Ohio history. ;

may attend the school free of sharge, others paying an annual tuition fee of $40. The 
class is limited to 20 in number, beginning with the highest in rank of scholarship 
and admitted in order after. One month is devoted to the practical work of teaching, 
for which purpose 2 schools are specially designated and located in the building of the 
normal school. Graduates have preference in appointment as teachers, other things 
being equal, and such graduation is considered equivalent to 1 year’s practical experi- 
encé in the estimation of salary. An average of 80 per cent. in the studies of the 
year is required for gedaation, and after'1 year’s successful teaching a diploma is 
given, General teachers’ meetings are held every 4 weeks, and the normal pupils are 
required to attend all regular meetings. 
Laneaster,—-Soon after the opening of the schools in September, 1886, a class com- 
posed of all the teachers in the city schools, together with some who were not teach- 
ers, was organized and took up the study of Sully’s psychology. This class met every 
2 weeks during the fall and winter, and made commendable progress in the study. 
In addition to psychology, the teachers took lessons in vocal music, and some were 
members of a Chautauqua reading circle, while others read educational periodicals. 
Teachers are allowed one-half day during the year for school inspection. 
Canton has teachers’ meetings every 2 weeks, with a penalty of $1 for unexcused 
absence, and 50 cents for each tardiness, 
Newark has fenarat teachers’ meetings on the Saturday preceding the opening of 
schools at the beginning of the school year, and as soon after the close of each school 
month ; also general and sectional meetings, 
Norwalk has weekly teachers’ meetings, and also special meetings at the call of the

the Ohio teachers’ reading course. General grade meetings are held monthly; also 
report meetings, and the Teachers’ Reading Circlehas weekly sessions. 
Sandusky teachers have stated meetings and opportunity for school inspection. 
Springfield has an annual teachers’ inatitute and teachers’ associations. For a few 
years past normal work has been attempted in connection with the regular work of 
the miele, and the city superintendent advises a moro thorough organization and 
liberal proyision for this department, 
Chillicothe, Ironton, Massilion, and Xewia afford their teachers opportunity for visits

Ohio has many teachers’ associations, During April, 1887, 7 meetings of teachers 
were held in different parts of the State for discussion of educational topics, and 3 
more were announced for the first half of May. 
The forty-first annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held July 
28-30, 1887, at Akron, where the association was organized in 1847. A special resolu- 
tion was adopted that there should be appropriate exercises in all the schools of 
Ohio in connection with the centennial celebration of the first settlement of the State, 
and it was urged that this subject be presented in all the institutes to be held during 
the year. The North-western Ohio Teachers’ Association met at Lima, December 
28-29, 1886; the South-western Association at Cincinnati, January 29, 1887; the 
North-western Association at Ashtabula, May 14, 1887; the South-castern Association

State teachers’ institutes are held in the several judicial districts of the State, and 
are usually largely attended by teachers and people. County institutes were held in 
14 counties during the past 2 years, and the increased attendance indicates the 
growing popularity of these assemblies, Among the good results of institute work 
noticeable in the State, which applies also to other States, the superintendent of 
public education mentions that the best teachers are always present at the institute 
and are active in its support and emphatic in its approval. The best educators from 
college, university, academy and high school are aiso ip attendance and active in the 
work; school directors, impressed with the necessity of employing the best teachers, 
attend the institutes for the very purpose of securing the best qualified and enter- 
prising teachers; and the energetic efforts of county superintendents to improve 
their schools is also the means of arousing in the minds of school officers and people 
a renewed and lasting interest in the public. schools.! 
The State Teachers’ Association held a mecting at Yaquina City, July 6-9, 1886, 
which was more largely attended than ever before, having 420 teachers enrolled, 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
Tho rosults of normal training in this State are comprehensively summarized by 
the State superintendent. He says that the commendable service now being ren- 
dered in the public schools of that Commonwealth by teachers who have had the ad- 
vantages of normal school training is the best evidence that can be offered in proof 
of the fact that these schools are cojperating in the work of education within their 
proper and legitimate sphere. The marked increaso in the number of earnest and 
faithful students in attendance during the past year shows that the State normal 
schools as a whole are regarded by thoughtful people with growing favor, and are 
proving themselves worthy of a most generous support.? ce 
There are 11 State normal schools, bosides the Girls’ Normal School of Philadelphia, 
and various training schools and high schools with normal courses throughout the 
State. The course of study at the State normal schools covers a period of 2 and 3 
years, while at the Philadelphia school the fourth, or post-graduate year, is devoted 
exclusively to practice work in the schools. Tuition is charged at all the State in- 
stitutions, but the law appropriates to every student over 17 years of age who shall 
sign a declaration of intention to teach in the common schools of the State the sum 
of 50 cents per week, and every student who upon graduation shall sign an agree- 
ment to teach in the common schools of the State 2 full years receives the sum of $50. 
The course of instruction, as recently revised and approved by tho State authorities, 
consists of an elementary course of 2 years and a ecientific course of 1 year addi- 
tional, which arrangement appears to meet with general approval. Academic courses 
are also established for students desiring to enter college. Admission to the senior 
class of the professional course is determined by examination in the junior studies, 
with the exception of pedagogy, the examination being held by the State board of 
examiners, and being fival for those studies. Students passing this examination 
successfully are given certificates which entitle the holders to admission into the 
senior class in any State normal school of Pennsylvania at the beginning of any 
senior year. Diplomas are awarded on the completion of both the elementary and 
scientitic courses, Normal school diplomas are teachers’ certificates of highest grade, 
conferring the right for life to teach, without farther examination, in the common 
schools of the State. 
A new State normal school for the thirteenth district, at Clarion, was opened April 
12, 1887, with nearly 150 students and a faculty of 10 instructors. ‘The Carrier 
Seminary, in operation at that place, formed the basis for the school. Two large 
3-story dormitories were erected, with all modern appliances for comfort and con- 
venience, and provision has been made for furnishing the library. The chief fact 
to be noted in connection with the Bloomsburg school is the opening in January of 
the building for tho use of the model schoo) and of the teachers’ classes. At the Cal- 
ifornia State Normal School a large extension to the ladies’ dormitory was completed 
and partly occupied before the close of the year. The grounds also have been im- 
roved, The school at Edinborough has a model school divided into ten grades, 
rom primary to grammar grades. There is an armory for military drill in storm 
weather, while on fair days the young men drill onthe campus, The library of 6,500 vol- 
umes continues a prominent feature of the school. Itis open every day in the year, and 
@ librarian devotes her entire time to its care. Improvements have been made in the 
heating arrangements at this school. At Indiana important improvements have been 
made within the year in regard to heating and ventilation. Other improvements of

value are now in progress and will be completed in time for next year. Much empha- 
sis is placed upon the training department at this institution, and many kindergarten 
‘features have been recently introduced in connection therewith. At the opening of 
the third term at Kutztown, on the first Monday in April, the school took possession 
of the new building containing a chapel, dining hall, and additional dormitories and 
recitation rooms. Notwithstanding these.increased accommodations, upwards of 40 
young men were compelled to room and board outside of the buildings. Among the 
ae recently purchased is a solar camera with a large collection of well selected 
slides. This is used as an aid in teaching geography, and it is intended to be utilized 
be for the purpose of showing microscopic objects to an entire class during the reci- 
ations in botany and physiology. The Central State Normal School at Lock Haven 
received an extra appropriation from the Legislature of $15,000, with which the south 
wing of the building has been finished, That portion of the building which has been 
in use from the beginning has been also thoroughly renovated. Additions have been 
made to the teaching force at the Mansfield school. ‘Ten post-graduates were in at- 
tendance last year, and all departments of the school are full. More apparatus and 
furniture have been added to the model school, and the plan of work in this depart- 
ment has been very much improved. Every teacher is required to make careful prep- 
aration for every recitation, including both matterand method. . A plan of the week’s 
work is submitted to the principal, and he observes whether it be correct and sees 
that it is put into execution. At Millersville improvements have been completed to 
the approximate amount of $16,000. Much interest and enthusiasm is manifested 
among the students, extra work being done in addition to the required studies. An 
unusually large number of resident graduates attended the school during the summer 
session and pursued studies of the scientific course and reviewed others. A read- 
ing room has recently been opened at this school. At Shippensburg the libraries 
have been increased. The building has been thoroughly repaired during the summer 
and is now in first class condition as to convenience and comfort. The attendanco 
is large and the standard of scholarship has been raised, and the students generally 
have manifested a spirit of earnest attentioa to work. At West Chester additions 
and improvements have been made to new buildings. A new chapel has been erected, 
with fixed seats for 1,000 persons; the total cost of all improvements made during 
the year will amount to more than $40,000. The new course of study has added at least 
one-half a year to the length of the course and fully a yeartoits value. High school 
graduates generally plan to be there 2 years and are well satisfied if they can finish 
the course in that time. In addition to the careful study of psychology, methods of 
instruction, school management, and history of education, the graduating classes must 
now read carefully, and under close supervision, half a dozen of the leading works 
onpedagogy. These they all buy, and thus make a creditable beginning towards 
professional libraries of their own. This has proved to be a most valuable feature of 
the course. Model schools are in operation at all the State normal schools, 
The Philadelphia Normal School for Girls has a 3 years’ course of professional study 
and 1 yearof practice additional. Only residents of the city and those having been 
pupils of the twelfth grade in the public schools are admitted. The school is crowded 
to its utmost capacity, and the principal urges the importance of increasing the age 
of admission from 14 years. A kindergarten department has been recently esta)- 
lished. A notable feature of the curriculum at this school is the teaching of sewing, 
entting, and fitting. An examination in this branch of work is held at the close of ~ 
the 4 years’ course of study, and a trial certificate of qualification as teacher of sew- 
ing for 1 year is awarded to each member of the fourth year class who obtains an 
average of 80 per cent. or upwards. At the expiration of a year’s teaching on the 
part of the holder of this:trial certificate it becomes void unless evidence of satisfac- 
tory teaching is furnished, when the certificate is made permanent. The fourth year 
students enter the school of practice as teachers immediately after graduation in the 
normal school, and give instruction at intervals during half the year. Principals’, 
assistants’, and trial certificates are awarded to those completing the fourth year, in 
the order of their scholarship. ¥ 
Teachers’ institutes now stand upon their own merit. Proper remuneration is given 
to teachers for attendance, and all schools are closed during the time of the institute. 
They are of inestimable value to the school work, and carry with them wide-spread. 
educational power, Not only are teachers encouraged and benefited by them, but 
whole communities come under their influence, and the educational authorities can 
find no surer way to reach the mass of the people than through their instrumentality.) 
Many of the counties have local institutes, educational meetings, teachers’ associa- 
tions, and reading circles. Allentown held semimonthly meetings, the primary grades 
studying Brooks’ Normal Methods of Teaching. Altoona has a teachers’ reading circle. 
Beaver Falts has stated teachers’ meetings. Bethlehem has semimonthly meetings, 
and Tate’s Philosophy of Education was the subject for special study during the year. 
There is a teachers’ library in this city. Bristol has primary teachers’ meetings twice

subjects regarding which assistance had been asked by some teachers, Meadville 
teachers met as an institute every Monday evening during the year, and made a special 
study of Sully’s Psychology. Nanticoke high school has a normal course for post- 
raduates, embracing methods of teaching, mental science, and the history of educa- 
ae Norristown reports the regular district institute as having been continued at 
stated times, and in addition to tho regular school work, a number of teachers organ- 
ized a class for the study of psychology, This study formed part of the exercises of 
the institute. Philqdelphia’s city superintendent is authorized to dismiss grammar and 
consolidated schools two hali-days during each term, and all schools of lower grade 
four half-days each term, for the purpose of holding teachers’ meetings; he is also au- 
thorized to hold such meetings at other times when the schools are not in session,

RHODE ISLAND, 
The Stato Normal School at Providence is gaining year by year a firmer position 
among the primo factors of education in the State. The past year has been one of 
most gratifying prosperity, and the school has been full to its utmost capacity. The 
course of study is academic rathor than professional, which is made necessary by the 
needs of the pupils who enter, These come from localities where there is no high 
school or other good secondary school, and are hence defective in scholarship. It is 
recommended to furnish academic instruction of a first-class high school course and 
then form the normal ciass of high school graduates and those of equal scholarship. 
Graduates of the Providence, Newport, and other accredited high schools will be 
admitted to the last year, and if their work is satisfactory they will be graduated 
at the end of the year, This course includes the common school branches, with 
higher and professional studies. The general course occupies three years, with no 
foreign language in either course, Special attention is paid to the preparation and 
delivery of original papers on pedagogical themes. Saturday classes are held, to 
which teachers occupied during the week are admitted. Pupils have practice in 
teaching and opportunities for observation in the kindergarten and public schools 
of the city. Tuition’is free to all who complete the course of study with the inten- 
tion of teaching in the public schools of the State. Students are aided by a mileage 
appropriation of $1,500, which is distributed among those pupils residing in the State ee 1State Report.

Cumberland allows two half-days each term for school inspection. East Providence 
held teachers’ meetings, and Zzeier and Hopkinton had local institutes, Newportschool 
hoard has declared by vote that in the selection of new teachers they will hereafter 
give the preference, other things being equal, to normal graduates. This city had 
various meetings during the past year—a most practieal institute, a course of twelve 
valuable lessons upon reading, the week’s session of the American Institute of In~ — 
struction in the summer, a course of suggestive lessons upon the principjes of teach- 
ing by the president of the State Normal School, and recently a fortnightly liter- 
ary club has been formed numbering 100 members, which includes nearly all the 
teachers, and exacts from them at least one-half hour of home study daily. Paw- 
tucket has a normal teachers’ Glass to whieh only graduates of high or normal schools 
are admitted.' The plan followed last year was to secure a good primary teacher of 
experience and place under her charge three young ladies at a small salary each, who 
shon!d perform most of the work of teaching the two primary rooms of that building, 
making the training teacher responsible for the character of the work done. A local 
teachers’ institute was held in October. Tiverton has monthly meetings of teachers. 
The Rhode Island Institute of Instruction is the oldest and one of the largest of 
the State teachers’ associations, It partakes more of the character of an institute 
than of a convention. Tho forty-second annual meeting was held at Providence, Oe- 
tober 28-30, 1886, ~ 
A State teachers’ reading circle, in whieh the teachers have shown much interest, 
has been formed as a recent outgrowth of the Institute of Instruction, The one great 
object of this organization is to secure the cirgulation among the teachers of im- 
portant works on the subject of teaching and of educational training. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
The white teachers of South Carolina are asking for a State normal school for 
white teachers, and rapid strides are being made in accomplishing the desired end, 
The founding of the Winthrop Training School for Teachers at Columbia marks a 
new era in the educational history of the State. The school is named in honor of Hon. 
Rebert C. Winthrop, through whose influence chiefly the Peabody appropriation of 
$1,500 was secured which made the establishment of the school possible. The first ses- 
sion opened November 15, 1886, and 14 young ladies graduated at its close, The school 
occupied the chapel of the Presbyterian Theological Seminary free of charge, but dur- 
ing the year 1887-88 it will be established in a new school bnilding whieh can be fitted 
up according to the wants of the school. The annual session is coincident with that 
of the city schools, the normal course beistg completed in one year. The studies include 
the ysual common school branches, natural and mental science, science and history of 
education, with methods and practice of teaching, A model school is connected with 
the institution, One student from each county, selected by the county beard of ex- 
aminers, is admitted free of tuition; other pupils are charged §2 monthly. Diplomas 
are aivarded upon completion of the course, equivalent to first-grade State certificates, 
without farther examination. 
The Saturday Normal School at Charleston has a course of 4 years’ study, with free 
tuition, South Carolina College at Columbia offers a 2 years’ course preparatory for 
the profession. or ranbing: Of the 10 Peabody scholarship students allowed this State 
at the Nashville Normal College, 3 students were graduated at tho close of the last session, 
Claflin University at Orangeburg, the colored department of the State University, 
has a normal course of 3 years. For those who can not take the full course there will 
be organized at the beginning of each spring term a special teachers’ class in theory 
and practice of teaching. The advantages of this course, together with the regular 
normai course, will be open to teachers free of charge.! Five other institutions in 
the State report normal instruction for colored. teachers. About 500 studénts are in 
attendance at all these schools.’ : 
The State made no Spnrappiation for normal institutes during the past year. 
Through the liberality of the Peabody Fund an inter-county institute of 2 weeks was 
held at Williamston. About 150 teachers from all parts of the State were present. 
A similar institute was heldat Sumter, and others elsewhere, reaching no less than 
500 teachers.

Columbia reports its teachers laboring to perfect themselves more and more by study 
and investigation for the work of their profession, The psychological laws and the 
‘pedagogical principles which underlie all true teaching have been a special subject 
of study with them during the year, to the improvement of the schools in instruc- 
tion and discipline. White’s Elements of Pedagogy and Page’s Theory and Practice 
of*Teaching have been read and discussed at teachers’ meetings in addition to the 
educational works and journals read privately. Monthly teachers’ meetings are held 
for each race. 
State teachers’ associations separate for the races are in operation, and hold annual 
meetings during the sessions of their respective institutes, 
Reading circles are reported in some of the counties, 
TENNESSEE, 
The State Normal College at Nashville, which constitutes the literary department 
of the University of Nashville, has been in operation as a normal school since 1875. 
It is designed for the professional education and training of teachers, and “ practice 
in all grades of instruction.” Support is received from the funds of the university, 
the Peabody education fund, and the State, The institution receives as students 
young gentlemen and ladies from any of the States, and combines with a State nor- 
mal school for Tennessee a normal college of high grade for the benefit of all the 
Southern States.1 The trustees of the Peabody Fund distribute 114 scholarships an- 
nually among ten Southern States. These scholarships, of $200 each, are awarded 
by the State superintendents to persons not under 17 years of age, after competitive 
examination in the studies required for admission to the second year class, and the 
candidates must give evidence of such knowledge of these branches as will justify 
omitting their further study. Students are again examined at the college with refer- 
ence to their classification.! An accepted candidate must give a pledge to remain at 
the college 2 years, and promise to teach at least 4 years in the public schools of his 
or her own State unless formally excused by the superintendent of public instrac- 
tion. These scholarships will, in no case, be continued to students whose rank or 
standing is low, or who are otherwise lacking in promise of usefulness in the profes- 
sion, All students failing to complete their course of study according to the condi- 
tions prescribed, or to teach after graduation, are required to refund to the president 
of the college the amount of money received from the Peabody scholarship. The 
State of Tennessee receives 14 of these scholarships, and of the students holding these 
10 graduated in the class of 1887. 3 
Tuition is free at present, as no person is admitted to the privileges of the college 
who does not intend to teach. The course of instruction covers 3 and 4 years, 
and embraces a rapid review of the more elementary studies, with reference to the 
best ways of teaching them; a review of the more common of the higher branches 
of knowledge with the same object, and a careful study of such others as time and 
circumstances will permit, together with the general management of classes and 
schools, organization, government, discipline, etc. The fourth year, or baccalau- 
reate class, is intended solely for those having completed the regular senior class 
studies at the college, and includes advanced studies in mathematics, English liter- 
ature, Latin, psychology, drawing, designing, ete., with German. Students com- 
pleting satisfactorily the first 2 years of the course receive certificates, and those 
completing the entire course receive the diploma of the college with the degree 
“Licentiate of Instruction.” This diploma is a State certificate, accepted without 
further examination by all the States holding scholarships at the college. Students 
who finish the fourth year may receive in addition the usual baccalaureate degree of 
the university. As a provision for physical training, a commodious gymnasium has 
been erected and supplied with Dr. Sargent’s apparatus, and placed under the charge 
of competent and skilled directors, a gentleman and alady. Attendance at the gym- 
nasium is required of all students, unless excused on the certificate of a physician. 
Chattanooga.—The city superintendent of schools is required to form a normal 
class, with special reference to the practical work of teaching and school government, 
which all teachers in the public schools must attend regularly. Other persons desir- 
ing to prepare themselves for teaching in the city schools may also be received as 
members of this class. | 
Clarksville has normal meetings semimonthly for its teachers, 
Jackson has regular teachers’ meetings with continued courses of study. 
Nashville has a successful normal class with regular meetings. Monthly teachers’ 
moetings are held, summer normals conducted, and a teachers’ association and a 
reading circle are also in active operation, 
Teachers’ institutes for white and colored separate are held by the State superintend- 
ent in all parts of the State, and many counties have stated meetings of this character.

: _ TRAINING OF TEACHERS. i 445 
The twenty-third session of the State Teachers’ Association was held at Jackson, 
August 23-26, 1887. The importance of summer institutes was brought out at this 
meeting, and it was recommended that teachers failing to attend such institutes be 
deprived of their certificates. ‘ 
‘ennessee has a State teachers’ reading circle, which is well organized and doing 
a good work. It has the confidence and support of the State board of education; 
so much so that it is ordered that ‘‘membership in the circle and completion of its 
course of reading shal] be recognized in the fature on the teachors’ certificates issued 
by county superintendents.”    
TEXAS. 
Texas has two State normal schools, one for each race, but more normal schools are 
needed in the State. The superintendent of public instraction recommends the im- 
mediate establishment of two more such schools for white teachers, one in west and 
one in north Texas, and one for colored teachers in east Texas. 
The Sam Houston Normal Institute for white pupils is located at Huntsville. Of 
the influence of this school the State superintendent says: ‘* Sam Houston Normal 
Institute continues to grow in merit. It has done a wonderful work for Texas, and, 
if liberally supported, will increase in usefulness each succeeding year. Teachers 
who have attended this institution may be found in every county and in almost 
every city. In every instance they are worthy and competent.”! The eighth annual 
session, 1#86-87, has been a prosperous one; more than 200 students, representing 
ninety-eight counties of the State, were enrolled. 
One State student from each senatorial and each representative district and nine 
from the State at large receive tuition, books, and board free for one year. Such as 
show decided ability for teaching, and pledge themselves to make teaching their pro- 
fession may, upon the recommendation of the principal, be reappointed for a second 
year. State students are required to stand a competitive examination. Pay stu- 
dents receive tuition and books free, but must pay their own board. All students 
pass the same examination for admission, take the same obligations, and receive the 
same certificates and diplomas.” 
The course of study is mainly professional, extending over 3 years, each year’s 
work, however, being made complete in itself as far as possible. Satisfactory com- 
pletion of the first year’s work entitles the student to a second-grade certificate, the 
‘second year’s work to a first-grade certiticate, and the third to a diploma. 
Through the liberality of the Legislature, during the summer of 1887 the buildings 
were remodelled and greatly improved, and the apparatus and library increased by 
one-half, making the normal school the best equipped institution in the State with 
the exception of the university. : 
From the beginning the institution has received generous aid from the Peabody 
Fund, and was, indeed, founded through the agency of Dr. Barnas Sears. ThisFund ~ 
has annually contributed from $3,000 to $7,000 to enable the best teachers to be secured 
and a normal school of a high order to be maintained. In addition, medals have 
been annually contributed to be awarded to meritorious students, and for all these 
substantial encouragements the president and school authorities make grateful men- 
tion. Nine scholarships are granted the State at the Nashville Normal College, and, 
of the holders of these, 5 graduated in 1887. 
The Prairie View State Normal School for colored students is located at Hempstead. 
The State superintendent reports that it has a most excellent faculty and is doing 
splendid work. It has accomplished much in elevating the professional character 
of the colored teachers of the State.? The course of study extends through 2 years. 
There were 23 graduates and more than 100 students in attendance last session.. 
Galveston has normal classes for white and colored teachers. All public school 
teachers are required to attend, and others may be admitted upon conditions pre- 
seribed by the superintendent. Members of these classes, after passing the regular 
examination, are preferred in appointments, provided they have certificates, 
Houston High School has a normal course for pupils of the senior year, giving in- 
struction in the theory and practice of teaching. In addition, normal classes are held 
for the teachers of the city, attendance being compulsory. Pupils of the normal 
course in the high school are obliged to attend these meetings when required by the 
superintendent. Waco has normal classes for each race. Brenham, El Paso, Fort 
Worth, Houston, Palestine, and Sherman report teachers’ meetings and institutes at 
stated times. Several years ago the teachers of Houston organized a library associa- 
tion which has contributed largely to the efficiency and progress of the schools. 
Heretofore a summer normal institute has been conducted each year for the white 
teachers in each senatorial district, and for colored teachers in each Congressional 
district except the eleventh, which has not a sufficient number of colored teachers to

tiation for the usual summer normal schools, the regents of the State University at 
ustin tendered the use of the building, apparatus, and library duriiig the month of 
August, 1887, to be used for that purpose. Excellent work in various lines was ac- 
Goinplished and there was a latge attendance of teachers, county judges, and city and 
county superintendents. 
The white State Teachers’ Association met at Dallas, June 28-30, 1887, with an at- 
tendance of over 500 teachers. Tho colored State Teachers’ Association met at the. 
same place, June 21-23, 1887. ‘ 
Several years ago the teachers of Houston organized ‘a library association which 
has contributed largely to the efficiency and progress of the schools. 
Texas has a State teachers’ reading citcle. 
UTAnL 
The University of Deseret at Salt Lake City has a normal department which has 
been if siecessful operation since its creation in 1875. This course was established 
6h its present basis in pursnance of an act of the Legislature of Utah providing for 
the instruction of 40 normal students annually in the university free of charge for 
‘tition, books,and apparatus. The law provides that such students shall be selected 
by the Territorial commissioner of district schools from persons nominated by the 
poatds of examination of tho several counties. These notninatiohs ate usually 
the result of a competitive examination which is free to all persons in the county. 
The only condition attached to this provision is that for each year’s free tuition so 
received the students shall serve one year as district school teacher if requited by 
theit respective county superintendents. 2 
_ The cotirse of study is designed principally for those intending to become teachers 
in the district svhools: The instruction given is of a practical character, embracing 
the every-day work of the teacher at school as well as that of patents in educating 
their children at home. The completion of the course reqtiires 2 yeats and the 
studies and their arrangement are approved by the Teititorial commissioner of dis- 
trict schools as required bylaw. Normal students must take the studies in theit pre- 
setibed ofder, aid each student on completing the course receives a ¢ertificate of 
graduation. Sixteen graduates in the normal depattment ate reported for 1887.* 
Teachers’ institutes ate maintained in some of the counties but no tecent reports of 
this work have been received. ‘ 
VERMONT. 
Vermont has State normal schools at Castleton, Johnson, and Randolph. No recent 
data have been received from Castleton. At Johnson and Randolph there are 2 
courses, one of 2 years and the other of 14 years additional, the studies consisting of the 
usual clementary and professional branches, without any foreign language. Special 
attention is given to singing in general exercises and by classes, and during 1 term 
to methods of teaching singing. In view of the fact that professionally trained 
teachers with ability to teach somo language other than English are in constant de- 
mand in high schools and academies, it is suggested that the normal schools, in order 
to provide for this demand, be allowed to add one foreign language to the studies of 
the second course.> ’ 
The higher standard in scholarship of teachers required by the progress made in 
the educational field has necessitated the raising of the standard for admission to the 
normal schools. ‘The result has been most satisfactory, and shows a gain in scholar- 
ship, which is a better preparation for doing strictly normal work. Every town in the 
State is entitled to 1 scholarship, and may have others not exceeding 10, “ provided the 
number of scholarships in the 3 normal schools does not excced the number of towns 
in the State.” Each scholarship is valued at $12 per term, Graduates who have re- 
ceived the bénefié of scholarships must teach 2 years in the State. The diploma for 
completion of the first course of study is equivalent to a State certificate for 5 years, 
and that of the second course for 10 years.+ 
Annual teachers’ institutes of 3 days are held by the State superintendent in any 
county where application is made by 15 to 25 teachers of that county. _ In addition to 
the county institutes educational meetings of 1 day and evening, or longer, ate fre- 
quently held. ¢ 
Rutland has monthly teachers’ mectings, and 1 day each term is allowed for inspec- 
tion of other schools. 
_ The annual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held at West Randolph, 
January 27-29, 1887. A State teachers’ reading circle has been organized in eon- 
nection with the “Chautauqua Teachers’ Reading Union.” Local circles have 
already been established under this in several towns of the State.

    TRAINING OF TEACHERS. 447 
VIRGINIA. 
This State offers normal training for white teachers at Farmville and the University 
of Virginia, and for colored teachers at Hampton and Petersburg. The State Female 
Normal! School at Farmville is divided into three departments, the normal, or pro- 
fessional department proper; the preparatory school, which is simply a well-taught 
primary and grammar school; and a model school, which is composed of childten 
uider 10 years, who ate instructed and trained by an expert model-school teacher. 
This model school is for the special benefit of the senior class of the normal depart- 
ment, who attend the school in sections, and there observe and teach, and receive 
practical instruction and criticism from the principal of the school. 4 
The normal department proper covers two years, and the six elementary branches 
required by law to be taught in every public school, constittte the main lines of study. 
Besides this standard line of professional work, other studies are purstied with the 
design of assisting in the teaching of these primary studies. Each line of elementary 
study is pursued to some extent into its higher continuations, and incidental studies 
are introduced. The philosophy of the mind, school management, and the theory 
and practice of teaching each branch, constitute the regular course of separate pro- 
fessional study. One hundred and twenty-eight students are received from the State, 
who must be recommended by a county or city superintendent, after an approved 
examination on the six elementary studies. These pay no tuition or other school fees, 
but must sign a pledge to teach in the public schools of the State at least two years 
after leaving the normal school, Other students from Virginia may be received on 
ayment of $25 annual tuition, if their admission does: not interfere with the privi- 
leges of State students. Public school teachers are also allowed to attend by virtue 
of their licenses, without tuition fees, A legislative appropriation of $15,000 served 
to erect and equip during the past yeat a commodious building, which furnishes 
much needed facilities in the way of lecture rooms, dorinitories, ete, 
White male teachers and superintendents of the free schools of Virginia are ad- 
mitted to the schools of the academic department of the University of Virginia with- 
out payment of fees. The faculty of that institution offers special courses of instruc- 
tion for such students in Latin, Greek, English, French, German, pure and applied 
mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry, botany, geography, and pedagogies, 
and they are also privileged to attend any of the regular classes in the academic de- 
partment of the University free of charge. At the conclusion of the courses certifi- — 
cates of attendance will be given by the several professors to those students whose 
work is approved. University dormitories will be assigned free of rent, in the order 
of application, as far as the vacant rooms will setve. During the past session about 
30 public school teachers of the State availed themselves of this offer and proved dili- 
gent, earnest, and successful in their studies! 
Virginia receives 14 Peabody scholarships at the Nashville Normal College, and of 
the students filling these, 8 graduated in the class of 1887. : 
The almost unparalleled career of usefulness and success of the Normal and Agri- 
cultural Institute af Hampton, which aims to supply teachers for the colored schools 
of the middle Southern States and for the Indians, is known and recognized through- 
out the country: This institution repotts 65 teachers and a total enrolment of 709 
negro and Indian students for the year ending June, 1887.2 Of these over 300 were 
normal students, In the organization of the school there seems to have been clearly in 
view the actual condition, the defiviencies, and wants of the negro race. Intellectual 
developiment was therefore by no means the only ond, if even the leading end, aimed 
at, The substantial elements of personal character were recognized as the basis of 
improvement. Honesty, truthfulness, sobriety, industry, economy, and intelligence 
were to be developed and strengthened as absolutely essential to useful and worthy 
citizenship. Hence the courses of study—literary, industrial, notmal—and the gov- 
ernment and discipline have been judiciously directed to these ends. The theory and 
the practice have beon consistent, and the wisdom of both is vindicated by the results, 
The school is doing a great work. Its gtaduates are in active demand as teachers for 
the public schools, and are considered by school superintendents as among tho 
best teachers to be had.? Six hundred of its graduates and 200 of its under-grad- 
uates are said to be teaching about 45,000 colored youth in public schools, Indus- 
trial as well as intellectual training is given by most of the teachers reared under 
these infiuences.? This institution is specially a training school for negro teachers 
and is not able to supply the demands which are made upon it. The teacher of a ~ 
neero school must be able to earn his living by manual labor during the greater part 
of the year. This the Hampton graduates can do, becauss in the school they have 
had an industrial education, The cost of giving a year’s education at Hampton 
is but $70; the scholars practically earn their own living in the workshops and on

the farm. The farm contains 700 acres, and there are 32 buildings upon the premises, 
including 13 workshops. Improyements have been made during the past year in the 
heating arrangements and the gas works. A powerful new steam fite-engine, with a 
supply of hose, was purchased last summer, and with a drilled fire-brigade is kept 
ready for emergencies. A partial endowment fund of $500,000—part of which has 
been raised—is needed for the further enlargement and support of the school. 
The course of study oceupies three years, and tuition is free. A training school 
furnishes the senior class with opportunity for daily observation and practice. The 
common branches are the main ones throughout the course, and at the close of the 
term a three weeks’ institute is held as a special preparation for teaching. The in- 
. dustrial arts are taught both sexes, the males having instruction in practical farming 
and in mechanic arts, commenced and continued throughout the entire course, from 
a day and a half to two days each week. Tho girls spend an equal period of time in 
sewing and household industries. Labor is required of all for the sake of discipline 
and instruction. The school endeavors to give each student over 18 years of age $5 
worth of work monthly, and $4 in work to each one under 18. This amount, how- 
ever, is not guaranteed, as the rate of wages varies according to the age of the stu- 
dent and the real vaiue of the work done. In accordance with the law, 100 students 
are received from the public schools of Virginia free of tuition and room rent. 
The Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute at Petersburg was established by act 
of the General Assembly, for the higher education of the colored youth of the State, 
and with special reference to the training of teachers. Twenty thousand dollars an- 
nually are appropriated for its support. In addition, the Legislature of 1885-86 ap- 
propriated $32,000 for the completion of the building, and the entire edifice is expected 
to be ready for occupancy during 1887. Three departments, academic, normal, and 
preparatory, are in successful operation. The normal course covers 4 years—2 years 
being preparatory, and 2 years in the regular course. The studies are confined to the 
English branches exclusively, and are such as are adapted for the profession of teach- 
ing. Practice is afforded in the model school attached. The institution is open to 
pupils of both sexes, and 50 students are furnished with free tuition by the State, 
provided they promise to teach 2 years in Virginia after graduating. The school does 
not furnish manual labor to the students, but a farm attached offers opportunity to 
industrious students to earn sufficient to pay a great part of their expenses. 
A summer session of 5 weeks is established by law, intended as a teachers’ normal 
institute, where both the matter to teach and the method of teaching may be obtained. 
The course of study is not fixed, but varies with the needs and demands of the teachers 
attending. For the most part the course includes the branches taught in the public 
schools. Thirty-eight males and 93 females were in attendance during the summer 
normal of 1887. 
During the past summer there were held in the State eight Peabody, two State, and 
a number of county institutes. The Peabody institutes were so distributed as to make 
them accessible to a-large number of teachers at a comparatively small travelling 
expense. Some of them were in sections of the State where they had never been held 
before, and were specially intended to reach a class of teachers who had never enjoyed 
the benefits of such instruction, The attendance upon the institutes, considering the 
extreme heat of the season, was exceptionally large, and the work done highly satis- 
factory.! Competitive examinations were held at the various institutes for white 
teachers to fill vacancies in eight of the Peabody scholarships at Nashville. 
The State superintendent saysthat what is needed in Virginia in regard to institutes 
is: a State appropriation for their support; a radical change in the plan of institute 
work, for instead of a few State institutes there ought to be one at least held annually 
in each senatorial district, and if practicable, one in each county; a 4 years’ graded 
course of instruction, with proper examinations required at the end of each year. 
Upon these examinations satisfactory certificates should be awarded for the first 3 
years, and a diploma for the fourth year, which should relieve from further exam- 
ination for a period of years, provided the teacher held a first-grade certificate, and 
had had successful experience in teaching for 3 or 4 years. A course of professional 
reading should be prescribed for each year, and an examination required therein in 
connection with the institute work of that year. The superintendent further suggests 
that teachers be classified at first mainly by grade of certificates and successful ex- 
perience in teaching; and that an efiicient corps of institute instructors be provided 
whose services could be relied on from year to year.? 
The Virginia Teachers’ Reading Association, organized little more than 2 years ago, 
is reported as doing good service. Nearly 500 teachers are taking the course in whole 
or part, and there has been a considerable increase in the membership during the 
past year. The reading extends over 2 years, and includes methods and management 
of schools, anatomy, physiology and hygiene, principles and practice of teaching,

WASHINGTON TERRITORY. 
The professional preparation of teachers in this Territory is provided for by teachers 
institutes, which are éstablished by law, and attendance made compulsory, with a 
penalty for absence. An annual Territorial institute is held by the Territorial super- 
intendent of public instruction; and county superintendents are required to hold 
yearly institutes in counties whenever the number of school children is 500 or more. 
‘The county commissioners are empowered to make appropriations for this purpose.. 
The institutes of the past year are reported to have excited more than usual interest 
among the teachers. ys 
Teachers’ certificates, valid for 5 years, and diplomas for life, are issued upon ex- 
amination by the Territorial board of education, ‘Tho board of county examiners 
issues county certificates of 3 grades. 
Reading circles are reported at several points in the Territory. 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
The result of normal school work in this State is a convincing proof of the necessity 
and importance of such institutions. The president of the board of regents affirms 
that ‘‘no institutions in the State are doing a more noble work for its development, 
or deserve better of the State than the normal schools,”? In order to secure that efti- 
ciency and development commensurate with the educational interests of the State, a 
fixed and settled policy in regard to their financial support is urged by the board. 
It is also recommended that the academic work outside of the normal course should 
be made to harmonize with the higher institutions of learning, and for this purpose 
academic departments have been established in each of the normal schools, in which 
the work is limited to the preparation required to enter the State University. The 
graduates of these academic courses are admitted into the University upon certificates 
of graduation.” 
Six schools are established for white pupils, as follows: Concord, Fairmont, 
Glenville, Marshall College at Huntington, Shepherd College at Shepherdstown, and 
West Liberty. Storer College at Harper’s Ferry is devoted to normal instraction of 
colored students. Free tuition at these schools is provided for 600 pupils from the 
different counties of the State. The appointments are made by county superintend- 
ents, and subject to the approval of the State superintendent; males and females 
being selected in equal proportion, as far as practicable, . Of such students, 1 year’s 
teaching in the public schools of the State is required after the completion of the 
normal course. The professional course occupies 3 years, with Latin, French, and 
German optional. The academic course consists of 2 years’ study, which is considered 
equal to the preparatory course at the State University. Diplomas of the normal 
department are equivalent to number one certificates anywhore in the State, when 
the holders have taught 3 years under number one county certificates. 
Storer College has an industrial department in which the girls are taught sewing, 
cutting of plain garments, ete. : 
West Virginia is allowed 8 Peabody scholarships at the Nashville Normal College. 
Two students from the State graduated in the class of 1887. The liberal aid from this 
fund for normal work in the State has largely stimulated interest and enthusiasm 
in the cause of public schools. This has been reflected in the Legislature by moro 
liberal laws affecting education, and more liberal appropriations to normal schools, 
Regarding teachers’ institutes, the State superintendent reports the present insti- 
tute law a success. The teachers in many of the interior counties can not attend the 
normal schools, and to provide in a measure for some professional training, institutes 
have been organized in every county of the State, and in some counties where there 
is a large number of teachers 2 institutes have been held. A Peabody institute is 
held- yearly in the chapel of Storer College during the first week in June, and certifi- 
cates from the instructor answer the requirements of the law for teachers from any 
county in the State.

    understanding of their possibilities. and a more intimate acquaintance with their de- 
fects and excellencies.! x 
Normal schools are now established at Milwaukee, Oshkosh, Platteville, River 
Falls, and Whitewater. The State superintendent reports these schools under the 
management. of able and experienced faculties, equipped with apparatus, laboratories, 
cabinets, and libraries reasonably sufficiont for the requirements of such institutions, 
and superior to those found in any other schools in the State, outside of the Uni- 
versity. The curriculum embraces elementary and advanced study, and is kept 
abreast of the educational progress of the day. The course extends over a period of 
from 2 to 4} years. The school at Milwaukee, relying upon thorough preparation at 
the high schools, has a course of 2 years. The requirements for admission to these 
schools are being gradually raised as fast as the graded and high schools of the State 
can furnish pupils with the necessary scholastic training. The attendance is large, 
and additional teachers are recommended. Each assembly district in the State is en- 
itled to 8 representatives in the normal schools, candidates being nominated by 
_ county or city superintendents. An examination is necessary in branches required 
by law for third-grade certificates, and tuition is free to those signing the pledge to 
teach. Completion of the elementary course entitles the pupil toa certificate, which, 
after 1 year’s successful teaching in the State, may be countersigned by the State 
superintendent and is then equivalent to a 5 years’ State certificate. To those 
who complete the-full course of 4 years, diplomas are given, which, after a year’s ex- 
perience in teaching and on receiving the signature of the State superintendent, are 
equal to first-grade State certificates. Light gymnastics are provided for in all the 
‘ schools, while those at Milwaukee and Whitewater have workshops for manual train- 
ing, where students are instructed in the use of wood-working tools. Each of the 
paca schools has a model school attached, with the various grammar grades of 
study. 
A number of high schools give instruction for the profession of teaching. Milwau- 
kee has anormal department with i year’s course of strictly professional study. 
There is also a training class in that city for instruction in kindergarten teaching. 
Appleton, Baraboo, Berlin, Evansville, Green Bay, Janesville, Madison, Sheboygan, Sparta, 
Viroqua, and Wausau have incorporated the study of the theory and art of teaching 
as a part of the high school course. Appleton has stated teachers’ meetings, at which 
one study is regularly pursued, and upon which an examination is held at the end of 
the year. If this examination is satisfactory a certificate to teach is awarded. Dur- 
ing the past year the teachers met once a mouth to recite in history, algebra, and phys- 
iology, 28 well as for the discussion of other topics. Many of the teachers voluntarily 
organized into a reading circle and did thorough work. A city institute of 2 days 
. was held in the fall, with a large attendance from the neighboring towns and villages. 
Baraboo, Berlin, Green Bay, La Crosse, Milwaukee, and Sheboygan have monthly teach- 
ers’ meetings. Janesville has meetings every 2 weeks, and at least 1 teachers’ insti- 
tute during the year. The teachers’ meetings during the past year were devoted to 
the consideration of physiology, general history, science, and art of teaching, music, 
and penmanship. Among the subjects proposed for next year are psychology, school 
economy, and English literature. Oshkosh also has meetings every 2 weeks, while in 
Madison and Wausau they are held weekly. In some of these cities the teachers are 
allowed opportunities of visiting other schools for inspection. Miheaukee has a 
teachers’ library which numbered nearly 1,000 volumes in 1886. : 
The work of teachers’ institutes is conducted according to what is known as the 
Wisconsin system. The usual conferences of institute workers are held semiannually 
in connection with the meetings of the State Teachers’ Association. Fifty-one 
counties are reported to have held institutes in the summer of 1887, 28 of these of 
1 week each, 22 of 2 weeks each, and 1 in Green County of 4 weeks.? A series of 
-institutes for graded school teachers was held during the fall and winter, con- 
ducted as far as practicable by a normal school professor, and continuing 2 days, Fri- 
' day and Saturday.? 
The Wisconsin University summer school for teachers during the summer of: 1887 
enrolled 40 members. The work was elective and discretionary, 
The semiannual meeting of the State Teachers’ Association was held December 
27-29, 1886, at Madison, and the thirty-fourth annual meeting convened at Milwau- 
kee, July 6-7, 1887. The attendance at the latter was about 350. 
Wisconsin has a State teachers’ reading circle, with a course of study comprising 
eneral history, history of education, civil government, psychology, and English 
literature. In order to increase tho efficiency of this work and add interest to the 
_ course it is recommended to reduce the studies, have a system of county organization, 
and hold examinations at stated periods.

‘The chief need in educational matters in this Territory seems to be a normal school, 
but it is doubtful whether such an institution could be maintained with the present 
number of schools.1 ‘The University of Wyoming, recently established at Laramie, 
includes in its curriculum a course of study in the theory and art of teaching, and the 
Jaw provides free tuition to all students of the University who are nominated by the 
county commissioners of the several counties.* 
Annual teachers’ institutes of at least a week’s duration are required, and the fare 
to and from the institute, of all teachers and superintendents of public scliools who 
attend, is paid from the Territorial fund? A Territorial institute was held at Laramie, 
Angust-29, 1887. 
Prabopy Arp TO NorMaL SCHOOLS. 
In regard to appropriations for normal schools and other appliances for the train- 
ing of teachers, the generous aid of the Peabody Education Find, with its important 
results to the cause of Southern education, must not bo overlooked. ‘The graded 
schools in so many cities and towns and districts; the excellent school laws in so 
, many States; the training schools and normal colleges which have been established 
in so many quarters of the South; and the normal institutes which have been ‘at- 
tended by such throngs of teachers and students, and of people of all classes and 
ages, and of both sexes, during the summer months, bear abundant. testimony to the 
work which has been done since George Peabody signed that memorable letter of 
trust.”? While disclaiming all these great results as having been accomplished solely 
through this assistance, and making due acknowledgment of the codperation and 
cordial concurrence of the Southern people in this work, the chairman of the board 
adds: ‘It is not too much to say that Mr. Peabody’s munificent endowment opened 
the way, gave the original impulse, and secured a successful progress for that great 
educational movement iu which the Southern States are now rejoicing, and in which 
it is our privilege and pride to rejoice with them.” 
The settled policy of the trustees is to use the greater portion of the annual in- 
come for normal schools and institutes, believing that nothing is so much needed in 
the South as trained teachers for the public schools. 
The following table will show the several amounts distributed among ten States, 
for educational purposes, since October 1, 1886‘—$57,000 in all, not including $13,000

fornia, of the 900 normal school graduates reported as teaching in 1886, more than two- 
thirds were graduates of the California State normal schools; and of the entire teaching 
~ force, 2,012 subscribed for some educational journal, The total number of teachers, 
winter and summer, in Connecticut were 6,165, as given in.the table, of whom less than 
one-half were continuously employed. The Illinois State Normal University reports 
oyer 1,100 graduates and under-graduates teaching in the State during 1886. In Kan- 
sas the 335 teachers holding State certificates are all graduates of the State Normal 
School; and of nearly 12,000 certificates of all grades issued to teachers in Michigan, 
about one-half had attended institutes during the year. New Hampshire reports 146 
towns as employing teachers from normal schools; in Pennsylvania, during the past 
year, nearly 15,000 teachers read books on teaching; and in West Virginia about one 
third of the teachers subscribed for some educational journal during 1886. 
TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES. 
[Table 24, Page 454.] 
The statistics of this work throughout the country are incomplete, as they are com- 
piled from the reports of the superintendents of public instruction for the several 
States when such information is given. These State reports are issued annually in 
some States and biennially in others, and hence complete statistics for the current 
year are not available. The latest statistics of teachers’ institutes are tabulated 
below. Of the 37 held in Alabama, 15 were Peabody normal institutes for both 
races separate. Besides the county institutes in Indiana, there were 4,190 township 
institutes additional; and in Minnesota, 167 local associations and meetings were 
convened by the county superintendents. District institutes were held in 747 school 
districts in Pennsylvania during the past year, and the three institutes reported from 
South Carolina were inter-county institutes, besides which several others were held, 
with a total attendance of at least 500 teachers. In Vermont many educational 
meetings were held in addition tothe institutes. Wisconsin reports 6,246 teachers in 
attendance at the seventy-five institutes held in that State during 1886, of whom 
1,757 had not taught.

REMARKS UPON THE TABLES.’ So MEe 
Puriic NorMat Scnoo.s. 
_ [Zables 25 and 26, Pages 456 and 458.] 
In the following tables giving tho statistics of public normal schools reporting to this 
Office for the year 1886-87, only those schools are included which receive appropriations 
from State, county, city, or Peabody funds, These number 124 schools, with 1,235 in- 
atructors and 30,296 sindents, Of the last mentioned, 26,594 are normal pupils, 7,576 
of whom are males and 17,507 females, with 1,511 whoso sex is not stated. Normal 
pupils are also reported from high schools (including public and partly ppblic schools), 
the number aggregating 2,967, while private normal schools and academies increase 
the number by 18,386 pupils. To these ato to be added 1,542 normal students reported 
. from 58 colleges, giving ‘ total of 22,895 in other than public normal schools, and a 
grand total of 49,489 normal students in public and private schools throughout the 
country. P 
About two-thirds of the public normal schools receive State aid; a few are assisted 
by county funds; while many are supported wholly from the appropriations for city 
schools. The Peabody Education Fund assists liberally in this cause, distributing 
nearly $50,000 annually among normal schools in the South. x 
Private Normar ScHoo.s. 
[Table 264, Page 464.] 
Peculiar difficulties attend tho classification of schools reporting under the head of private normals, on account of the following conditions: : 
Their work is twofold; general and special. The general course is sometimes of an elementary grade, sometimes corresponds to the usual academic course, andis some- times a, union of the two. Again, the special or teachers’ training course may con- 
sist of a brief series of lectures on methods of instruction or an extended course in” . the theory and art of teaching, including practice in a model school. 
In the former case the special course is not a feature of suflicient prominence to be made the basis of classification. In the latter ease.the schools are essentially train- ing schools for teachers, and are so regarded in their respective communities, 
It is hoped that special inquiries now in progress may securo information that will lead to a more satisfactory exhibit of the number gud character of the schools in question than is possible with the present data. 
__ Table 26A presents the statistics of twenty-six private normal schools, having 238 
instructors and 8,470 pupils. Si

KINDERGARTENS. 
     General progress of kindergarten training—] dergatten training-schools—Snmmary of statisticsof _ 
kindergartens (Table 27)—Summary of statistics of kindergarten training schools (‘Table 28)—Statis 
tics of kindergartens (Table 29)—Statistics of kindergarten training schools (‘Table 30). 
    - There are 544 kindergartens reported to this Office for the present year, with 1,256 
instructors and 25,925 children, a considerable increase over the year 1880-86. 
The majority of kindergartens, whether giving or not giving free tuition, are still 
supported by private means, only 158 of the whole number being supported by public’ 
funds, St. Louis, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia are the only cities in which kinder- 
gartens seem to be firmly established as a part of the public school system. 
» In January, 1887, the kindergartens, which for several years had been under the 
care of the Subprimary School Society of Philadelphia, were formally transferred to 
the board of education, and $15,000 were appropriated for their support. Edward T. 
Steel, president of the board of education, in accepting the care of these kindergar- 
» tens in the name of the city of Philadelphia, said: ‘‘ While I am earnestly in favor ° 
of what is known as higher education asa part of the public school system, I believe 
that it is secondary to the necessity fora perfectly organized system of instruction 
for the youngest children; and when these kindergartens shall become as extensive as 
the other grades of our schools—which I believe they will—and manual training (the 
principle of which is one of the leading features of the kindergarten system) shall be 
in practice throughout all of our schools, we shall have accomplished the highest posi- 
tion possible to attain in a system of public education, and have fulfilled a duty in 
regard to youth which the enlightenment and civilization of the times demand.” 
joston will soon follow the example of Philadelphia. In December, 1887, the com- 
mittee on examinations made a report on the establishment of kindergartens in con- 
nection with the public schools, proposing to adopt the 14 kindergartens now sup- 
ported by Mrs. Shaw, and recommending an appropriation of $20,000 for the year 
1888-89 for the support of these and others in different parts of the city. , 
Other cities are taking steps in this direction, among them Lynn, Mass.; Hartford 
and New Haven, Conn.; Des Moines, Iowa; and Ionia and Muskegon, Mich, 
_ The kindergarten is found to be invaluable in schools for the blind, and a very in- 
. teresting fact indicative of progress in this work is the establishment during the 
present year of a kindergarten in connection with the Perkins Institution for the Blind 
at Roxbury, Mass. A fine three-story building, built especially for the purpose with 
money raised by subscription, largely through Laura Bridgman’s efforts, was di dicated 
in April, 1877, with-very interesting exere Friends of the cause are now solicit- 
ing funds for an endowment, in order to place this department of the institution on 
a firm foundation, 
    
  
  
     
      
KINDERGARTEN TRAINING SCHOOLS. 
For the present year there are 49 training schools reported, with $5 instructors and 
524 pupils. Eight of these are connected with public normal schools or supported 
by public funds, and 5 are supported by free kindergarten associations. 
The training school under the auspices of the Subprimary School Society of Phila- / 
‘delphia has been given up to the care of the school board and a modern kinder- 
garten connected with it. In September, 188° school of psychology, embracing a 
chair in “‘Psychology of childhood and the nce and art of teaching and kinder- 
gartening,” was established, having in connection with it a model kindergarten, pri- 
mary, and other grades on the Froebel principle and method of education. :

The total number of schools for secondary instruction reporting to the Office in 
1886-87 was 1,476, having 8,604 instructors and 184,616 students, If to these be 
added the number of students reported in the preparatory departments of superior in- 
_ stitutions (Tables 42, 45, 48, and 52), viz, 32,182, there results a sum total of 216,798 
pupils reported in courses of secondary instruction, 
Tho independence, variety, and individuality of secondary schools in the United, 
States render it difficult to bring them within the compass of a common scheme of 
representation, such as might show the quantity and the resources of this part of the 
educational provision of the country and indicate the direction in which efforts should 
be expended for the farther improvement and development of the work. 
In the present Report the aim has been to arrive at the best classification of the 
schools and to make an intelligible presentation of those features which pertain to 
secondary as distinguished from special training. 
The source of support, which is the most obvious distinction between the schools, 
leads naturally to their division into two groups—public and private, Intermediate 
between the two is a number of schools supported partly by public funds and partly 
by private funds or tuition fees. They are mostly in the Southern States, and mark 
a phase in the progress of the free-school system which has nearly disappeared in other 
sections. Their separate tabulation serves an historical purpose only. 
The private secondary schools have been tabulated in three groups, viz: (1) schools 
for boys exclusively ; (2) schools for girls exclusively ; and (3) schools for both sexes, 
This classification suits well with the scholastic characteristics of the three groups. 
In: the United States, as elsewhere, secondary instruction tends largely to two 
courses—the ‘‘classical” and the ‘‘scientific.” These convenient terms can not, 
however, be employed in our tabulation, from the want of uniformity in their use. 
The former has three applications: first, as including both Latin and Greek ; second, 
as allowing alternatives between Greek and French and German; third, but rarely, 
as inelnding the classical literature of any language. : 
494 
   
-P-A-G-E-495
   
The importance of the two courses as compared with the entire work of the schools 
may be inferred from the following summary : 
  
  
      Proportion of students in classical and scientific courses. Schools so reporting, 
Grade. Per cent. 
25 to 50 per cent. -| High schools. \ 28 . Private schoo! 16 50 to 100 por cent. .| High schools. 36 Private schools. 27   
  
a Includes public and partly public. 
The schools for boys exceed all other classes of secondary schools in the proportion 
of their pupils classified as above. 
In addition to the classical and the scientific course, there is a third course numeri- 
cally large, variously constituted and variously named, as “ general,” “ English,” 
and “literary.” 
Normal and business courses are incidental to the main work of secondary schools, 
being very generally pursued in connection with other courses. 
The work in progress in the schools can not, however, be so well indicated by courses 
as by particular studies, Sbalce peng made of those having known value, Mathe- 
matics naturally stands first in the list. Of this branch it is sufficient to say that 
algebra and geometry are invariably included in the secondary programmes, and are 
pursued either together or in succession throughout the course. Physics and chemistry 
are common features, and are generally taken in the order named. From an inquiry 
respecting the latter it is found to be a requisite for graduation in 295 high schools, 
or 57 per cent. of the whole number (26 schools specifying scientific or general course), 
in 61 per cent. of the private schools for girls, in 26 per cent. of the schools for boys, 
and in 50 per cent. of the schools for both sexes, 
The statistics pertaining to language studies which, all things considered, afford 
the best index of the work, have been tabulated, and are summarized in Tables 31 
and 32. : 
The inquiries were intended to secure information as to the number of students pue- 
suing a foreign language and the number confining themselves to English, 
Unfortunately one question, viz, ‘‘What is the number of students pursuing En- 
glish branches exclusively,” was susceptible of different interpretations. In several 
cases it was understood to exclude pupils in drawing; in others the entire enrolment 
of the school was given in reply, notwithstanding the fact that this was contradicted” 
by the answers to other inquiries. 
In the case of all the schools, save those for girls, it was found possible to correct 
the mistakes arising from this misunderstanding in time to use the information, either 
-in the integral or in the ratio tables. For the girls’ schools the statistics remain ine 
complete. 
The tables show further the number of secondary pupils pursuing drawing (free 
hand and mechanical), a matter of daily-increasing interest, both on account of the 
recognized importance of the exercise as a part of general training, and as a prepara- 
tion for scientific and technical training. Statistics of other forms of manual train- 
ing have also been included. The summary of students preparing for superior insti- 
tutions completes the view of the scholastic work. 
Asregards financial particulars, our present information is exceedingly defective, 
neitherincome nor expenditure being included. Property valuation, permanent funds, 
and benefactions are shown in the summaries of the schools for boys and the schools 
for both sexes. In the summary of the schools for girls, and the high schools, public 
and partly public, permanent funds have not been tabulated. Six private schools 
tor girls report under this head a total of $119,000, and 27 high schools a total of 
$685,305. ‘

508 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
} CoMPARATIVE STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Tables 33 and 34 bring into comparative view the particulars summarized in the 
foregoing tables. 
Confining our attention to public schools, it appears that a little more than one- 
third of the pupils pursue English branches exclusively; in the partly public the 
proportion is still larger. 
Latin holds a prominent place in the curriculum, and is evidently not merely the 
sign of a course preparatory to college or to scientifie school, since the proportion of 
pupils pursuing it is much greater than the proportion intending to matriculate, as 
will be seen by the comparison of Columns 3 and 8. It is interesting to note that not- 
withstanding the enthusiasm for science and the commercial value of scientific knowl- 
edge, the classical preparatory course attracts a larger proportion of scholars than the 
scientific, even in the public high schools, which are often charged with fostering too 
largely the money-making propensity. : 
Table 34, Divisions B and C, derived from the statistics of private schools for boys 
and for both sexes, include one column more than Table 33, showing the number of 
pupils not distributed under the specified languages. 
The larger proportion of the schools not answering the questions relating to par- 
‘ticular studies give some data from which the facts may be inferred. 
As regards the schools for both sexes,!viz, Table 34, Division C, the inference is 
that the majority of the undistributed pupils are in English branches only, while in 
the case of the schools for boys (Table 34, Division B), the reverse is to be inferred. 
In the schools for boys, as in the public high schools, Latin is a leading feature, 
and in all classes of secondary schools it holds the first place among foreign languages. 
The schools for boys are the only secondary schools, as a class, in which Greek has 
prominence; it is noticeable, further, that they show the highest percentages in all 
the languages, except French, in which the schools for girls take precedence. 
About one-third of the work of the boys’ schools is professedly preparatory to col- 
lege or to scientific school, the proportion in the classical preparatory being a little 
more than double that in the scientific. 
The relation of the several particulars embodied in Tables 33 and 34, as it appears 
for the entire country, is shown in Table-35. 
Several considerations applicable to all classes of secondary schools are suggested 
by the statistics before us: 
First in order is the importance of a well ordered English course, in which the 
studies, their sequence, and the time allotted to each, shall be carefully and intelli- 
gently determined. 
Second, the importance of determining the proper relation of Latin to secondary 
training in general. 
Third, the importance of so adjusting the preparatory courses and those of superior 
schools as to prevent waste of time and effort by the overlapping of studies. 
Although individual schools can be instanced in which these essentials are well 
ordered, considering the country at large there is serious want of authoritative agencies 
to systematize the work along the lines indicated. A few such agencies have been 
organized in particular States. 4 
Hirst among these should be noted the supervisory work of the regents of the Uni- 
versity of the State of New York. In order to have the benefit of the regents’ inspec- 
tion and examination and to share in consequence in the distribution of the literature 
fund, academies and union schools must comply with the following conditions: “The 
possession of property amounting to at least $5,000 over and above all incumbrances, 
and that the debts shall not exceed the one-third part of said property; and that, 
besides the buildings (which, as required by law, must be of the value of at least 
$2,000), said property shall include alibrary of suitable books worth at least $500, 
and apparatus and collections suitable for instruction in physics, chemistry, and nat- 
ural history, worth at least $500; and that reasonable assurances exist of a sufficient 
income for the suitable support of said academy and of the attendance thereat of at 
least 25 scholars who are qualified to pursue the proper studies of an academy.” 
The following survey of the academic examinations is from the annual report of the 
regents of the university for the year 1885-86: 
“In 1866 the system of academic examinations was organized by the board, for the 
purpose of determining in a more satisfactory manner the number of qualified schol- 
ars entitled each year to share in the distribution of the literature fund. The first 
year in which this test was applied, the number allowed as entitled to share in the 
distribution, was reduced from 20,443 in 1865 to 13,140 in 1866, in 1867 it fell to 10,806; 
a reduction in 2 years of nearly one-half. The minimum of 5,873 was reached in 1872, 
since which time the increasing number of schools and students, more thorough and 
efficient instruction, and the influence of examinations in advanced subjects organ- 
ized in 1878, have caused the number to steadily increase to 12,583 in 1886,
-P-A-G-E-509
  STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 509 \ 
“While these examinations were instituted as a more intelligent means than that 
before enployert for determining a proper basis for the distribution of the literature 
fund and have more than fulfilled the expectations of their projectors in this particu- 
lar, they have performed and are performing other and far more important functions, 
in testing,.by instrumentalities outside the regularly employed means of instruction, 
the efficiency of that instruction; while at the same time the knowledge of the pupil 
is shown, a uniform standard of scholarship is established throughout the second- 
ary schools of the State, and that standard is maintained at a much higher point than 
has before been reached in these schools. 
“The experience of two decades shows the wisdom with which the foundations of the * 
system were laid. The patient.and harmonious efforts of principals and instructors, 
of boards of trustees and boards of education, combined with those of the board of 
regents, have developed and strengthened the system until it has reached proportions 3 
and is performing functions not anticipated at the outset. 
+ “The system, entirely unique, has the almost unanimous support of those engaged 
in the work of secondary education in the State, and the fact that each year numer- 
ous inquiries are received in regard to the system and numerous applications made 
by secondary schools to be received under the visitation of the board, chiefly in order 
to share in the benefits derived from the system of examinations, bears witness that 
the system is fruitful in good results for the educational interests of the State.” 4 A 
In 1885-86 the number of academies visited was 276, having 1,400 teachers and 
37,735 scholars, of whom 12,583 were academic. The number of subjects covered by 
the examination questions was 41. 
While the regents’ examinations have a stimulating effect in every part of second- 
ary work, nearly all the other agencies for its improvement are directed to the 
course preparatory to college or to scientific school. Among these should be noted 
the system established in a number of Western States, whereby graduates of approved 
high schools are admitted to the universities without further examination. This 
becomes virtually a system of supervision. + 
The following private associations devoted to the work in question have becomo 
well known through their published proceedings: The Associated Academic Princi- 
pals of the State of New York; the Massachusetts Association of Classical and High i 
School Teachers, and the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory 
Schools. An outcome of the last mentioned is the Commission of Colleges in New 
England on Admission Examinations, The purpose of the Commission is sufficiently 
indicated by its name ; its work is that of investigation, discussion, and advice. The 
wide-spread interest which its deliberations have excited shows that the problems 
with which it has to deal affect the entire country, so that the solutions which prove 
sufficient forthe exigencies of one section will be of practical advantage to the 
others. 
The Commission was definitely established in September, 1886, and comprised the 
following colleges: Ambherst, Boston University, Brown, Colby, Dartmouth, Har- 
vard, Smith, Trinity, Tufts, Wellesley, Wesleyan, Williams, and Yale. The follow- 
ing statement is from the first annual report, covering the operations of the Commis-. 
sion for 1886-87 : 
“At a preliminary meeting held April, 1886, the Commission considered the division 
of admission examinations into preliminary and final examinations, and made the 
following recommendations to the colleges: 
“1, Voted, To recommend to the several faculties to permit candidates in the pre- 
liminary examination to be examined only in those subjects in which their teachers» 
certify that they are prepared, and in which they present themselves with their 
teachers’ approval. 
“2. Voted, That this Commission suggest that the several faculties recommend the 
reservation of the following subjects until the final examinations: Vergil, Latin 
prose composition, Homer, Greek prose composition, geometry, French, and English 
composition.” 
“On the 7th of January, 1887, at a special meeting of the New England Association 
of College Officersand Preparatory Teachers, the secretary of the Commission, by invi- 
tation, read an account of the formation of the Commission, and a statement of its 
proposed work. He invited the preparatory teachers to present to the Commission 
any questions which seemed to them important and germane to the work. Responding 
to this invitation, the Association appointed a committee to communicate with the a Commission. This committee, consisting of Messrs. F, A. Hill, principal of the English 
» High School, Cambridge ; W. Gallagher, principal of Williston Seminary, Easthamp- 
ton; and C. F. P. Bancroft, principal of Phillips Academy, Andover, sent a commu- 
nication, which was presented to the Commission at its annual meeting in April, 
1887, .

‘With respect to the appropriate functions of the Commission the oink cntheeies 
set forth that the preparatory schools accepted the views formulated by, the Associa- 
tion of the Colleges.! As regards other matters of common interest the communica- 
tion was as follows: \ 
“1, The preparatory schools undoubtedly approve the first vote of the Commission 
at its meeting in 1886, recommending to the several faculties to permit candidates in 
the preliminary examinations to be examined only in those subjects in which their 
teachers certify that they are prepared, in which they present themselves with their 
teachers’ approval. 
“2. The second vote of the Commission, recommending the reservation of Vergil, 
Latin prose composition, Homer, Greek prose composition, geometry, French, and 
English composition, meets, in its general purpose to set apart certain subjects as 
* suitable for the final examinations, with entire approval. ‘ 
“3, The committee find that the reservation of French for the final examinations 
does not commend itself to the preparatory schools. This fact was apparent at the 
special meeting of the New England Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, 
held in Boston in January last. Wherever the committee have been able to ascer- 
tain opinion about the proposed reservation, they have found dissent, | 
“The objections raised are not against the theory that it is wise to prevent inter- 
ruption in the study of subjects which would be continued after admission to college, 
but rather to the practicability of applying this principle fully, on the basis of a fair 
division of subjects between the preliminary and the final examinations. 
“The committee respectfully ask the Commission to consider the propriety of leay- 
ing French optional, at least for the present. 
“4, The committee beg leave to suggest that in the English requisitions, the limit, 
not only in the number and variety of authors and works recommended, but also in 
the annual changes, has been reached, if not passed. They regret the lack of uni- 
formity that still exists in these requisitions, notwithstanding the fact that many 
colleges are in accord. | 
“This committee also presented a communication requesting ‘that the examina- 
tion in Greek and in Roman history be divided. The fact that some colleges separate 
the two subjects while others do not, is, at times, a source of embarrassment.’ 
“Further, the statement was made, qualifying the suggestion as to the requirement 
in English, ‘that there would be no serious objections to the quantity of reading at 
present required, if the pupils were not required to carry it all for examination pur- 
ses.’ ” 
. The report further states that: | 
By invitation, Mr. F, A. Hill, chairman of the committee sending the communica- 
tion, appeared before the Commission and presented more fully the views of his com- 
mittee. 
“As it appeared that the recommendation of the Commission to reserve French for 
the final examination had been adopted to some extent, it was thought best not to 
discuss that question at present. 
“The requirement in English was discussed at length, as it was clearly the ques- 
tion of most urgent importance in the conviction of the preparatory teachers, It was 
finally voted ‘that further consideration of the subject be postponed until the next 
meeting of the Commission,’ i 
“This subject, therefore, is now before the colleges for their consideration. It is 
hoped that discussion by the several faculties may enable the Commission to take 
more definite action when it next shall meet.” 
At this point the deliberations of the Commission have an important general bear- 
ing, since, as regards the mother tongue, all secondary courses may well be made 
uniform. 
The value to be attached to the study of English language and literature is not a 
matter of recent recognition, but the extension of courses in this direetion, the im- 
provement in methods of instruction, and the appointment of special teachers for 
the work are noticeable features of recent progress in the leading secondary schools 
both public and private. 
Several investigations in respect to this development are now going on in the Office 
with the view to a full report upon the same. Intimately connected with this sub- 
ject is that of provision for other modern languages. Here the secondary schools are 
enefitted by the labors of the Modern Language Association, which embraces in its 
inquiries and deliberations both preparatory and collegiate courses. 
  
1 The views referred to were recorded in the following votes: : 
“First, To maintain with punctuality the existing degree of uniformity in the requirements for admission. ! “Second. To bring about a greater degree of uniformity in requirements upon common subjects. “Third, Lo bring about a greater degree of uniformity of regulations in regard to the division of admission examinations into preliminary and final examinations. “Fourth, Lo uxge the use of identical examination papers upon common requirements.”

The most important consideration relative to secondary instruction is that of the 
time devoted to the work. This underlies all questions of curricula and of the ad- 
justment of preparatory to superior courses, and has, moreover, social and economic 
bearings which can not be ignored. It isa matter about which there is great diversity 
of practice, and also one with reference to which it is difficult to secure satisfactory 
information. a 
Two inquiries made by the Office this year were directed to this subject. The first 
asked the age of admission, the second the duration of the course of study under 
three heads, viz: 
(1) Preparatory to classical course in college. 
(2) Preparatory to scientific course in college or scientific school. 
(3) General academic course. 
It was found that as a general rule in the high schools answering the inquiries, the 
three courses have the same duration, which is either 3 or 4 years. In a few cases 
the scientific preparatory is one year less than the classical. 
In the private schools for boys, on the contrary, the scientific preparatory is, as a 
rule, a year shorter than the classical. : 
The following summary shows the possibilities or probabilities as to the age at 
which pupils will finish secondary courses considering their duration and the age 
required for admission. Where the three courses differed in time the classical pre- 
paratory was the one employed. The number of high schools responding to both in- 
quiries was 97, and the number of private schools for boys (the only class here con- 
sidered), 91:

The detailed tables, viz, 36 and 37, show for the individual schools responding to 
the inquiries of the Office the particulars involved in the summaries. 
From an examination of Table 36, Part 1, it will be seen that of the seven largest 
cities of the United States three, namely, New York, Brooklyn, and Philadelphia, 
have no place in the table before us, while one, Baltimore, is represented by high 
schools for girls only. This omission arises not from the lack of public provision for 
secondary instruction, but from conditions of the work peculiar to the respective 
cities. 
Brooklyn, N. Y., has maintained since 1878 a central school to which pupils are 
advanced from the grammar grade. In his report for 1886, Hon. Calvin Patterson, 
superintendent of public instruction in that city, gives the following statisties of the 
school for the year mentioned : 
  
Number graduated. 
Sex. Number 
admitted.) Commercial | Regular course. course. 
  
Boys - 33 
Girls - 188 
221 
    
“The courses of study were enlarged in July last by the adoption of a 3 years’ Jan 
uage course, ard a 2 years’ commercial course in place of the 1 year course. The 
nglish course remains 2 years as heretofore.” 
Respecting the general scope of the school the superintendent says: ‘‘The courses 
of study now prescribed for the pupils of the Central School do not materially modify 
the general scope of the work. Pupils completing the language course would not be 
admitted to the classical course in any college. The committee of the school and the 
board of education have refused as yet to include among the subjects taught any 
branches that were not necessary to the proper preparation of the young ladies for 
teaching and the young men for the every-day aftairs of life. It is to be hoped that 
the time is not far distant when the young people of Brooklyn will be favored with 
the same educational advantages that are granted to the youth of other cities.” 
New York City maintains anormal college for girls, the statistics of which will be 
found in Chapter VI of this Report, page 460, and the College of the City of New 
York, which is tabulated in Chapter IX. 
The first 2 years in the Normal College are entirely academic, the second 2 partly 
academic and partly professional. The curriculum includes Latin, French, German, 
mathematics, extended courses in science and in literature, with music, drawing, and 
intellectual philosophy considered especially in relation to the art of teaching. Can- 
didates for admission must pass an examination.

    518 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
"Philadelphia maintains a central high school for boys and a normal school for ee 
which latter is tabulated in Chapter 1. 
The 4 years’ course of the Central High School includes Latin, German, and a ‘fine 
course in drawing. Graduates from this course receive the degree Yof B.A. "Thecourse 
in the Girls’ Normal School is of 3 years’ duration with a post-graduate year for those 
intending to teach. In his report for 1886, Mr. G. W. Fetter, the principal, states that 
“the chief object of the school is to give the pupils a thorough English education 
before graduation, and to supplement t this by furnishing the post-graduates such ad- 
ditional training as instructors of youth need and must ; have to insure success.” 
In addition to the 2 high schools for girls included in the table before us, Baltimore 
maintains a college for boys which is included in Table 45. 
In the city of Boston there are 10 high schools, which were characterized as follows 
by Mr. Philbrick, ‘‘ six local mixed schools of’the lower order and 4 central schools 
of the superior order, a classical, and a non-classical, one for each sex.” 
For convenience of reference the principal statistics of the dissimilar institutions 
of academic grade comprised in the public school systems of the 7 largest cities are 
exhibited together .in the following table, only the 4 central high schools of Boston 
being included : *

  SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 567 
REMARKS ON THE TABLES. 
. PROMINENCE GIVEN TO LATIN. 
The value of Latin as an instrument of mental discipline has been the most promi- 
nent subject in the discussions excited by the movement toward the ‘‘modern” or 
“scientific” course. The summarized and comparative statistics of secondary schools 
(Tables 31, 32, 33, and 34) show very clearly the extent of the demand made upon 
them for instruction in this branch. To this showing the detailed Tables, viz, 36 and 
37, add some suggestive particulars. For instance, it will be seen that the demand 
for Latin is not confined to a few schools, nor to particular sections of the country. 
Of the public and partly public schools 88 per cent. report students in the language 
specified. For the private schools the proportions are 68 per cent. of the schools for 
girls, 84 per cent. of the schools for boys, and 72 per cent. of the schools for both sexes. 
These indications are farther emphasized by comparison with the relative number 
of each class of schools reporting students in French or German, These proportions 
are as follows: Of public and partly public schools, 61 per cent. ; of private schools for 
girls, 75 per cent. ; of private schools for boys, 74 per cent. ; and of private schools for 
both sexes, 52 per cent. 
PHYSICAL CULTURE, 
By reference to Column 20, Table 36; to the same column, Table 37, Division A; 
to Column 23, Table 37, Division B; and to Column 25, Division C, it will be seen 
that a large proportion of the secondary schools have answered the inquiry respect- 
ing provision for physical culture. 
The inquiries as to the system of training and the nature of the appliances were 
not answered as fully as could have been desired. 
Gymnasiums suitably equipped were reported from 13 private schools for girls, 81 
private schools for boys, and 57 private schools for both sexes. Military drill is a 
feature of the training in 26 private schools for boys and in 13 of the schools for both 
sexes,

    STATISTICS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 587 
REMARKS ON TABLE 37. 
The financial statistics presented in Table 37, Divisions A, B, and C, show a general 
want of endowment funds for the purposes of secondary instruction. Very few re- 
ports under this head are made from schools for girls, and the larger proportion of 
the endowed schools for boys and for both sexes are located in the North Atlantic 
and the South Atlantic States. It is noticeable, further, that for the most part these 
endowments date back to an early period of our history. ‘ 
It is to be feared that the rapid and vigorous development of public high schools 
has tended to divert the attention of the wealthy patrons of learning from the need 
of private funds for the same grade of instruction. Private Seeueie are, however, 
as necessary as public for its fulldevelopment. The dignity and independence which 
ample and permanent resources impart are conditions favorable to sound instruction 
ant effective discipline. Hence, endowed schools like Phillips’ Academy and the 
William Penn Charter School can not be spared from the forces that are to shape 
public character and develop public intelligence. 
Among comparatively recent foundations due to private liberality the McDonogh 
School is one of the most important and interesting. In the expressed purposes of its 
founder and the manner in which these have been realized it bears a close analogy to 
the great endowed schools of England. ‘In accordance with the will of Mr. Mc- 
Donogh, the foundation is designed for the education, first, of the poor boys of the 
city of Baltimore ; second, of those of the towns and villages of the State of Mary- 
land; and third, of those from ‘the different large cities of the Union.’” 
Such has been the growth of the school since its opening in 1872, that a system of 
appointment, based upon a comparative examination of all applicants, has been 
found necessary. It is now proposed to extend the opportunities of the school by 
the admission of a certain number of pay scholars.

Commissioner in preparation for this Report, the tables were closed at an earlier date

matter, 
Returns were received from the following schools at a date so near that assigned 
that it has been possible to present the leading statisties as addenda to Tables 36 
and 37. 
These statistics are not, however, included in the foregoing discussions nor sum- 
maries, excepting only in the general summary, p. 494.

      I—INSTITUTIONS FOR THE SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. 
The institutions providing advanced courses of instruction for women may 
be divided into two classes; the one including a small number of colleges organized 
upon the usual plan of the arts colleges; the other a large class of colleges and 
seminaries most of which make provision for a complete course of instruction, be- 
ginning at a very elementary stage and carrying pupils on to graduation. 
‘All the institutions of the former class, and a large proportion of the latter, are 
authorized by law to confer degrees, and it seems that eventually the fact of such 
authority, taken in connection with the main purpose of individual institutions as 
indicated by concentration upon collegiate work or provision for all grades, may afford. 
the basis for a better classification than is now possible. 
The information thus far collected by the Office is not sufficiently definite and exact 
upon several points. 
For example, without any apparent change of status certain seminaries have been 
reported one year as authorized by law to confer degrees and the next as not so 
authorized. Again, in some cases, when the inquiry as to the authority to confer de- 
es has been answered in the negative, a statement has been made as to the num- 
r and kind of degrees conferred. Moreover, the requirements for degrees, and the 
significance of the various degrees, are not clearly indicated. The differences in re- 
spect to these particulars between the seminaries for women and the colleges for'men 
must be taken into account in considering the relative number of degrees conferred 
by each. Thus, according to returns received at the Office in 1885-86, the number of 
women receiving the A. B. degree exceeded the number of men in two States, while 
in three States the numbers were nearly equal. There is, however, every reason for 
believing that the number of young men completing the recognized course for A. B. 
in each of these States excelled the number of women. As to the number of women 
who avail themselves of the provision for higher education the present information is 
‘unsatisfactory, as many seminaries make no distinction between the elementary and 
the academic departments in reporting the number of their students. 
In view of these circumstances the study of the subject of the higher education of 
women must be extended to the details of the colleges and seminaries engaged in the 
work before a satisfactory tabulation can be accomplished. This investigation has 
been commenced; meanwhile the endeavor in the present Report has been simply to 
preserve in convenient form the principal statisties for the year. 
In Table 42, Division A, have been placed three colleges for women in New York, 
which on account of their relation to the University of the State have heretofore ap- 
642 
       
 
-P-A-G-E-643
     
eared in Table 47, three eollnaes which, as is well known, are organized and con- 
uctéd in strict accordance with the plan of the arts colleges, together with the Har- 
. vard Annex, whose standards are also definitely fixed. 
Division B includes all other institutions reporting under the head of Superior In- 
struction of Women. ‘ 
ADMISSION OF WOMEN TO COLUMBIA COLLEGE, NEW YORK, ‘ 
The following announcement, from the Hand-book of Information of Columbia Col- 
lege, explains in full the arrangements under which women have been admitted to its 
* privileges: 
“By a resolution of the trustees of Columbia College adopted June 8, 1883, it was _ 
ordered that a course of cpllegiate study equivalent to the course given to young’ 
men in the college should be offered to such women as may desire to avail themselves 
of it, to be pursued under the general direction of tho faculty of the college in ao- 
cordance with the following principles and regulations : 
‘1, That such course of study shall extend over a term of four years. 
“2, That it shall be-arranged in groups. 
“3, That of these groups one shall be required for the first two years, and that 
with it another shall be selected. : 
“4, That on the expiration of the first two years all the groups shall become 
elective, 
“5, That a general and very strict preliminary examination shall be held for ad- 
mission to the four years’ course, and that this examination shall have reference to 
the course in general, like the examination for entrance into the freshman class in 
college. 
“6, That, unless under special circumstances, no young woman shall be admitted 
to such entrance examination before she shall have attained the age of seventeen 
years. ‘ 
“7, That every student so admitted shall bo entirely free as to where and how to 
pursue her studies, whether in some school, private or public, or at home, or under the 
auspices or direction of any association interested in her welfare and advancement, 
and providing her with the means of education. 
“8, That examinations shall be held as often as may bo necessary, such examina- 
tions to be conducted by officers of the college or their duly appointed representa- 
tives, and to be in writing. 
“Tn accordance with these principles a course of collegiate study is offered to 
women arranged under the following groups: 
€1, English language and literature. 
“2, Modern languages and foreign literature. 
“3, Latin language and literature, 
“4, Greek language and literature, 
“5, Mathematics. 
“6, History and political science. 
“7, Physics, chemistry, and hygiene. 
“8, Natural history, geology, palwontology, botany, and zodlogy. 
“9, Moral and intellectual philosophy. 
“ The course shall extend over four years, to be known simply as the first, second, 
third, and fourth. 
“No woman shall be admitted to the course before she shall have attained the age 
of seventeen years, unless in case of extraordinary proficiency, of which the examin- 
ers shall be the judges. 
“A preliminary examination for entrance shall be held annually at such time and — place as shall be agreed upon hereafter. The fee for such preliminary examination 
shall be $5. 
“Every person having passed the entrance examination shall pursue for the first 
and second years the first group, viz, English language and literature, and must in - 
addition select at least one more group. At the end of the first year a now selection 
may be made in place of the group selected at the beginning of that year, and at 
the end of the second year the entire course is elective. 
uns place and manner of pursuing her studies are left to the discretion of each 
student. 
“Examinations shall be held as often as may be necessary; they shall be in writ- 
ing and conducted by professors or officers of the college,to be appointed by the board 
of the college, and at such time and place as may be duly appointed. ‘The fee at 
each examination shall be $5. * * * 
“The degree of bachelor of arts will be conferred on such students as shall have 
pursued during four years’a course of study fully equivalent to that for which the 
same degree is conferred in the school of arts, and shall have passed all the examina- 
tions required. SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION OF WOMEN. cc Gdae

“Any woman who shall have taken the degree of bachelor of arts in the collegiate 
sonia: for women may study for higher degrees under the direction of the faculty of 
the college. ‘ 
“ Women graduates of other colleges in good repute who shall have satisfied the 
faculty of the college that the course of study for which they have reéeived their 
degrees is equivalent to that for which similar degrees are conferred in the collegiate 
course for women, or shall have passed such exarmination as the faculty may prescribe, 
may be admitted to higher degrees on the same terms and conditions as are preseribed 
for the admission of graduates in the collegiate course for women to the same degrees. 
“To students not pursuing the full course required for the degree of bachelor of 
arts, but limiting themselves to one or more courses of inferior range, a certificate of 
proficiency in the subjects pursued will be given on the, satisfactory completion of 
such course or courses of study, to be signed by the president of the college and the 
exainining professor or professors. 
“Special students may be admitted to the collegiate course for women. No en- 
trance examination is required of such students, except such as may be necessary to 
ascertain whether they are qualified to pursue with profit the special coarse for which 
they apply.”

          EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
II.—UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 
In the tabular scheme employed since 1873 in the reports of this Office, the superior 
scholastic institutions for men or for both sexes have been divided into three groups, 
viz, universities and colleges, schools of science, and professional schools, This scheme 
suffices for about two-thirds of the institutions, but is inadequate for the remainder, 
owing to their complex organization and the rapid expansion of what are generally 
termed university features. 
The separate presentation of a few of the more comprehensive foundations was 
madein the Report for 1885-86. This view is extended in the present Report, as will 
be seen by reference to Tables 43 and 44, the former including foundations comprising 
* sroups of related faculties, colleges, or schools” endowed by private funds, and the 
latter, State universities. The details of the separate departments, colleges, etc., of 
these foundations are presented as heretofore in the tables to which they respectively 
pertain, and are included in the corresponding summaries, 
The more thoroughly the general college work of the country is understood, the more 
clearly will be seen the importance of foundations which are destined to become great 
centres of the higher learning. 
Disciplined minds and steady enthusiasm on the part of students; freedom, devo- 
tion, and concentration on the part of professors; libraries; laboratory equipments, 
full and varied as the forms and forces of nature; the inspiring contact of minds rep- 
resenting diverse formative influences; are the essentials of university life and labor. 
The possible number of such seais of learning is limited; they can not exist at all 
excepting in a condition of public intelligence, and of public and of private liberality 
which are, or should be, promoted by the smaller colleges and diffused by their 
agency throughout the land. 2 
It is not pretended that the foundations which have been selected for representa- 
tion in the tables following are all universities, or even that they all bear the prom- 
ise of becoming universities, in the special sense of that much-abused term. It is, 
however, believed that the principle of selection employed is justified by the facts 
and tendencies as known at present. The foundations comprised in Table 43 illus- 
“ trate every source from which the material equipments of the highest order of insti- 
tutions is likely to arise, excepting State or national bounty. All of them have pro- 
gressed far enough to be jndged by their actual work, and nearly all of them have 
achieved more than national distinction. 
The undergradnate work of five of these institutions is carried on in colleges of arts 
and schools of science having their distinct faculties and students; in three, schools 
of science have distinct recognition, although the faculties and students are not re- 
ported separately from those of the college of arts; in the remaining four, the under- 
graduates are classified by the subjects or courses of study pursued. 
Graduate departments, not professional, are reported from ten of the institutions, 
Seyen of the ten report also professional schools, as do the two that do not report a 
graduate department, 
The graduate students include7 per cent. and the professional students 50 per cent, 
of the students of their respective institutions. i 
Ten of the twelve foundations in question report productive fands amounting in the 
aggregate to $24,567,745, which is 34 per cent. of the total productive funds reported 
for all colleges of liberal arts, schools of science, and professional schools. 
The total receipts for the year as reported from ten of the institutions were 
$2,474,463, which sum was made up as follows: income from productive funds, 52 per 
cent.; receipts from tuition fees, 32 per cent.; State appropriations, 1 per cent.; 
other sources, 15 per cent. 
The twenty-four institutions included in Table 44, while differing widely from each 
other in respect to their present development, have this in common—that they are all 
State universities. 
Fourteen of the universities report graduate students, and seventeen report pro- 
fessional students, the number of the former being 2 per cent., and of the latter 35 per 
cent., of the students of their respective institutions, 
With a single exception all the State universities report their productive funds, the 
aggregate amount being $6,881,045. é 
The tutal income reported for twenty-three of the universities is $1,302,042. This 
amount was made up as follows: income from productive funds, 32 per cent.; re- 
ceipts from tuition fees, 11 cent.; from State appropriations, 49 per cent.; from 
other sources, 8 per cent. T'uition fees, it will be seen, form but a small proportion of 
the aggregate income; the deta‘ls show further that in three cases only do they rep- 
resent a comparatively large part of the individual incomes. 
The attendance upon post-graduate courses in the State universities is small as 
compared with the same in the universities included in Table 43. The number of 
graduate students in the latter is 55 per cent. of the entire number of such students 
reported from all colleges and universities.    
    
    
   
-P-A-G-E-657
  UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 657 
As regards professional schools, theology has no representation in the State univer. 
sities, and but four schools, with 272 students, in the universities of Table 43. 
The law schools in Table 44 number 14, with 973 students, and in Table 43, 8, with 
1,262 students. ‘The number of medical schools in Table 44 is 11, with 969 students. 
and in Table 43, 9, with 2,412 students. The remaining professional students are dis. | 
tributed in dental, pharmaceutical, and veterinary schools. : 
The theological students of Table 43 represent 4 per cent. of all such students re- 
ported; the attendance upon law schools in both tables, 70 per cent. of all law stu- 
dents reported; and the attendance upon the medical schools, 28 per cent. of the 
medical students reported for the country at large. 
In the report of funds distinction is not generally made between the several schools 
or departments of universities. So far as that has been done in the case of the uni- 
versities here tabulated, the fact can be ascertained by reference to the detailed 
tables, in which the several departments have separate representation. 
Comparisons of institutions with respect to their material resources are misleading, 
unless all the conditions under which their work is maintained can he taken into 
account. This is true when the institutions considered are in the same country, and- 
doubly so when they are in different countries. At the same time, the knowledge of 
the resources available or which are deemed necessary for the conduct of higher edu- 
cation in any established seat of learning is always helpful to those charged with the 
same responsibility elsewhere. Information of this kind is not readily obtained from 
foreign countries, a circumstance which makes the publication of what is obtained 
all the more desirable. 2 
In connection with the view here presented of university work and resources in the 
United States, the following statement respecting the colleges which are comprised 
in Cambridge University, England, is likely to be suggestive. 
It presents the result of the assessment by the Financial Board of the income of tho several colleges for the purposes of contribution to the Common University Fund. 
The source of the information is the Educational Times! of July 1, 1 : 
The funds which in tho original were given in English currency are I ere converted 
into dollars. ;

2600.0 2 ‘EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
CotrGEs on CoLLEGIATE DEPARTMENTS. 
Table 45 presents the summarized statistics of 361 colleges or collegiate depart- ments. Of these, 248 report distinct preparatory departments with 26,550 students. There are, in addition, 21 colleges known to have preparatory departments, but which have not made separate reports of the same. The total of students in these is 3,507, or less than 9 per cent. of the sum total (viz, 43,474) reported in all collegiate 
departments. 
The value of grounds, buildings, and apparatus is reported from 304 colleges, the amount being $45,948,778; 206 colleges report productive funds to the amount of $44,416,183. Of this sum, $1,136,946 is not included in the reported income from pro- ductive funds, viz, $2,655,081. . On the other hand, a very small proportion of the in- come, viz, $15,500, is realized from funds not stated. 
The comparison of Tables 47 and 48,and the tables of professional schools, vis, 58, 61, and 63, with the one before us, will show that distinction is not always made 
between the funds of separate departments of the same institution. This is true also of State appropriations (Column 20). The larger proportion, however, of both these 
amounts is devoted to the service of the undergraduate work. The number of insti- tutions richly endowed is small; only 29, or about 14 per cent. of thosé reporting the item, have income from funds amounting to $25,000 or upwards. Of this number, 14 
are either State universities or are included in the universities (Table 43), while of the remaining 15 all but 7 comprise one or more professional schools. 
The State appropriations reported for the year amount to $911,124. Of this sum, $678,907 went to State and Territorial universities, and the balance, $232,217, was divided between thirteen colleges. 
The total income reported from 275 colleges was $7,475,200. Of this sum, 36 per cent. was derived from productive funds, 26 per cent. from tuition fees, 12 per cent. 
from State appropriations, and 26 per cent. from all other sources. 
. The numerical strength of the teaching force and the number and classification of 
students are shown in Columns 9-14. As an index of power and resources, these num- 
bers must be relatively considered. In a new country, in a sparsely settled or a poor 
country, a few professors and a small body of eager students may be the sign of high 
purpose and the promise of large results. In any community a college, small as to 
the number of its students, but well equipped as to teachers and material resources, is 
& power which cannot be spared and which cannot be supplied by more imposing 
institutions. 
The full discussion of the statistics in the columns indicated requires a considera- 
tion of details that cannot be attempted here; it may be noted, as indicating the 
lines within which the discussion might be pursued, that 192 of the colleges tabulated 
report less thay 100 collegiate students. Of the remaining 169, there are 145 colleges 
reporting from 100 to 300 students, 20 from 300 to 500, 3 from 500 to 800, and one above 
800. 
Comparisons between colleges with respect to the ratio of professors to students are 
apt to be misleading, since many colleges that report preparatory departments or 
affiliated professional schools have a combined faculty for all. The number of col- 
leges reporting only college work is less than 20 per cent. of the total namber. 
The number of endowed professorships tabulated (Column 11, Table 45) emphasizes 
the need of increased funds for this important purpose. The 421 reported are dis- 
tributed among 96 colleges. As to their yalue, which is the matter of chief impor- 
tance, it is difficult to secure information, although it might naturally be supposed 
that the published statement would be the means of inducing larger contributions 
for this purpose, Some idea of the sum necessary to put the highest order of teach- 
ing service upon a free and secure footing may be gathered from the statement of 
the endowment funds! of Harvard University, for which the Office is indebted to the 
president, Dr. C. W. Eliot. : ‘ : 
At the request of Dr. Edward Mussey Hartwell, associate in physical training, 
Johns Hopkins University, an inquiry as to the provision for physical training was 
included in the form addressed to colleges of arts and sciences. The replies show 
great variety of provision and widely different views as to the purposes and the im- 
portance of the training. 
The colleges and universities reporting a gymnasium for the use of students, or 
military training as a part of their course, or both of these provisions, are presented 
in the following table:* 
  
1See p. 657. : a : ovale University was accidentally omitted. In his report for 1887 President Dwight calls attention 
to the movement for the erection of a new gymnasium.

CLASSIFICATION or UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS, : 
Table 46 presents a comparative view of the undergraduate work of the colleges 
included in this Report. 
. For the country at large, sixty per cent. of college students are in degree courses, 
the remainder being classified in normal, business, partial, and special courses. These 
courses include the majority of students in the South Central and Western Divisions 
of the country, and have the smallest representation in the North Atlantic Division. 
The distribution of students among the degree courses is shown in Columns 4, 5, 6, 
and 7, the last mentioned including students in literary courses leading to the B. L. 
degree, philosophical leading to B. Ph., and civil engineering courses leading to the 
degree of B.S. or of C. E. Of degree courses, the classical shows the largest pro- 
portion of students, whether regard be had to the entire country or to the several 
geographical sections.

  668 ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
In a letter accompanying this statement, Dr. Eliot calls attention to the fact that 
only three of the professorships here mentioned are completely endowed. 
In his report for 1886-87, he notes that the university has received this year gifts 
and bequests to the amount of more than a million of dollars. This includes the Price 
Greenleaf bequest of $630,000, the scholarships and other aid provided for poor stu- 
dents, but which are restricted in their application to undergraduates of the college 
proper. 
ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. 
[Prom letter of Jesse T. Burk, secretary of the University. | 
“The college department comprises a department of arts, one of science, a course of 
philosophy for undergraduates, a course in music, and a department of finance and 
economy. The one faculty governing and teaching this complex body is not all con- 
cerned in the teaching of any one section. Indeed, throughout the university, one 
professor may belong to and teach in several faculties. * * * So also an endowed 
chaiz, of which we have but few, may provide for instruction in several of these 
united departments. * * * I beg to add a few special statements: 
“1, This university receivesno State or municipal aid. Its board of trustees fills its 
own vacancies, and has no other connection with the State than that the Governor 
is ex officio the president. : 
“2. In addition to the fixed scholarships noted in the report on colleges (2 State and 
50 city prizes), there are special grants made of an average of 25 others, privately, at 
the discretion of the board. 
“3, Two commencements are held annually,—Ist, that in May, of the medical and 
dental departments ; 2d, that in June of the college (arts, science, finance, philosophy, 
enere) law, and veterinary departments. Honorary degrees may be conferred at 
either. 
‘The schools of arts, science, philosophy, finances are in fact one for the first two 
years, diverging only on entering third or junior year, hence no separate report can 
be made of income from tuition tees.” 
ORGANIZATION OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 
[From letter of Prof. Charles 8. Venable, chairman of the faculty.) 
“* * * The University of Virginia is a university in the broad sense of the Euro- 
pean universities. 
“The library is undivided and is as a whole for the institution. 
“Neither the law class nor the medicine class have a separate dean, All the students 
of the institution are on the same footing, and many in the academic departments have 
also some of the law school or medicine school, We have no separate college of arts 
or of sciences. Many in scientific departments are also in departments of arts.. All 
of these departments report to one head, the chairman of the faculty. 
“Attendance is required of all students in any and every department, and all are sub- 
ject to daily examination in portion of subject assigned. 
“As requested I send several catalogues and sketches, You see all of the students 
are catalogued together.” 
THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA. 
The material resources of the University of Alabama have been greatly improved 
during the year by the completion of the new university building. ‘The work fitly 
closes a series of efforts that form an interesting chapter in the educational record of 
the last decade. In 1875 the university was placed under the control of a board of 
trustees nominated by the Governor and approved by the Senate of the State. They 
found the university in a prostrate condition and applied themselves to the difficult 
task of restoring its prestige. ‘Their first endeavor was to clear up the accounts and 
place the funds upon a sound basis. This was so successfully accomplished that since 
1876-77 it has been possible to obtain, whenever desired, an accurate knowledge of 
the university finances. Then followed the revision of the rules and regulations af- 
fecting the internal discipline and the conduct of studies. The result is seen in the 
elevated tone of the university life, in the advancement of its scholastic standards 
and its consequent increase in numbers and influence. 3 cs : 
It remained to secure proper housing for the revived institution. The need in this 
respect is indicated by a statement in the report of the trustees for 1831-82. “The 
building now in use,” they say, ‘‘is only the rear portion and a part of the two sides 
of the structure as originally planned, was not constructed or adapted for many of the 
uses to which it is now put, and its use, except as barracks, messroow, and recitation 
rooms, was only a makeshift until the building could be completed.” i 
In their appeals to the General Assembly for the appropriation of a building fund 
the trustees simply sought justice, the State being debtor tothe university for large 
sums on account of the proceads of the sale of the “ university lands.” Such, how-
-P-A-G-E-669
  UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. 669 
ever, was the condition of the State finances that no appropriation for the purpose 
was possible until 1884, in which year $60,000 were allowed. Since that timo the 
work has been steadily pushed to its completion. 
The buildings erected comprise 4 halls, inclosing a quadrangle or court 230 by 250 
feet, from the centre of which a sentinel on duty commands a view of all the rooms. 
Clark Hall, the central building on the south side, which is the front of the quad- 
rangle, is a handsome structure of brick and gray limestone, and is appropriated to 
general academic uses. It is three stories in height, and has a front of 60 feet and a 
depth of 100 feet. The first story contains the library and reading rooms, and the 
chapel. The great public hall of the university occupies the second and third stories, 
This hall will seat with comfort 800 people on the first floor, with accommodations 
for several hundred more in the galleries. An extensive laboratory has also just been 
completed. 
ite organization the University of Alabama comprises two departments, the 
academic and professional. The former consists of eleven schools, the studies of 
which are so arranged as to form four separate and complete courses, as follows: (1) 
The classical course; (2) the scientific course; (3) the civil engineering course; (4) 
the mining engineering course. ; 
“A suitable degree is conferred upon students, who complete the studies in either 
of these courses.” 5 
Military training is a feature of the academic department, which has attracted much 
attention especially since the interstate drill for cadets held at New Orleans in 1885, 
on which occasion the prize was won by the university students. : 
'The law department organized in 1873 embraces: (1) The school of internal and con- 
stitutional law; (2) the school of common and statute law; (3) the school of equity 
jurisprudence. : 
This course may be completed in one scholastic year and leads to the degree of 
bachelor of laws, which entitles the recipient to practice law in all the courts of law 
and equity in this State. ss . : sees ‘ 
Tho progress of the university here outlined is emphasized by the statistics reported 
to this Office. As compared with 1875 the number of professors has increased from 10 
io 15, the number of students from 75 to 212, and the volumes in the library from 4,000 
to 7,115. 
Moreover, the statistics for the years between 1875 and 1886-87 show that the increase 
has been steady during the period. 
CORNELL UNIVERSITY — ORGANIZATION, RECENT BUILDING OPERATIONS. 
[From letter of O. IH. Thurber, secretary of the university, and special documents.) 
“The only division recognized in the university is that according to courses of 
study. This division on broad lines is between general and technical courses. Among 
the latter are included courses in agriculture, mechanical engineering, civil engi- 
neering, architecture, etc. But the students in these various courses are all classified 
together; they have the same instructors so far as they have the same branches of 
study ; they recite in the same classes, they are subject to the same discipline, and arein 
no way separated, except by the fact of the difference in courses. All students in me- 
chanical engineering must take shop work during the whole four years of the course ; 
all agricultural students must take practical work in the field, and so on. There are 
always a considerable number taking this work who are not required to take it.” 
From an analysis of the statistics reported to this Office it appears that the 743 
classified students reported for 1886-87 were distributed among the courses of study as 
follows: 4 per cent. in agriculture; 15 per cent. in civil engineering; 15 per cent in 
mechanical engineering; 8 per cent. in electrical engineering; 6 per cent. in architect- 
ure; 1 per cent, in chemistry; 8 per cent. in science (including 3 students in prepara- 
tory medical); 11 per cent. in letters; 6 per cent. in arts; 8 per cent. in philosophy, 
and 18 per cent. in special or partial courses. 
The chemical and physical building was opened for occupancy in September, 1883, 
The rooms of the physical department occupy the first floor and the basement. The 
second and third floors are occupied by the chemical department. The building con- 
tains, in addition to the amply equipped laboratories, two large lecture rooms. A 
fire-proof one-story annex, built of brick, was erected north of the chemical and phys- 
ical building during the year 1886-87, for the further extension of the work of the 
chemical department. It contains the laboratories of organic chemistry and assay- 
ing, with the necessary balance rooms and store room. 
The unexpectedly large attendance of students at the beginning of the year at 
Sibley College made it immediately apparent that the room would soon be inade- 
quate to the accommodation of the new classes. The director reported that another 
class as large as the one entering in the fall of 1886-87 could not possibly be accom- 
modated. The matter having been brought before Mr. Sibley, he added to his already 
generous gifts to the university a sum sufficient for the building and equipment

of the required extension, The Sibley College extension, now nearly completed, 
is 150 feet long, 40 feet wide, and 2 stories high, The whole upper floor is devoted 
_ to drawing, and the rooms are fitted with improved drawing desks. The lower 
floor is divided by a transverse hall, at the right side of which is a large room in 
which are placed all the testing machines for use in investigating the strength and 
other properties of the materials used in mechanical engineering and construction. 
At the extreme right of the building are a reom for an instructor and for the use of 
students working up their data, and another room for special research. At the left 
of the hall is a group of rooms devoted to tests of engines, steam pumps, and various 
motors, which will be set up permanently, and to the temporary mounting of small 
motors sent in for test. At the extreme west end of this floor are the boiler room and 
a room devoted to calorimetric investigations. 
A noteworthy addition to the material equipment of the university made in the 
course of the year has been the gift by ex-President White of his library of history 
and political science. This remarkable collection of books, brought together as the 
result of very careful study and observation, and consisting of about 30,000 volumes, is 
doubtless, in many respects, the most valuable private historical library ever collected 
in this country. 
WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY—NEEDS OF AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. 
[From letter of E. M. Turner, president.] 
“You will observe from my report in the blank relating to the agricultural depart- 
ment, that we are very weak in that line. The truth is that very little attention is - 
paid to this department by the Legislature, or by the board of regents, owing to the 
following facts: (1) Our people are not a farming people in the sense of tilling, 
though there is marked advance in that department of agricultural work in the re- 
cent past; our principal business is raising stock, horses, sheep, cattle, ete. Experi- 
ments in the feeding and breeding of animals are expensive, and they have never been 
undertaken by the university. (2) We have no college farm, and have never had a 
practical agriculturist connected with the institution, (3) The fund of the university 
arising from the land grant amounts to only about $90,000, which is invested in 
United States bonds. The Legislature appropriates about $20,000 annually for the 
support of the university. 
“Tf the Hatch bill, passed last winter, should be perfected and the scope of it mod- 
. ified so as to include the class of agricultural industry in which our people are mainly 
interested, I have no doubt the Legislature will at its next session provide a suitable 
farm and buildings for an experiment station in connection with the university. I 
may say, in a general way, that educational work, in all departments, in West Vir- 
ginia is in a crude condition owing to the history of our State and its undeveloped 
condition. A large part of the State was the prey of both armies during the War, 
and the cost of building public edifices has been a great tax, as also the inception 
and development of a State system of schools, There has really been nothing left 
for higher educational or technical or industrial education. The State also received 
a very small share of the land grant scrip for agricultural colleges, and what was 
received was very improvidently disposed of by the Legislature. 2 
“Taking all these matters into consideration, I think the State is to be congratu- 
lated on the condition of its educational system. Weare now engaged in trying to 
encourage the establishment of local high schools and academies; so as to give the 
youth of the State the advantages of preparatory training at home, and thus make it 
easier for them to bear the cost of the college course. 
“T trust that these explanations may account for the meagre report I make of our 
agricultural department. Iam very anxious to develop this part of our work, but 
see no prospect of our being able to do so in the present condition of our finances.” 
MrMoraBLe EVENTS OF THE YEAR. 
The year has been made memorable in the history of superior instruction by the 
following events: 
The University of Michigan celebrated the completion of its first half century in 
June, 1887. 
On Wednesday, the 13th of April, 1887, Columbia College commemorated the one 
hundredtb anniversary of the revival and confirmation by the Legislature of the 
State of New York of the royal charter granted in 1754. 
The two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of Harvard College was 
celebrated from the 5th to the 8th of November, 1886. 
As usual the current college catalogues and the reports ef presidents contain valu- 
able information and suggestive discussions relative to superior instruction, Much 
of this material is reserved for use in the treatment of special topics which are being 
investigated inthe Office. This is particularly the case with matter bearing upon 
the development of college courses in English language and literature and the in- 
¢reasing provision for the study of the history and civil polity of our own country—

subjects with reference to which there is great activity in all classes of superiot 
institutions. 
In the present Report extracts from the catalogues have been for the mos$ part 
limited to accounts of the increase in material resources and building operations, 
which have been a noticeable feature of the current record.

CALIFORNIA, ‘ 
University of California—Lick Observatory.—During the year covered by this Report 
great advance has been made toward the completion of the buildings of the Lick Ob- 
servatory. The glass dises for the 36-inch objective, cast by M. Feil, in Paris, and 
figured by Alvan Clark & Sons, have been safely stored at the observatory. If the 
necessary glass for a photographic corrector (36 inches in aperture) can be obtained, 
it is the intention of the Lick trustees to order the same to be made. 
If no unforeseen accident occurs, the observatory will be delivered, completed, to 
the University of California before the close of 1887. 
St. Ignatius College.—The scientific department of St. Ignatius College, San Francisco, 
has attained a high degree of efficiency. It is provided with commodious quarters, 
comprising lecture rooms for physics and chemistry, a chemical laboratory, and an ex- 
tensive cabinet of physics, rooms for qualitative and quantitative analysis, engine- 
rooms, with magneto-electric machines, battery rooms, complete telegraphic stations, 
rooms for preparations, balances, spectroscopic studies, and other scientific experiments 
and investigations, museums of mineralogy, geology, and collections of natural objects 
and curiosities of different kinds, andit is furnished with a very large and choice collec- 
tion of philosophical and chemical apparatus. Among recent additions are a large 
improved electrical machine, and a modern dynamo-electric generator to supply fif- 
teen large arc lights, and above one hundred incandescent lamps, designed to illus- 
‘trate all the most recent improvements in electric lighting, electro-motion, ete. 
The Santa Clara College, at Santa Clara, has a well-equipped scientific department 
and special facilities for practical training, among which is a printing office furnished 
with two steam presses and all the necessary appendages of a complete establish- 
ment for job and book work. . 
COLORADO, 
University of Denver.—During the year steps have been taken towards securing a 
large permanent endowment for this university. Nearly 500 acres of land have been 
obtained on an elevation overlooking the city. Here a town site has been laid out with 
over 2,500 lots, including a large caitipus for the university. One quarter of each block 
in this town is to be retained in perpetuity for the endowment of the institution, 
while the proceeds of the sales of the remainder are to be devoted to other purposes 
in the discretion of the board of trustees. With this plan it is believed that the uni- 
versity has a prospective endowment which will insure its success, : 
CONNECTICUT. 
  Trinity College reports a building in progress to contain a gymnasium and a pub- 
lic hall. It will be ready for occupation before the close of the year. The cost will 
be nearly $35,000, a large part of which was provided by special’ contributions of 
alumni and friends of the college. 
‘Yale University.—The designation Yale University, which was officially authorized 
by the corporation of Yale College soon after President Dwight’s accession, has been 
legalized by an act of the General Assembly of the State, passed in March, 1887. In 
December, 1886, the university suffered a great loss in the sudden death of Mr. Henry 
C. Kingsley, who had served as its treasurer for nearly 25 years. Under his wise and 
prudent management the invested funds had increased from less than seven hundred 
thousand dollars to considerably over two millions. Among the gifts recorded in 
1887 is $100,000 from Hon. Simeon B. Chittenden, of Brooklyn, N. Y., for an enlarge- 
ment of the university library. 
GEORGIA, 
The School of Technology, Emory College, Oxford, Ga., was opened in October, 1884, 
By gifts from friends interested in industrial education, North and South, its facili- » 
ties for practice and instruction have rapidly increased, until at present it represents’ 
in buildings and appliances an investment of $10,000. 
INDIANA. 
DePauw University, Greencastle, Ind., celebrates its semi-centennial during the 
present year, having been chartered January 10, 1837. The progress of the university 
is thus summed up in the catalogue for 1887: “At the beginning it did not own a foot

of land; now its grounds embrace 150 acres. From a small rented building of but 2 
rooms it now has 9 edifices, most of them among the best devoted to the purposes of 
education anywhere. From a faculty of 4 members its present staff of instruction 
comprises 41 professors and teachers, besides occasional lecturers, with libraries, physi- 
cal, chemical, and biological laboratories, and all the appliances of first-class instruc- 
tion. Beginning with 85 students, mostly from the immediate neighborhood, its at- 
tendance now reaches 843, and from nearly all parts of the world.” e 
- Through the liberality of the late Hon. W. C. De Pauw, and the codperation of the 
citizens of Greencastle and of Putnam County, and of the Indiana Methodist Confer- 
ences, a large endowment fund was assured to the university in 1884, and the name 
changed from Indiana Asbury to De Pauw. By means of this endowment, tuition 
has been made free in nearly all departments. 
Lartham College, Richmond, Ind., has received from Mordecai Parry the gift of a 
science hall, now in process of erection. It is to be 35 by 56 feet, and will contain 
large and well-equipped chemical and physical laboratories, a lecture-room, appa- 
ratus room, etc. A new college building is also in process of erection, which will 
greatly increase the capacity of the institution. 
ILLINOIS. 
North-western University, at Evanston, reports the completion of a new memorial 
hall, It contains a large chapel, library, and reading-room, six lecture-rooms, several 
private rooms for professors, and a fire-proof vault for the valuable books and papers. 
It is built of pressed brick, stone, and terra cotta, and is a very beautiful and com- 
modious structure. In the chapel are to be several fine memorial windows. 
Augustana College, at Rock Island, reports a memorial hall now in progress of erec- 
tion. Tho building is under roof, but for want of necessary funds its completion has 
been delayed. It will contain the library, the museum, the apparatus, the conserva- 
tory, the recitation-rooms, and the assembly hall. 
The semicentennial of Knox College, Galesburg, was celebrated June 9, 1887. 
IOWA. 
Cornell College, Mt, Vernon, Iowa, has added a building for the accommodation of 
young women. It provides rooms for about one hundred students. The privileges 
of the dining hall are not confined to those who live in the building. 
Tabor College, Tabor, Iowa, reports a new building containing 17 rooms for offices 
and recitations, together with rooms for the library, art department, etc. The build- 
ing has been erected by the gifts of 245 persons and is finished free of debt.

process of erection for the accommodation of young women. 
KANSAS. 
University of Kansas.—In 1885 the Legislature of Kansas appropriated $50,000 for 
the erection of a building for the department of natural history of the University of 
Kansas. The building was completed and formally dedicated November 16, 1886. Its 
museums are designed to make complete display of the material illustrative of botany, 
zodlogy, and geology, in which the university is particularly rich. The laboratories 
are so related to the cabinets as to secure the utmost convenience. 
Washburn College, Topeka, Kans., reports the completion of two buildings dur- 
ing the year, viz, Boswell Memorial Library, erected at a cost of $20,000, and the 
Hallbrook Hall for young women, at a cost of $10,000. 
The College of Emporia, reports a new college building sufficiently completed to 
be available for use during the present year. It is named Stuart Hall, as a memorial 
of Mrs. Robert Stuart, of New York City, who, bya gift of $10,000, contributed largely 
to its erection. 
LOUISIANA. 
Southern University, the Louisiana State University for the colored people, has just 
secured a special appropriation of $14,000 from the Legislature for the completion of 
the new university building. 
MARYLAND. 
Johns Hopkins University.—In his report for 1886-87 Dr. Gilman, president of Johns 
Hopkins University, gives the following summary of progress during the year: The 
number of teachers has been slightly enlarged; the number of students has consider- 
ably increased; a new department of instruction, pathology, has been initiated; a

has been completed and occupied ; a building has been set apart for the petrographical 
laboratory; an astronomical-observatory for the instruction of students has been 
equipped ; and a new fellowship has been founded by the gift of a generous individual. 
The laboratory is a brick building, with sandstone facings, and its exterior dimen- 
sions aro 117 feet by 714 feet. ‘The cost of the structure, including the land, furni- 
ture, gas-fitting, steam-heating, steam power, and astronomical dome (but not includ- 
ing large amounts previously paid for instruments and apparatus, and not including 
the dynamos nor the telescope), was $174,765.86, 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Boston University reports within the past year the erection of a new hall for the

Williams College.—Dr. Franklin Carter, president of Williams College, in his report 
for 1886 calls attention to the new gymnasium recently completed at a cost of about 
$50,000. The athletic field, the cost of which, including the drainage, has amounted 
to $5,000, came into use in the spring of 1886. 
Clark University.—The corporation of Clark University, Worcester, Mass., was or- 
ganized May 4, 1887. It takes its name from the gentleman through whose liberality 
it has been founded, Mr. Jonas G. Clark, of Hubbardstown, whose gifts for the pur- 
pose are as follows: 
For the general working or construction fund, to be applied to the erection and 
equipment of buildings, $300,000; for a library fund, the income only to be used,

III.—SCHOOLS OF SCIENCE. 
The number of institutions in the United States sharing in the benefit of the land 
grant of 1862 is 48. 
In 13 States the grant was made over to universities or colleges already existing, 
» and hasserved to establish or to augment the funds of courses, departments, or schools 
of applied science in the same. In the 25 remaining States the fund has served as 
the chief source of endowment for new institutions, or as the nucleus around which 
have collected additional funds, in several cases far exceeding the amount derived 
from the national grant. In 6 States the grant has been divided. In Georgia it has 
been applied to the endowment of 6 colleges of agriculture affiliated to the State 
University ; in Massachusetts separate colleges, one of agriculture, the other of the 
mechanic arts, have been the recipients; in Missouri a portion of the grant has been 
applied to the endowment of an “agricultural and mechanical college” and the rest 
to the endowment of a ‘‘school of mines and metallurgy,” both under the auspices of 
the University of Missouri; in Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia the fund 
has been divided between institutions for white and colored students, respectively. 
Certain of the schools have developed particularly in the direction of the mechani- 
cal arts; others are agricultural colleges, pure and simple; a few combine both de- 
partments, with large provision for theoretic instruction, while some differ in no 
essential particular from the ordinary classical college. 
Under ‘these circumstances it is difficult, and as time passes it must become more 
and more difficult, to group in a single table institutions which have shared in this 
national benefaction. In the present Report, 33 of these institutions are included to-- 
gether in Table 51. The statistics of the remaining 15 are included in Table 47. For 
convenience of reference, a list of these is appended to the table before us. 
As in the case of the older classical colleges, the characteristic work of the “col- 
Jeges of agriculture and the mechanic arts” has been organized in degree courses. 
Where the requirements for admission to these are above the attainments of the prob- 
able applicants, preparatory departments have been established, whereby the purposs 
of keeping the colleges in line with the common schools of the country is accom- 
plished. ‘The distinction between the preparatory students and those of collegiate 
grade is even less marked than in the classical colleges, since all classes participate 
in the provision for technical and industrial training. 
Of the 33 colleges here tabulated 19 report preparatory departments having 2,166 
students, the number of students in collegiate departments is 5,910, and the number 
of graduate students 157, making a sum total of 8,233 students.

  SCHOOLS OF SCIENCE. 107 
The value of grounds, buildings, and apparatus as reported from 24 colleges is 
$6,707,799. The amount of productive funds reported from 26 colleges is $10,169,308 ; 
one more college is included in the reported incomo from productive funds, viz, 
563,204. 
From the statement of funds it would seem that these colleges show a higher aver- 
age of endowment than any other class of institutions save theological schools. Omit- 
ting Cornell University, which is one of the five richest foundations in the United 
States, it appears that 5 of the institutions in Table 51 have productive funds ex- 
ceeding $400,000; 3 have from $300,000 to $400,000; 4 from $200,000 to $300,000; 
and 8 from $100,000 to $200,000. The remaining 5 which report the particular have 
funds ranging from $10,000 to $98,575, the aggiegate for the 5 being $275,575. 
The total income is $1,207,516 reported for 30 colleges. Of this amount 47 per cent. 
was derived from productive funds, 33 per cent. from State appropriations, 17 per 
cent. from tuition fees, and 3 per cent. from other sources. 
The year has been made memorable in the history of the colleges under considera- 
tion by the passage of an act, approved March 2, 1887, ‘‘to establish agricultural ex- 
periment stations in connection with the colleges established in the several States 
under the provisions of an act approved July 2, 1862, and of the acts supplementary 
thereto.” Under the provisions of this act an annual appropriation of $15,000 will 
be made to each State for the purpose therein specified. 
The following are the colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts that report 
themselves as sustaining relations to State agricultural stations: 
Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama. 
Colorado State Agricultural College. ‘ 
Sheffield Scientific School (Yale University). 
University of Florida and State Agricultural College.

View or PracticaL Work aS REPORTED FROM TWENTY-FIVE COLLEGES. 
Table 49 presents the result of an inquiry addressed to the land grant colleges for 
the purpose of ascertaining the proportion of their students who receive practical as 
well as theoretic training in agriculture, the mechanic arts, etc. 
The questions included such practical work in the field or shops as serves to illus- 
trate or to test the theoretic instruction or to familiarize one with a routine of labor, 
and also investigations carried on in laboratories or elsewhere in pursuit of scientific 
knowledge applicable to the arts. 
From the number and varied character of the colleges addressed it could not be 
expected that a single form of inquiry would suffice for an exhaustive presentation of 
this part of their training. But a beginning has been made with results which are 
not devoid of interest. 
Two of the colleges here included report only field and laboratory practice. Del- 
aware College and many land grant agricultural colleges report only laboratory 
practice. 
In the remaining colleges, which reported shop practice also, the courses of train- 
ing are generally identical, or nearly so, for one or more years, so that whatever may 
be the final selection, students work in two or more of the lines indicated, and henco 
the ratios tabulated involve reduplications—in other words, their sum is not 100 per 
cent, A number of the colleges afford opportunity for remunerative work, of which 
students, without regard to courses, often avail themselves. It has not been possi- 
ble so far, even if it were desirable, to discriminate betwe en the work pursued con- 
sidered as to its purposes, which for convenience may be called illustration, in- 
vestigation, remuneration. 
At the request of the Hon. Justin §. Morrill, the following inquiry was embodied 
in the form addressed to the colleges under consideration: ‘‘-What is the full amount 
given by individuals, towns, counties, or States, either as an outright donation or as 
an annual appropriation on the part of the Legislatures, to the land grant colleges 
established under the act of 1862?” The information thus secured, supplemented by 
statistics previously furnished to the Office, is presented in Table 50.

EQUIPMENT OF AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGES. 
The Special Report on Industrial Education in the United States, issued by this 
Office in 1883, contains a full report on the equipment of agricultural and mechanical 
colleges to that date, In order to ascertain the improvements in the farms, build- 
ings, apparatus, etc, made since that year, an inquiry was addressed to the college 
presidents asking for further information on the subject. Some of the colleges re- 
ported fully. In the case of those not answering the inquiry the catalogues were 
consulted for the particulars desired. The follo wing is a summary of the information 
furnished directly by the presidents or gathered from the printed documents: 
ALABAMA STATE AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL COLLEGE. 
[From letter of Prof. O.D. Smith, secretary of faculty.] 
The Agricultural and Mechanical College, Auburn, was organized in 1872. The en- 
dowment derived from the sale of the land scrip is $253,500, yielding an annual in- 
come of $20,280. The college had no other ome, except incidental fees, and re- 
ceived no aid from the State until the year Il That year the State Legislature 
appropriated $30,000 to repair and furnish th®’college building and equip the agri- 
cultural, mechanical, and scientific departments. An annual apropriation was also 
made of one-third the net proceeds of the tax on commercial fertilizers, for the estab- 
lishment and support of an experiment station and a mechanic art laboratory. In 
1887 an additional appropriation of $12,500 was made for further equipment of the 
mechanical and scientific departments. 
June 24, 1887, the main college building was burned. The trustees immediately 
provided for rebuilding it and for the erection of a chemical laboratory. ‘The latter 
is about complete, and the main building will be completed during the next scholas- 
tic year. 
In the endeavor to carry out the provisions of the land grant act, the college has 
become a distinctive school of industrial science or polytechnic institute. It offers 
three degree courses for undergraduates leading to the degree of bachelor of science 
(B. Se.), requiring four years for their completion: (1) Course in chemistry and agri- 
culture; (2) course in mechanics and engineering; (3) general course. There are 
also two partial courses, each requiring two years for their completion: (1) agricult- 
ure; (2) mechanics. Laboratory instruction constitutes an important feature in the 
work of the college, and is obligatory for all students. 2 
The facilities for this are as follows: In agriculture, a farm of 226 acres, on which is 
the State experiment station. The students of agriculture accompany the professor | 
in the field, garden, conservatory, stock yard, where lectures are delivered in pres- 
ence of the object discussed. The mechanic-art laboratory consists of two shops: 
the first, 90 by 50, contains the wood and the machine shop; the second, 72 by 36, 
the forge and foundry, all fully equipped. 
The power for running the machinery of this department is furnished by a twenty- 
five horse power Harris-Corliss engine. A steam pump, heater, and indicator form a 
part of the steam apparatus. The course in shop work extends through three years: 
first year, carpentry, turning, and pattern making; second year, moulding and cast- 
ing in iron and brass, forge work in iron and steel; third year, machine work and 
steam and mill engineering. All students are required to take the first year’s work 
in the shop at least 6 hours per week. Special students take 12 hours per week 
throughout the entire three years,

  712 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
The chemical laboratory is a separate two story building, 60 by 43, with a one story 
annex, 57 by 36. The cost, including furnishings, was about $20,000. It contains the 
students’ laboratory to accommodate 60 students in analytical work, the State chemi- 
eal laboratory, two balance rooms, an office, library, apparatus room, and a large lect- 
ureroom. The engineering department is fully equipped for field and office work. 
The departments of physics and natural history will be provided with laboratories 
in the new college building, and offices and equipment for printing and telegraphy. 
All students are required to take technical drawing for two years. 
The experiment station has been organized in accordance with act of Congress, with 
the following corps of directors: (1) president of the college; (2) agriculturist and 
director ; (3) chemist and vice-director; (4) physiologist, animal and vegetable; (5) 
botanist ; (6) entomologist and meteorologist; (7) first and second assistant agricultu- 
ralists ; (8) first and second assistant chemists. Work will begin at once on the station. 
Notwithstanding the fire the college has maintained its patronage, and is growing 
in public favor.

priated $9,000 for the erection of a new laboratory and a barn. The former, which is 
nearly completed, is a one-story building, with attic for storage. It is 35 feet wide 
and 64 feet long, and very complete in its arrangement. The entire cost will be 
$7,000. The appropriation for the barn is $3,000. It will be a plain, substantial struc- 
ture, 40 by 80 fect. 
DAKOTA, 
The Agricultural College, at Brookings, provides 2 courses of study, viz, a course 
in agriculture for young men, and a course in domestic economy for young women. 
‘These courses include the usual literary and scientific studies that lead to the bachelor 
of science degree. In addition, one industrial study or occupation is required each 
term. The college has just come into possession of a half-section of improved land, 
which, with the 80 acres given by the people of Brookings, constitutes a tract of 400 
acres for college campus and practical farming. The college buildings are three in 
number, viz, college hall, which contains finely equipped Jaboratories for experi- 
mental purposes; the ladies’ dormitory, and the gentlemen’s dormitory. Finely 
equipped shops for wood and metal work have been provided. 
The Dakota School of Mines, at Rapid City, was opened February 17, 1887, for a special 
course in assaying, etc. Four professorships were established, and a number of stu- 
dents presented themselves and were in attendance until the close of the term. ‘The 
school has established three full courses of study, viz, mining engineering, civil en- 
gineering, and a general scientific course. The school of mines building proper is a 
commodious brick structure, 3 stories in height. The laboratory building is 2 stories 
in height, and is 138 by 60 feet. Itis not attached to the college building proper, 
but stands 200 feet distant from it. 
INDIANA. 
Rose Polytechnic Institute, at Terre Haute, offers 3 courses of study, viz, mechanical 
engineering, civil engineering, and chemistry. A course in electrical engineering 
will soon be added. This, like the other courses of this richly endowed institution, 
will be placed upon an excellent footing as regards professors and material equip-

ment. The shops for practical work comprise a wood shop, a machine shop, a forge 
room, a brass foundry, an engine and boiler room, and an engineering laboratory. The 
academic building is a brick structure, 4 stories high. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
The Lawrence Scientific School of Harvard University, at Cambridge, offers 4 courses 
of instruction, viz, a course in civil and topographical engineering, a course in chem- 
istry, a course in natural history, and a course in mathematics and physics. The 
celebration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of Harvard College led to the 
first reunion of the graduates of this school which has ever been held, and at this 
meeting the future of the school was most earnestly considered. ‘Three plans were 
suggested. In his report for the current year, the dean, W. S. Chaplin, expresses his 
preference for that of concentrating the work of the school on the one subject of en- 
ineering. 
5 Bussey Institution of Harvard University, at Jamaica Plain, gives systematic instruc- 
tion in agriculture, useful and ornamental gardening, and stock-raising. The farm 
belonging to the institution and upon which the school buildings are situated com- 
prises 200 acres.

following departments, viz, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry, 
physics, and drawing. The capacity of the shop has recently been nearly doubled by 
a gift of $13,600. The shop contains an engine and boiler room, blacksmith shop, tool 
room, draughting room, painting and finishing room, work rooms equipped with tools 
and machinery, and other auxiliary rooms. 
MICHIGAN. 
The State Mining School, at Houghton, was first opened for instruction on Septem- 
ber 15, 1886, with 3 professors and 24 students. The conrse of study embraces 
geology, mineralogy, chemistry, mining and mining engineering, and such other 
pranches of practical and theoretical knowledge as will conduce to the énd of 
enabling the students of this institution to obtain a fall knowledge of the science, 
art, and practice of mining, and the application of machinery thereto. Tuition is 
free to all bona fide residents of the State. y 
MISSISSIPPI, 
The Industrial Institute and College for Women, at Columbus, was opened October 
92, 1885. The design of the institution is threefold: (1) To confer a thorough gen- 
eral education. (2) To give the best normal training, together with teaching and 
practice in kindergarten. (3) To train pupils in the various industrial arts. The 
buildings occupied by this institution were donated by the city of Columbus to the 
State, and have been repaired and improved so as to conform to the uses for which 
they are intended. 
MISSOURI. 
The Polytechnic School of Washington University, at Saint Louis, offers 4 courses 
of study extending through 5 years. They are, a course in civil engineering. in 
dynamic engineering, in chemistry, and in mining and metallurgy. During the year 
under consideration, a metallurgical mill has been erected in connection with the de- 
partment of mining and metallurgy for the sampling of ores and mineral substances, 
the testing of ores, etc., ona commercial scale. The mill is equipped with a complete 
set of machinery. The university is supplied with finely equipped laboratories for 
the study of physics and chemistry. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE.

engineering, mathematics and astronomy, physics, and chemistry." The Case School 
building, to which the school was transferred in September, 1885, was burned on 
October 27, 1886. The trustees and faculty of Adelbert College generously offered 
rooms and appliances for carrying on the work of the school, and recitations were 
resumed on the following Monday, work having been suspended but 3 days. The 
rebuilding of the burnt structure was begun at once, and a temporary laboratory was 
erected for immediate use. Instruments and apparatus were procured for the class- 
rooms and laboratories, and the work of the classes proceeded with comparatively 
little interruption.

such attendance bore to the population at those dates. 
The populations have been estimated from the data furnished by the United States 
census of 1870 and 1880, and the statistics showing attendance, as specified, from the 
reports of this Office. Students in preparatory courses or departments have not been 
included. 
Considering the institutions involved in the discussion, it will be seen that there 
was a decrease of 9 in the number of colleges reporting attendance in 1885-86 as 
compared with the number in 1875-76, and an_ increase of 10 in the number of scien- 
* tific schools. The attendance upon the smaller number of colleges in 1885-86 ex- 
ceeded the attendance in 1875-76 by 7,072, or 27 per cent. ; the attendance upon both 
colleges and scientific schools increased by 8,950, or 28 per cent. ; whilst the increase 
in the estimated population was 11,355,972, or 25 per cent. 
The comparative view of the relation of students to population for the years selected 
is presented by States and by geographical sections in Columns 12, 13, 14, and 15 of 
the table before us. The statistics, as tabulated, show increase in the number of 
students as compared with the population for colleges alone and for both colleges and. 
scientific schools in the North Atlantic and North Central Divisions of the country, 
_ and decrease in the three remaining sections. 
Many considerations are suggested by this view; the most important pertains to 
the statistics themselves. Do they fairly represent the’ situation? If they do not, 
the failure is attributable to the want of accuracy in the returns made to the Office, 
orto the failure of institutions to make any returns, 
With respect to the first-named source of passible error, it can only be said that an 
examination of the returns for the years intermediate between 1875 and 1886 confirms 
the statistics reported for those years. 
With respect to the second source of error, it is evident that a number of colleges 
reporting at the earlier date failed to do so at the later date. Some of these have 
suspended operations; others, finding it impossible to maintain the college standard, 
haye assumed the work of secondary schools; a few have not furnished recent infor- 
mation. While the number of these last is not large, their omission is to be regretted 
in an inquiry of this kind. 
As regards the country at large the conclusions here established must be approxi- 
mately correct. If any State or section is misrepresented it is hoped that the addi- 
tional data required to do justice to the same will be immediately forthcoming. In- 
deed, one great purpose of the inquiry, carried so far as the material at hand permits, 
will have been served if this illustration of its importance in settling questions of 
public moment shall induce greater care and promptness in replying on the part of 
those by whom the facts must be supplied. . 
In considering the relative status of the geographical sections of the country, as 
Shown in Columns 12, 18, 14, 15, it should be remembered that the two Southern sec- 
tions have a large colored population which is scarely represented in college attend- 
ance. Comparison between the ratios here given and those published in De Bow’s 
Review as early as 1857 will naturally occur to many minds. 
The latter estimates wore for 29 States, considering the white population only. The 
conclusions established by De Bow’s figures are placed in comparison with the fore- 
going in the following summary, the same States being included in both sets of ratios :

EDUGATION REPORT, 1886-87, 
In the Report of the Bureau for 1885-86 attention was called to the fact that the faculty of Harvard had laid before the Academic Council a plan for the abridgment of the college course by those students who go from college directly into one of the professional schools of the university. The subject was made a special order for the December meeting of the Academic Council; and, in consequence of the discussion 
which then took place, a committee of nine persons was appointed to consider the whole question of the relation of the degree of A. B. to the other degrees conferred by the university. That committee made their report to the Academic Council at the close of the year 1886-87; and the Academic Council have now recommended to the college faculty that, inthe interest both of the professional schools and of the graduate department, some reduction be made in the requirements for the degree of A. B.

: ne EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
ST, VINCENT’S SEMINARY, GERMANTOWN, PA. 
‘The following account of St. Vincent’s Seminary, Germantown, Pa., is furnished by 
the president, Rev. James McGill. It illustrates the character of a number of semi- 
naries in the United States which combine collegiate and professional instruction in 
such a manner as to make it difficult to give them exact representation in the tables, 
The seminary, as such, holds no real estate nor funds. It is supported by an asso- 
ciation of Catholic clergymen for the purpose of giving a select number of young men 
an opportunity to pursue a course of study in literature, higher mathematics, modern 
languages, philosophy, and theology. For admission an examination is required 
which would entitle the applicant in any well-conducted college to the A. B. degree. 
The course of study embraces a period of eight years; each scholastic year consists 
of forty weeks. 
The entire number of students for the scholastic year 1886-87 was 25; and the 
classification—9 in theology, 6 in philosophy, and 10 in the two years’ preparatory 
course, which consists of an exhaustive review of previous studies in English, Latin, 
Greek, French, German, and mathematics. The study of highor mathematics may be 
continued during the two years’ course of philosophy, and, if the needs of the student 
demand it, during the first and second years of the theology course. All the students 
are required to follow both the classical and scientific courses, The language of the 
class during the last 6 years of the course is Latin. 
The library contains from 11,000 to 12,000 volumes. The institution has never re- 
ceived any State or municipal appropriation of any kind. Tuition is free for all who 
pass the examination for admission. The professors number 6. 
PROGRESS DURING THE DECADE. 
As in the case of similar tables, the comparative statistics of schools of theology 
from 1877 to 1887, inclusive, simply show the relative numbers reporting to the Office 
in the successive years. 
The details as recorded during the period indicated show further the degree of per- 
manency in institutions, and the positive increase in their numbers. 
From a comparison of the detailed statistics of 1877 with those of the current year, 
it appears that of 124 schools tabulated at the earlier date, 91, or 73 per cent., are 
still found in the table. 
‘Ten of the remaining 33 have ceased to exist, and 23 have made no recent report. 
Thirty-two schools which were in existence prior to 1877, but did not report at that 
date, are now reporting. Of the remaining 22 schools found in the table for 1886-87, 
4 had just begun operations in 1877 and 18 have been opened since. 
Of the 91 schools which reported in 1877 and in 1886-87, 12 failed at one of the dates 
to report the particulars required for comparative study; the remaining 79 show in- 
erease during the decade of 31 per cent. in the number of instructors; 30 per cent, 
in the number of students; 53 per cent. in the number of volumes in libraries; 65 
per cent. in property valuation; and 42 per cent. in productive funds, 
The 91 schools whose permanence and vigor are attested by the statistical record 
have been the recipients of liberal and repeated benefactions. So far as reported to 
this Office, the total of,money gifts and legacies to schools of theology during the 
ten years under review was $6,697,210. Of this amount 91 per cent. went to the 
schools in question. 
The present relative importance of the same schools may be judged from the fact 
that they include 73 per cent. of the instructors and 73 per cent. of the students re- 
ported from schools of: uheology. Forty-two of the number report their productive 
funds, the total amount being 93 per cent. of the total productive funds in the table. 
The 22 schools whose operations are limited to the ten years under review include 
10 per cent. of the instructors and 10 per cent. of the students in the table. 
From this analysis it is evident that the schools which have reported irregularly 
represent but a small part of the entire provision for theological instruction, and do 
not greatly affect the general bearing of the statistical record. 
THEOLOGICAL SCHOOLS ORGANIZED SINCE 1876. 
Table 59 shows the relative position of the various religious denominations in re- 
spect to the number of schools which they maintain, and the number of students 
attracted to them. 
The 22 schools organized during the decade are distributed among twelve denom- 
inations. The Baptist, Lutheran, and Methodist Episcopal Churches have contrib- 
uted 4schoolseach. “ . 
The first named include 23 per cent. of the instructors and 23 per cent, of the stu- 
dents reported from the new schools; the second, 14 per cent. and 19 per cent., 
respectively; the third, 14 per cent. and 16 per cent., respectively. The financial

resources of the new schools are not fully given, only 15 of the 22 reporting even 
their property valuation. Of the entire amount, viz, $434,000, 31 per cent. is owned 
by the four Baptist schools, 20 per cent. by three of the four Lutheran schools, 22 per 
» cent. by three of the Methodist Episcopal schools, and 23 per cent. by one school 
under the auspices of the Protestant EpiscopalChurch. Productive funds are reported 
fiom seven only of the new schools. In these, as in all theological schools whose 
invested funds are small, special contributions from churches and individuals form a 
;o part of the income, tuition fees being low, and in many cases remitted vitirely. 
ix of the 22 schools established since 1876 are for the education of colored students. 
Oue of the most important of these is the Gammon School of Theology at Atlanta, 
Ga., which was organized in 1883 as a department of Clark University, Beginning 
with an attendance of 2 students, it closed its first year with 19, and has steadily 
increased in numbers year by year, reaching in the current year a total of 57. 
Among the favoring conditions attending the origin of the school, not the least was 
the gift of twenty thousand dollars by Rey. E. H. Gammon, of Batavia, Il. The 
growth of the institution, and the rapid extension of its field of influence, with the 
corresponding demand for enlarged facilities, have prompted him recently to propose 
a munificent addition to the endowment, which will establish the school on a firm and 
permanent basis. The only condition imposed by Mr. Gammon, in unfolding his plan, 
was that the school should be made an institution of a purely theological character, 
entirely independent of any other institution in its organization and government. In 
accordance with his views, the official connection of the school with Clark Universit y 
was dissolved in April, 1887, and it was placed on an independent basis,

I. MANUAL TRAINING AND INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENTS. 
IN THE PuBLic SCHOOLS. 
The introduction of manual training as a public school study may be said to be 
yet in the experimental stage, rendering an exposition of its condition less com- 
plete and more difficult than an account of the more thoroughly organized branches 
* of the system of public schools. The recent addition of the study, however, invites 
inquiry as to the objects to be attained by its introduction, the methods of accom- 
plishing them, the cost entailed, and the results; while the agitation against the 
so-claimed overloaded curriculum of the upper grades of the public schools ealls for 
an examination of the manner of interpolating a study new in a twofold sense into 
that curriculum. The reports of the city superintendents and other school officials 
have therefore been examined with reference to these heads of inquiry; for no better 
testimony, it is thought, could be obtained than that of the agents of the people at 
whose expense the new study has been introduced and is supported. 
- Purpose.—In Portland, Me., the superintendent of the city schools was encouraged 
by a petition signed “by all to whom it was presented,” to ask the city council for a 
grant of $1,500 to establish a manual training school, because ‘the belief is gaining 
ground in our own country, as well as in other countries, that youth should be edu- 
cated in the use of the tools of industry as well as in books ; and in other cities it has 
been found by trial that this can be done during school life without impeding other 
studies.” Considerations of a fiscal nature sent the matter over for a year. The school 
committee of Springfield, Mass., say: ‘‘ It has been and will continue to be the aim 
of the committee to bring the course of study in the schools into harmony with the 
best and most practical educational methods known, in order that the analytical, 
-reasoning, and constructive powers of the scholars may be developed, that they may 
become Eemiliar with practical things and leave school * * * equipped with 
knowledge * * * that will be useful to them in whatever honest occupation they 
may follow. As nearly 95 per cent. of the scholars who go out from the schools will 
from necessity become engaged in some kind of manual labor, it is important that 
manual training should have an established place in our school system.” In New 
Haven, Conn., it is considered “as a protest against the teaching of mere words, and 
makes its eloquent appeal for recognition on the ground that it supplies an element 
in education that has been almost entirely lacking.” 
In his report for 1885-86, the superintendent of the Newburg, N. Y., schools, after 
remarking ‘that drawing gives the qualifications of a good mechanic except the 
practice,” continues: “These views have long been held by the board of education of 
the city of Newburg, and in order more fully to carry out the ideas involved therein, 
this board has established a manual training school for the more perfect and symmetri- 
cal development of the hand and eye. A most weighty and practical reason for this 
is that by far the greater number of pupils must after leaving school get their living 
and employment by the use of their hands and eyes. * * * Primarily, the aim of 
the manual training school is to train the hands of the pupils, to give them the power 
of doing.”

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 183 
In their matter-of-fact and otherwise very valuable report on manual training 
in the common schools, the committee on course of study and school books of the 
poard of education, New York City, after noting that‘the leading purpose of manual 
instruction in Europe “is to foster industrial skill,” and ‘‘only incidental refer- 
ence ig had in most cases to its general educational, disciplinary, and intellectual 
relations,” that ‘it has long been a matter of deep regret, and.even of apprehension, 
that a large proportion of our young people are growing up with a positive distaste 
for manual labor ;” that the introduction of manual training ‘into many of the 
schools and higher educational institutions of the country, lias already begun to exert 
an influence towards bringing about a better state of things;” and thata wide gap exists 
“between the kindergarten and the high school,” arrived at this, the first of several 
conclusions: ‘‘ That the introduction of what is generally known as manual training 
would be an improvement to our present course of study.” ‘Instruction in draw- 
ing,” they continue, “and the introduction of object-teaching have proved of the great- 
est advantage, and lead directly and naturally to those subjects and methods now 
under discussion ;” and “it has come to be generally recognized as true that a certain 
amount of work, some application of mental power through the bodily powers, some 
production of physical results of thought and intention, implying the training of the 
senses, especially through the hand and the eye, are needed to produce @ well-trained 
mind.” 
At Minneapolis, Minn., ‘‘ An important reason for introducing industrial training 
into the public schools is found in the wide-spread distaste for manual labor. Serious 
apprehensions may well be aroused in view of the large number of youth growing up 
to manhood, not only without a handicraft, but even disdaining such an occupation,” 
and “One of the practical benefits which may be expected from the introduction of 
manual training into the schools is the furnishing of superior foremen and superin- 
tendents for our various industries. The apprentice system is a thing of the past. 
* * * Jn no way can men be more successiully fitted for these responsible positions, 
than by combining with a thorough intellectual discipline, early familiarity with the 
principles of mechanics and the use of tools.” In the course of his comments on the 
recent introduction of manual training in the schools of St. Paul, Minn., the saper- 
intendent remarks: ‘‘'The codrdination of mental and manual training to its practical 
limit in our public schools, will foster an industrial spirit and bring to the surface, 
not intellectual strength but a genius adapted to this kind of education. That there 
is in our schools a large amount of undeveloped skill will surely be seen as soon as an 
opportunity is given, and which has heretofore been clearly demonstrated in the work 
which has already been done under the general subject of drawing.” The object at 
Omaha, Nebr., among the first to introduce manual training, is not to teach “ but to 
prepare the students for greater proficiency in a trade should they conclude to become 
mechanics.” 
Location, equipment, and course of training.—In four cifies the school is located in 
the high-school building of the system, in three other cities it is situated in buildings 
of other grades. In Boston the present quarters are too small for proper instruction 
in carpentry, and on the vacation of the building now occupied by the Horace Mann 
School for the Deaf, the committee on manual training will ask for it. The course of 
instruction is invariably in wood-working—carpentry—given, as at Springfield, Mass., 
in 15 lessons of 45 problems, or, as at Mont Clair, N. J., in 40 graded Jessons.. In sey- 
eral instances the instruction is under the care of graduates of manual training 
schools, in others under askilled mechanic who has had some experience in teaching. 
The equipment is almost invariably for about 10 or 20 students, and consists of car- 
penters’ benches and the necessary tools. Itis understood that the course of instruc- 
tion is of 1 year, with the exception of Mont Clair where it is of 3. 
drdination with the other studies of the system.—Five of the seven school systems 
giving information on the subject have schools to which the students come especially . 
to receive this instruction, not of course including the pupils attending schools oc- 
cupying rooms in the same building in which the manual training school is located, 
One exception is the Minneapolis course, the manual training apparently being con- 
fined to the high school pupils, which perhaps would throw it into the category of 
manual training schools (see page 791). The classes, either 10 or 12 or 20, usually 
receive one lesson a week, generally occupying the half of a school day; at Omaha 
and Minneapolis instruction is given for over an hour daily, and at Mont Clair for the 
second and third grades for an hoursemiweekly. The pupils are drawn from the high 
school or the upper grades of the grammar schools or both, except at Mont Clair, 
where the pupils of the high school and highest grammar grade are excluded. 
Cost.—Dhis isa very difficult question to disenss. The word “equipment” may in- 
clude many things at one place not included by it at another, vitiating results as to per 
t. Nor is this the only obstacle. In a public school the pupil or his fieti- 
tious representative “in average attendance ” oceupies the same desk every day of the 
school year ; in these schools for manual training, only an hour or two every week, and 
then gives place to another. In Boston, for instance, the total cost for the first year 
for 200 pupils was $2,500, a per capita cost of $12.50 each, but as they were divided   
       
-P-A-G-E-784

784 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
jnto classes of 20, receiving a lesson a week, covering a half a day, the weekly at- 
tendance of 200 under such circumstances is merely equivalent to the attendance of 
20 pupils for 5 full days; thus the per capita cost viewed in this light would be $125. 
The cost for the last school year was $7.50. It may be said that the cost of man- 
ual training as a part of the public school system should be dealt with as if it were 
: a question as to the cost of grammar or geography. But, even ignoring the fact 
that the cost of the apartment in which manual instruction is given—and to which 
instruction it is wholly devoted—is not included as a part of the cost, it would be 
manifestly wrong to compare the per capita cost of a course in manual training in 
which a lesson of an hour is given daily to the same class, with the per capita cost of 
instructing the same class for half a school day oncea week. At Springfield, Mass., the 
equipment cost $503, or $42 per capita (8 classes of twelve each, instructed once weekly), 
andthe running expenses $3.03, based on total number instructed. At Omaha the equip- 
ment cost $2,129, and the expenses of running about $18 a pupil, based on average 
attendance. At Mont Clair the expenses for equipment were $350, those for 1886-87 
$1,000. The New York committee, in their report already referred to, compute that an 
outfit for a workshop will cost $300, and running expenses, exclusive of teachers’ sala- 
ries, $80, to which must be added the cost of constructing or preparing a workroom, 
computed at $100. 
Results.—After giving some statistics of attendance in Boston, the superintendents 
will again be allowed to speak for themselves. 
Of the 200 boys that began the course in the Boston school for the last school year, 
49 dropped out, 33, or 17 per cent. of the whole number, from obtaining employment, 
2 from dullness in their regular studies, and 4 were expelled for insubordination. In 
Springfield, Mass., the school committee ask for an appropriation of $5,000 to extend 
the scope of the school ‘‘in view of the encouraging results of the experiment,” and 
“it is the testimony of the principals of the high school and grammar schools that the 
time given to manual training has not retarded the pupils in their regular studies.” In 
Mont Clair, N. J., the ‘‘ boys show great diversity of talent, some becoming in a little 
time quite expert in tool handling, while others find it much more difficult.” In New 
Haven, Conn., ‘‘some boys were heedless and seemed to lack the power of close at- 
tention and nice execution. The inability of some to use their hands at first and 
the decided gain in manual power exhibited after a few weeks of practice, furnish 
strong arguments in favor of such training.” 
In Newburg, N. Y., it is too soon to speak of results, but “the boys take to the 
work with enthusiasm, and many of them show unmistakable signs of becoming ex- 
pert in the use of tools.” The introduction of steam power is advised, and the inten- 
tion to increase the equipment noted. 
In Minneapolis, Minn., the principal of the high school remarks: ‘So far as can 
be judged from the work of the past term, the school is a success, and will continue to 
be more and more useful as experience shows better methods of management. This 
course seems to attract and hold boys who would at this stage of their work drop out 
of school if such course was not provided.” 
In Omaha, Nebr., the committee on manual training says: ‘‘We can not emphasize 
too strongly the value of this system, which we believe in time will come into gen- 
eral use.” ‘On the whole,” says the superintendent, “‘ our experiment with a manual 
training department in our high school, as far as it has gone, must be considered a 
success. It has not interfered with the regular academic work, * * * and the 
progress of the boys in the mechanic arts has been satisfactory.” 
Industrial training for girls.—The courses of industrial training for girls are as yet 
sewing and cooking. Witb the thorough introduction of “construction” work, as 
contemplated at New York and Washington, D. C., for instance, the girls will re- 
ceive instruction in the general principles governing the combination of elements 
into a harmonious whole, as well as in the specific duties of two branches of industry 
both eminently adapted to their sphere in domestic life, and also immediately useful. 
Sewing would appear to be excellently titted for introduction into the school course, 
since from its nature the students are not required to leave the class-room while under 
instruction ; and although the superintendents of the evening schools of Brooklyn, 
N. Y., advocate the congregation of those who desire instruction into a class, their 
recommendation is based on the complaint of individual scholars of the evening schools 
that they were being retarded in other studies by the time consumed in sewing, and 
not upon any fundamental difficulty of teaching the art in the ordinary school-room. 
At Boston, where the study has been most thoroughly introduced and organized, even 
to the extent of holding weekly meetings of the sewing teachers for conference, the 
course of instruction is, in brief, as follows: After the child has been taught how to 
select both thread and needle, to thread the needle and to hold it, it is put to basting 
together a ‘bag-apron,” in which to keep the work; then it is taught to back-stitch, 
to hem, and to overcast the seams of the basted apron. This method has the advan- 
tage, says the supervisor of sewing, of interesting the child, since it is employed in 
making something that itis to wear. The material is almost invariably furnished by 
 
-P-A-G-E-785

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 785 
the pupil; the garment is prepared by the teacher and sewed under her direction. 
Great interest is manifested at the homes of the children, and cases are known in 
which the child has instructed the mother in the lesson that it has learned at school. 
In a few schools dressmaking has been introduced; simple dresses, however, are 
made in all the schools. In concluding her remarks the supervisor says: 
~ “There is no doubt that the habits formed in connection with learning to sew have 
an important influenoe on the life and character of the girls and of their homes. It 
may be confidently asserted that the influence of the sewing is healthful and lasting 
upon the mind and character of the pupils, and on that account, no less than for its 
material utility, it deserves the respect and encouragement of the community. Asa 
department of school work it is second to none in the success which it has attained 
and the interest it has enlisted in and out of the school-room.” 
At Philadelphia, the success of the instruction in sewing caused its introduction into 
the secondary and grammar schools for girls; and the experience of two years has 
been most satisfactory. ‘It is believed,” says the superintendent, ‘‘ that the instruc- 
tion in this branch is more extensively and thoroughly organized in this city than in 
any other in the country. Twenty-five thousand girls are now regularly taught the 
principles and practice of sewing by a corps of thirty-two special teachers.” At 
Mont Clair, N. J., three grammar grades receive instruction in a graded course of sew- 
ing, cutting, and fitting, given to the girls in their class rooms, while the boys are 
engaged in the shops. 
The inexpensiveness of the materials (in Boston costing about $200 a year), the 
cleanliness, and particularly the simplicity of the work, permitting the pupil to r 
main at her desk, render sewing much less difficult to introduce and maintain as a 
study than cooking, which not only requires appliances that are inappropriate to a 
school-room, but an activity that is incompatible with the order that is exacted there. 
At Boston, where instruction in cooking is more extensively introduced than in any 
other city,’there are four cooking schools, or kitchens, as they are there called. Each 
school has ten classes somiosel of 15 or 20 pupils, as the case may be, each class 
receiving about twenty lessons, Taking the oldest school, instituted and as yet sus- 
tained by the liberality of Mrs. Hemenway, as illustrating the manner of conducting 
these “kitchens” and of connecting them with the usual studies of public schools, 
the course may be said to be as follows: From each of five public schools in the vicinity 
of the ‘‘ kitchen,” 30 pupils are selected and divided into two equal classes. For the 
two classes thus formed from the contingent of each school, a day of the week is set 
apart (it is presumed that in the forenoon one class is instructed. and in the after- 
noon the other) for instruction. Thus the two classes of the Hyde School have Mon- 
day, of the Winthrop School, Tuesday, and so on for twenty weeks. Still using the 
statistics of Kitchen No. 1 as typical of the class, it appears that the cost of giving 
150 girls a course of twenty lessons was 28} cents a girl, or 1? cents for each lesson 
given to each pupil. Of the 700 families who Heyes ieee represented at this school 
during the years 1885-87, 692 have expressed themselves in favor of it. ‘‘ No school,” 
says the chairman of the Committee on Manual Training of Boston, ‘established 
among us ever received such quick appreciation from all classes of our people.” 
Opinions as to the advisability of introducing manual training into the public schools.—An 
analysis of the answers made by 16 State superintendents to an item on one of the 
Bureau’s forms of inquiry shows that 11 favor the introduction of manual training 
into the public school system, 4 of whom and 2 others who are otherwise non-com- 
mittal think it impracticable to introduce it into the country schools; 1 considers it a 
good thing in the abstract, and 2 are ooponee toit. The superintendent of Brooklyn, 
N. Y., thinks the question merely one of expense, remarking: ‘‘It is clearly impossible 
to introduce manual training to any extent in our present class-rooms, and I do not 
think the board of education would be justified in expending any portion of its ap- 
propriations for the erection of work-shops so long as thousands of children are refused. 
admission or permitted to attend but half a day.” The superintendent of Worcester, 
Mass., though far from questioning the utility or necessity of technical schools, is a 
determined opponent to the introduction of manual training into the public schools, 
and the superintendent of Meriden, Conn., says in his report for 1886-87: ‘The tes- 
timony we have gathered from places where the experiment has been tried are far 
from satisfactory ;” while the superintendent of Joliet, Ill., recommends a middle 
course, objecting to the manual training as ‘no part of the public school system, and 
for several reasons is out of place as an annex to it,” but would ‘ encourage the pupil 
to spend part of his time while out of school in industrial and mechanical work.” To 
this end, annual “industrial fairs” are held with highly satisfactory results. 
Dyrawing.—The unmistakable tendency to make drawing the hand-maiden of con- 
structive work is plainly evinced in several quarters. “The work in this department 
[that of drawing] was recast somewhat,” says the superintendent of the Troy (N. Y.) 
city schools, ‘‘by the adoption of a course which looked wholly toward the indus- 
trial features of the study, but preserving and continuing all the advantages derived » 
from tho system in use.” “It,” [drawing] says the president of the St. Louis 
50 ED 
       
-P-A-G-E-786
      186 "EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
school board, ‘‘ contributes in several ways to educate; it teaches the eye to see bet- 
ter, the hand to yield up some of its almost incorrigible obstinacy; and the faculty 
ot memory is strengthened by its pursuit. As we are engaged in training some 
thousands of boys who in the fulness of time will become artisans and mechanics, 
engaged in the numerous branches of industry common to a great centre like St, 
Louis, we owe it to ourselves and to them that our well-earned credit for intelligence 
shall not suffer by any appearance of indifference here. Drawing ought to be kept 
very near to the three R’s, because it is one of the arts of expression, that one which 
is capable of depicting the worker’s thought with graphic clearness, such as no 
formula of words can always adequately do.” | 
Under the caption ‘Drawing in the grammar schools as a means of manual train- 
ing,” the superintendent of the Washington (D. C.) schools remarks: ‘‘The work, as 
a whole, is included under three heads, construction, representation, and ornamenta- 
tion, In each of the above lines of work the effort is first to lead the pupil to see 
and decide, and afterwards to make or to do.” 
The new course of study in drawing adopted in 1885 by the Brooklyn (N. Y.) board 
of education is reported as eminently preferable to the old. The third feature of this 
new course is its ‘industrial application.” Although the concurrent testimony given 
above shows a marked tendency to make instruction in drawing an introduction to 
manual training, the Office hag been unable to ascertain its magnitude. The subject 
of drawing is again, though incidentally, referred to in the following. 
Industrial exhibits—Under the heading, ‘‘Opinions of superintendents as to the ad- 
visability of introducing manual training into the public schools,” mention has been 
made of the advocacy and adoption by the superintendent of Joliet, Ill, of industrial 
exhibits; ho is not alone in his practice. At several other towns similar exhibits of 
manual work, “realized drawing,” as the superintendent of Moline calls it, are an- 
aually made. 
The Office is not in possession of sufficient evidence to assert that these exhibits are 
tho natural outcome of the exhibitions in the past of the progress of the pupil in 
drawing, and that the effort to ‘‘realize,” to materialize what has been taught as 
drawing, is a development as natural as the effort now making in several quarters to 
fill the gap that exists between the kindergarten and the manual training school, but 
the following quotation from the report of the Albany (N. Y.) superintendent would 
seem, together with hints from other, sources, to justify such a conclusion: ‘(The 
Drawing Exhibition * * * was made one of the most attractive features of the 
occasion. The scholars’ work exhibited was even more varied and extensive than at 
the last exhibition. Much interest was shown by the thousands that viewed the 
drawings; especially in the unusually large number of strictly industrial pieces, which 
showed to all the highly practical nature of this study, now admitted to be as essen- 
tial a part, of primary education as reading or writing.” If the interest was aug- 
mented by the representation of industrial pieces, why not still further enhanced by 
showing the thing itself. 
The opportunity of giving the public a tangible evidence of what they are accom- 
plishing is far too favorable to be neglected by superintendents. ‘“ Exhibitions,” says 
the superintendent of Lewiston, Me., ‘‘ possess many valuable features, inasmuch as 
the public is reached and moved by them. An interest in behalf of the public schools 
is aroused which otherwise would liedormant. * * * To encourage manual labor 
Trecommend industrial exhibitions, where not only school work may be seen, but work 
performed out of school, including sewing, cooking, carpentry, etc.” 
“While there may be a difference of opinion regarding the value of these exhibits,” 
says the superintendent of Moline, IIL., ‘‘ there should, if seems to us, be only one opin- 
ion concerning the value of the training which must inevitably accompany the ‘do- 
ing’ or ‘making’ which have rendered these exhibits possible, especially if prop- 
erly planned, and accomplished with due regard to the other work of the school.” 
At Oskaloosa, Iowa, where the exhibition lasted 3 days, the handiwork of the 
pupils filled 5 rooms. The exhibit comprised articles made with tools from wood, 
drawings, ueedle-work, and specimens of cooking. At Joliet, Ill., where the exhibi- 
tions, inaugurated in 1884-85, are called industrial fairs, and ‘‘ the effect upon many 
of the pupils was magical,” no exhibition was held for 1886-87 owing to the preva- 
lence of sickness. At Salem, Mass., the pupils of the Bowditch School gave their 
second industrial exhibition, making a display highly creditable, though not so 
varied as the first. At Moline, Ill, 10 classes constitute the scheme of exhibition, 
which is so systematic and well digested as to call for insertion in full:

For the preparation of this work the following regulations were issued:

hibit of such work as it is possible and desirable to do in school under the direction 
and guidance of the teacher.

In OTHER EpucATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. 
Manual training in the form of apprenticeship at trades (see p. 82, ‘‘ Convention,” 
abstract of the remarks of Superintendent Clarke) has long been codrdinate with the 
ordinary school work in the education of the deat; the absence of the feature in day 
schools for them making such schools an exception. ‘‘ Institutions having the whole 
care of children between the years of 10 and 20 owe them an industrial training,” ‘ ie 
says Dr. G. O. Fay! The old system of working in the morning and in the afternoon ; 
of each day is being supplanted by one of two systems denominated rotating. By one, 
the pupil spends one-half of his school day in school and the other in working; by © 
the other, only one-third of the day is spent at work. Dr. Fay, in the article quoted 
from above, states that the latter plan is preferable; for while giving a reasonable pro- 
ficiency at a trade, it allows the pupil the time for school work that the pupils of the 
higher classes and the brighter scholars have felt the need of, Seven pupils from

the Chicago schools for the deaf, ranging from 14 to 21, have entered the industrial 
school of the city board of education, and ‘‘so far are holding their own with those 
who hear and speak;” while in Boston the pupils of the Horace Mann School were 
permitted to attend institutions of that city for manual instruction. In 41 institu- 
tions giving manual instruction, 29 provide shoemaking ; 25, printing; 15, cabinet- 
making; 12, carpentry; 12, dress-making, and 8, tailoring. Although the number 
following these and less generally introduced trades is not given, the predominance 
of shoemaking, printing, and wood-working may be taken as indicating their adapt- 
ability as trades for the deaf. 
The object of introducing manual training into the public schools is mainly to sup- 
ply a correlative to the mental training they are intended to give. In the deaf-mute 
institution the object has been to make the trade learned in the institution a means 
of supportin after life. In hisreport to the committee of the board of directors of the 
Pennsylvania Institution, Principal Crouter remarks that the difficulty experienced 
by the deaf in acquiring trades does not arise so much from want of mechanical in- 
genuity on their part as from the indisposition of employers of skilled labor to afford 
them a fair opportunity to learn them. Accurate statistics as to deaf-mutes are very 
difficult to obtain; so much so, that the government of Holland declined to attempt 
to collect such information in the census of 1879. But the desire to judge of their 
work by evidences of a more practical character than the results of the final examina- 
tion, to investigate the intricate question of heredity in deaf-mutism, and to ascertain 
if their graduates have been helpless in the community, has induced most extensive 
- inquiries on the part of the Pennsylvania Institution and the American Asylum at 
_ Hartford. The inquiries instituted by the first institution among its graduates as to 
the callings they followed showed that of 119 pupils taught shoemaking or tai- 
loring (the trades principally taught), 34.5 per cent. followed that taught them in the 
institution and supported themselves thereby; the percentage of shoemakers being 
53, that of the tailors 19. The result of the inquiry of the American Asylum, at 
Hartford, shows that 19 per cent. of 368 of its graduates are farmers, 16 per cent. are 
engaged in some business by which wood is fashioned by hand tools, and 13 per cent. 
are shoemakers ; the occupations, mainly mechanical, of the other half are too diverse 
for classification. The trades taught at the institution are cabinet-making, shoe- 
making, and tailoring, but the statistics do not show the relation between the manual 
instruction given at the school and the vocation followed as a means of livelihood. 
Principal Williams observes, however, that comparatively few of the former pupils 
follow the trade taught them. 
In schools for the blind.—Music and the trade of broom-making stand out so promi- 
nently, are so generally recognized as vocations for the blind, that the other occupa- 
tions taught are comparatively insignificant. ‘My personal experience as a blind 
man,” says F. J, Campbell, now principal of the Royal Normal College and Academy 
of Music for the Blind, London, ‘‘and my experience as a teacher of the blind in Ten- 
nessee, Wisconsin, New England, and Great Britain, prove conclusively to my mind 
that if music, based upon a thoroughly good intellectual training, is properly taught. 
it is worth more, in a practical point of view, than all other avocations combine 
which are open to the blind.” In the fortieth annual report of the Indiana institu- 
tion, Superintendent Jacobs remarks: ‘There is probably no attainment a blind man 
can possess, that he can turn to better account in an effort to find congenial and lucra- 
tive employment than the ability to repair, regulate, and tune pianos and cabinet 
organs. Good tuners are always in demand.” The experience of the Pennsylvania 
institution and of others confirms Superintendent Chapin in the belief that ‘its 
[tuning] relative importance as a bread-winner is very high.” As to the ability of 
the blind to acquire this very desirable art, Director Anagnos uses no doubtful lan- 
guage: “I have repeatedly stated in my previous reports that the blind develop 
* * * a remarkable power of distinguishing the pitch and qualities of sounds; 
that as a result of this ability they acquire great proficiency in the art of tuning 
piano-fortes; that in this calling they labor under no disadvantage whatsoever, 
* * * and that their work is, in many respects, more thoroughly and satisfac- 
torily done than that of most of their seeing competitors. I desire to repeat the 
assertion * * * it does not rest upon a mere a priori reasoning, but is warranted 
by experience gathered in the field of observation and confirmed by an array of in- 
disputable facts.” ‘‘Of nineteen who have acqnired the trade and have been fur- 
nished with tools,” says Superintendent Clement, of the New York State Institution, 
“fourteen are successful.” 
While competent testimony shows piano-tuning to be a profession that may be fol- 
lowed by the blind with success in the North, West, or South, or in Europe, the 
trades taught stand upon a different basis, the locality having much to do with the 
return the workman receives for his labor. Where the corn is cheap, as in Texas, 
broom-making is remunerative ; in Illinois broom-making and cane-seating are the 
most lucrative occupations, and carpet-weaving has been dropped as unprofitable, 
while in Pennsylvania broom-making and carpet weaving are the most profitable, 
and cane-seating is unreliable.

  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. . 789 
In reform schools.—The claims of industrial education, taught in a thorough and sys- 
' tematic manner, for recognition in this class of schools are briefly stated by the trus- 
tees of the Illinois State Reform School, who say: ‘“ Boys from 13 up to 20 years old, 
who are deprived (no matter from what cause) of their liberty, should have an op- 
portunity of acquiring some trade. The large majority of men who get into State 
prison have passed the age.” The organic act of the Ohio Industrial School requires 
the board of trustees to have the pupils taught in some agricultural or mechanical 
industry, which has been done ‘‘so far as circumstances and appropriations would per- 
mit” ; but in many cases it would appear that the industrial instruction given is moro 
adapted to keep the boys from idleness or to produce revenue while in the school 
than to furnish them with a means of livelihood after they have leftit. But the tide 
is setting against ‘reform schools for revenue,” to use the vigorous phrase of the su- 
perintendent of the Indiana School for Boys, and he looks forward to the time when 
the pupils of his institution can be taught “ the science and art of working in wood or 
iron,” while the superintendent of the Newark (N. J.) City Home follows in the same 
line, declaring that “the purpose of profit should yield to the design of reformation.” 
The board of control of the Michigan School heartily endorses and concurs in the ree- 
ommendation that some form of light manufacturing be introduced into their insti- 
tution ‘as a reformatory agency,” and only as such. In New York and Pennsylvania 
the contract system has been abolished and the managers of the New York House of 
Refuge ask for an appropriation to enable them to reclaim a tract of marsh in order to 
train the pupils in agriculture and horticulture, “as best for the interests and future 
welfare of the boys ;” while the managers of the Philadelphia House of Refuge desire 
to move from their present city quarters and establish an agricultural reform school 
where farming and trades may be taught, as ‘“it is of essential importance that chil- 
dren should have the benefits of a manual training as a reformatory factor for their 
present and future advantage.” In New Jersey the boys have beentaken (though at - 
a loss) from the ironing of shirts and put to work at farming, carpentry, blacksmith- 
ing, and shoemaking; aud in New Hampshire a hosiery mill has been established in 
connection with the school, Although our reformatory schools are as yet only on the 
borderland of systematic manual training, as that term is used above, it is not be- 
cause its value as a means of reformation and of future self-support are ignored. 
The superintendents of the New Jersey, Indiana, Michigan, and Cincinnati institu- 
tions are asking for the ‘“‘manual training school system.” The superintendent of the 
Illinois School, where the contract for making shoes is about to expire, is inclined 
to it, but fears that ‘the money required to carry on such industries, with but little 
prospect of profitable return on a currency basis, is the only apparent obstacle to 
technological labor in a reform school ;” while the superintendent of the Nebraska 
School has already introduced the system toa limited extent (at the expense of two 
of the officers), and asks not only that an appropriation be made to carry it on, but 
that the name State Reform School be changed to State Industrial School. The re- 
sults already attained in the ‘Mechanical School” (a school of carpentry) of the 
Maine State Reform School “fully justify the wisdom of the Legislature in establish- 
ing this labor-teaching department.” 
In schools for the feeble-minded.—Nine years ago instruction in trades was intro- 
duced as a part of the school work of the Kentucky institution for this class of chil- 
dren. “It was an experiment,” says Superintendent Stewart, ‘as nothing of the 
kind had ever been tried before, and it was adopted by the board of commissioners 
after much thought and many fears.” A small carpenter and shoe shop was built for 
the boys, and a sewing-room and laundry for the girls, in which instruction was given 
in the afternoon. It was soon developed that work in the shop was an incentive to 
mental and physical effort, and applications by the children for permission to learn a 
trade had to be refused from want of accommodations. The additions to and re- 
pair of the institutional buildings are done by the boys learning carpentry, while 
the 20 boys at work in the shoe shop make shoes for the inmates and supply a demand 
at Frankfort. In a report made in 1881, after an experience of several years, Super- 
intendent Stewart remarks: “It has been demonstrated in our institution that some 
ehildren who could not be taught to read or write could be taught some useful kind 
of labor.” In this report the superintendent states that the pupils in the shops aro 
graded by their intelligence, the first or most intelligent class are taught carpentry ; 
the second class, shoemaking ; the third class, mattress, broom, or mop making, and 
the lowest class have been found surprisingly apt in tying brooms, making mops and 
stuffing and sewing mattresses, The girls do the sewing and a large part of the 
laundry work of the institution. The number of inmates at the institution is kept 
down by the non-admission of idiots and the unimprovable, and the fact that ‘ the sys- 
tem of instruction in the common trades enables us [the Kentucky institution] to 
send away every year almost as many as we receive, they being reasonably equipped 
m pose branches and able to maintain themselves or contribute largely to their own 
support. 
yA radion schools.—‘‘All Indian schools should be agricultural training schools on 
the reservation,” says Agent Cramsie in a report to the Commissioner of Indian Af- 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-790
        
    790 EDUCATION REPORT,»1886-87. 
; “ 
fairs, ‘The one great and important industry which should be taught to all Indian 
boys is agriculture,” says Agent Kinney. ‘‘ We haye endeavored to give agricultural 
knowledge to every pupil by our system of outing [placing the student with a 
farmer]; and to that end the apprentices in the different shops haye been largely 
allowed to go out on farms,” says Superintendent Pratt of the Carlisle School, in his 
annual report. Without admitting that the only road out of savagery lies through 
herding or agriculture, Superintendent Pratt urges against the objection that trades 
are taught that can not be utilized, that ‘there is scarcely a mechanical pursuit 
that does not directly minister to agricultural success.” The enactment of the law 
providing for citizenship and the allotment of land would seem to call for agricult- 
ural training for the rising generation of Indians, the future landholders; manual 
training being especially valuable as inculeating habits of industry. 
It is inferred from a remark of the superintendent of Indian schools that mechanic 
trades are not taught at many of the reservation schools, ‘as no provision has been 
made,” and it appears that while 40 ‘‘industrial teachers” are employed at an ay- 
erage annual salary of $575 in the 57 reservation boarding-schools, none are em- 
ployed in the 90 day schools. In the boarding-schools under bonded superintendents, 
6 ‘industrial teachers” are on the rolls as such at an average salary of $708 ; but, for 
reasons given under the “Education of the Indian,” Chapter XIV, this is believed to 
fall far short of the true number. 
Working in wood and leather, and blacksmithing are the principal mechanic indus- 
tries taught at these schools. At Carlisle the distribution for the year last passed was 
as follows: Carpentry, including wagon-making, 34; shoe and harness-making, 69; 
tailoring, 39; printing, 15. Full statistics are not given for the other schools, but it 
appears that shoemaking and carpentry are most commonly taught. The erection 
of a 3-story building, 60 by 40, has given the Haskell Institute at Lawrence, Kans., 
facilities to teach the above-mentioned and other trades, . 
In colored schools.—The annual distribution of $45,000 by the trustees of the John 
F, Slater fund is enabling the institutions aided, 39 in 1886-87,! to provide the organi- 
zation and appliances that systematic industrial education demands, but the insti- 
tutions for the colored people that give industrial training differ so in character and 
methods as to render a statement in tabular form of the statistics of their industrial 
departments impracticable at this date. Of 26 secondary institutions for colored 
ersons, containing nearly 7,000 pupils, 9 institutions had industrial courses attended 
yy 1,525 pupils; that is, of the whole body of secondary pupils in 26 schools about 25 per 
cent. were receiving industrial training. Although the diversity of the character of 
the institutions precludes tabulation of the number in industrial courses the uni- 
formity with which the same trades have been adopted at the several schools per- 
mits a statement of the kind of industrial instruction given. To the female pupils 
house-work, cooking, and sewing are taught; to the male pupils carpentry, farming, 
and printing very generally, with occasional instances of work in iron, as at Atlanta 
(Ga.) University, State Normal School, Tuskegee, Ala., and Tougaloo, Miss. At Knox- 
ville, Tenn., the directress of the Slater Training Schoolhopes ‘to engraft industrial 
training upon the regular city school system.” ‘Three grades from the city schools, 168 
pupils in all, attend, and on Saturdays there are classes from other grades of the city 
schools. Two of the5 teachers are paid by the city school board, The instruction in 
carpentry in the schools for males is very practical—constructing and repairing build- 
ings, making plain furniture, and wagon-making. At Clark University, Atlanta, 
Ga., this last industry has assumed considerable proportions. At Tougaloo Univer- 
sity, where the instruction is graded and very thorough, the conclusions arrived at are 
thus expressed by the president of the school: (1) Industrial training is of prime im- 
portance for the colored people; (2) it aids the work in the school-room through the 
discipline and the habits it gives; (3) the industries pursued should be those of the 
most utility to the people, and a few of these are better than many; (4) to insure 
success both competent teachers and ample appliances are necessary ; and, finally, © 
the chief difficulty is to make the necessary adjustments between head-work and hand- 
work. It is hoped by the authorities of Fisk University, Nashville, Tenn., that a 
sufficient sum will be added to a recent gift of $4,000 to enable them to start a ‘‘ school 
of mechanics and engineering.” 
SOCIETIES FOR THE PROMOTION OF MaNUAL TRAINING. 
The oldest of these societies, and perhaps the most comprehensive, is the Industrial 
Education Association of New York, a reorganization of the Kitchen Garden Associa- 
tion of the same city, with a greatly enlarged sphere of activity. The new objects of 
the association since its reorganization in 1884, are: (1)'To secure the introduction 
of manual training as an important factor indgeneral education, and to promote the 
training of both sexes in: such industries as shall enable those trained to become 
self-supporting; (2) to devise methods and systems of industrial training, and to 
put them into operation in schools and institutions of all grades; (3) to provide 
1 Forty-one inall, of which two are medical schools.  
-P-A-G-E-791
  MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 791 
and train teachers for this work. To accommodate the Museum of Industrial 
and Technical Education and the large classes that must be gathered together 
“to demonstrate the practicability of ingrafting the system advanced by the associa- 
tion on the present system of general education,” the building previously occupied 
by the Union Theological Seminary was leased for 8 years, at an annual rental of 
$6,000, and taken possession of in October, 1886. The number of pupils taught by 
the association in its various departments of instruction in the main and other schools 
was 4,383 for 1886-87; of the 992 pupils under instruction in the main building, 65 
wore teachers. Twenty-five teachers in the pay of the association taught classes in 
different parts and suburbs of the city, and through its instrumentality ‘industrial 
drawing, clay-modelling, wood-carying, carpentry, and sewing have been introduced 
into the public schools of Hoboken and Staten Island with adair degree of success.” 
The crowning effort of the association, however—the realization of the third feature 
of its work—is the establishment of an industrial normal school or college for the 
training of teachers, under the presidency of Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, who is assist- 
ed by four instruetors. The conditions of admission, such, with one exception, as a 
grammar-school graduate should be able to meet, are remarkable from the require- 
ment of as much geometry as is contained in the first five books of Davies’s edition of 
Legendre. The course for female pupils differs from that for men by the addition of | 
domestic science to the studies common to both; that is, the studies of history and 
science of education, mechanical drawing and wood-working, and modelling and in- 
dustrial art. A model schoel of several grades is attached to the college. TheCleve- — 
land Manual Training School Company was incorporated Jume 2, 1885, for the ‘‘ pro- 
motion of education, and especially the establishment and maintenance of a school 
of manual training.” The school that was quickly established is more fully referred 
to in the follow ule section (p. 792): The Industrial Education Association of New Jer- 
sey was organized at a meeting held June 5, 1885, at Hoboken, N, J., with the ob- 
ject of stimulating public favor; to train women and girls in domestic economy; to 
teach such industries as shall enable those trained to become self-supporting ; tostudy 
and devise methods and systems of industrial training, and secure their introduction 
into the public schools, and to provide and, if necessary, to train teachers for the 
work. Permission was given to the association to place a teacher in the public schools , 
of Hoboken, and 8 classes were instructed in sewing for the girls, and clay-modelling 
for the boys. The Milwaukee Manual Training Association was organized during the 
fall of 1885, as ‘‘the growth, prosperity, and general welfare of Milwaukee demand 
that immediate steps be taken to provide industrial education and manual training 
suited to the genius and character of her people, and to her possibilities and destiny 
as a leading and influential industrial city.” It was thought that the most economical 
and effectual way to accomplish the desired object ‘‘is in connection with the public 
high school, and that new buildings * * * should be erected at an early day.” 
It will be observed that one of the objects of these societies is to demonstrate the 
feasibility and the advantage of introducing industrial training into the public 
schools; and the matter has therefore been included under this head. 
Il. MANUAL TRAINING AND TRADE SCHOOLS. 
In the foregoing the condition of manual and of industrial instruction as a feature 
of a school or system of schools has been briefly reviewed. It remains to examine 
the object and methods of manual training and industrial schools. Provisionally 
these institutions have been arranged in the following tables under two heads, one 
containing the schools whose pupils possess the requirements of the upper grades of 
the public schools, the other those schools which are.at the same time elementary 
schools and workshops. The classification is merely tentative; continued examination 
will correct the inadvertencies of the tables, and additional information may change 
their form and, in the case of the second table, their place. : 
A decade has passed since Professor Runkle became acquainted with the system of 
instruction pursued at the Imperial Technical School of Moscow, saw its utility, and 
advocated and secured its introduction into the Massachusetts Institute of Technol- 
ogy. Of the several manual training schools or departments established since that 
important event, it will here suffice to mention three that claim particular attention 
by reason of the sources from which they sprang ; priyatg munificence at St. Louis, 
commercial enterprise at Chicago, and the comprehensive interpretation of its educa- 
tional obligations by the city of Baltimore. 
The St. Louis Manual Training School, though a department of the Washington 
University, owes its establishment in 1879 to the liberality and wisdom of several 
gentlemen of St. Louis, by whom the buildings were erected andthe school endowed. 
To define the scope of this school and give its program of manual studies is to give 
those of the other two of which it seems to have been the prototype. “Its object,” says 
the second article of the ordinance given by the Washington University, “shall be in- 
struction in mathematics, drawing, and the English branches of a high school course, 
   
-P-A-G-E-792
          192 5 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. ‘ 
and instruction and practice in the use of tools. The tool instruction, as at present 
contemplated, shall include carpentry, wood-turning, pattern-making, iron chipping 
and filing, forge work, brazing and soldering, the use of machine tools, and such other 
instruction of a similar character as may be deemed advisable to add _to the foregoing 
from time to time.” In all the schools the course is of three years. At St. Louis and 
Chicago the first year is spent at wood-working, the second at the forge, and the third 
at the metal-working bench and lathe, and in the study of machinery. Tho sequence 
at the Baltimore school is somewhat different, forging coming in the first, and pattern- 
making and vise-work in the second year. Mathematics through trigonometry, English 
language, literature, and history, and elementary science are relied on for mental 
training, and free-hand and mechanical drawing is the intermediary that brings 
the mental and manual work into relation. At St. Louis and Chicago, Latin and 
French are optional for English ; in all the schools the day is about equally divided 
between the two concurrent systems of development. 
The history of the Chicago Manual Training School began at a meeting of the 
Commercial Club of that city in 1882, during which funds were subscribed and a 
committee appointed. On April 19, 1883, the Chicago Manual Training Association 
was incorporated and the control of the school vested in a board of 9 trustees ap- 
pointed by it. The school was opened in February, 1884, on completion of its build- 
ing, with 72 pupils, and closed June, 1887, with 190. 
But perhaps the most interesting example of the establishment of an institution of 
this class is the organization of the Baltimore Manual Training School as a part of 
the public school system of that city. On the 24th of April, 1883, in response to a 
motion, a committee was appointed by the school commissioners to report upon the 
best means of fitting boys and girls “‘as quickly as possible for self-support.” On June 
19, 1883, the committee reported that it would be expedient to establish a high school 
for manual education under the supervision of the board, since ‘a knowledge of some 
form of industrial labor is as necessary as a knowledge of books; and as the State 
and city acknowledge their obligations to teach children to read and write they can 
not deny their obligation to teach them to work, as the latter is as essential for the 
public welfare as the former. Only a small portion of those who receive their educa- 
tion in the public schools ever enter the professions, but the large number become 
artisans and adopt mechanical occupations for their future support.” On petition, 
the city council empowered the school commissioners to establish the school, and leg- 
islative action was taken in January, 1884. In March of the same year the school 
was opened with 60 students; in June, 1887, it closed with 150. 
The equipment of these typical schools is adequate, perhaps fully adequate to the 
demand of their students, if such an expression can safely be a) plied to any school 
system or school. ‘he cost of the apparatus of the Baltimore school to the close of 
1886 was $10,680, and this school, the youngest of the three, appears to be somewhat 
less largely equipped thanits precursors; the motive power for operating its machinery 
is less, and the accommodations of the wood-working and forging departments, es- 
pecially the latter, seem to be intended for fewer pupils, though this may merely in- 
dicate more attention to the other subjects of technical study requiring neither steam 
power nor anvils. 
Time enough has not elapsed to speak of “results.” Of the 40 graduates of the St. 
Louis school in 1885, 5 became teachers of manual training, 11 engaged in some busi- 
88 requiring technical knowledge, and 11 entered higher institutions, 3 into tech- 
“nical schools. Of the 27 graduates of the Chicago school,7 entered higher technical 
schools, and all but four, whose occupations, if pursuing any, are not reported, have 
entered manufacturing houses or higher institutions. Of the 34 young men who with- 
drew from the Baltimore school during 1886-87, 7 are learning the trade of machinist, 
4 that of carpentry, and 3 are severally engaged in ear, carriage, and watch making. 
At the St. Louis school, tuition is $60, $40, and $100 for the three years respect- 
ively, and until the close of the last school year it was the same at the Chicago school, 
an addition of $20 having recently been made to the charge for each year. At tho 
Baltimore school tuition is free to residents, to others it is $50. At St. Louis there 
are 50 to 60 full or partial scholarships; at the Chicago institution provision is 
made for a limited number who can meet every requirement but the fee. 
In 1885, the Philadelphia Manual Training School was opened as a part of the pub- 
lic school system, and on the petition of the Cleveland, Ohio, board of education the 
State legislature empowered that body to levy a special tax to establish a manual 
training school for the benefit of the pupils of the Cleveland public schools. As the 
directors are elected partly by the board of education and partly by the Cleve- 
land Manual Training School Company, a stock company with a capital of $25,000, 
the Office assumes that the fine institution established by the company has either 
wholly or in part been adopted by the city, the only change being the abrogation 
of the charge for tuition. Both of these schools are on the “‘ Russian or St. Louis plan,” 
but it is noticeable that the central school feature obtains at Cleveland, the pupils 
attending three timesfor3 hours each during the week. Thismight cause the Cleveland

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 793 
school to fall more properly under the foregoing general head, but as its pupils must 
have tho requirements necessary to gain admission to the city high schools and be 14 
years of age, it has beon deemed expedient to treat it as a manual training school as 
the Office understands that term, a school having a graded course in wood, iron, and 
machinist’s work, systematic and continued instruction in free-hand and mechani- 
cal drawing, and a post grammar school course of study, as cobrdinate departments. 
The schools mentioned above give a practical Gaia of the processes by which 
the raw materials with which they have to do are operated upon and fashioned to 
meet the wants of a manufacturing age. But there is another class of schools whose 
purpose is to teach trades—to make skilful bricklayers, stonecutters, or plumbers, or 
to improve those who are already mechanics. In this class, or rather school, since, 
as far as the Office knows, the New York trade schools constitute the class, the system 
is to leave the gencral education to the public schools and confine the work to the 
manual instruction necessary to make a mechanic. ‘The sessions are held three even- 
ings from seven to nine thirty, of every week, and for five and a half months. The 
class in tailoring meets daily, from eight a. m. to five p.m. Efforts to establish day 
classes in other trades have, with the exception of plumbing, been unsuccessful. The 
admission age is 16 to 21, the tuition charge for the season $15, $16, and $17 for car- 
pentry, plastering, and bricklaying, respectively, and $10 to $12 for the other trades; 
the attendance for 1886-87 was 337, the first session, 1881, it was 20. The land and 
buildings cost $56,000; the receipts for the last season were $4,848, the expenses 
$9,516. In a letter to the Bureau the proprietor, Richard T. Auchmuty, Esq., says: 
“The results of this experiment in industrial education have been most gratifying. 
The young men, after working for from six months to one year after leaving the schools, usually get full wages, if old enough to do a full day’s work. That they are thoroughly taught in the science of the trade * * * was shown by the severe ex- amination held by the committee appointed by the Master Plumbers’ Association last spring.

    196 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
| REMARKS ON THE SUMMARY OF TaBLE 67. 
_ Omitting the statistics of the McDonogh Institute, of the manual training depart- 
__~ ment of the Omaha High School, and of the technical school of the Carriage Builde 
ers’ Association, which appear for the first time in the Table, there is an increase of 
17 in the number of the instructors, of 1,326 in pupils, of $18,120 in income, and $10,150 
r in expenditure over the year 1885-86. In 1885-86 the average number of pupils to a 
: teacher was 23, in 1886-87, 35; the per capita expenditure, excluding the students in 
institutions not reporting expenditure, in the former year was $123 and in the latter 
* year $111. Excluding the statistics of the well-endowed Miller Manual Labor School 
: _ for both years, and those of the McDonogh Institute for 1886-87, the per capita ex- 
< _ pense was $78 for 1885-86, and $66 for 1886-87.

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 
The classes of persons whose education is treated of in this chapter may be paged. in 
two categories, those wliom nature, disease, or accident has placed at a disadvantage 
as compared with children possessed of a full complement of human faculties, and those 
who by reason of their social position or transgressions are unlikely to reach a higher 
level of intelligence unless assisted or coerced. The educational life here dealt with 
is institutional and it has the additional feature of being fostered by the general 
public, except in the case of the negro, for a very small proportion of itself, a fact that 
has not a little. tended to give rise to the vicious propensity of looking upon these 
institutions as public charities rather than as public schools. : 
Schools or asylums.—Without touching upon the esthetic side of the question of 
naming these institutions and the several classes whose instruction it is their purpose 
to accomplish, the practical evils resulting from what is indicated, or is supposed to 
be indicated, by the names they bear or have borne is here considered in so far as it 
interferes with the accomplishment of their specific object. It was stated by President 
Gallaudet, of the National Deaf-Mute College, in presenting his report as chairman of 
the executive committee of the Convention of American Instructors of the Deaf (see 
p. 824), that it was a matter of experience that children who are deaf but not dumb 
have found difficulty in securing the advantages to which the so-called deaf and dumb 
are admitted without question; and Superintendent Weston Jenkins, in his article on 
“Aphasia in Relation to Deafness” read before the Eleventh Convention of the In- 
structors of the Deaf, speaks as though it was a common thing for superintendents to 
receive application for the admittance of children who are described as ‘‘dumb but 
not deaf.” But itis among the institutions for the blind that, apparently, the greatest 
inconvenience is experienced. In its annual report for 1886, the board of trustees of 
the Texas Institution for the Blind, uses the following language: ‘‘In conclusion, we 
invite a careful perusal of the report of the superintendent, and would again impress 
the idea that this isnot an asylum. * * * At least one citizen of a distant State 
travelled to Austin under the delusion that this was an asylum, * * * The con- 
818

stitution never intended that it should be used as an ‘asylum’ and such nomenclature 
properly has no place in our statute books, and we trust that all legislation in the fut- 
ure will look to this important distinction.” Superintendent Sibley, of the Missouri 
School for the Blind, issues a printed circular: ‘In view of the fact that a want 
of proper information on the part of the public concerning this school has been 
the cause of many blind children growing up in ignorance. * * * This institu- 
tion is in no sense an asylum.” Struggling against the same misconception Superin- 
tendent Jacobs, of the Indiana Institution for the Education of the Blind, remarks: 
« * * * Judging from the contents of many letters that I haye received, there 
seems to be a lack of information relative to the real character and purposes of this 
institute among all classes of people. They fail to comprehend that this ig not an 
asylum. * * *” Superintendent Miller, of the Ohio Institution, remarks that ‘‘An’ 
erroneous impression seems to exist * * * as to the intention of our institution. 
It is not a State infirmary, nor is it in any sense an asylum.” Superintendent Clement, 
of the New York State Institution for the Blind, though not commenting on the evil 
complained of in the West, issues an ‘‘Address to the Parents and Friends of the Blind” 
ostensibly to advise the parent as to the course of home instruction to be pursued be- 
fore the child is sent to school, but he carefully notes that the organic act declares 
“that the institution shall be considered as a department of public instruction,” It 
will be observed that the new school for the blind in Alabama has received the name of 
Academy for the Blind, 
The name ‘“‘reformatory.”—If the odium which attaches to the word “asylum,” in 
which light it would seem the public persists in viewing the above institutions, their 
trpe names to the contrary notwithstanding, “has been the cause of many blind chil- 
dren, growing up in ignorance,” it may be supposed that the graduate of a reform 
school would be at some pains to conceal the name of his alma mater rather than 
andere the worst evil to a reformed person of having been ‘in jail.” Superintendent 
Mallalieu, of the Nebraska State Reform School, observes, in suggesting that the name 
of his institution be changed to State Industrial School that ‘‘the word ‘reform’ when 
applied to penal institutions carries withitastigma. Itis frequently amisnomer,! It 
projects itself into the future and springs up at the very time when the struggling 
youth is doing his best to lead an honorable life.” The trustees of the Iowa school in 
recommending that the name be changed to the ‘State Industrial School” say: ‘‘The 
use of the name ‘reform school’ was considered inapplicable, although the school is 
reformatory in its work and character.” Superintendent Charlton, of the Indiana 
School for Boys, however, takes another view of the matter, considering the question 
in the light of propriety of nomenclature and the life of the boy while in school. He 
very logically observes: ‘‘ Let us call things by their right names, I try to impress 
upon every boy the fact that this is a reform school.” 
Attendance.—The attendance at these institutions suffers not only from the false 
conception of their object, but also from ignorance of their existence and, in some 
cases, a wilful neglect of the advantages proffered, Among several methods followed 
by superintendents of schools for the deaf to make the schools and their true character 
known (see page 822, Education of the Deaf—Convention), that pursued by Superin- 
tendent Noyes, of the Minnesota school, seems to be, not only ingenious in its concep- 
tion and thorough in its operation, but highly valuable in its results. ‘* That method 
alone,” observed Mr. Noyes, ‘‘ has given me tenfold more reliable information in the 
State of Minnesota than all the census returns that have been made, either by the 
national or State government, since that [the Minnesota] institution was founded.” 
This plan is based on the fact that a child in the public school will be more likely 
to know if there is a deaf and dumb child in the neighborhood than his father or 
his mother. Taking advantage of the superintendent of public instruction’s annual 
distribution of blank forms to be filled out and returned, a table was added to the 
form; and on this, county superintendents and teachers were required to write the 
name, the age, and the parent’s post-office address of each deaf or blind child in the 
State. The responses the State superintendent had tabulated and transmitted co 
Superintendent Noyes, who recommends that the word “dumb” be not used, “ because 
some parties * * * make the same child deaf, dumb, and blind” quite contrary 
to the fact. The matter of attendance was not formally before the ninth biennial 
meeting of instructors of the blind, but thesame ignorance of the existence of schools 
for the blind was adverted to by several members, 
I.—EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 
I.—GENERAL REMARKS. 
New institutions and buildings.—Three schools for the education of the deaf haye 
been opened during the year and two provided for. Ofthe schools established those at 
Evansville, Ind., and La Crosse, Wis., are respectively a part of the common school sys- 
1See page 856, Classification of pupils.  
-P-A-G-E-820
    
820 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
tem of the city, while that at Cincinnati, Ohio, is under the auspices of the Society for 
the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, of Cincinnati. The institution for the deaf 
and the blind lately established at Cheyenne by the Legislature of Wyoming is prepared © 
to begin its work as soon as a sufficient number shall have presented themselves for 
instruction, and the institution for the education of the colored deaf and blind, pro- 
vided for by the twentieth Legislature of Texas (1887), will be ready in September, 
through the activity of the three commissioners appointed to carry out the act and to 
whom the $50,000 appropriated was intrusted. 
Two schools have ceased to exist, the private school of Prof. A. Graham Bell, in 
Washington, and the St. Joseph’s Deaf-Mute School, Hannibal, Mo., whose pupils 
have been removed to the Convent of Maria Consilia Deaf-Mute Institute, Saint Louis, 
“Mo. The school in Baltimore, known as F. Knapp’s Institute, is supposed to have 
been discontinued as a school for the deaf, as no information of it or from it as such 
has been received for several years. 
The Kansas, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Oregon, West Virginia, and the national in- 
stitution have largely increased their accommodations. The central and the northern 
New York institutions are making preparations to begin the erection of institutional 
buildings, the State Legislature having appropriated $40,000 to each; while the ap- 
propriation of $40,000 by the Massachusetts Legislature to the Horace Mann School 
having been found inadequate to erect the building contemplated, work has not yet 
been begun. As,to tho plan and arrangement of these buildings, the Office possesses 
no information. 
Changes of the year.—The changes in the management of the institutions for the 
class under review are few but marked. The Alabama Institution for the Deaf and 
Dumb and the Blind has been separated into its elements and an institution estab- 
lished for each class of its inmates; the New Mexico institution has beén adopted by 
the Territory; and the New England Industrial School for Deaf-Mutes, Beverly, Mass., 
has, for the first time, been aided (to the amount of $2,000) by the State. In the 
Pennsylvania and Wisconsin institutions the oral department has been enlarged, and 
in the former institution is now taught in a separate establishment. The “advanced 
class” of the Chicago schools for the deaf, or high school, in the language of the 
principal of this class of city schools, ‘‘ bids fair to become an established feature, as 
it has done well and grows more and more useful.” Another “experiment,” the most 
important innovation of the year, has been the determination on the part of the board 
of directors of the National College to admit young women to the college on the same 
terms and conditions as have been applied to young men. The results will determine 
the future policy of the board. 
Training of teachers for the deaf.—The normal department of the Eleventh Conven- 
tion of American Instructors of the Deaf, the first of its kind, was opened on July 
16, 1886, by its superintendent, Mr. Ely, of the Maryland School for Deaf and Dumb, 
in the following language: 
‘The first subject to be considered is primary language. * * * The idea is to 
have set before us here the methods of the class-room—how we begin, how we go on, 
what means we use to reach the minds of our pupils to illustrate certain things, to 
get over certain difficulties, and in the progress of the discussion it is expected that 
the teachers present will ask questions, make suggestions, and offer remarks from 
their places in the room. It is to be as informal as is consistent with good order.” 
Mr. Weed, of the Pennsylvania institution, was in eharge of the exercises of the 
section of language for primary and intermediate classes, and selected as topics 
for discussion: (1) Vocabulary; (2) tense; (3) correction of mistakes; (4) methods of 
review ; (5) exercises most profitable for primary teaching, Then followed in order 
arithmetic, in charge of Mr. F. W. Booth; kindergarten work, in charge of Mr. Z. F. 
Westervelt ; geography, under Mr. Weston Jenkins; natural science, in charge‘of Mr. 
F. D. Clarke; art, in charge of Mrs. A. J. Griffith; history, in charge of Mr. George 
Goodall; and the sections of sign language, Mr. I. L. Peet, of articulation and lip read- 
ing, Miss L. D. Richards, and of auricular instruction, Mr. J. A. Gillespee. Space is 
wanting to follow the discussions. 1t is necessary, however, to say that the presiding 
officer’s expectation that questions would be asked was fully realized. 
Miss Garrett, principal of the Pennsylvania Oral School for the Deaf, Scranton, Pa., 
devotes a portion of her time to training teachers in the oral method. ‘The course 
continues L0 months—4 of observation and 6 of practice. Twenty of those who have 
received instruction atthe school are engaged in teaching; the class for the year just 
closed consisted of 3. The National College at Washington has done so much toward 
furnishing the institutions of the country with teachers that, though its object is the 
higher education of the deaf, it may in a manner be regarded as a normal institu- 
tion. Eighteen per cent. of those who have been connected for a longer or shorter 
time with the college have been engaged in teaching, and it is interesting to note 
that not infrequently their work has Deen that of pioneers. 
Articulation.—The electicism and the intelligent advocacy of teaching the deaf to 
Gpeak, and to read from a speaker’s lips, as evinced in the resolution unanimously
-P-A-G-E-821
  EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. © 821 
adopted at the Eleventh Convention of American Instructors, contrasts with the en- 
thusiastic preference given to the “pure oral method” by the Milan Convention,! 
representing the opinion on the continent of Europe. 
The desirability of teaching the deaf to speak, and to read from the lips, is fully ap- 
preciated by American instructors, but experience causes them to doubt the possibility 
of the congenitally deaf acquiring these arts, except in cases of exceptional bright- 
ness. A trialof the combined system in its second and fourth features, Professor l’ay’s 
classification (see page 823, Convention), at the Pennsylvania institution, showed, after 
a trial of several years, the second method to be unsatisfactory as regards articula- 
tion and lip-reading, while in the trial of the fourth method the oral department was 
found worthy of being continued, though the ‘‘ results were not such as its most ardent 
friends had expected.” ‘‘It is believed,” says Superintendent Crouter, of the Penn- 
sylvania institution, “that a large percentage of our pupils, namely, the semi-mutes 
and the semi-deaf, and such of the congenitally deaf (few in number probably) as are 
capable of receiving oral instruction, can and should be orally taught, and that all 
others, forming, to be sure, the majority of the pupils, should be taught by manual 
methods” (see page 823, Convention). Calculations by this Office, based upon replies 
made to the inquiry of the editor of the American Annals of the Deaf and published 
in that journal, show that 36 of the schools reporting statistics for the year 1886 used 
the combined method exclusively, 13 the oral, and 10 the manual. Of the whole 
number of pupils (excluding the pupils of the New York institution) of these institu- 
tions (about 8,000), 32.5 per cent. were instructed in articulation. In the 45 institu- 
tions reporting teachers of articulation as such, the average number of pupils to a 
teacher is 15, so far as this is not modified by the fact that some of the pupils that 
appear in the aggregate were only present for a part of the year, causing this average 
to be too high. In the London city schools for the deaf, 10 is the maximum number 
committed to the charge of one teacher, and this number was one of the ‘‘six cardi- 
nal demands” of the schools for the deaf in Germany, almost unanimously adopted at 
the convention of German instructors of the deaf. The teachers of articulation formed 
24 per cent. of the whole teaching body. 
The oral branch of the Pennsylvania institution, above referred to, is taught in a 
separate establishment, with accommodations increased to admit 100 pupils. The Wis- 
consin institution has enlarged its oral department, which now receives the entire 
attention of three teachers; and the board of directors of the Oregon school asks the 
legislature to provide the means of employing a teacher of articulation. ‘Iwo of the 
new schools of the year are oral schools, the Evansville, Ind., school being taught on 
the manual system. 
Auricular instruction.—This lately introduced and rapidly extending method of in- 
struction has been defined by the auricular teacher of the Nebraska institution, Miss 
Plum, as ‘‘educating the brain to use the hearing so that speech may be gained,” 
and Professor Currier, of the New York Institution for the Education of the Deaf 
and Dumb, explains the phrase ‘aural development” as ‘‘the systematic training of 
an ear in abnormal condition to perform, with the aid of mechanical contrivance, the 
operations just described [the operations of the ear in a normal state].” To ascer- 
tain the number of semi-deaf, the tests made, and the number taught auricularly in 
the schools for the deaf, Superintendent Gillespie, during 1835-36, sent out a series 
of questions to the various institutions and received answers from 35. To the first 
question, ‘‘Has there been a general test of the hearing made in your school?” 22 
answers are in the affirmative. ‘To the question, ‘‘How many have you found with 
sufficient hearing to distinguish vowel sounds?” the 22 institutions answering the pre- 
vious question in the affirmative, answered, collectively, 80. To the question, “ How 
many have you taught wholly aurally ?” the answer was 35, including the Nebraska in-    
    
1 The resolutions adopted by the international convention at Milan wer 
“1. The convention, considering the incontestable superiority of speech over signs, (1) for restoring deaf-mutes to social life, (2) for giving them greater facility of language, declares that the method o: articulation should have the preference over that of signs in the instruction and education of the deaf 
and dumb. 
“2, Considering that the simultaneous use of signs and speech has the disadvantage of injuring speech and lip-reading and precision of ideas, the convention declares that the pure oral method ought to be preferre The American instructors embodied their views in the following preamble and resolutions: 
‘““Whereas the experience of many years in the instruction of the deaf has plainly shown that among 
the members of this class of persons great differences exist in mental and physical condition, and in 
capacity for improvement, making results easily possible in certain cases which are actually unat- tainable in others, these differences suggesting very widely differenttreatment with different individ- uals: It is therefore 
“Resolved, That the system of instruction existing at present in America commends itself to the 
world, for the reason that its tendency is to include all known methods and expedients which have 
been found to be of value in the education of the deaf, while it allows diversity and pelea ae of 
* action, working at the same time in harmony, and aiming at the attainment of a common object by all. 
“Resolved, ‘That earnest and persistent endeavors should be made in every school for the deaf to teach every pupil to speak and read from the lips, and that such efforts should only be abandoned when (after thorough tests by experienced teachers) it is plainly evident that the measure of success attain.

stitution. To the inquiry, ‘How many are taught both aurally and orally ?” intended 
to bring out the number taught with a view to cultivating the hearing, the answer 
was399. Superintendent Gillespie, of the Nebraska institution, stated in the Hleventh 
Convention, at Berkeley, that experience had convinced him that his previous esti- 
mate of 15 per cent. was not too low as an estimate of the pupils at schools for the 
deaf who have sufficient hearing to be developed. At the Mississippi institution dur- 
ing 1885 a class of 10 were daily instructed in this method, and, although 5 could not 
at first distinguish vowel sounds, they could at the close of the year distinguish words 
and sentences. 
Periodicals.—Of the two journals that are not issued by institutions for the deaf, one, 
the American Annals of the Deaf, Peonam demands attention as an educational 
publication of the highest class. This journal, 79 per cent. of whose running expenses 
are derived from assessments on American and Canadian institutions, contained dur- 
ing the year under review bee een articles, three-fourths of which are of a peda- 
gogical nature, the others being historical, biographical, or casual articles relating to 
ersons or subjects connected with deaf-mutism. These constitute the general and 
largest part of each quarterly issue; the minor departments being a department for 
notice of the current literature of deaf-mutism, a school-items department, and a de- 
partment of announcements, and record of current events. The articles, original or 
translated, are written, with but few exceptions, by instructors. In the other peri- 
odical, the Deaf-Mutes’ Journal, social rather than educational information predomi- 
nates. Besides these, the educational and the social journals of the deaf world, there 
is a class of periodicals printed for, and very frequently, if not in every case, by the pu- 
ils of the séveral institutions! The potential value of these papers, and that their 
influence is not confined to an institution, was happily illustrated by Superintendent 
‘Westervelt during the session of the normal section of the Eleventh Convention, at the 
close of Miss Harris's account of her method of teaching language at the Maryland in- 
stitution. Hesaid: ‘Would it not be a benefit to the profession and to all the institu- 
tions where papers are published, if such work as this done by Miss Harris were printed 
in such paper for the benefit of other institutions? * * * We all look through 
the institution papers, and we are very glad to get hold of something of this kind.” 
Convention.—As the proceedings of the Eleventh Convention of American Instruc- 
tors of the Deaf, at Berkeley, Cal., July 15-22, 1886, cover 320 pages of an octavo vol- 
ame, it is impossible to do justice to them in afew paragraphs, A faint sketch of the 
proceedings of the normal department has been given under ‘Training of Teachers.” 
Those desirous of information as to the intimate or social side of a transcontinental 
trip that appears to have been as pleasant as long, are referred to the article in 
the American Annals of the Deaf,? and those who wish the full information, that can 
not be given here, to the volume of the procecdings.? In calling the convention to 
order President Gallaudet, of the National College, gave a historical view of the pre- 
vious conventions which, as a series, may be separated into two periods; the first from 
1850 to 1858, held at intervals of about two years, with an attendance on the average 
of 35, representing from 3 to 10 institutions; the second, inaugurated after an inter- 
val of 10 years, at intervals of 4 years, and a constantly increasing attendance, until 
at Berkeley 41 institutions were represented by 230 delegates, 
At the opening session Mr. L N. Tate’s paper on the means of securing a better at- 
tendance at schools for the deat called forth the discussion intended, Rev. Thomas 
Gallaudet recommended a multiplication of institutions to accomplish the end, a 
proposition that was opposed by Mr. Erastus Brooks, of New York, as tending to 
weaken the power that could only be had by having one institution, and by Miss 
Black, principal of the Rhode Island school, who observed that notwithstanding the 
small extent of Rhode Island, not more than a fourth of the deaf children in the State 
could be gotten into the school. Dr. Peet advocated exhibitions at a central point in 
the State, as wellas at home; Mr. Williams operated by sending out letters; President 
Gallaudet advocated the teaching of the manual system of conversing in the public 
schools; and Mr. Noyes gave his ingenious scheme, fully stated in the introduction 
of this chapter, for finding out deaf children. The session of the 16th was closed 
with a paper by Mr. James Denison, on “The Manual Alphabet as a Part of the Public 
School Course,” a paper briefly anticipated the day before. As the utility of the propo- 
sition met with the unanimous support of the convention‘ and may not be self-evident, 
the reasons for introducing this study into the public schools are given quite fully. 
1 The Office takes ocoasion to thank the superintendents of the Nebraska and Ohio institutions for 
their courtesy in sending it the Nebraska Mute Journal and the Mutes’ Chronicle, respectively, during the year, and the editor of the Deaf-Mutes’ Journal for a similar favor.

“There are indisputably times and places in which the finger alphabet fulfills, as 
writing can not do, the conditions of expression where vocal utterance is either not 
desirable ornot possible. * * * How oftenatsocial gatherings * * * do weseo 
individuals separated from each other by the crowd or the length of the room, vainly 
sttiving * * * foconvey * * * information. *.* * In concerts, * * .* 
inthe chureh, * * * inthetheatre, * * * and amid the noise and rattle of 
the machine-shop, factory, or railroad, how often arises an imperious necessity for 
making a communication to another. * * * Outside of the confessedly deaf, how 
many persons there are who * * * are yet hardly ever addressed except in tones 
moré or less raised above the conversational pitch, * * * To the invalid and 
to the sick room the manual alphabet comes, as it were, with healing on its wings. 
* * * How many last messages * * * have been lost to the loving ones re- 
maining behind; lost because the finger alphabet was not known.” Mr. Denison 
then discusses the advantage of the manual alphabet to the hearing child as a stu- 
dent of the orthography of the English language, because ‘the more varied the form 
under which language is presented to the mind through the different senses, the more 
pertect will be the knowledge of it acquired and the more permanently will ib be re- 
tained.” Mr. Denison concludes with stating the undoubted benefits accruing to the 
deaf from ability to converse with the general public. 
Saturday was a holiday, Sunday was devoted to the discussion of Sabbath Ex- 
ercises in an institution for the deaf and dumb, and Monday to the great questions 
of the day in deaf-mute instruction, the relative merits of the oral, the manual, and 
the combined methods. Professor Crouter, in his paper on ‘The True Combined 
System of Instruction”—after quoting Professor Fay’s subdivisions of the combined 
method into four classes, (1) the use of signs and articulation concurrently in the 
same class; (2) special classes in which lip-reading and articulation are taught as an’ 
accomplishment; (3) separate oral and manual classes in the same school; and (4) 
separate oral and manual schools or departments in the same institution—objected to 
the concurrent use of signs and articulation in the same class, since the ‘‘methods aro 
diametrically opposed,” and the semi-mutes are compelled to attend the advancement 
of the congenitally deaf, which is slow. To teaching articulation and lip-reading 
as an accomplishment he also objected as producing results inferior to the pure oral 
method. In the practice of the third species of the combined system, in which pupils 
are instructed in different classes by the oral or by the manual method, but are per- 
mitted to use signs on the play-ground, Mr, Crouter had found that such use of signs 
had tended to improve the pupil’s intellectual faculties; he pronounced, however, for 
the fourth system of instruction in the following terms: ‘‘ For all practical purposes 
and in order to secure immunity from error in the choice of methods, I would divide 
the deaf into three classes,—the congenitally deaf, the semi-deaf, and the semi-mute. 
With the first I would include those born deaf and those who lose their hearing trom 
accidental causes very early in life, say within the age of three or four years. ‘These, 
for the most part, I would instruct manually. The semi-mute and the semi-deaf, and 
such of the congenitally deaf as appear particularly bright and quick to learn, I 
would instruct orally.” Professor Crouter’s remarks are of especial interest, as the 
institution over which he presides is ‘‘ working out for the benefit of the American 
schools,” to quote from the paper that followed by Dr. Peet, ‘‘a most interesting 
problem” (see p. 821). Dr. Peet, in his paper on the combined system, after sum- 
inarizing the progress of manual and oral instruction in this country, proceeded to 
describe the methods pursued in the New York institution, where, ‘‘Except in what 
we call our kindergarten department, the hours of instruction for each class are four 
daily. The first hour is devoted to the recitation of the lesson conned in the study 
hours out of school; the second hour, to exercises in the English language; the third 
hour, to arithmetic; and the fourth hour, to lip-reading and its corollary, articulation.” 
Mr. G. O. Fay, in his paper on ‘* Comprehensive Education in its Philosophy and Prac- 
tice,” advocated, in order “‘ to secure the best results in existing institutions, sign and 
oral,” a reorganization, gradual or summary ; for, though the schools of France for a 
century, and of this country ‘‘ have demonstrated only and mainly * * * theim- 
portance and possibilities of pantomime and the uses of the manual alphabet, supple- 
mented by written speech, * * * and have produced a remarkable body of silent 
scholars, easily superior to anything that ‘oralists haye been able to produce,” they 
have been backward * * * intaking up and applying with equal skill and energy 
the teaching of oral speech.” On the other hand, the schools devoted to the pure oral 
method of instruction “ have yet to learn that in omitting the use of pantomime and 
finger spelling they ignore the uneducated mute’s best friend. They take away a 
ladder, the only ladder known, by which all the deaf can easily rise.” The reading of 
these papers was followed by a keen, though not acrimonious, colloquy as to the prob- 
ability of error in a segregation of pupils unfit for oral instruction, that was not 
founded on a long trial, and even re-trials. The discussion was interrupted by Pro- 
fessor Gallaudet, president of the National College, who introduced the resolutions 
already given (p. 821, note), which, after some amendments in the interest of oraland 
auricular instruction, were unanimously passed.

  824 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
The first paper of the following day was by Professor F. D. Clarke, of the Arkansas 
School, on ‘‘ Technical Education.” Mr. Clarke stated that the California institution 
was the only one that followed the Russian system of technical instruction, and that, 
only in the wood-working feature of the system, and that at no institution, so far as 
he was aware,! “is there any regular course of [technical] instruction, any examina- 
tion, or any attempt at eith He advocated a manual-iraining course of four years; 
the pupil during the first 2 years to be instructed in the use of tools ina general 
way, and during the last 2 made a specialist of. The convention then unanimously 
adopted the report of the standing executive committee to 
word ‘‘dumb ” in the title of the convention and of the public 
the American Annals of the Deaf and Dumb. Mr. Chickering’s paper on ‘‘ Physical 
Culture,” not intended ‘to offer anything new or original,” presented the methods 
and results of physical education at the National Coliege; his testimony as to the 
value of the exercise to the deaf was corroborated by Professors Fay and Noyes. 
Miss Garrett’s paper, entitled “A Summary of Work done in the Pennsylvania Oral 
School for Deaf-Mutes, Scranton, Pa., June 18, 1886,” stated that the object of the 
anthor’s school was to develop speech and language, for, if the work is well begun, 
it will be a comparatively easy matter to instruct the pupils in the ordinary branches 
later.” ‘If the school were larger,” continues the essayist, ‘‘I should classify it as I 
did in [the] oral branch of [the] Pennsylvania institution—placing semi-mutes, semi- 
deaf pupils, and congenital and practically congenital, each in separate classes; of 
course sending semi-mutes and semi-deaf pupils to hearing-schools as soon as possible.” 
After taking action in the matter of President Gallaudet’s invitation to appear be- 
fore the royal commission to inquire into the education of the blind and the deaf in 
Great Britain and Ireland (seo Buroau Report, 18¢5-86), the following resolution was 
introduced and unanimously passed: 
“ Resolved, That, in the opinion of this convention, instruction in art is of special 
importance in the instruction of the deaf, as without its guiding and developing in- 
fluence the peculiar tendency of the deaf-mute’s mind to think in pictures can not be 
taken advantage of to place him on that plane in life to which he is best adapted, 
nor can that superiority in handicraft of whatever kind which he is capable of at- 
taining be placed within his grasp.” 
The evening of the 2ist was spent in discussing auricular instruction (see p. 821, 
Auricular Instruction); the day followiag was taken up with the closing exercises.

ALABAMA. 
Alabama Institution for the Deaf (formerly Alabama Institution for the Deaf and Dumb 
and the Blind). Talladega, Aia.—The oral class recently established in this institu- 
tion numbered 16, the pupils’ ages ranging from 8 to 22 years. They had at the date 
of the report acquired a vocabulary of 450 words, quite a number of short sentences, 
and could count and add very well. Industrial training has been reduced to a min- 
imum from want of room, a state of affairs that the erection of the department for 
the blind into a separate institution and its removal will remedy.   
  COLORADO. 
Colorado Institute for the Mute and the Blind, Colorado Springs, Colo.—Of the 82 
persons admitted to the institution and of whom a record was obtained, 30 per cent. 
were congenitally deaf, though no pupil had had deaf parents. Signs are used freely, 
while those showing aptitude are also instructed in articulation and lip-reading; 
some pupils being quite proficient in both. Printing and carpentery are taught as 
trades. 
CONNECTICUT, : 
American Asylum for’ the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Hartford, Conn.—Forty- 
one per cent. of the 289 pupils admitted since 1877 to this long-established school were 
born deaf, and 57 per cent. of those born deaf were children not having deaf-mute 
relatives; 23 per cent. having deaf relatives belonged to 47 families, having in all 
240 children (154 hearing and 86 deaf), of whom 64 per cent. were not deaf. The 
increase in the attendance in the articulation department necessitated the employ- 
ment of a third teacher of articulation and lip-reading. In, this school all new 
pupils are thoroughly tested as to their ability to continue in it with profit; 63 have 
been under instruction during the year. Of the 184 pupils in the school at the date 
of the report, 23 were supported by the State of Maine, 21 by New Hampshire, 17 by

Vermont, 62 by Massachusetts, 5 by Rhode Island, and 56 by Connecticut. Referring 
to the objection urged against the combined or eclectic system as occupying the 
greater part of the pupils’ time with the sign language, Principal Williams observes 
that it certainly does not hold against his school, and that signs are used ‘as a val- 
uable aid, and only as an aid.” 
Whipple's Home School for Deaf-Mutes, Mystic River, Conn.—This school is taught 
wholly on the oral system. The course of study is lip-reading and articulation, lan- 
guage, arithmetic, geography, and history. The boys are taught farming and garden- 
ing. The school is partly supported by the State and partly by contributions.   
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. 
National Deaf-Mute College, Washington, D. C.—This, the initial effort to secure to 
a constantly increasing class the advantages of a rigid and thorough course of intel- 
lectual training, was partly instituted to prove that the deaf were capable of profit- 
ing by the opportunities it afforded; a theory that the experience of 23 years and 
the occupations of the alumni have demonstrated. Of the 298 students who have 
been for a longer or shorter period connected with it, 50 have engaged in teaching, 1 
is a minister, 6 have been connected with newspapers as editors, writers, or publishers, 
10 have entered the civil service, 2 are scientists, and 2 have held municipal offices. 
Some have entered business offices as subordinates, while others have embarked on 
their own account, and many have become farmers and mechanics. The sections of 
* the Union have been represented as follows: New England, 43; Middle States, 58; 
Sonthern States, 67; and the West, 130. 
The liberality of Congress has been marked and uniform. It has not only provided 
for the current expense: liberally as to enable the college authorities, to assist in- 
digent students, but has appropriated from time to time over $400,000 for the splendid 
college buildings and the extensive grounds by which they are surrounded. ‘The in- 
stitution, however, bas not been wholly dependent on the national treasury. In its 
early days scholarships were maintained by distinguished citizens of the capital, and 
to accomplish the purchase of the last and largest addition to the grounds there were 
many contributors. 
The college does not attempt the work of a polytechnic school nor of a university. 
Its curriculum of four years consists of studies in ancient and modern languages, in 
natural and political science, and in philosophy and in history. This course, which 
leads to the degree of B. A., is introduced by a course of instruction lasting a year. 
Greek, analytical geometry, and the calculus are optional. Latin is finished with the 
first term of the sophomore year, and English and mathematics are prominent by rea- 
son of the continuity with which they are pursued. Candidates for admission are 
examined as to their ability to converse (oral or finger spelled); to render at sight 
paragraphs from school-books or newspapers; to compose extemporaneously; and 
are examined in the studies of the common school. 
    GEORGIA. 
Georgia Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Cave Spring, Ga.— 
The school at the date of the last report had not yet occupied the new building, for 
which an appropriation of $5,000 was made in 1880 and an additional sum of $10,000 
by a subsequent Legislature ; to complete and equip the building will require $6,000 
more. In the school the usual branches are taught; in the industrial department the 
boys are taught shoemaking. 
ILLINOIS, 
Ephpheta School for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, Chicago, I],—This 
school, though appearing in the table for the first time, was established in 1884, and 
has been sustained by the Ephpheta Society (an incorporated association of Roman 
Catholic ladies); tuition is free. The addition of an industrial department is under 
consideration, while the formation of a library has already been begun. 
Chicago (Ill.) City Schools for the Deaf.—These schools, of which at the date of the 
last report there were 5, are taught on the manual system. There is, however, a class 
in articulation and lip-reading. In a letter to this Office transmitting statistics, Su- 
perintendent Emery remarks: ‘‘Seven deaf boysfrom the advanced classand Scammun 
Primary Mute School, ranging from 14 to 21 years of age, have entered the industrial 
school of the city board of education. So far they are holding their own with those 
who hear and speak. This * * * overcomes the greatest and only serious objec- 
tion to mute day schools.” 
Illinois Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Jacksonville, I1.—Of 
the 1,613 pupils of whom the cause of deafness was reported, 30 per cent. were born 
deaf. Since 1846, 1,886 pupils have been admitted into the institution, representing 
 
-P-A-G-E-826
826 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
1,706 families; 90 per cent. of these families had each one deaf child (pupil in the 
institution), 6 per cent. 2 deaf children, and 4 per cent. 3 or 4, “Of tho deaf-mutes who 
have been connected with the institution as pupils and have left it, 251 have married 
deaf-mutes, and 19 have married hearing persons. Theso marriages have been as 
fruitfal in offspring as the average of marriages in society at large, some of them re- 
sulting in large families of children. Among all these only 16 have deaf-mute children. 
In some of the families having a deaf child there are other childven who hear.” After 
discussing the evils of non-attendance on the opening day of the school, the fallacious- 
ness of per capita comparisons of the cost of one institution with that of others of a dif- 
ferent kind, or of the same kind but of a different environment, the superintendent 
asks for an appropriation of $8,000 to erect a cottage for little girls. The gymnasium, 
for which $6,000 was appropriated, was nearly completed at the date of the report. 
KANSAS. 
Kansas Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Olathe, Kans.—Artic- 
ulation and lip-reading are taught to those who show aptitude, about one-sixth of 
the whole number. The school is divided into 12 classes under as many teachers. 
In the mechanical department, cabinet-making, carpentry, shoemaking, and printing 
are taught by competent foremen. 
MASSACHUSETTS, 
New England Industrial School for Deaf-Mutes, Beverly, Mass.—Articulation is taught 
to a greater extent than ever before. The course covers the ustal common school 
studies. 
Horace Mann School for the Deaf, Boston, Mass.—Although by a recent act of the 
Legislature the school is now one of those at which pupils may be maintained at the 
expense of the State, it still remains under the control of the school committee of the 
city. ‘The want of provision for industrial instruction has compelled the institution 
to depend upon the courtesy of the North Bennett Street Industrial School and the 
‘Tennyson Street Cooking School for such instruction. The primary classes have been 
much assisted during the year by printed language lessons that private contributions 
enabled the principal to provide. 
MICHIGAN. 
Michigan Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Flint, Mich.—Of the 336 
pupils enrolled during the biennial period covered by the report (1685-86), 19 per cent. 
were congenitally deaf. In 1855-56, the third year of this school’s existence, 18 deaf 
children were admitted ; in 1865-66, 14 ; in 1875-76, 39; 1885-86, 58. The course covers 
10 years, 5 of which are passed in the primary department, 3 in the grammar, and 2 
in the academic. As those who enter the school are, with few exceptions, destitute 
of language, the first 4 or 5 years of their school life are consumed in its acquisition. 
The general method of instruction pursued is the combined, its elasticity and flexi- 
bility rendering it adaptable to the condition of the pupil. Without intending in 
any way to reflect upon the value of the work done in the articulation department 
of his school, the superintendent recommends that an oral department, in which prom- 
ising pupils are to be taught wholly by the oral method, be established at an early 
day. The 304 pupils enrolled in 1885-86 were taught as 19 classes by 15 teachers, an 
average of 16 pupils to a class and of 20 toa teacher. Referring to the new study of 
drawing, the superintendent remarks: ‘‘Whatat the beginning of the year was an 
* * * experiment * * * has become a decided and well-determined success.” In the 
cabinet-shop (23 pupils), in the shoe shop (28 pupils), or in the printing-office (12 male 
and 7 female pupils), the pupils above the primary grade spend half of the school day. 
NEBRASKA. 
Nebraska Institute for Deaf and Dumb, Omaha, Nebr.—Of the 244 children that have 
attended the school since its opening, 32 per cent. were reported as congenitally deaf. 
The auricular work, adopted as a special feature of the institution, gives great 
promise of beneficial results. As an experiment the school has been divided into 
three divigions, one working in the shop while the others are in school, for the put- 
pose of giving the pupils more thorough manual instruction without taking from their 
school time. Drawing, pencil and crayon, has been introduced and taught to 60 
pupils with highly satisfactory results. In the industrial department, printing, car- 
pentry, engraving, and carving are taught the boys. 
NEW JERSEY. 
New Jersey School for Deaf-Mutes, Trenton, N. J.—Of the 109 pupils ip. the institu- 
tion at the beginning of the school, 35 per cent. were between the ages cf 15 and 18, 
 
-P-A-G-E-827
     827 
26 per cent. of 8 and 12, 25 per cent. 12 and 15, and 14 per cent. of 18 and 21; 51 per 
cent. were born deaf. ‘‘ Special and continued instruction is given in lip-reading and 
’ articulations with varied success.” The recent act of the Legislature, appropriating 
money for the establishment of a system of mechanical instruction, has led to the en- 
largement of the shoe shop and the introduction of the machinery necessary to teach 
the trade on a larger scale; a room has been fitted up as a carpenter shop, and an- 
other provided with a printing-press. The superintendent regrets that circumstances 
have as yet prevented him from giving auricular instruction tho attention that its 
promise deserves. EDUCATION OF THE DEAF, 
NEW YORK. 
Le Couteute St. Mary’s Institution for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, Buffalo, 
N. Y.—Of the 139 pupils in the school at the close of the year covered by the report, 
$7 were State pupils and 27 county; 19 were supported by parents or guardians, and 
6 were charity scholars. The method of instruction is the combined articulation. 
“The greater number of those who have been born deaf, or who have lost their hear- 
ing in infancy, make comparatively small gain in speech and in lip-reading, though 
still enough to be useful to them in their homes and among their friends.” The boys, 
according to their individual aptitude and taste, are taught printing, tailoring, or 
shoemaking ‘The principal remarks that printing not only is attractive to the stu- 
dents, but that the trade promotes their intellectual growth, adding: “ Many of our 
former pupils are now filling lucrative positions in newspaper and job-printing offices 
in various parts of the country.” 
St. Joseph’s Institute for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, Fordham, N. Y.— 
Although the system of instruction has not radically changed, ‘there has been a 
steady advancement from the combined to the oral in the classes where the former 
system is still in use.” The studies are those of the public schools. Shoemaking and 
tailoring are taught the boys. 
Northern New York Institution for Deaf-Mutes,! Malone, N. Y.—Of the 56 pupils con- 
nected with the school during the year covered by the report, 46 were supported by 
the State and 10 by counties. Speaking of the method of instruction followed at his 
school the superintendent says: ‘‘We do not use sigis as an end in this institution, 
* * * Fyven for the most advanced and intelligent deaf-mutes and, I may add, 
semi-mutes the explanation of difficult words and phrases by signs is of great value; 
but for beginners, and those whose mental faculties are of the lowest order, they are 
indispensable.” As the pate of several pupils having some power of speech desired 
that their children should retain it, a teacher was detailed to instruct such pupils in 
articulation and lip-reading, a temporary arrangement until the services of an articu- 
lation teacher can be obtained. After commenting on the difficulties of instructing 
the deaf, the superintendent remarks: “It is very unfortunate that so many of our 
pupils arrive at the institution at an age when the difficulty of imparting instruction 
to them is doubled. Their most impressive years are gone, and they generally find it 
a task of no small moment to retain in the mind what they commit to memory.” 
Institution for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, New York, N. Y.—The number 
of State pupils instructed during the year was 103; county, 66; paying tuition, 19; 
and charity, 1. There were 14 classes, under 4 male and 10 female teachers. The 
institution has of late received a considerable number of very young pupils, touching 
the education of whom the superintendent remarks: ‘‘ Now, in my experience I have 
found that those deaf-mutes make the most satisfactory progress in speech and lip- 
reading whose instruction is commenced when they ave 8 or9yearsold, * * * All 
that can be done with such young children is to prepare them for the regular school 
work, which they have to begin when they are old enough for it.” To meet the re- 
quirements of this class a pee reey department was organized, with a curriculum 
consisting of calisthenics, kindergarten work, writing, lip-reading, and, for 2 hours 
daily, preliminary voice-training. An important advance has been made in the method 
of teaching science. This consists of a system of object lessons, reinforced and invig- 
orated by a continuous series of succinct questions admitting of concise responses, for 
the purpose of familiarizing the pupils with those principles of physics, chemistry, and 
geometry that are most applied in the workshop. In the industrial department in- 
struction is given to the larger boys 4 afternoons in the week, the object being not to 
teach, as yet, trades, but general mechanical principles. For the girls, in addition to 
the usual sewing, cutting, and fitting, there is a well equipped cooking school; they 
are also taught drawing and, to those showing talent, painting. 
  
1In his remarks at the convention at Berkeley, on the desirability of multiplying institutions for the 
purpose of increasing attendance (see page 822, convention), Rev. Thomas Gallaudet says of this insti- 
. tution: ‘Phere is a singtlar fact with regard to this school. Tho majority of the young men aro over eighteen years of age—men who had grown up in ignorance, twenty, twenty-two, and twenty-four years ofage. You could see the results of training, even in their physical condition, in the way they looked and carried themselves. I saw them when they began, some two years ago.”

  828 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
North Carolina Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Raleigh, N. C.— 
Of the 5 classes in the department for the deaf, 2 are taught by the oral method. 
Shoemaking is the only trade taught, but others are asked for, especially printing. 
The number taught during the period covered by the report was 26; the girls receive 
instruction in sewing. f 
OHIO. 
Cincinnati (Ohio) Deaf-Mute School.—The averago attendance during the year was 
29 in this school, 20 having attended for the whole session of 10 months, and 5 from 8 
to10 months. All studied reading, orthography, writing upon slates, arithmetic, 
penmanship, and composition ; 6 geography, and 6 history. 44 were 10 or under, and 30 
were 13 or 14 years ofage. The school was taught in two school-rooms having accom- 
modations for 40 pupils. 
The Oral School for the Deaf, Cincinnati, Ohio.—This school, the purpose for which 
the Society for the Improved Instruction of Deaf-Mutes was formed in August, 1886, 
offers instruction in the purely oral method. In many instances the society as- 
sumes the expense of educating the child whose parents or guardians are destitute. 
For the year under review the work of the society was facilitated by permission to 
use for school purposes a room in the Children’s Home free of rent; a class of 10 was 
soon formed, and placed under competent teachers. In regard to the success of the 
school the executive committee observes, ‘The work accomplished was in every re- 
spect gratifying. * * * The executive committee of the society is confident that 
the work to be accomplished during the present year will increase the usefulness of 
the school and that it will illustrate practically the main objects and purposes of the 
work, and typify it not alone as an educational effort but also a desirable charity.” 
Ohio Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb, Columbus, Ohio.—The whole 
number of students instructed here has been 2,152, of whom 31 per cent. were born 
deaf (excluding 80 not reported). Excluding those whose age, at time of becoming 
deaf, was not reported (411) and those born deaf, 34 per cent. were over 3 years ol 
when deafness occurred. The industrial department is organized on a very practical 
basis; in the printing-office (38 pupils) the printing for the State agricultural board 
is done, as well as the job work of the institution; in the shoemaking shop (47 pupils) 
shoes are made and repaired for the inmates at the expense of their parents, $1,500 
for the year covered by the report; and the repairs, extensions, and alterations neces- 
sary to so large an establishment are done by the carpentry class (28 pupils). To 
these occupations is to be added tailoring. 
OREGON. « 
Oregon School for the Education of Deaf-Mutes, Salem, Oregon.—The present condition 
of this school contrasts strongly with its original quarters in an utterly inadequate, 
rented building. The institution now owns 3 fine buildings adapted to the purposes 
of the school, provided by funds not granted by the State. Articulation is taught 
every afternoon to those who seem qualified to make progress init. The great want 
of the institution is an industrial department. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
Pennsylvania Oral School for the Deaf, Scranton, Pa.—The appropriation for a build- 
ing for this school having been vetoed by the governor of the State, the school can 
offer its advantages only to those who reside in the vicinity, which greatly interferes 
with the attendance. The president of the board of directors observes: “The success 
of the school and advancement of the pupils under our care has been a marvel to those 
who attended the exhibitions. * * * We can only reiterate what we have ex- 
pressed before, and experience shows, that the unfortunate deaf children are able to 
become speaking men and women and to all appearances as those that hear.” Miss 
Emma Garrett, the principal of the school, a teacher of experience, and an advocate 
of the pure oral method, also devotes a portion of time to normal training as referred 
to under Training of Teachers, p. 820. 
The Western Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb, Wil-, 
kinsburg, Pa.—Of the 173 pupils under instruction for the year ending September, 
1886, 31 per cent. wero reported as born deaf, excluding these and those who became 
deaf before completing their third year, and the unknown cases (4), 28 per cent., lost 
their hearing after entering upon their fourth year. The system of instruction pur- 
sued is the combined, but it is sought as far as possible to adapt.the method to the 
evident needs of the pupil rather than the pupil to general theories. The results of 
instruction in articulation and lip-reading are encouraging, and children likely to 
derive benefit from this method are daily exercised in vocalization and lip-reading 
 
-P-A-G-E-829
  EDUCATION OF THE DEAF. 829 
under the supervision of an experienced instructor. Two pleasant rooms have been 
fitted up as a library, and books will soon be provided by the income from a fund of 
$5,000 lately given by Andrew Carnegie, Esq. In the industrial department instruc- 
tion is given in carpentry, shoe and cabinet making.. It has been determined to dis- 
continue the holiday vacations, the authorities having been induced to take the step 
from having imposed upon them 40 cases of mumps resulting from contact with a 
pupil who had contracted the disease while at home during the vacation at Christmas, 
and 21 cases of measles propagated by a pupil who had caught the disease while at 
home at Easter. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
Rhode Island School for the Deaf, Providence, R. I.—The aim of this school is “to 
teach deaf children to use the English language with the spontaneity, correctness, 
and enjoyment of hearing children, as far as this is practicable.” To attain this end it 
is very desirable that children be sent to schocl even at the age of 5 or 6. Prizes are 
offered for progress in articulation and speech-reading. The course of instruction is 
thoroughly graded into 4 divisions of two years each, There appears to be no indus- 
trial department, but it is noted that two pupils took lessons in drawing in the Rhode 
Island School of Design and two others have attended an industrial school on Satur- 
days. The great want of the school is a boarding department. 
SOUTH CAROLINA. 
South Carolina Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Cedar 
Spring, S. C.—The west wing of the building having been completed during the year 
covered by the report, it was cccupied during the last term. Articulation is taught. 
VIRGINIA. 
Institution for the Education of the Deaf and Dumb and of the Blind, Staunton, Va.— 
The course of study has been lengthened one year by the addition of a higher class 
(the seventh class of the school) which gives effect to the provision which allows 
the pupil seven years of instruction. By a systematic series of efforts the superin- 
tendent has brought the number of pupils present on the first day of the session from 
35 in 1884-85 to 68 in 1886-87, thus enabling the school to organize immediately. 
The class of articulation for 1886-87 consisted of the new scholars and of 25 pupils 
selected from the -two classes of the previous year. The number of these, too large 
for one teacher, will be decreased by the removal of those not benefited by the in- 
struction. The boys are daily instructed for 3 hours in some handicraft that will 
enable them to support themselves after leaving school. The Russian system of in- 
dustrial instruction has lately been introduced into the wood-working shop which 
has been enlarged to accommodate the new machinery. 
  Tennessee School for the Deaf, Knoxville, Tenn.—Articulation and lip-reading, taught 
under the method known as the combined, is steadily growing in favor at this school. 
The average attendance for the period covered by the report was 103, a number that 
it is thought should be increased by 25 per cent.| Discussing the query, ‘‘Are we do- 
ing as much as we ought for the deaf of Tennessee?” the superintendent observes: 
“Most of our young men who wish to attend the National Deaf-Mute College leave 
us to enter the preparatory department of that institution. I think that we should, 
at least, with other institutions, fit pupils for the introductory class, * * * and 
that we should give those boys and girls whose school life will end when they leave 
us * * * amental equipment more nearly equal to that of their hearing compan- 
ions who have received the benefits of the public schools.” 
TEXAS. 
Texas Deaf, Dumb, and Blind Institution for Colored Youth, Austin Tex.—Through 
the kindness of Z. ¥. Fulmore, Esq., of Austin, to whom, by the courtesy of Superin- 
tendent Rainey of the School for the Blind, the Commissioner’s letter of inquiry was 
referred, the Office has been informed of the circumstances under which this institu- 
tion has lately come into life. In 1887 the Legislature provided for an institution, 
appropriated $50,000 for its establishment, and appointed three commissioners to 
earry out the act, of whom Mr. Fulmore was one. Uninformed as to the numberof
-P-A-G-E-830
  830 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
children who were entitled to become beneficiaries, or who would avail themselves 
of their privilege, the commission entered upon a double line of activity, appointed 
a superintendent (a colored citizen, the members of the commission are not colored}, 
whose first duty it was to collect statistics and purchase 100 acres of land. The 
buildings on this farm were re-adjusted and added to in order to accommodate the 50 
children that the superintendent soon reported would attend. The school is sufli- 
ciently supplied with apparatus, is out of debt, and has funds to carry it on until the 
next Legislature will have appropriated for its further support. The deaf pupils will 
be in a large majority. 
WISCONSIN, 
Oral Department of the Public Schools, for the Instruction of Deaf-Mutes, La Crosse, 
Wis.—This school has been organized under the statute of 1885 of Wisconsin, That 
it is a day school taught’ on the oral method is indicated by its name. Other than 
that contained in the table, the Office has no information. 
WYOMING. 
Wyoming Institution for the Blind and the Deaf, Cheyenne, Wyo.—Through the courtesy 
of George C. Rafter, Esq., of Cheyenne, the Office has been put in possession of the 
following facts in regard to this as yet unopened institution: The Legislature of 
1886 appropriated $8,000 to defray the expenses of a school for the blind and deaf for 
+wo years, providing that the school should not be opened until an attendance of 12 
was assured. The commission to whom the plan and the money were entrusted did 
not delay to purchase a block of land and erect a suitable building, which is now 
ready for use. The next Legislature will be asked to remove the condition of open- 
ing and to provide liberally to carry on the work.

ce Dr. G. O. Fay stated at the Eleventh Convention of American Instructors of the Deaf that the ratio, 
speaking generally, is three males to two females, é. e., 60 to 40 in the hundred. 
During the interval from 1882-83 to 1886-87 the table shows that the net increase in 
the number of schools has been 9. It remains to indicate how this increase has ob- 
tained. Of the 65 schools in the table for 1886-87, 14 have been established since 
1883; 6 of them State or Territorial institutions, 5 ‘day schools, 1 a private boarding 
school, and 2 schools for the instruction of children of Catholic parents. To these 
are to be added the recently founded public institutions in Wyoming and Texas, both 
dual institutions. Five schools in the table of 1882-83 do not appear in that of the 
present report. They are located respectively at Baltimore, Md., Marquette, Mich., 
St. Joseph, Mo., and Erie, Pa., while the oral department of the Pennsylvania institu- 
tion is not now, as it was in 1882-83, reported separately. Four of the schools estab- 
lished during this interval use the oral method exclusively; 3 of them belong to the 
public school system of the town or city in which they are situated.

838 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
Il.—EDUCATION OF THE BLIND. 
I.—GENERAL REMARKS. 
New institutions and buildings.—Threo institutions for the blind have been estab- 
lished during the year. Two, the Wyoming and Texas institutions—the latter for 
colored persons—are also for the deaf, and one, the Alabama Academy for the Blind, 
was formerly the blind department of the Alabama Institution for the Deaf and 
Dumb and the Blind. Neither the Texas nor the Wyoming school was in operation 
during the year. In Pennsylvania a number of gentlemen of Pittsburg, in order to 
render available a legacy of $20,000, have set about raising additional funds for the 
establishment of a western Pennsylvania school, but the Office is uninformed as to - 
the result of their exertions. In Kentucky the department created in 1884 for tho 
education of the blind colored children of the State was opened October 4, 1886. At 
Roxbury, Boston, a brick building large enough to accommodate 35 or 40 pupils is in 
process of construction on a recently purchased lot of 6 acres, and will be opened dur- 
ing 1887 as the kindergarten department of the Perkins institution. Three lots and 
a commodious building have been secured for the Oregon school. 
The Perkins institution continues to be the New England school for the blind ; New 
Jersey and Delaware still send their blind to the Pennsylvania institution, nine and 
three, respectively, and the District of Columbia has pupils at the Maryland school. 
Higher education.—The effort to secure a college for the blind continues unabated, 
and at the last biennial meeting of the instructors a committee of thirty-three was 
appointed to carry on the agitation of the subject. It is proposed to ask Congress to 
incorporate an institution for the higher education of the blind, such as has already 
been established for the deaf (see p. 840, Convention). At the instance of Superinten- 
dent Anagnos, the board of directors of the Perkins institution has taken steps in the 
organization of a post-graduate course in that institution, for those who have shown 
marked talent and capacity for higher attainment in any important branch of study 
or art. 
Printing for the blind.—The radical difference of opinion as to the relative merits of 
the “line” and the point systems of printing for the blind still continues (see p. 840, 
Convention), and, to accommodate the friends of each system, the annual income 
from the national fund is expended in equal parts in producing the same work in dif- 
ferent type. As between the point systems of printing and writing known as the 
Braille and the New York, the latter bids fair to become the American system, al- 
though it has not been so generally favored here as the Braille has been in Eng- 
land and on the Continent. Editions of seven works—“ Pilgrims Progress,” ‘ Imita- 
tion of Christ,” “In His Name,” ete.—have been printed and distributed within the 
last few years by the Society for Providing Evangelical Religious Literature for the 
Blind, which also publishes a Sunday-school paper having a circulation of 1,000; 
andthe American Bible Society has published during the year an edition of the Psalms 
in New York point. All these have been printed by the American Printing House, at 
Louisville, Ky., the great printing centre for the blind. At the printing office of the 
Perkins institution, which has recently been supplied with a new press, Scott’s Tal- 
isman, in two volumes, the New Testament, in three, and two volumes of an edition 
of Dickens's David Copperfield have been printed in raised type. 
Workshops for the blind.—Self-support in after life being the purpose for which 
manual instruction is given to blind pupils, the result is a matter of great interest 
to their instructors. If, after the time and money devoted to mental and industrial 
instruction, the great majority of the pupils become severally an educated rather than 
an. illiterate burden on individuals or the community, merely from failure to make 
the vocations they have learned profitable, or from inability to obtain employment, 
it would seem doubly economical to drop the manual feature if, on examination, 
the cause of the evil be found irremediable. Touching this, Superintendent Chapin 
of the Pennsylvania institution, who has been familiar with the subject for the last 
40 years, says: “‘In due time these young and elderly mechanics [pupils taught at his 
institution], having perfected their trades, are honorably discharged, some to their 
own homes, others to seek their fortunes in our larger towns. They apply for em- 
ployment at the large manufactories and dealers, but are disappointed. There is not 
an establishment that will receive a blind man for employment. With the eption 
of those who succeed at their own homes in the country districts, there is very little 
hope for employment elsewhere for blind mechanics.” Very much the same condition 
of affairs exists in England, on the competent authority of Dr. Armitage,! and did ex- 
ist in Saxony and other parts of Germany until the ‘‘ Saxon system ” introduced, 
This system consists in the institution’s keeping up a permanent connection with its 
former pupils. For this purpose there is an annual fund of about $7,500 derived from

invested fands, subscriptions, and the sale of work done by the pupils in the institu- 
tion, When the pupil leaves the school, the director goes to his intended place of 
residence and secures the promise of a clergyman, the mayor, or some manufacturer 
to recommend and advise the future citizen, and to keep the director informed about 
him. When a pupil leaves, his outfit consists of a bed, clothing, tools, and material 
for his trade; all of which have been paid for out of his savings. Raw material is 
sent at wholesale prices on demand. 
Differences of nationalinstitutions and the large extent of territory militate against 
the adoption of this system here, and the result is being accomplished in another 
way. In the workshop, or working home, for the blind provision is made not only 
for former pupils of institutions who can not support themselves, but also for the 
Jarge number of those who, losing their sight after maturity, seek to learn some handi- 
eraft by which they can support themselves. Of this class of institutions the Penn- 
sylvania Working Home for Blind Men was the first. In 1875, the year of its open- 
ing, 13,900 brooms were made by its six inmates, and the sales amounted to $4,600 ; 
for the year 1886 the 105 inmates made 373,294 brooms, and the sales were $60,827.11. 
The inmates are charged $2.50 a week for board, which is deducted from their earn- 
ings, which in all amounted to $15,688 during 1886. The State appropriates $10,000 
for maintenance and the city $1,000, while legacies and donations swell the total for 
1886 to $17,000. In 1885, when there were 123 blind persons connected with the in- 
stitution, of whom 24 wore unskilled persons admitted during the year, the average 
loss for each was $33.80. Dr. Armitage computes the average amount given by the 
Dresden, Saxony, institution at $25. 
Convention.—The American Association of Instructors of the Blind held its ninth 
biennial meeting at the New York Institution for the Blind, New York City, July 6 
to 8, 1886, with an attendance of 43 delegates representing 24 institutions. Mr. 
Wait, superintendent of the New York institution, in welcoming the association 
briefly reviewed its life. The first convention, at which fourteen out of sixteen schools 
were represented, was held in 1853, the next, the first of the current series, in 1871, 
since which the association has met regularly at biennial intervals. Mr. J. F. Me- 
Elroy, in bis paper on “ Building for the Blind,” advocated the subordination of 
architectural beauty to the requirements of the use the building is to be put to. As 
the noise of piano tuning and practice ‘is one of the most Patines nuisances,” the 
isolation of such sounds becomes highly desirable. In the Michigan school the eigh- 
teen rooms for piano practice occupy wings and are on the sides most remote from the 
large open court in the rear of the main building and from its centre. The corri- 
dors of these wings are shut off from the main corridors by doors and heavy brick 
walls. The floors are concreted over a false flooring, upon which is laid a covering 
of ash, terminating at the partitions of the room, in order to prevent vibration. The 
partitions are double and are filled with ‘‘ mineral wool,” a hair-like mass of silica, 
which is almost impervious to sound and vermin, Mr. McElroy predicts the gradual 
downfall of the ‘‘old congregate dormitory system,” ‘‘the indiscriminate herding 
of pupilsinto one room,” throug the provision for comfortable private rooms for pupils, 
and he urges such provision as tending to remove the reproach that institutional life 
tends to educate the children out of sympathy with their homes. Another point of con- 
struction specially relating to the blind (it is only such that space will permit here) is 
the important one of separating the sexes. If the sexes are completely separated, the 
building must be constructed to prevent communication ; if they are to meet during 
recitation, such rooms must be centrally located and approaches must be arranged to 
prevent intermingling in coming and going. In the discussion that ensued Mr. Ole- 
mnent said he would supplant the congregate with the cottage system, aset of cottages 
for each sex. 
Doctor Anagnos in his paper on “ Workshops for the Blind,” after speaking of the 
splendid achievements of the institutions for the blind, continued thus: ‘With all 
this success and progress, however, there is a proportion of blind adults, who can not 
maintain themselves by their unassisted labor. What shall be done with these 
classes? * *. * Of the various measures which are proposed * * * the estab- 
lishment of special asylums or workshops for both sexes seems to be recommended on 
all sides.” But Dr. Anagnos would not have men and women herded together as in an 
asylum ; he would give them an opportunity to support themselves in commodious and. 
well-equipped workshops; he would pay them in cash and leave them ‘‘to the whole- 
some responsibility of taking care of themselves.” These industrial auxiliary institu- 
tions should be locatedin large cities where aready market obtains, they should be 
non-political and non-sectarian, should offer high salaries to officers, should encourage 
the blind workman to remain at home by “ransacting his business for him, and finally 
should have a permanent fand, the interest of which should be devoted to eking out the 
earnings of those who can not support themselves by their labor. Two cardinal prin- 
ciples must never be departed from in endeavoring to ameliorate the condition of the

blind: they must be dispersed in general society and subjected to the ordinary influ- 
ences of life; and the sexes should be strictly and absolutely separated. Mr. Chapin’s 
paper dealt with the difficulty of the blind workman in procuring employment (see p. 
838, Workshops for the Blind) and the hygienic necessity of work to him. He advocated 
an industrial establishment for the blind on the model, with a few modifications, of 
the Pennsylvania Working Home for Blind Men (see p. 839). This paper was followed 
by one from Mr. Hall, superintendent of the home just referred to, descriptive of the 
character of that institution. Mr. Huntoon thought the question of providing for the 
adult blind not germane to the education of youth, while Mr. Wait considered itas quite 
legitimate by reason of its being a legacy that had come down with the ether princi- 
ples borrowed or inaugurated by the pioneers in the work of educating the American 
blind. “Every Institution,” says the resolution of the First Convention, ‘should 
afford employment to all its graduates of good moral character.” The experience of 
his own institution proved this to be impracticable, and the necessity must be met by 
the incorporation of private associations for the purpose of furnishing employment to 
the blind workman, and of intruding their care into his private affairs only so far as 
his inability to care for himself demands. Statistics show that in 1879, of 307 biind 
persons in the almshouses of the State of New York, 88 per cent. had lost their sight 
after their twentieth year, and that 87 per cent. had pursued some useful or skilled 
occupation before losing their sight; of the 1,200 persons who had been instructed at 
the New York institutions only 21 were in the almshouse at the above date. At the 
close of the discussion Mr. Battles introduced the following : 
“Whereas, deaf-mutes and the blind require entirely different methods of educa- 
tion, and whereas a number of States co-educate these two defective classes, 
“ Resolved, This association disapproves such co-education.” 
The resolution was unanimousiy adopted. The session was then closed by Mr. 
Battles’s paper on ‘‘ The Powers, Duties, and Responsibilities of the Superintendent,” 
ae a vote of confidence in the Society for Providing Evangelical Literature for tho 
lind. 
Mr. Huntoon, in his paper entitled ‘“‘The General Character of the Embossed 
Literature which the Schools for the blind Demand,” had the purpose “briefly to 
summarize what the [American] Printing House has already done,” and to protest 
against the purchase of apparatus with a part of the income irom the Congressional 
fund for printing embossed books. Speaking of the point. system, Mr. Huntoon re- 
marked: “The points have come to stay, and they have come to dominate.” Mr, Hall 
acknowledged that he had been converted to the New York point system. Mr. Dow 
trusted that it would soon become the system universally used. Mr. Battles said that 
the boys of the Pennsylvania institution averaged in reading only twenty-eight words 
a minute, while in the New York institution (Mr. Wait’s, the author of the New York 
point system) the average was about sixty-three, although, so he stated, the com- 
parison between the schools was hardly fair as a test of the relative merits of the 
systems on account of the conditions under which the trial was made at Philadelphia. 
Mr. Wait thought that the sentiment of the profession is uniting, and the sooner it is 
decided that the funds of the American Printing House shall be expended upon books 
of one character of type the greater will be the supply of literature for the blind. 
Mr. Babcock considered the point as greatly superior to the line in tangible power, 
and that the one system should be the New York point. Mr. Harvey said he would be 
glad to know that all the books from the American Printing House were to be in point 
printing, which, on the principle of the greatest good to the greatest number, should be 
adopted. On the other side, Mr. Graves maintained that children complained to him 
that they could not read the point as long as they could the line, because their ‘‘ sense 
of touch becomes weak,” and Mr. Wood did not think that the test referred to by Mr. 
Battles was at all final. 
Mr. Wait, in his address on the important question of ‘(A College for the Blind,” said 
that as the kindergarten and the university were the educational extremes, as the 
blind had shown their ability to follow with advantage the higher studies—witness 
Saunderson, mathematician and successor of Newton at Cambridge; Foster, pro- 
fessor at the same university and postmaster-general; Nelson, of New York, professor 
of languages; and Carll, blind graduate of Columbia College, New York, and author of 
the ‘Calculus of Variations”—and as blindness is a bar to those vocations to the prac- 
tice of which light and sight are indispensable, and as our public policy récognizes 
higher education as being the right of all who are competent to receive it, ‘‘is it too 
much to ask that those who must work in darkness shall be giyen special facilities 
for enlarging the contracted sphere of their opportunities and for preparing them to 
do their work well?” To those who would have the blind enter the colleges for the 
seeing, Mr. Wait responds by saying that experience has shown it is impracticable} the 
difficulties that Mr. Carll surmounted, aided by the most favoring surroundings, outside 
of the class room, would prove fatal to the progress of the majority. During the last 
day of the session (July 8) it was resolved by the association: ‘‘(1) That in the judgment 
of this association, an institution for the higher education of the blind has become a

pressing necessity for theintellectual, professional, and moral advancement of the blind. 
of this country; (2) that this association warmly endorses the efforts of those earnest 
friends of the blind, who have, by unwearied endeavor, sought to establish such an 
institution; (3) that a committee of nine! be appointed from this association to take 
up and carry forward this work on behalf of the association, said committee to be ap- 
pointed by the chair.” After the passage of the resolutions, papers were read by Mrs. 
Little on ‘‘ Methods of Teaching,” and Mr. Dow on ‘The Idiosyneracies of the Blind.” 
Mrs. Little spoke of the great difficulties under which the congenital or practically 
congenital blind pupil labored in acquiring ideas, and of the assistance they derived 
from the objective methods of the kindergarten, and advocated the employment of 
tangible apparatus in the higher grades. ‘The study of geometry is especially valua- 
ble, as it affords the blind pupil the best means “of acquiring the power of forming 
a correct conception from a verbal description.” 
Meeting of the board of trustees of the American Printing House for the Blind.—This 
body, composed of the superintendengs of the institutions for the ,blind, held its an- 
nual meeting July 7, 1886, at the New York institution, New York City. After some 
discussion, Mr. Graves, of the Alabama institution, who presented a proxy from Mr. 
Johnson, principal of that institution, was admitted as a trustee by a vote of 10 to 7. 
Mr. Dow then introduced the following resolution: ‘‘That requisitions by any insti- 
tution for the blind upon the American Printing House for the Blind, for books or 
tangible apparatus, printed or constructed elsewhere than at the American Printing 
House for the Blind, shall be duly honored, provided that such requisitions do not 
exceed 20 per cent. of the income from the subsidy fund of the Institution making such 
requisition.” An amendment to strike out 20 and insert 25 per cent. was lost by a 
vote of 10 to 8. The original question then coming up, Mr. Huntoon opposed the res- 
olution, as it “ would cripple materially the resources and the business affairs of the 
American Printing House.” After an extended debate the resolution was passed by 
a vote of 14 to 5.2 
II.—NorEes FROM CATALOGUES AND REPORTS OF INSTITUTIONS. 
ALABAMA. 
Alabama Academy for the Blind, Talladega, Ala.—Although this school entered 
upon its life as a separate institution in February, 1887, the source from which the 
following facts are taken covers a period previous to that event. In the literary de- 
partment the course is continued above the common school studies, and in the de- 
partment of music instruction is given on the piano, organ, violin, etc., and in the 
theory of music’ and in harmony. The print used is the Braille, New York point, 
and pin-type. Although the boys are employed in manufacturing mats, mattresses, 
etc., the object of the school is to prepare as many of its students as possible as in- 
structors in literature and music. In order to secure competency the senior pupils 
are required to teach several hours every week. 
ARKANSAS. 
Arkansas School for the Blind, Little Rock, Ark.—This school opened in 1860 with 10 
pupils in attendance. In 1870 the attendance was 38, in 1880, 32, and in 1886, 63. The 
‘frail, dangerous, and unsightly wooden shells” formerly used as school rooms and 
dormitories have been demolished, and a handsome and commodious structure of 
brick erected, lighted by gas and heated by steam, capable of accommodating 120 chil- 
dren, and permitting a complete separation of the sexes. An annual appropriation 
of $500 is asked to enable the superintendent to supply worthy indigent pupils with 
the tools necessary to the successful prosecution of the trade they have learned in the 
school. After the kindergarten, the benefits of which are marked, the schoolis class- 
ified in 4 grades, each of 2 divisions; in the highest grade the course is academic. In 
the music department 37 pupils have received instruction on the piano, 11 on the or- 
gan, and 8 on other instruments, while 10 have been taught thorough-bass and har- 
mony, and 6 tuning. In the industrial department shoe and brush making have been 
added to broom and mattress making, and it is expected soon to add willow work. 
' Subsequently increasod to 33, 2 The local board of trustees of the American Printing Houso for the Blind having asked an opinion from the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States as to the legality of this resolution, the First Comptroller of the Treasury, under date of March 12, 1887, responded as follows: ‘It is my opinion that the act authorizes the trustees to use the fund set apart by the act for the purchase of the sup- plies mentioned through the American Printing Houso for the Blind, at Louisville, Ky., alone; that said trustees are not authorized by the act to make such purchase from other sources, as it appears = * * a majority of the trustees think they have a right to do, and that such a diversion of the fand would be unlawful.” ‘the fund hero referred to is that established by Congress.

COLORADO. 
Colorado Mute and Blind Instituie, Colorado Springs, Colo.—Of the 23 blind chil- 
dren that have entered the institution, only one was born blind. The line and the 
point print are used, and vocal and instrumental music are taught to those compe- 
tent to derive benefit from the instruction. Very little manual training is attempted 
in the blind department as yet. An appropriation of $500 is asked for the purchase 
of the necessary machinery to introduce broom-making and carpet-weaving. 
ILLINOIS. 
Iinois Institution for the Education of the Blind, Jacksonville, 111.—During the 2 
years covered by the report, great effort bas been made to find the blind persons in 
the State that were not in the institution though entitled to enjoy the benefits that 
it offers. Although 7,000 letters were sent to persons most likely to furnish the in- 
formation, the correspondence did not result in increasing the attendance, forcing 
the trustees to the conclusion that all are in the school that are entitled to its priv- 
ileges, or that non-attendants are not to be discovered in their retreats. In the liter- 
ary department the course carries the pupil through and beyond the common school 
studies; in the musical department piano-tuning is taught to those capable of profit- 
ing by the instruction; and in the industrial section broom-making, cane-seating, and. 
mattress-making are taught. 
INDIANA. 
Indiana Institution for the Education of the Blind, Indianapolis, Ind.—Of the 130 
pupils in this school, October 31, 1886, 32 per cent. were born with their infirmity. 
Sixty per cent. were not totally devoid of sight, the cases shading down from those 
unable to distinguish form to those only and barely able to distinguish light fron 
darkness. The object of theliterary department, consisting of 6 grades, is to give the 
pupil a sound English education ; all are instructed in music, and special instruction 
is given to those showing talent ; 12 pupils receive instruction on the cabinet or pipe 
organ, 69 on the piano-forte, and 18 are individually instructed in voice culture. To 
prepare students intending to become music teachers, ‘‘ normal teaching exercises” 
are given, in order that they may anticipate and rectify any deficiency that might in- 
terfere with the practice of their future vocation. Piano-tuning receives the atten- 
tion its importance demands and the inadequate facilities will admit of. Broom- 
making and cane-seating are the only industries that the blind workman can rely 
on, and are taught from 1 to 3 hours daily. 
TOwA. 
College for the Blind, Vinton, Iowa.—This institution was established that the citi- 
zens of the State might have for their blind children advantages similar to those of- 
fered by the public schools. In view of this, the difference between this school and 
the public schools has been reduced as much as possible, the course of study covering 
twelve years—four primary, four grammar, and four academic. The system of goy- 
ernment is dual. A principal has charge of the pupils, the educational apparatus, 
and the building and its domestics, while a secretary has charge of the property and 
employés outside of the college building, and of the buying and selling. ‘‘ This sys- 
tem,” says the principal, ‘is eminently satisfactory to the secretary and myself.” 
KENTUCKY. 
Kentucky Institution for the Blind, Louisville, Ky.—Earnest efforts have been made 
during the year to acquaint parents with the character of the school, and not with- 
out results. The pupils are required to exercise daily in light gymnastics. On en- 
tering they become members of the kindergarten, where the sense of form and touch 
are educated. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Perkins Institute for the Blind, Boston, Mass.—The family system of this institu- 
tion has prevented the evil effects of crowded quarters, but the institution has 
reached the limit of its capacity, and has been compelled to refuse several eligible 
applicants. In the literary department the pupils are divided into small classes and 
receive a certain amount of individual instruction in a simple and natural way. The 
course in natural science consists of zodlogy, followed by botany and physiology. 
Throughout this course the teacher’s explanations are supplemented by models, and 
clay is largely used to enable the pupil to form his ideas correctly. “We know that

a girl understands the articulation of the skull and the vertebral column when she 
can take a bit of clay and show it.” In the music department 88 pupils received in- 
struction on the piano, 10 on the organ, 6 on the violin, and 27 on brass or reed in- 
struments; 25 received individual instruction in vocal music, and 38, divided into 7 
classes, studied harmony. A full and systematic course of training is given in the 
tuning section, which is splendidly equipped for the study of musical acoustics and 
for the development of mechanical proficiency, the pupil receiving instruction in the 
theory of scales, harmonics, beats, and temperaments, and then, by the use of models 
and the dissection of instruments, in the construction of the piano and its repair. 
The trades taught at the institution are cane-seating, broom and mattress making, 
and upholstering furniture. 
MISSOURI. 
Missouri School for the Blind, St. Louis, Mo.—The principal events in this insti- 
» tution for the biennial period, 1884-86 are a radical change in its discipline, subject- 
ing its inmates to rules of conduct that are consistent with its character as a pnblic 
school, and the addition of a kindergarten. The talent of the pupils in the musical 
department was not such as to produce high results, but there is every reason to be- 
lieve that the high standard of years past will soon be reached. The superintendent 
is inclined to think that the industrial rather than the music department is that 
from which the most benefit is derived, since for every one of the many good musi- 
cians instructed by the school ten workmen have been turned out capable of making 
salable brooms and brushes. Superintendent Sibley suggests as good policy that 10 
acres be purchased in the suburbs of Saint Louis, and that a new institution be built 
on the cottage plan.    
  NEW YORK. 
New York State Institution for the Blind, Batavia, N. Y.—Of the 163 blind children 
in the institution during the year 11 per cent. were born so, the other cases resulting 
mostly from inflammation or accident. The literary department, in which both the 
line and point are used, consists of five grades, of which the last two are academic; 
kindergarten instruction is also given. In the department of music, 11 pupils re- 
ceived instruction on the organ and 88 on the piano; 28 were taught harmony and 
almost all were in the singing classes. In the industrial department 18 pupils were 
taught broom-making, 5 of whom acquired the trade and left the school, 12 were 
taught mattress-making, and 24 cane-seating. Three of the 27 scholars instructed in 
tuning left the institution to engage in business. 
NORTH CAROLINA. 
   
                 
    
    
        
    
      North Carolina Institution for the Deaf and Dumb and the Blind, Raleigh, N. C.—The 
literary division of the blind department has a curriculum in which studies of an 
academic grade are included. Although the liberality of Congress has well supplied 
the school with books, it lacks the apparatus and appliances that are essential to the 
instruction of the blind. A kindergarten and a gymnasium are also required. Inthe department of music instruction is given, mainly to prepare for teaching, in vocal 
culture and harmony, and on the piano and organ. In the industrial division, in 
which are 11 boys, cane-seating, broom and mattress making are taught for 2 hours daily. 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
   
            
          
         
       
              Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, Philadelphia, Pa.—In the 
literary department there are 88 classes for males and 67 for females, an average of 
5.6 pupils in each; in the music and work departments the teaching is, in general, in- 
dividual. A large majority of the students are pursuing the common school studies, 
some 14 or 15 studying algebra, astronomy, and political economy, and 22 literature; 
34 are in the kindergarten. In the music department 67 are receiving instruction on 
the piano, 15 on the organ, 26 on the violin, and 74 in the theory of music, and 22 in 
piano-tuning. In the vocal classes there are 105 pupils. It is in these classes, says 
the superintendent, that a foundation for that further education by the music depart- 
ment is given that has enabled its pupils and graduates to obtain positions again and 
again, though competing with seeing persons. The tuning department continues to 
receive the attention that its importance demands. In the industrial department 
broom and mattress making and cane-seating are pursued. The Legislature has been 
asked to leave the duration of the pupils’ residence to the discretion of the board of 
trustees. «

  844 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
TEXAS. 
Texas Institution for the Blind, Austin, Tex.—Increased facilities are needed in each of 
the three departments of the school, caused by the increase of its students. ‘The chil- 
dren are prepared in the kindergarten for the regular course which consists of the 
usual common school studies, English literature, and elementary science; both the 
line and point print are used. Nearly all the pupils are given an opportunity to study 
music, but failure to make progress after a fair trial is deemed sufficient proof that 
further exertions would be useless; the number regularly receiving musical instruc- 
tion rarely exceeds one-half the enrolment. Broom-making is a satisfactory business 
in Texas, but brush-making, carpet-weaving, and upholstering are unprofitable. To 
stimulate and encourage the boys to overcome the natural propensity of the blind to 
sedentary habits and consequent indisposition to work, the superintendent has intro- 
duced a system of remunerating the pupil-worker, the pay he receives being about 
the same as would have been given him in a broom factory.

¢ Georgia and Maryland. 2 
d Represented here by Oregon. 
Of the 3 institutions established since 1883, not including the dual institutions 
recently established in Wyoming and Texas, two are dual, a form that several times 
has been publicly objected to by the convention of American Instructors of the Blind 
(see p. 840, Convention), but which is especially necessary, perhaps, in thinly settled 
countries. The Alabama Academy, appearing here for the first time, was formerly the 
blind department of an institution of this dual class. No comparisons have been in- 
stituted or percentages obtained in which the number of ‘“ instructors and other em- 
ployés” would have been a factor.. In several cases the answer given in the return has 
been the number of teachers, and the fact stated, while in other cases it is probable 
that the same thing has been done without indicating it. In the future the inquiry 
will be ‘number of instructors.” With the exception of the school for colored blind 
and deaf persons of Maryland and the department for the blind of the North Carolina 
school, it has been found impossible to separate the financial affairs of the dual insti- 
tutions, and reference is made to #he table for the deaf where receipts and expenditures, 
etc., are given for the whole institution. To prevent a fictitious increase or the re- 
verse in receipts the Office has, in the tables by States arranged by divisions, assumed 
the appropriation to have been the total amount received. In computing the per 
capita expenditure and valuation of Table 80, the number of the pupils in attendance 
at institutions whose expenditure or property valuation is not given has not been 
included in the division when computing the percentage.

    850 e _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
II.—EDUCATION OF THE FEEBLE-MINDED. 
I.—GENERAL REMARKS, 
New institutions.—The act of March 5, 1885, establishing an institution for feeble- minded youth in Nebraska recites that, ‘“‘ Besides shelter and protection the prime 
object ot the said institution shall be to provide special means of improvement for that unfortunate portion of the community who were born or by disease have become im- 
becile or feeble-minded, and by a well adapted course of instructiun reclaim them from their helpless condition, and through the development of their intellectual facul- 
ties fit them as far as possible for usefulness in society. To this end there shall be 
furnished them such agricultural and mechanical education as they may be capable 
of receiving.” By the provisions of the act the institution was to be located near 
Beatrice, on the condition that not less than 40 acres of land were to be conveyed to 
the State by that city. Fifty thousand dollars were appropriated to construct build- 
ings, and’ an annual tax authorized, not to exceed one-eighth of a mill, to support 
the institution. Children of indigent parents have transportation furnished them 
and are clothed ; the age limitation is5to18, The institution was opened on May 25, 
1887, but will really begin its work in September next. 
The institution heretofore known as the Indiana Soldiers’ Orphans’ Home and Asy- 
lum for Feeble-Minded Children is reported this year as the Indiana School for Feeble- 
Minded Youth. ' The immediate cause of separation appears to have been the destruc- 
tion by fire of the main building of the dual institution, necessitating the removal of 
the orphange to temporary quarters in Knightstown, while the feeble-minded children 
were accommodated in a 4-room school-house on the grounds of the institution near 
that place, from which they were removed to Richmond, Ind., on May 17, 1887, to 
await the completion of a building for them at Fort Wayne. In June, 1886, an insti- 
tution was established by Dr. Samuel J. Fort, its principal, at Ellicott City, Md., and 
is strictly a private school, having as yet had no assistance from outside sources. 
Convention.—The tenth annual session of the Association of Medical Officers of 
American Institutions for Idiotic and Feeble-Minded Persons convened at Syracuse, 
N. Y., September 29, 1836,! and continued in session 3 days. Of the several resolu- 
tions adopted the following is of importance in an educational sense in view of the 
legislative action that has been taken regarding its subject matter as a public school 
study: 
“Whereas, the members of this association are convinced from their observation 
and the records of their institutions that a large percentage of idiocy and feeble- 
mindedness is due to the transmitted effect of aleohol: Therefore, 
“‘ Resolved, That it is their conviction that, together with the educational trainin 
of the young in the avoidance of the evils of intemperance, there should be some legal 
repression upon the indiscriminate sale of intoxicating beverages.” 
n his inaugural address Dr. Powell, of the Iowa Institution, after briefly tracing 
the progress of the establishment of institutions for the imbecile, urged their 
necessity and the amplification of their scope. At his own institution (as in several 
others) a division into two departments—educational and asylum—obtains, and the 
utter helplessness of the inmates of the latter makes it the duty of superintendents 
to ask separate provision for them adapted to their low grade of intelligence. For the 
“large number” who have not adequate ability to cope with the world, the institu- 
tion should be a ‘‘life-school for its inmates, thereby preventing the transmission of 
infirmities to a still more degraded progeny ;” and the step taken in establishing the 
custodial institution at Newark, N. Y. (see page 852), is being followed at the Pennsyl- 
vania institution, while the visiting committee of the Iowa institution recommend 
that the care of the State institution be made perpetual. The necessity for this cus- 
tody of certain adult imbeciles was developed at length by Mrs. C. W. Brown, of 
Barre, Mass., in a paper entitled ‘‘The Future of the Educated Imbecile,” in which 
the essayist stated that ‘‘although the feeble body may be invigorated and the use- 
Jess hand trained, enabling the feeble-minded man or woman to become self-support- 
ing, no means have yet been found to strengthen the will or develop morality in the 
great majority.” Dr. George Brown, of the Barre, Mass., institution, in his paper 
entitled ‘‘ The Principles of our Work,” would answer the question, ‘‘ What is the real 
essence of our teaching the defective minds committed to us?” by saying that ‘It is 
to form habits—habits that by their repetition shall become instincts; * * * and 
these habits shall be the basis of memory.” The hope should not be held out to the 
public that training and teaching are in general likely to overcome radical defects of 
nerve organization, but what has been accomplished for such unfortunates should be

most confidently shown as evidences of the improvement that may be attained under 
the fostering care of institutions for imbeciles. In his paper ‘On a Broader Provision 
for Epileptics,” Dr. G. H. Knight, of the Connecticut institution, thought that more 
attention should be given to this class, the teaching of which is the slowest and most 
discouraging work in dn institution for imbeciles. In the 6 institutions that have 
_ made a beginning in this work 202 epileptics had been, at the time of reporting, un- 
der special treatment, 53 per cent. of whom had been improved; while 4 institutions 
together report 8.5 per cent. cured. As the other papers were of a pathological or 
personal nature, their contents would be inappropriate here.

CALIFORNIA. 
California Home for the Care and Training of Feeble-Minded Children, Santa Clara, 
Cal.—With $32,400 of the $45,000 appropriated to establish this school, a farm of 51 
acres was purchased, an old building on the place renovated, and new ones built. 
These buildings were occupied in 1885. The accommodations, however, are already 
so inadequate that applications for admission are refused, and an appropriation of 
$150,000 for additional buildings believed to be necessary. 
INDIANA. = 
Indiana School for Feeble-Minded Children, now at Richmond, Ind.—The work of 
the school has been much interfered with by the destruction of the main building, 
making it necessary to send a number of children home; the others were accommo- 
dated in a school building of 4 rooms, formerly used by the orphanage. The school- 
work consists of articulation, spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography ; 
the occupations are house work for the girls, and farm and garden work for the boys. 
KENTUCKY, 
Kentucky Institution for the Education and Training of Feeble-Minded Children, Frank- 
fort, Ky.—The pupils are instructed in the common school studies; in the industrial 
department the boys are taught carpentry and shoe-making. Of the 4 boys returned 
to their homes, 2 had made sufficient advancement to sustain themselves, 2 were 
unimprovable; of the 6 girls, 4 had so improved that their friends were glad to re- 
ceive them, 1 was placed with a respectable family, and the other dismissed as suf- 
fering with a contagious disease. The industrial feature of this school, which is 
quite marked, is more fully referred to under Manual Training (page 789, Industrial 
Training in Schools for the Feeble-Minded). 
MARYLAND, 
The Font Hill Private Institution for Feeble-Minded Children, near Ellicott City, Ma.— 
This institution, established during the summer of 1836, is situated on a farm of 90 
acres, contains twenty large and well ventilated rooms, and is lighted with gas. Dr. 
Fort, its superintendent, and his wife were formerly instructors in the Pennsylvania 
Institution for the Feeble-Minded. The object of the school is to furnish a private 
home for feeble-minded persons requiring special care, and to train those of a higher 
grade of intelligence. Kindergarten exercises are much used in school work, and, 
where practicable, the simpler studies of the common school are introduced. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Private Institution for the Education of Feeble-Minded Youth, Barre, Mass.—The pur- 
pose of the institution—the education of children not amenable to ordinary modes ; 
of instruction—is individual in its character, and is carried somewhat beyond the 
common school course by the addition of geometry, physics, and German. 
MICHIGAN. 
Wilbur Home and School for the Ieeble- Minded, Kalamazoo, Mich.—To afford an op- 
portunity to parents desirous of having their afflicted children educated in a private 
establishment, Dr. Wilbur has established this institution, with accommodations for 
30 pupils. The small number cared for permits great attention to individuals, and 
prevents the possible evils of the contact of a pupil with others more unfortunate 
than himself, ¥

          852 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
NEBRASKA. 
Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, Beatrice, Nebr.—By a series of inqui- 
ries the superintendent of this recently established institution has obtained the names 
of 614 idiotic and imbecile persons in the State, the age of 19 of whom was not ascer- 
tained. Fifty-two per cent. of those whose age was obtained were between 5 and 18, 
and 2.5 per cent. under 5. The superintendent recommends that the introduction of 
manual training be deferred until the school-room work has been well established. 
NEW YORK. 
New York State Custodial Asylum for Feeble-Minded Women, Newark, N. Y.—To ob- 
viate the evils of the promiscuous association of young women of unsound mind with 
the male inmates of the county poor-houses of New York, this institution was estab- 
lished in 1878, as a placé of custody rather than of education. The teachable inmates, 
however, are taught to sew, read, write, and do general house-work. 
New York State Asylum for Idiots, Syracuse, N. Y.—Of the 203 applications for ad- 
mission since September 30, 1884, 53 per cent., excluding the cases of whom no record 
was obtained, were of a parentage untainted by insanity, intemperance, or disease, 
and in 17 per cent. the father, or mother, or both, were said to be imbecilie, epileptic, 
orinsane. There were 5 cases having a consanguineous parentage. In the school 
there are two grades; the higher is instructed in reading, writing, and numbers; the 
lower kept occupied with peg-board, dotted pin-cushion, etc. Inmates of sufficient 
mental and physical capacity are put to work during a portion of the day at some 
occupation suited to their capacity. 
OHIO. 
Ohio Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, Columbus, Ohio.—In the language of the 
superintendent: ‘ The training of the school-rooms is simply a means to the more im- 
portant end of developing the industrial power of the children.* This has shown con- 
vineing practical results in the industrial departments here.” The work of the 
industrial department has been greatly retarded on account of insufticient accommo- 
dations caused by the pressure for admittance. 
PENNSYLVANIA, 
Pennsylvania Training School for Feeble-Minded Children, Elwyn, Pa.—At the date of 
the report 590 children were lodged in the two separate ranges of buildings of the 
institution ; the first, containing 338 girls and boys, known as the educational and 
industrial departments; the second, a third of a mile away and containing 252 chil- 
dren, as the department of the asylum, or Hillside Home. One hundred and ninety- 
two children were enrolled in 8 ‘‘ day-schools,” in which a special class of articula- 
tion was formed. In the shoe and mattress shops, the bakery, and the laundry, a 
number of the more advanced inmates are occupied, many of them supporting them- 
selves, but the greater number of the inmates are employed in agricultural and do- 
mestic service. The uniformly unsatisfactory results of placing young women in pri- 
vate homes has induced the superintendent to refuse to permit further trial of this 
system. A new carpenter-shop and a cottage for young women of slightly-impaired 
intellect are building. Superintendent Kerlin urges the desirability of separate 
provision for cases denominated as paralytic, epileptic, or moral imbeciles or idiots.

d Omitting the pupils of the California institution, as well as those in mztitutions not reporting ex- 
penditure.     
  Of the 5 schools established since the Report of 1882-83, those founded severally in 
the States of Massachusetts, Maryland, and Michigan are private, while the schools 
in Nebraska and California, respectively, are State institutions. ‘The seeming incon- 
sistency of refusing to make computations in which the number of the ‘‘teachers and 
other employés” is a factor, in the case of the blind, and yet. making that very com- 
putation here, is to be explained thus, quoting the language of the superintendent 
of the Ohio Institution in the thirtieth annual report of taat school: ‘‘ They [the 
pupils of the year] came to this Institution as to a school possessing means for their 
training and development not attainable elsewhere. It is therefore an asylum and 
hospital, as well as a temporary home and school.” vould seem, therefore, difficult 
to distinguish in such an institution between the functions of the teacher and those of 
the physician or nurse, both characters perhaps being united in the same person; to 
avoid the possible inclusion of domestics,—cooks, chamber-maids, gardeners, and 
the like,—who have nothing to do with the personal care of the children, the query 
hereafter will he “teachers and assistants.”

IV.—REFORM SCHOOLS. 
I.—GENERAL REMARKS. és 
New institution.—The only new institution for the year under review that the Office 
has record of is the Burnham Industrial Farm, Canaan Four Corners, N. Y., an in- 
stitution founded on the theory in practice at the celebrated Rauhes Haus, at Ham- 
burg, and the agricultural modification of it that exists at Mettray, near Tours. Its 
object is to receive bad but corrigible boys, to awaken in them a desire for respect- 
ability, to provide situations for them where industry will be rewarded, and, finally, 
to guard them from relapsinginto old courses, This school is established on advanced 
lines. It is in the country, surrounded by a splendid farm, has the cottage system of 
construction, the family sysiem of government, and an unobjectionable name; and 
to these high and generally recognized advaitiages the authorities would add freedom 
from the vexations arising from depending on public funds and from ‘questions of 
political control and religious interference, that have perplexed the several institu- 
tions that have been founded more or less upon these [its] ideas.” 
Classification of pupils.—One of the most important elements, if not the most im- 
portant, in reformatory education, is the removal of the offender from the influence 
of criminal associates. If all the youths detained were equally bad, or if the shades 
of their criminality varied within narrow limits, there would be little danger of con- 
tamination in congregating them. Experience and statistics testify that no such 
equality exists. In a paper read before the National Prison Association, Superin- 
tendent Gower, of the Reform School at Lansing, Mich., says: “A great majority 
of boys who come under our care are not by nature bad. * * * They have been 
deprived of those influences which a good home supplies. * * * Could they hayo 
been placed in good homes at the time they are sent to us, most of them would have 
been saved to society without the intervention of the institution.” The reform- 
atory at Lansing is conducted on the open system, but Superintendent Caldwell, of the 
House of Refuge, Louisville, Ky., an advocate of the enclosed plan, speaks to the same 
effect: ‘‘It seems to me a fair estimate to include in these two classes [those detained, 
who require care rather than reformation, and ‘the small proportion of physical, 
moral, and intellectual imbeciles’] 75 per cent. of reform-school children.”! Turn- 
ing now to the domain of statistics which the interesting and valuable table of the 
New York Iouse of Refuge permits, it appears that for the decade ending September 
30, 1886, 48 per cent. of the whole number of commitments to it were for crime, the 
other 52 per cent. for vagrancy, disorderly conduct, and the like. But it must not be 
supposed that the 48 per cent. were hardened criminals. In working the ratio the 
Office was compelled to include the number committed for petty larceny, though of 
such Superintendent Hite, of the Ohio institution, says: “It is a lamentable and noto- 
rious fact that guardians and even parents have had their children arrested * * * 
for the most trivial offences * * * . There are at the present time boys serving 
outlong sentences for taking articles * * * valued at 25 cents, for jumping on a 
railroad train while in motion, taking a small amountof scrap-iron * * * andthe 
commissions of other petty larcenies of similar insignificance.” In Great Britain this 
distinction is made and met by the establishment of two classes of schools: reform- 
atory schools for the better training of juvenile convicted offenders; industrial schools 
for vagrant and neglected children and children not convicted of theft. In the ab- 
sence of such provision here the cottage system of construction is thought to be a 
substitute, as each cottage has its own play ground, and in many instances its own 
school and place of work ; indeed, at the Ohio Industrial School 150 little boys under 
twelve are placed in a cottage half a mile from the 10 other buildings of the school, 
at Ae see the older boys except in marching to or from religious services on 
unday. 
The cottage system.—This system of construction, entailing as it does the family 
system of government, seems to be very popular. We find the board of managers of 
the House of Refuge at Philadelphia urging the State Legislature to purchase and 
convert the buildings now occupied by the school into a reformatory for men, in 
order that an agricultural reform school on the family system may be established with 
the proceeds, each family to consist of 30 or 40, thus removing “the objectionable 
feature of the congregate system, where large numbers are confined within high 
walls and prison-like appliances.” At the recently established Burnham Industrial 
Farm, pupilsare placed ‘in cottages with not more than 15 or 20 under one roof, so that 
by separation into small families a close personal supervision may be maintained,” and 
the management of the Lyman School for Boys felicitates itself upon the success of 
a recent change from the congregate to the cottage plan. As to the economy of 
small buildings the statement of the board of control of the State Industrial Home 
for Girls, Michigan, is pertinent: ‘‘ We find the large building, erected as an experi-

ment, * * * no more economical, much more difficult to manage properly, and 
Jess satisfactory in every way than the smaller ones,” while the board of trustees of 
the Maine State Reform School, speaking of the system of cottages there, says that 
“it does cogt more, but it is worth more.” : 
There are various modifications of this system. In some instances each family has 
its own school and work, while in others there is a general dining-room, and family 
distinctions do not exist during work or school hours, so as not to interfere with grad- 
ing; in others a spirit of emulation is evoked, and the family connection is a sign 
or distinction or the reverse. Perhaps no school on the cottage plan surpasses in 
wealth of land or buildings the Ohio school, which has afarm of over 1,000 acres, and 
nine cottages arranged in a semicircle around the main building, in addition to the 
distant cottage for little boys referred to above. 
Results of reformatory training.—As so large a percentage of the inmates of reforma- 
tory institutions are not of the criminal class, it would be, quoting the language of 
Superintendent Caldwell in the address before referred to, ‘disingenuous * * * to 
claim credit for reformation in such cases.” When it is said, therefore, that 80 per 
cent. or 90 per cent. of the pupils who leave an institution are doing well, it must be 
borne in mind thatif all had become respectable members of society, from half to three- 
fourths of them had never seriously, if at all, attacked it. In such cases the institu- 
tion can claim only that it had received and instructed them when surrounded by 
every circumstance tending to facilitate an entry ona criminal career. The source of 
the statistics that are not rough approximations as to the life the former pupil is lead- 
ing, is the information derived from the reports of the agent of the institution. During 
the year 1886, 261 boys were discharged from the House of Refuge at Philadelphia, who 
with those still on the agent’s list from previous years made a total of 328, of whom 
nearly 97 per cent. were located in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. To or 
about these, 775 letters were written and 723 visits made, and from the information 
thus obtained the agent estimates that 90 per cent. were doing well—a percentage 
confirmatory of the estimate of his predecessor. In New Jersey the agent visited 686 
of the boys who had left the State institution,and grades them 21 per cent. doing “‘ very 
well,” 56 per cent. ‘‘ well,” 19 per cent. ‘not well,” and 4 per cent. “badly.” Be- 
sides these, the agent made 325 visits during the year, mainly to ascertain the char- 
acter of the surroundings of the homes of the boys in the institution, or to have friends 
secure suitable employment for those ready to go out. It is a part of the duty of the 
assistant superintendent of the House of Refuge of Cincinnati to report monthly con- 
cerning the children paroled or released from that institution, From 1881 to 1886, 
1,044 children had been paroled, of whom 240 had been recalled either from the unfit- 
ness of the place or pupil, 169 had been dropped on reaching majority, and 82 had 
been lost sight of or had died. Excluding these, 47 per cent, of the namber sent out, 
in other words considering the 553 that remained out, 97 per cent. are doing well and 
3per cent. badly. Inthe Nebraska school, of 62 boys and girls who have honorably 
left the school 6 have been brought back and % have relapsed into criminal courses ; the 
others, 87 per cent., have conducted themselves in a creditable mauner. In a report 
asked for by the State Board of Charities and Corrections of Michigan, W. H. Faxon, 
a county agent of that State, says: ‘‘Within the past year I have secured homes for 
about 30 boys from the reform school at Lansing on leave of absence * * * 3; the 
boys are all doing well.” Tho former practice of visiting children indentured to per- 
‘sons in the neighborhood of New York City has been resumed by the New York House 
of Refuge, and the information from this source, and from corresponding frequently 
with masters, parents, and guardians, confirms the superintendent’s estimate ‘that 
upwards of 80 per cent, of the children are reformed through the instrumentality of 
this [his] institution.” Considering the subsequent career of nearly 2,000 persons who haye gone through the course of the Indiana School for Boys, the superintendent says: “The most careful estimates show that nearly 90 per cent. have become good citizens; 
Of pester 10 per cent. some have done moderately well, and still others have done badly. 
Reformatories for men.—Of the two systems of prison discipline that have originated 
in this country, that known to the French and English investigators sent here to report 
upon their respective merits as the Auburn or silent system, has, though modified be- 
yond recognition, supplanted the Philadelphia or solitary confinement plan. In practi- 
cally isolating the criminal, an expedient of Quaker origin, reflection and religious in- 
struction were the reformatory agencies, a course occasionally resulting in madness 
or‘suicide, while on the Auburn plan, in its early days at least, no attempt was made 
at reformation, other than through the deterring effect of a hard life and a continued 
silence enforced by spontaneous lashing. Sunday instruction in writing was stopped, 
as it was found that it afforded the prisoners a very easy means of communicating. 
To these early and now decayed efforts at reform through reflection or intimidation, there has been added, during the last few years, reform by education, founded on the indefinite sentence, the love of liberty, the effects of mental effort, and a trade. There are two institutions in the United States conducted on these principles, though sey-

eral others are coming into existence. One, the State Reformatory at Elmira, N. Y., 
is pa ee its second decade, while the other, the Massachusetts Reformatory, 
Concord, Mass., has just completed its second year. 
In his report for the year 1886 the superintendent of the Detroit House of Correc- 
tion, which isnot areformatory institution, sums up the experience of 25 years of that 
institution in the following energetic and unmistakable language: ‘It must be evident 
that there is no marked success in the diminution of crime commensurate with the 
great improvement in the manner of keeping and caring for criminals. * * * This 
is clearly shown by the steady growth of an element in the community known as ‘in- 
corrigibles, * * * in whom the practice of short sentences seems to act only as 
@ good opportunity to recuperate energies wasted by debauchery.” . 
The superintendent does not stop here ; he gives the figures, and upon these the Office 
has based some computations. During the 25 years closing with 1886, 40,338 per- 
sons were sent to this prison, of whom 15 per cent. had been committed twice, 6 
per cent, three times, 12 per cent. over three but under ten times, 3 per cent. ten 
to twenty times, and 1 per cent. twenty-one to fifty-seven times. After the forty- 
third commitment the number is only one or two for each step of the notation to fifty- 
seven. Sixteen per cent were under twenty, 23 per cent. twenty to twenty-five, 18 
per cent. twenty-five to thirty ; 71 per cent. could both read and write (their facility 
is not graded), while 6 per cent. said they had had no religious instruction, 
If not to rectify, at least to improve, this condition of affairs, has been the mission 
of the Elmira Reformatory, which is charged with the custody of prisoners commit- 
ted for the first time, mostly under the Indefinite Sentence Law of 1877, between the 
ages of 16 and 30. Herein aschool of 3 sections ey corresponding to the primary, 
grammar, and high school divisions of the public schools, the prisoner is lectured 
to and catechised on political economy, American history, civil government, business 
ethivs, English literature, and physiology in the highest division, numbering 268; is 
taught arithmetic, composition, and the history of the English language in the inter- 
iediate grade, numbering 210; and reading, writing, and arithmetic in the lowest 
grade, numbering 135. The school ceased to be an experiment after the introduction 
of history, civil government, and physics, though economics, English literature, 
and physics are the most successful and lasting studies. Graded instruction in draw- 
ing, carpentry, stone-cutting, ete., is given in the evening, while many are employed 
in commercial manufacture during the day. The inmates are marked according 
to their diligence in executing their school and other tasks, and according to their 
conduct. When they have acquired a certain standing they are considered fit to be 
trusted upon parole, and they are, after each case has been duly considered, provis- 
ionally released ; the average prison life has been 20.5 months, only 7.8 per cent. re- 
maining over 3years. Of the 1,476 ‘‘indefinites ” paroled (.04 per cent. paroled twice 
and one-half of 1 per cent. three times), 59 per cent. served the probation well and 
received their release, 7 per cent. are now set'ving well on parole, in all 66 pet cent. 
known to be doing well. By estimating that one-half of those lost sight of (in all 
114) and one-half of those discharged by maximum expiration of sentence (in all 192% 
and one-third of the 125 sent out of the State have taken to criminal courses, and 
adding the number of those returned to the prison while on parole and now there, the 
superintendent finds himself entitled to say that, in all probability, 20 per cent. only 
have not been reformed by instruction at his institution. The work at the Massachu- 
setts Reformatory is far larger; there is no maximum age limit, and a con- 
vieted person may be sent to it. This reformatory may be said to have just begun 
its work. 
IL—NoreEs rrom CaTALOGUES AND REPORTS or INSTITUTIONS. 
CALIFORNIA. 
City and County Industrial School, San Francisco, Cal.—Ten per cent. of the inmates 
of this institution were committed to it because of criminal offences, almost all the 
others owing their commitment to their idle and dissolute life. Twenty per cent. were 
recommitments ; 27 per cent. had lost their fathers, and 14 per cent. were 12 years of 
age orunder, The girls’ department of the school is under the Sisters of Mercy. The 
school consists of 5 classes,in which the common school studies were pursued for 6 
hours daily for 240 days, with an average attendance of 63. The boys are taught 
shoemaking and tailoring. 
COLORADO. 
State Industrial School of Colorado, Golden, Colo.—Of the 311 inmates admitted since 
the school was opened in 1881, 29 per cent. had been committed for non-criminal acts; 
70 per cent. had been committed for 3 years; 47 per cent. were 12 years of age or unk

dex; 33 per cent had lost their fathers; 23 per cent. had previously been arrested. The — 
school is divided into 3 families and the school course into 4 grades. Instruction is 
given in carpentry, tailoring, and broom-making. Four hours 5 days weekly are de- 
voted to the school-room and 5 hours to the shop. 
CONNECTICUT. 
Connecticut State Reform School, Meriden, Conn.—Of the 4,074 commitments made 
to this school since its establishment, 38 per cent. were held on charges of incorrigi- 
bility, truancy, vagrancy, etc., and 44 per cent. were twelve years of age or under. 
“The boys that come to us,” says the superintendent, ‘are usually recruits from 
the street loiterers and corner loafers that infest our towns and cities—those who 
haye never known what honest and productive labor signified.” On the completion 
of the two cottages now building, the school will be conducted on the cottage sys- 
tem purely, the additions permitting the necessary classification. The school has a 
library of well-selected books, having been substantially aided by a gift of $1,100 
from the Hon. I. C. Lewis. Of the 419 pupils remaining in the school at the close of 
the school year 1886-87, 25 per cent. could not read or could read only in the First 
Reader, 64 per cent. could not write or wrote only easy words, and 36 per cent. knew 
nothing of arithmetic when admitted. All the boys attend school three hours for 
six days of the week for ten months. The schools are divided into ten grades, par- 
ticular attention being given to reading, writing, and arithmetic. Three hundred 
ue are employed in the six shops, three-fourths of whom are employed in caning 
chairs. 
ILLINOIS. 
Illinois State Reform School, Pontiac, l.—The 255 inmates of the Hlinois State Reform 
School were criminals in so far as indicated by the offence for which they were held. 
Thirty-seven per cent. had previously been convicted of a crime, 13 of them 5 times 
or more; 15 per cent. were 12 years of age or under. Thirty-two per cent. could not 
read or read onlyin the first reader, and 75 per cent. had never studied arithmetic or 
did not know the multiplication table. The system of reporting monthly to the par- 
ents of the pupils of the school has been very successful, a large number of parents 
taking a lively interest in such reports, and when delayed the superintendent is sure 
to receive letters inquiring the ‘reason for delay and whether the report is not up to 
required standard.” It is found that the reports are compared with those‘ obtained 
by the other children of the family who are in the public or other schools, and praise 
or blame, as the comparison may be favorable or unfavorable, is written to the pupil 
at the reform school. The boys of the institution are let out on contract and are en- 
gaged in making women’s shoes. As the contract would expire in September, 1887, 
the board of trustees urged the desirability of providing employment for the inmates, 
as otherwise they Gane nate no employment after the 4 hours of school work. The 
board does not believe that the contract is the best system, but it will be satisfied 
with its continuance, inasmuch as it is the only chance that the pupils have had to 
learn a trade during a period of life beyond which it is very difficult to learn. 
Illinois Industrial School for Girls, South Evanston, Ill.—Of the 145 girls received 
during the year, 122 had been committed, the rest being charity scholars or boarders ; 
ae half of them were 12 or under. The common. school branches and sewing are 
aught. 
INDIANA. 
Indiana Reformatory Institution for Women and Girls, Indianapolis, Ind.—This insti- 
tution has 2 departments, a penal and areformatory section. In the reformatory de- 
partment each girl is required to attend school for half of each school day, and pur- 
sues the common school studies. The manual work is domestic duties and cane-seating. 
Good homes are constantly being offered to the pupils, who are sent out on ticket of 
leave as soon as fitted for the duties they will be called upon to perform, each being 
furnished with an outfit on leaving. All money earned by her is placed to her 
eredit. The pupils sent out on ticket of leave during the year, all of whom are under 
the supervision of the authorities of the school until majority, were 34, of whom 4 had 
been returned as incompetent. Of the 38 girls committed during the year, 26 per cent. 
were 12 years old or under. 
Indiana Reform School for Boys, Plainfield, Ind.—This schoolis conducted on the cot- 
tage plan. The pupil spends half the day in working and the other half in school. 
The boys work on the farm, make bricks and lay them, but no regular industries 
have as yet been introduced. Corporal punishment can only be administered by a written order of the superintendent.

_ KENTUCKY. : : 
Louisville Industrial School of Reform, Louisville, Ky.—Of the 90 male pupils ad- 
mitted during the year, 42 per cent. were under 12, 74 per cent. had been committed 
as incorrigible, homeless, or vagrant, and 34 per cent. had lost both parents or their 
fathers. Of the 109 boys (white and colored departments) and girls received during 
the year 48 per cent. were unable to read or were just commencing the primer, and 
44 per cent? had never studied arithmetic. The course of study consists of instruc- 
tion in reading, writing, arithmetic, and geography. The industrial departments, 
though financially a success, have been ‘too limited and crude,” a condition best 
remedied by the introduction “of a more perfect manual training system.” The 
principal industries are cane-seating, followed by 107 persons; shoemaking, followed 
by 12 white boys; and farming and. gardening, followed by 15 colored boys. 
MAINE. 
State Reform School, Cape Elizabeth, Me.—Of the 1,821 boys committed to this insti- 
tution from its establishment to November 30, 1886, 30 per cent. had been committed 
as truants, runaways, idlers, etc., 40 per cent. were 12 years of age or under, and 32 per 
cent. had lost their fathers. The school instruction consists of the common school 
studies, followed by 137 inmates during the year covered by the report, under 4 in- 
structors, who in their report to the trustees observe: ‘‘ We regard school work and 
instruction as among the most‘important agencies that can be used for the reforma- 
tion of boys.” The feeling in favor of the family and cottage system at this school 
is very pronounced ; ‘‘The need of a better classification of the boys, and of the intro- 
duction of the ‘family principle,’ was felt in the early days of the institution.” A. 
well-equipped shop, enabling systematic instruction to be given to boys, is under 
the charge of an able instructor, the repairing and improvements at the school fur- 
nishing an excellent opportunity of applying the principles taught. 
MARYLAND. 
Saint Mary's Industrial School for Boys of the City of Baltimore, Baltimore, Md.—The 
total number of inmates in the institution, November 30, 1886, was 459, of whom 5 per 
cent. had not been committed. The institution is not only for youthful offenders 
against the law, street beggars, etc., but also for destitute and orphan boys. In the 
school-room the common school studies are pursued; in the rhops, printing, tailor- 
ing, shoemaking, and cigar-making. 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
Boston, Mass., Reformatory Inatitution, Decr Island, Boston Harbor.—Of the several 
public institutions for the reception of the eriminal, indigent, and vagabond classes 
on Deer Island, two, the House of Reformation and the Truant School, are for the 
class under consideration. Of the 71 persons (68 boys and 3 girls) committed during 
1886 to the House of Reformation, 32 per cent. were committed for non-criminal of- 
fences, mostly stubbornness, and 30 per cent. were under 12. Of the 103 boys com- 
mitted to the Truant School all were committed for truancy, and 86 per cent. were 10 
to 14 years of age. ‘It is doubtful,” says the chaplain and superintendent of schools 
of the Deer Island institutions, ‘‘ whether there is another penal institution in the 
land where the temporal and spiritual wants of the inmates are more liberally pro- 
vided for than in the city institutions located on this island. If the inmates could 
be classified so that the more vicious could be kept by themselves, it would greatly 
help reform,” Thero are 5 schools—4 for boys and 1 for girls—under 1 female and 4 
male instructors, and while the majority of the pupils do not loye study, there are 
many who are really bright and proficient. The number in school was 189 boys and 
8 girls, of whom 165 could “‘ read books generally.” 
State Primary School at Monson, Mass.--Of the 111 children received at the school 
during the year, 36 per cent. had been committed as juvenile offenders, the rest being 
dependent or neglected children, There has been a constant decline in the number 
of inmates for the last 8 years, which is mainly ascribed to the operation of tho 
changes made in the “settlement laws,” causing a decrease in the number of children 
received from the State alms-house. ‘he full effect of this diminution in the instal- 
ment from the alms-house in reducing the attendance, however, has been modified by 
the enforcement of the acts of 1882, relating to the care and custody of “ neglected 
and dependent children.” For the period 1879-82, the average received from the 
alms-house annually was 113, while for the next following quarterrary period the an- 
nual average was 70.5; during the latter period the annual average of neglected 
children received was 25.8, and of dependent children 21, in all an annual addition

on the average of 46.8 to the number received from the alms-house. More than 
40 boys were employed on the farm. Ail the members of the five highest schools are 
compelled to work one half of the day and attend school the other half; those in 
the lowest schools receive instruction during the whole day. The school has 8 
grades or ‘‘schools,” and a kindergarten. 
Lyman School for Boys, Westborough, Mass.—Of the fifty-nine commitments dur- 
ing the year, all but three were made by various courts of law, and to these fifty-nine 
must be added two casesof recommitment. Of the commitments 23 per cent. were 
orphans or had lost their fathers, 88 per cent. had been inmates of other institutions 
or arrested before, and 25 per cent. were 12 years of age or under; 28 boys had been 
returned and 14 had come back to the institution of their own accord; 8 escaped. 
The system followed is the ‘‘open” or cottage plan, which the buildings lately added 
now permit. Twenty-one boys on an average were employed in caning chairs, the 
other work done being for the most part about the house or in the field. 
The State Industrial School for Girls, Lancaster, Mass.—The commitments to this 
institution during the year ending September 30, 1886, were 51, and the number of 
those for whom places were obtained or who were returned to friends or discharged 
was 64, of whom 48 per cent. were returned, mostly for bad or unsatisfactory con- 
duct, and 1 escaped; 18 per cent. of the commitments were for offences against public 
morals, and 12 per cent. against public justice, the others being merely wayward or 
vagrant girls ; 76 per cent. of the new pupils were between the ages of 14 and 16, none 
were under 13; 9 per cent. were illiterate. The school is conducted on the open sys- 
tem, and is divided into families of 25, the influence being, as far as possible, such as 
it would be in a good home. The pupils are employed in house-work, and on the farm 
and in the garden. 
Massachusetts Reformatory, Concord, Mass.—Seven per cent. of the persons sent by 
the courts to this institution (561) during the year ending September 30, 1886, rang- 
ing in age from 14 to 65, were committed for crimes against the person, 45 per cent. 
for crimes against property, and 47 per cent. for drunkenness, licentiousness, vag- 
abondism, etc. Of the 615 reveived during the year 19 per cent. were to serve an 
“indeterminate sentence,” Of the number in the institution at the close of Septem- 
ber, 1886 (660 prisoners), 54 per cent. had served a term in other institutions, and of 
these 47 per cent. had been committed more than once. Thirty-two per cent. of those 
received during the year were between the ages of 15 and 20, and 38 percent. between 
20 and 30, Four hundred and thirty-five prisoners were released on permit and 30 
permits were revoked. The schools are of three grades—primary, intermediate, and. 
advanced, in which are enrolled 315 inmates under 10 teachers. The work of the 
primary and intermediate grades is that of the public primary and grammar schools; 
in the advanced grade algebra, arithmetic, history, book-keeping, and French are 
taught; drawing is taught to a class of 25. The industries taught principally 
are shoemaking, tailoring, and harness-making. 
MICHIGAN, 
State Industrial Home for Girls, Adrian, Mich.—Nineteen per cent. of the girls re- 
ceived during the year were 12 or under. The pupils are located in 5 cottages, each 
containing about 30 or 35. The course of instruction is graded from the primary to the 
full grammar; in addition to this instruction the pupils are taught sewing and house- 
work. 
Detroit House of Correction School, Detroit, Mich.—The number enrolled in the 
school is 140, of whom 29 per cent. were illiterate on entering. The instruction given 
is elementary, and is under a teacher assisted by several of the more advanced pris- 
oners. 
Reform School, Lansing, Mich.—During the 2 years covered by the report, 381 
persons were committed to the school, 45 per cent. of whom had been convicted of 
slight offences, principally truancy and disorderly conduct. In addition to those 
received on commitments, 48 former inmates were returned, making 429 in all, of . 
whom 34 per cent. were 12 or under. The school day of 9 hours is equally divided 
between study and work. In the school nothing is attempted beyond thorough in- 
struction in the common school branches. Over 200 boys were employed in the cane 
shop, about 50 in the tailoring department, and 70 on the farm. 
NEBRASKA. 
State Reform School, Kearney, Nebr.—The following statistics are given for the 
number of persons committed to the institution since its opening in 1881. The num- 
ber received has been 208, of whom 45 per cent. were committed on slight offences, 30 
per cent. were orphans or had lost their fathers, and the same percentage were 12 or 
under, The school is divided into families, of which there are 4, Each inmate is

instructed in the common school branches 4 hours daily, the other part of the day being given to manual labor. Military drill was introduced during 1886, and has been found a valuable aid in promoting order. 
* NEW HAMPSHIRE, 
State Industrial School, Manchester, N. H.—The number committed to the institution 
during the year was 154, 24 per cent. of whom were convicted of slight offences,—dis- 
obedience, idleness, and the like,—34 per cent. were 12 years old or under, and 40 per 
cent. were committed during minority. The building erected by the principal and 
accumulated interest of the appropriation of 1879 has enabled the school to embark 
upon the manufacture of hosiery, at which industry half of the boys and girls are 
daily employed. The school has several funds, the interest of which is used in 
adding to the library. The common school studies are taught. 
NEW JERSEY. 
New Jersey State Reform School, Jamesburg, N. J.—The commitments during the 
“year were 120, of whom 29 per cent. were committed for incorrigibility, ete., and 32 
per cent. were 12 or under, Thirty-one per cent. had previously been arrested, and 
23 per cent. were orphans or had no fathers; 39 former inmates were returned to the 
school during the year and 8 pupils escaped. Forty-three per cent. of the new pupils 
could not read, or read only in the first reader, and only 1 could read in the fifth. 
The daily instruction in the school has been lengthened from 3 to 4 hours, with a corre- 
sponding reduction in the hours of labor. The boys are engaged in cultivating the 
farm and are instructed in carpentry, shoe-naking, blacksmithing, etc, y 
Newgrk City Home, Newark, N. J.—The large number of illiterates received during 
the last two years has almost reduced the school-room work of this institution to 
primary teaching; the advanced classes pursue arithmetic, geography, and history, 
‘The sessions of the school last for 6 hours daily. The immates work on the farm and 
in the brush shop connected with the institution. 
NEW YORK. 
The Burnham Industrial Farm, Canaan, Four Corners, N. ¥.- The property of this 
recently established institution consists of a farm of 580 acres formerly occupied by 
a Shaker community. It has on it several dwelling-houses, shops, and extensive 
barns, etc., one of the buildings containing a steam-engine and boilers. The relig- 
ious influence is Protestant, but not denominational. Besides the agricultural pur- 
suits which the great extent and splendid condition of the farm invite, the trades of 
carpentry, blacksmithing, etc., will be introduced at the earliest practical moment. 
The inmates are given the rudiments of acommon school education ; the daily session 
is of 2:hours. 
New York State Reformatory, Elmira, N. Y.—Education is compulsory here. Of 
2,378 inmates received during the last ten years, 20 per cent. were unable to read or 
write, and though 53 per cent. could do both they practised those arts with difficulty. 
Of the 711 inmates on September 30, 1886, 90 per cent. could read and write fiuently, 
the others being in the rudiments of language. At the close of each of the three 
terms into which the school year has been divided, those having passed the last 
monthly examination are promoted, the proportion of men advanced ranging from 
50 to 80 per cent., the percentage being smallest in the primary division, To en- 
‘deayor to invigorate the understanding of 12 incorrigible dullards, not one of whom 
knows the name of the country in which we live, they were subjected to a 5-months’ 
course of daily vapor baths, massage, and calisthenics. As the course progressed 
‘their minds brightened,” and “from being fairly contented to remain in the lowest 
grade an ambition to earn perfect records guided the conduct and work of all.” The 
average marking according to the school register was 45.25 before the experiment 
began, and 74.16 at its close. 
Yew York House of Refuge, Randall’s Island, N. Y.—Four hundred and forty-six 
~~ commitments were made during the year to this institution, of which 54 per cent. 
were for the slight offences of vagrancy, etc.; the percentage that were 12 or less 
than 12 years of age was 24, and of those who had been previously arrested, 40. 
The common school studies are taught very thoroughly and with excellent results. 
Tt is contemplated to replace contract labor by a system of agricultural and horticul- 
tural training upon ground to be reclaimed, giving the institution about 20 acres of 
arable land; to carry out the project in part the Legislature is asked to appropriate 
$25,000. At this school the younger and less hardened boys are carefully separated 
from the hardened inmates, each class having its own eating and sleeping apartments, 
and play-grounds, ‘

induced the board of managers to ask that the buildings of the school be purchased 
by the State, in order that an agricultural reform school on the family plan may beestab- 
lished with the proceeds. The schools, 17 in all, giving a good elementary educa- 
tion, are under a superintendent and. 19 teachers, including a teacher of music. In 
the industrial department shoemaking, cane-seating, and tailoring, are taught. °

    868 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
Examination shows that 19 schools on the list of the Report for 1882-83 have not ' 
reported for the year under review, and 8 on the list of the present Report were not 
on the Report of 1882-83, although only 3 have been established since it was issued. 
Comparisons instituted between two bodies of statistics made up from returns from 
50 many institutions that are not common to both would be misleading, and the Office 
has refrained from giving the increase or decrease, as the case may be. 
V.—EDUCATION OF THE INDIAN.! 
EDUCATION OF THE UNCIVILIZED TRIBES. 
As to their source of support, Indian schools may be divided into three kinds: those 
supported by the National Government (in New York by the State) directly or indi- 
rectly (contract); those supported by religious societies; and the public school sys- 
tems of the Five Nations of the Indian Territory. Viewed as educational institutions, 
they may be separated into boarding schvols and schools for day scholars, and this 
is the classification that has been adopted as best suited to the purposes of this Re- 
port; the systems of the Five Nations, however, will be considered apart. 
ACCOMMODATIONS, ATTENDANCE, AND COST. 
“Tt is anoteworthy fact,” says Superintendent Riley, “ that where schools have been 
established for several years, with accommodations for a considerable proportion of the 
children of school age, the prejudice [of the Indians] against education has largely dis- 
appeared ;” and again, If the Government would be rid of the Indian question edu- 
cational facilities must be provided for the preseut generation of Indian children.” By 
the treaties of 1867 and 1868, made witha number of tribes, the Government agreed to 
farnish school supplies, including building, and a teacher for every 30 children. 
To meet the obligations thus incurred, but not yet fulfilled, the Secretary of the 
Treasury submitted estimates in 1885 for an appropriation of $4,033,700. 
Accommodations.—From the insufticiency of the appropriations the Indian Bureau 
has been able to provide for only a small proportion of the children of the larger 
tribes; the treaty stipulations with the Navajoes, for instance, calls for 200 schools; 
one has been provided. The following table shows the school population and the pro- 
yision made for educating it:

1 The matter contained in this section is taken from or based upon the comprehensive report of Hon, 
John B. Riley, superintendent of Indian Schools. 
a‘There are probably upwards of 7,000 children of school age in Alaska,” says Superintendent 
Riley, ‘‘more than nine-tenths of whom are children of the native [non-Indian] population.” Con- 
tracts were made for the education of 100 pupils at two boarding schools.

  EDUCATION OF INDIANS. 869 
Excluding the Indians of school age on reservations in New York (1,711 in 1885-86), 
where the accommodations appear to keep pace with the demand for admittance, tho 
table shows that twenty-nine per cent. (11,770) of the children are provided for 
How far this provision is utilized is shown by the following table.

Excluding the New York statisties, it appears that the accommodations are 79 per 
cent. of the enrolment and, if it be assumed that the total of the average attendances 
more or less closely represents the true average attendance, the ratio of such an aver- 
age attendance to the accommodations would be 89 per cent. The language of the trea- 
ties above referred to, substantially the same in all, is as follows: ‘‘and they [the 
Navajoes] therefore pledge themselves to compel their children, male and female, be- 
tween the ages of six and sixteen years, to attend school, and it is hereby made the 
duty of the agent for said Indians to see that this stipulation is strictly complied 
with.” The statistics would appear to indicate that the Indians are availing them- 
selves of the educational facilities provided for them to the full extent of such pro- 
‘vision. 
English language in Indian schools.—‘‘ The advantage to the Indians of a knowl- 
edge of our language can not be overestimated. * * * Understanding English, 
they can deal directly with their white neighbors and the representative of the Goy- 
ernment. * * * ‘They will no longer be the prey of unprincipled white men. In 
fact, the Indian who speaks the English language is a savage no longer.” Continu- 
ing, Superintendent Riley quotes from the report of the Indian peace commission, ap- 
pointed in 1867 for the purpose, among others, of suggesting some plan for the civili- 
zation of the Indians: ‘‘ In the difference of language to-day lies two-thirds of our 
trouble, * * * Schoolsshould be established, which children should be required to 
attend; their barbarous dialects should be blotted out and the English language sub- 
stituted.” The superintendent found that in some schools, though he was understood 
by the pupils when he spoke, they could not express themselves in English, although 
they had been in school several years. : 
Course of study.—The efforts of the Indian Bureau to control the work in the school- 
room has so far been rendered futile by the total lack of system as to text-books and 
course of study. Each agent or superintendent selects the books and methods that 
appear best to him, and ‘the results attained vary as widely as do the methods pur- 
sued.” To rectify this evil the superintendent recommends the adoption of a series 
of text-books and a course of study. ‘Indian education,” he observes, “is yet in 
its infancy. An elaborate system is in process of formation. The enactment of laws 
enlarging the responsibilities of the Indians and looking to their citizenship makes 
it important that a well-considered and thoroughly organized system be devised for 
carrying on a work that will necessarily involve the employment of a large number 
of persons and the expenditure of many millions of dollars, and will in its operation 
determine in a large measure the future of the Indian race.” 
Finances.—The sources from which the money for Indian education is obtained are 
three: Congressional appropriation ; treaty, interest, and other funds; and the treas- 
uries of missionary bodies. The following table exhibits the proportion iu which the 
sum total is contributed to and disbursed: .

BOARDING SCHOOLS. 
As before remarked, the schools for educating the Indian are here classified as board- 
ing and day schools; the first of these classes admits of subdivision into schools un- 
der bonded superintendents, under Indian agents, and under societies or individuals 
either as contractors with the United States Government or as independent mission- 
ary enterprises. The specific difference between schools controlled by employés of 
the Government under the name of superintendent and those under the authority of 
United States Indian agents is more than one of name. ‘ Experience has shown,” 
says Superintendent Riley, ‘‘that the schools so conducted [under the direction of 
bonded superintendents] have shown much better results than have been attained at 
the schools supervised by Indian agents ;” and further, ‘‘in the selection of Indian 
agents men of good business qualifications are sought. Even if they could devote 
the time required for the proper supervision of the schools to that work, but few of 
them would be found to havehad the experience or to possess the special qualifica- 
tions requisite to the successful performance of such duty.” 
Schools in civilized communities.—To obtain information as to the most desirable lo- 
cation for Indian schools, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs sent a circular letter 
to the Indian agents asking for information as to the number of children returned 
from the Eastern schools; the pursuits in which they were engaged; the number 
who continue to wear civilized dress; and the agents’ opinion as to the value of the 
work done in these schools in comparison with that done on the reservation. 
The incompleteness of the record as to the departure and return of children prevented 
fall returns ; but the life of 388 pupils who had returned were given by 11 agents. Of 
these 89 died, 74 were engaged in civilized pursuits, 31 were employed at the agencies, 
17 attended school, 12 were not engaged in any occupation, 74 had apparently retro- 
graded and had adopted Indian costume, and 43 had been lost sight of. The large per- 
centage of those who died after their return to reservation life, the radical dissocia-~ 
tion of parent and child, and the great difference between life in a civilized commu- 
nity and on the frontier, induces the superintendent to recommend that none but    
graduates of the reservation schools be sent to Eastern boarding schools, and to sug-' 
. gest that the course of instruction at those schools be adapted to training teachers, 
professional men, or artisans. 
New schools.—Four new schools have been established during the year, situated 
respectively at Albuquerque, N. M., San Carlos and Keam’s Cation, Ariz., and Grand 
Junction, Cole. At three of these schools ample facilities are present to enable in- 
struction to be given in irrigation, an essential+element of farming in these regions. 
All the schools appear to belong to the bonded superintendent class.

Contract schools.—Many of the buildings erected by the various organizations with 
which the United States contracts surpass in size and beauty those built by the Gov- 
ernment. Nor are their efforts confined to providing suitable accommodations, for 
the teachers and employés they have secured are as a rule enthusiastic in their efforts 
to civilize the Indians, frequently giving instruction to grown persons as well as 
childrén. In many instances the number of children instructed is much greater than 
the number contracted for, the additional expense being met by religious denomina- 
tions, meeeipally. the Presbyterian, Catholic, Protestant Episcopal, and Congrega- 
tional churches. ‘

  Teachers.—The small salary of the teachers and the hardships and inconveniences 
of the service have caused many changes in the teaching force during the year, To 
retain the service of teachers “ whose language, habits, and character are worthy of 
imitation” the superintendent thinks it better policy to pay higher salaries, and, if 
absolutely necessary to the accomplishment of this end, have fewer schools,

4 Not including superintendent, unlessthat officer is also designated as a teacher, or, if not so desig- nated, has in his institution an “assistant teacher.” 
Two columns of the above table (the second and the last) call for remark by reason 
of ertain limitations which must be considered with them, 
In his remarks on teachers’ salaries Superintendent Riley uses the following lan- 
guage: ‘‘To insure success every employé must be a person of character and intelli- 
gence. The cook, the Jaundress, and the seamstress are all teachers in their different 
spheres.” In view of this statement, six would very inadequately represent the num- 
ber of teachers giving industrial instruction, however accurately representing the 
number of persons on the pay-roll as such; on the other hand, it-is impossible to dis- 
tinguish how far the various farmers and assistant farmers and the seamstresses and 
assistant seamstresses, are farmers or seamstresses and how far teachers. Confined to 
the examination of the pmy-rolls of the various schools (Exhibit No. 4 of the super- 
intendent’s report) in collecting information for the table, the Office has used, not the 
amount actually paid to teachers for service rendered, as a basis, but the amount 
that would have been paid had every teacher held his position from the beginning 
until the close of the year. To have done otherwise would have demanded many com- 
putations and, though giving the amount actually expended on the teaching force, 
would not so well have answered the purpose of the column as showing the average 
annual salary as provided for. Of the bonded superintendent class of boarding- 
schools 66 per cent. of the salaries were of the $600 grade, 16 per cent. were below 
that grade, and 18 per cent. above; of the Indian agent class, 35 per cent. of the 
salaries were of the $600 grade 22 per cent. above it, and 31 per cent. were of the $480 
and $500 grades.

DAY SCHOOLS. 
The utility of day schools for the Indians naturally depends on the extent to which 
the tribes haye discarded nomadic habits or their teachers become nomads. It is 
evident from the wording of the treaties of 1867 and 1868 that day schools were con- 
templated, but it will be seen by referring to Table p. 869 that the enrolment at board- 
ing schools is double that of the day schools, omitting the enrolment in New York day 
schools, although the number of schools are about equal. An interesting feature of 
the work of the American Missionary Association is the establishment of ‘‘ out sta- 
tions” with native teachers graduates of the Santee and Oahe boarding-schools 
maintained by this society.

The citizen population of the Indian Territory, including mixed bloods, freedmen, 
and adopted citizens, is about 64,000, to whom are to be added about 34,000 other per- 
sons—farmers, traders, claimants to citizenship, etc. 
Cherokees.—This nation, the largest, having a citizen population of 23,600, main- 
tains 2 boarding-schools and an orphan asylum capable of accommodating 550 pupils, 
and 100 day schools with a capacity of 5,000, In addition to the public schools there 
are at least 10 other schools, mostly if not all denominational, 7 of which have, to- 
gether, accommodations for 549. The Nation gives the negroes 12 common schools 
and the question of providing a high school for them is agitated. The aggregate at- 
sata was 4,200, the average attendance 2,600, and the cost of the national schools 
180,000. 
Choctaws.—With a population of 18,000 this Nation maintains 4 boarding-schools 
with a capacity of 300 fully utilized, at an expense of $31,000; sends 13 boys and as 
many girls to schools in the States at a cost of $7,025; and supports 83 ‘‘neighbor- 
hood schools,” having an aggregate attendance of 3,512, at an expense of $44,154. The 
annual appropriation was $82,269. The school year begins in September and closes 
with February, for the “‘neighborhoodschools.” "School property is valued at $200,000. 
Of the private and church schools no data can be obtained. 
Creeks (population 14,000).—Besides the 5 schools having a capacity of 410, main- 
tained by the Nation at a cost of $25,200, numerous other boarding-schools, princi- 
peuy. denominational, afford opportunities of education. Of the 28 public schools, 
aving a capacity of 700, 7 are for negroes; the cost of these public schools was 
ne Twenty-one pupils are suported at schools in the States at a cost of 
500, 
Chickasaws (population 6,000).—The 4 boarding-schools of this Nation have a ca- 
Bac of 310, and the 14 common schools of 280; beyond these no statistics are fur- 
nished. -

excluded, and in Delaware the 4 colored schools of Wilmington. Under such condi- 
tions, and excluding the statistics of Florida and Indiana, the comparison of the sta- 
tistics of 1886-87 with those of the preceding year shows a gain of 28,413 in colored 
enrolment, a gain of 2.7 per cent., and of 124,128, a gain of 4.5 per cent., in white en- 
rolment. Excluding 5 States and the District of Columbia, all using a census taken 
previous to 1835, the ratio of the colored enroJment of the other States given in the 
table to their colored population is 51.6 per cent.; of the white enrolment to white 
population, 64.06 percent. The ratio of the colored school population of the 17 States 
and the District of Columbia to the total school population, white and colored, is 
28.96, or, excluding Missouri, West Virginia, and Indiana, in which the colored school 
population is not 10 per cent. of the total school population, 36.85 per cent. The en- 
rolment in colored schools is 24.25 per cent. of the total enrolment, or 32.55 excludin; 
Missouri, West Virginia, and Indiana as before. It is thought that the afalytioal 
character of Tables 91 and 92 renders further remarks unnecessary. 
In Table 91 the variation among the several States of the ratio which the colored 
school population bears to the white can not fail to be noted. In North Carolina the 
colored school population is 38 per cent. of the total school population, in South Caro- 
lina it is 64 per cent., in Georgia it is 48 per cent., in Arkansas it is 26 per cent., in 
Louisiana 52, in Missouri and West Virginia it is below 6 per cent. Considering the 
strict separation of schools for educating colored children, and that the life of the 
colored man is agricultural, it would seem that the colored schools of States with a 
comparatively small percentage of colored youth would be nearly under the same dis- 
advantages that attend the first educational efforts of a sparsely settled State or Ter- 
» ritory. 
Although fostering the industrial education of the colored population as the trus- 
tees of the Peabody fund haye fostered normal instruction ‘among the entire popu- 
lation” of the South, the trustees of the John F. Slater fund, through their agent, Dr. 
Haygood, of Georgia, are indefatigable in collecting information as to the condition 
and progress of the people whose elevation is the purpose of their trust. In February, 
1887, Dr. Haygood sent out 300 circular letters “asking the best judgment of those 
to whom they were sent, on the matters inquired about.” Two of the inquiries made 
are connected with the subject of education: Do colored parents manifest interest 
in the education of their children? Are the common schools attended by colored 
children improving in their character? From the 300 letters of inquiry thus sent to 
officials, educators, and professional and business men, white and colored, 236 replies 
had been received by May, 1887. To the inquiry as to the interest of colored people 
in the education of their children 230 answered ‘‘ yes,” to which should be added the 
response, ‘‘ There were only two colored families in my neighborhood, and one moved 
away to get near a school” ; no correspondent denied that an interest was manifested, 
the 5 not answering in the affirmative speaking of it as spasmodic or limited. To the 
second query,a very material one, as to the improvement in the character of the com- 
mon schools as educational institutions, 199 respond affirmatively, 6 of whom deny 
like improvement in the private schools, 20 do not know or do not answer, 4 think 
not. Personal and diligent inquiry throughout the South causes Dr. Haygood to 
believe “that the answers given by the majority of those who replied to his circular 
letter give the true view on the questions asked.” 
Nores FROM THE REPORTS oF STaTH SUPERINTENDENTS. 
Alabama.—The census of 1887 shows that during the biennial period then closed 
the white school population had increased 8.4 per cent., and the colored 5.7, an in- 
crease in all of 7.2. ‘‘This large increase in the number of children,” says Superin- 
tendent Palmer, ‘‘reduces the per capita from 73 cents for both white and colored to 
72 for white and 66 for colored” for the year 1887-88 notwithstanding the increase of 
$20,000 made to the school fund. The greater reduction in the per capita for colored 
children is due to the liberal appropriations made by the last Legislature out of the 
fund for whites for the university for the colored people, and for normal schools. 
Delaware.—In 1876 the present incumbent, H. C. Conrad, Esq., was appointed 
Actuary for the Delaware Association for the Education of the Colored People, in 
whose hands the education of the colored people was placed in 1875. On his advent 
to office he found 29 schools in existence, having an enrolment of 1,197, ‘‘ supported 
by donations from this association and contributions made directly by the colored peo- 
ple.” In 1881 the State made the first direct appropriation, which was materially 
increased in 1883, and still further augmented at the last session of the General Assem- 
bly, when the amount was raised from $5,000 to $6,000 annually, the law touching
-P-A-G-E-877
EDUCATION OF THE COLORED RACE. 82 OE 
schools for this race simplified, and permission granted to the colored people of Dover 
and of Cedar Creek Hundred to elect their own trustees, who should levy and collect a 
school tax and provide for the maintenance of colored schools in the districts at the 
same time created. The total amount distributed to the schools was $7,057.56, of which 
$4,713.23 came from the State and $2,344.33 from the school-tax fund. ‘‘ Each year,” 
says the actuary, ‘‘shows an improvement in the corps of teachers, those of the past 
year being, I think, better equipped in. point of education and experience than those 
of any preceding year.” During the year the Delaware Association for the Education 
of Colored People, which had been engaged for the last 20 years in the education of 
colored youth, was disbanded, and the African School Society, incorporated in 1824, 
assumed the work. The two organizations were practically identical. 
Kentucky.—In 1882, the annual capitation tax of $i on each male colored person 
above the age of 21, reserved exclusively for and the principal source of support of 
colored public schools, was repealed as unconstitutional by the General Assembly, 
reducing the per capitaamount available for colored children from 48, for 1880, to 13 
cents, for 1883. To obviate the ill effects of this the people voted ‘an additional ‘tax 
of 2.cents on each $100 of property in this Commonwealth, subject to taxation for State 
revenue purposes,’ for the benefit of the common school fund,” and at the same time 
made the per capita and the school age the same for white and colored children. The 
result of this action is best shown by comparing the financial operations of 1880, in 
matters relating to education, with the operations of 1886. In 1880 $598,193, or $1.25 
per capita, were appropriated for the white and $31,951, or 48 cents per capita, for the 
colored. In 1886 the apportionment for the white schools was $865,052, a per capita of 
$1.65, and for the colored $164,429, a per capita of $1.65. In 1882-83, the first year of 
the new order of things, $106,117 were disbursed for colored public schools, of which 16 
per cent. were received from colored tax-payers; in 1885-86 $167,666 were disbursed for 
colored schools, of which 8.6 per cent. were from colored tax-payers. ‘That the peo- 
ple,” says Superintendent Pickett, in his report for 1886, which should be considered 
rather as a retrospect of an important educational period, ‘should, by their own act, 
draw the revenue from the white schools at so large a rate each successive year, to 
supplement the meager sum contributed by the colored people, is the most remarka- 
ble fact in the school history of Kentucky. That it should all be accomplished quietly 
and successfully without interruption of the schools, leading, at the same time, to a 
higher qualification of teachers, because required, and, consequently, to a higher 
standard in the schools * * * makes this an era in her history.” 
4 ScHooLs FoR NORMAL, SECONDARY, AND COLLEGIATE EDUCATION. 
In considering the institutions for the education of the colored race, it is noticeable 
how constantly present are the characteristics of a public elementary school, an acad- 
emy, a normal school, and in some instances of a theological seminary, all in the same 
institution. These schools have been placed in the various chapters according as one 
or another feature predominated, and are there mentioned, if at all. 
, The usual charge for tuition in these institutions is $1 a month; occasionally the fee 
falls below this figure, and not unfrequently rises above it, though rarely exceeding $2. 
Many of the institutions give instruction free. 
Board averages $6 to $8 a month. The lowest limit is $5, while $10 seems to mark 
the other extreme. In some instances the student can reduce his expenses or defray 
them by manual labor at the institution or in the vicinity. 
Normal and secondary instruction.—The object of the normal and secondary instruc- 
tion of the colored students seems to be the thorough grounding of the pupil in the 
principles of a common school education, with the additional purpose in the normal 
department of exercising the pupils in imparting the rudiments of the course they 
arecompleting. ‘The course of the normal department or school is mostly of 4 years’ 
duration, occasionally divided into a higher and a lower course ; frequently the course 
is of 3 years, sometimes of 2. The secondary school,under its various names of high 
school, higher English preparatory, or academic course, runs from 2 to 4 years. The 
requirements for admission are ability to read 4nd write and work examples in the 
fundamental rules of arithmetic. Some schools refuse to receive applicants under 14 
-or 15 years of age, as the case may be. In replying to the second query of Dr. Hay- 
good’s circular of inquiry referred to, p. 876, in every case where a comment was added. 
to the affirmation of improvement in the colored public schools the cause was atitrib- 
uted to the better teachers furnished by the colleges and other training schools for 
colored people.

These 9,824 pupils were taught by 445 teachers, an average of 22.1 pupils to each in- 
structor. The value of the property used in connection with the instruction of these 
pupils was $2,978,450, a per capita of $303. 
PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. 
Of the several classes of institutions for the education of the colored race, only the 
schools for theological instruction are present in sufficient number to warrant com- 
ment. The amount of work done by schools of law and medicine falls far short of 
that of normal and theological schools. The course in a majority of the theological 
institutions may be described as simple, being confined to the study of the Bible 
and church history, while in the case of the recently reorganized Richmond Theolog- 
ical Seminary of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, a systematic and 
thorough study of theology, including instruction in Greek and Hebrew, obtains, and 
the same remark holds good of the Gammon School of Theology, controlled by the 
Freedmen’s Aid Society of the M. E. Church, and formerly of Clark University. As 
remarked above, many of these schools are only departments of institutions that 
offer in addition, normal, secondary, or collegiate instruction, sometimes all three, 
thus affording to theological students an opportunity of removing the impediments 
to their studies, following from inadequate knowledge of the elements of learning. 
For ministers already in the pulpit one year courses are in some instances provided.

PROVISION FOR THE DEFECTIVE AND DEPENDENT CLASSES. 
The colored pupils of the schools for these classes, being either taught with the 
white pupils or forming a department of a white schbol, it is impossible to distinguish 
with precision the number of teachers employed in instructing colored children. Two 
of the deaf graduates of the North Carolina Institution are teaching in schoolsin other 
States and three blind graduates are ministers of the gospel and one is a music teacher,

      CHAPTER XVI 
OBITUARY LIST OF NOTABLE EDUCATORS AND BENE- 
: FACTORS TO EDUCATION. 
The list here presented contains such names among the dead of the year 1886-87, 
as were notable either for their connection with some form of educational labor or for 
their gifts and bequests to educational purposes. Of course the list is incomplete, or 
may be so considered ; some names are omitted because no trustworthy information 
of the kind here given could be procured respecting them; and other names might 
have been included by the partiality of friends. 
No attempt has been made to include some men of eminence whose work as educa- 
tionists was merely incidental; for example, the late Rev. Henry-Ward Beecher was 
a lecturer for three years in the Yale Divinity School at New Haven; yet Mr. Beecher’s 
name is not included. 4 These exclusions have been necessary in order to prevent the list from becoming 
too cumbrous for publication and too vague in design, 
Usually facts respetting those included in the list, which relate to other interests 
or labors are passed over in silence. 
A few names, omitted from the report for 1885-96, are included in this list.

ent of public instruction of Illinois. In discussing ‘‘The Problem of To-day” hoe 
stated that history shows that to every race and generation belongs some special 
work, The great problem of the latter decades of this century pertains to education, 
and upon the fraternity of teachers rests the responsibility of so moulding and 
strengthening the character of the men and women of this and coming generations 
that they shall not succumb to the unwonted strain of prosperity or be enfeebled by 
luxury and indulgence. The second session was devoted to the discussion of the

    THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE. 
     The thirty-sixth annual meeting was held at New York City, August 10-13, 1887, 
Prof. S. P. Langley, presiding. The association is divided into eight sections, and 
before each of these there were read a number of papers upon various topics relating 
to that particular branch of science to whose investigation the section is devoted. 
The following were among the subjects treated: 
In Section A (mathematics and fronomy), ‘“‘A Method of Computing the Secular 
Contraction of the Earth,” by R.S. Woodward; ‘‘A Completed Nomenclature for the

and James Russell Lowell, of Harvard, was elected president. 
THE CHAUTAUQUA ASSEMBLIES FOR 1887. 
Chautauqua, N. ¥Y.—July 2-August 28.—In the summer assemblies, Chautauqua, 
“Mother of Assemblies,” is placed first, as the model upon which the long train of 
followers have been formed. The plan for the summer session was full of life and 
. Vigor, as well as novelty and popularity, and these qualities were expressed by new 
features and by a refining and crystallization of those already introduced. The pro- 
gramme was skilfully and wisely arranged with regard to the taste of the constitu- 
ency upon which it must depend for support. The speakers were carefully selected 
out of the multitude, the timeliness of every subject weighed, popular and technical 
lectures were grouped with due consideration for the needs of students and people, 
and the platform exercises were invariably made to harmonize with the current spe- 
cialty. 
The meetings of the fourteenth Chautauqua Assembly may be divided into the 
Popular Programme, the work of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Ciréle 
(C. L. S. C,.”), Church Congress, Summer Session of the College of Liberal Arts, 
Summer Classes, Teachers’ Retreat, Institute of Music, Missionary Institute, Assem 
bly, and After-week. The special departments have crystallized into more refined, 
clear, and permanent shapes than ever before. A classification of the subjects dis- 
cussed by the various speakers includes literature, language, science, theology, his- 
tory, religion, political economy, social science, law, and travel, with the addition of 
a large amount of miscellaneous matter, such as concerts, classic organ recitals, and 
entertainments. 
The sessions of the schools and summer classes were largely attended. Some 60 
teachers were present at the three weeks’ session of the Retreat, and 800 students 
were enrolled in ali the various departments of the Chautauqua College of Liberal 
Arts. The launching of the college was an event of more than usual importance in 
   
-P-A-G-E-899
    ASSOCIATIONS AND CONVENTIONS 899 
the history of Chautauqua. Dr. W. R. Harper, of Yale University, supported by some 
35 instructors representing at least 20 different universities and colleges, conducted 
the six weeks’ session, Personal instruction was given in modern, classical, and 
oriental languages, mathematics, science, history, and philosophy, and all studies 
common to a university curriculum. Certain series of the lectures were of great prac- 
tical benefit, such as Professor Ely’s series on social science, the law lectures of Judge 
Tourgée, the memory lessons of Professor Loisette, and the psychological studies under 
Professor Davis. ‘The number of students present was about double that of any ses- 
sion of the schools of language. Representatives came from almost every State and 
Territory in the Union, as well as from Canada, Germany, Japan, and Syria. Exam- 
inations were given all who desired them, and certificates were awarded for the work 
done. These certificates will have the same value as those covering the same amount 
of work in any college of the country. So satisfactory didthe experiment prove, that 
Professor Harper announces that the same policy is to be pursued another year, and 
the same faculty engaged, the only change being additions to certain departments. 
The Institute of Music made the most ambitious and thoroughly systematized effort 
to teach instrumental and vocal music yet attempted at Chautauqua. The specially 
new feature of the season was the department of public school music, in which the 
methods of the National Normal Music School of Boston were taught by a faculty, in- 
cluding the president and secretary of this school, and the supervisor of musicin the 
public schools of Washington. 
The Normal Union, inaugurated last year for the purpose of systematizing and 
strengthening the normal work of the assembly, has met with hearty favor, and more 
than twenty assemblies are reported to have adopted the scheme. During the past 
winter many large classes were formed in various places, about 450 persons taking tho 
course at Chautauqua’in August. 
The Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle did persistent and valuable work 
throughout the entire session. The Round Tables attained an unusual degree of 
popularity even among many who were not members of the Circle, which was due to 
no special eloquence or learning displayed in the gatherings, but rather. to the spirit 
and aim which characterized them. On Recognition Day, 687 members of the ‘C. 
L. 8. C.” Class of 1887 received their diplomas. This class will graduate 5,000 mem- 
bers, a larger proportion of its first enrolment than that of 1886, whtch was fully 
one-fourth. 
The lecturers and instructors at the assembly included some of the foremost edu- 
cators and men of the day. Among the new speakers were Rev. Mark Guy Pearse, of 
England; Prof. Henry Drummond, of Glasgow; Dr. and Mrs. 8. L. Baldwin; Dr. J. 
A. Broadus; the Rev. Emory J. Haynes; Dr. C. R. Henderson; the Rev. W. H. In- 
gersoll; the Rey. G. W. Miller; Prof. R. E. Thompson; Dr. O. W. Warren; Dr. N. » 
‘West; Prof. W. C. Richards, and Mrs. Mary 'T. Lathrop, besides the large number 
of superior lecturers drawn from the faculty of the College of Liberal Arts. 
Many improvements in the grounds and buildings are reported, among which may 
be mentioned a large and handsome Union Class building, and a magnificent new 
building for the College of Liberal Arts. ‘These signs indicate the permanency of the 
Chautauqua growth, and the value and appreciation of the Chautauqua idea, An 
institution which can continue to increase for fourteen years in ambitions; breadth, 
scholarship, and appliances, has the very best elements of endurance.

LIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES. 
Former library tables—Classification adopted in the present Report—Free lending libraries, supported. 
wholly or partly by public moneys (Table 96)— Free reference libraries, aupported wholly or partly: 
by public moneys (Table 97)—Libraries attached to public school systems (‘Table 98) —Free lending 
libraries, owned and supported by corporations (‘Table 99)—Libraries belonging to societies, associa- 
tions, lodges, clubs, etc. (Table 100)—Lending libraries owned by corporations (Table 101)—Cireu-' y 
lating libraries which are business investments and are conducted for profit (Lable 102). : 
     
    ‘ 
This Burean has steadfastly emphasized the importance of libraries as instrumental- 
ities of culture and instruction. The first Annual Report of Mr. Commissioner Eaton 
(for 1870) contained a list of 161 ‘‘ principal librariés” in this country. These did not 
include libraries attached to or forming part of schools and colleges. The Report for 
1872 contained a list of 1,080 libraries containing 1,000 or more volumes, in which all 
libraries, not private, then known to the Office were included. In 1875 and 1876 the 
massive Special Report on Public Libraries, in two parts, appeared. This document 
contained a table of 3,647 libraries of 300 or more volumes. This table was also pub- 
lished in the Annual Report for 1875. A similar table, containing 5,338 such libraries, 3 § 
appeared in the Annual Report for 1884-85. 
The other Annual Reports contained additional information as yearly gathered, but 
not to an extent making special description desirable. 
The systematic attempt made in every part of the present document to classify and 
simplify the statistics of education to be reported, has been extended to those relating 
to libraries. After consultation with several librarians of exceptional experience 
and undoubted judgment, the following basic conclusions were formed: 
(1) That all libraries connected with colleges, schools, or school systems, mentioned 
in other parts of the Report, be omitted. 
(2) That only such other public libraries as contained one thousand or more vol- 
umes be retained as material for this document. 
(3) That these be classified in accordance with their ownership, the conditions im- 
posed for their use, and like simple standards of discrimination. 
It is obvious, therefore, that the lists presented in this chapter can not be compared 
with those published heretofore by this Bureau. The seven tables of detailed sta- 
tistics presented in this chapter give information respecting 1,779 libraries, which 
contained 14,012,370 volumes. 
‘These are properly libraries, or such an integral part of the corporations with 
which they are associated as to justify their presence in these tables. 
‘The first factor used in classifying these libraries was their financial relation to the 
public. The question—Is the library supported wholly or partly by public moneys? 
ae all into two general classes, those so supported and those otherwise main- 
ained. 
The libraries here reported which were wholly or partly supported by public mon- 
eys numbered 670, and contained 6,963,850 volumes. The libraries otherwise main- 
tained numbered 1,109, and contained 7,048,520 volumes. 
Almost without exception, libraries maintained wholly or partly by public moneys 
are free for public use. Libraries otherwise maintained are divisible on this point, 
#63 of them requiring membership fees, annual subscriptions, or payment for each 
book read. These libraries contained 5,320,750 volumes. 
It follows that the other 911 libraries, with their 8,691,620 volumes, were ‘‘ free” 
libraries. ¥ 
An inquiry as to whether a library was mainly for reference or was a lending li- 
brary produced a subdivision in the public libraries; and the question whether a 
public library was mainly for the use of the public schools surrounding it, produced a 
third class. 
The character of the ownership and nature of the use of libraries otherwise main- ~ 
tained divided them into four classes. 
The tables of detailed statistics are thus seven in number. Every caro has been 
taken to assign each library to its appropriate class; probably many errors in clas- 
sification have been made from lack of knowledge in individual cases, especially 
901

                acer hi ‘ 902. EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87.   
when it was necessary to decide whether a library belonging to a society, association, 
or other corporation, was or was not a lending library. The result, confessedly im- 
perfect, is submitted for the use and judgment of educationists and librarians. 
The word “library” is omitted wherever practicable from the columns entitled 
“name of library,” in order to avoid its wearisome repetition hundreds of times, and 
also in order to give room for the columns respecting “increase” and ‘‘ income,” 
now presented as compactly as the facts permit. ‘ 
The table of free public school libraries (Table 98) does not include any libraries 
connected with public school systems mentioned in Chapter IV of this Report. The 
libraries here set forth are additional to those in that chapter. It follows that Table 
$8 is not to be understood as a complete exhibit of all public school libraries. Re- 
specting these, indeed, @ complete or satisfactory statement is at present impossible. 
In addition to the libraries containing one thousand or more volumes, this Bureau _ 
possesses new statistics of nearly two thousand libraries having three hundred or 
more volumes. These are excluded from this chapter for imperative reasons relating 
to size, importance, time, etc. If circumstances are favorable, these statistics may 
appear in one of the minor publications of this Bureau for the year 1888. 
The number of libraries and of volumes in each of the seven classes considered in 
‘this chapter are as follows: 
  
| | Libraries. | Volumes. 
  
Free public lending libraries 424.| 8,721,191 Free public reference Libraries. 153 | 3,075, 099

  Circulating libraries proper . 
  
Frer Pusiic Lenpinc Lipraries. 
[Tables 97 and 98.] 
The first group to be more particularly considered is composed of those libraries 
supported wholly or in part by public grants, taxes, or endowments, and having free 
sep ulayon of their contents among the citizens of the places where they are sit- 
uated. 
Practically these libraries are confined to the northern parts of the Union, whero 
the population is collected in villages, towns, and cities, and where the surplus of 
public moneys permits this expenditure, The public free lending library can not 
exist and prosper in a rural community, or among people whose wealth is not collect- 
ively considerable. It is, therefore, not wonderful that Massachusetts, one of the 
wealthiest and most thickly populated of America’s commonwealths, should have 
many more of these libraries than any other of the States. The public education 
that begins with the elementary school, here culminates in the free library. 
By the law of this State any town may grant the proceeds of the ‘‘dog-tax” to a 
free library within its borders, Several other States have good laws for the encour- 
agement of free public libraries. The great State of New York, after lavish expend- 
itures of money for district libraries, and after several experiments, has recently 
» passed’'a law of this kind, of which the following paragraph is a synopsis: 
Any duly incorporated library association owning real estate worth $20,000 and a 
library of 10,000 volumes, which maintains the same as a free lending library, is author- 
ized to apply to the common council or other proper authority in its city for an ap- 
propriation based upon the circulation of its books during the twelve months pre- 
ceding such application. If the circulation has been 75,000 volumes, it may apply for 
$5,000, and $5,000 more for each addition of 100,000 to the circulation; the term cir- 
culation being defined to mean the aggregate number of volumes withdrawn from the 
library by readers for use in their homes or places of business. In the city of New 
York no library may receive more than $40,000 annually for such circulation. 
It is a fact to be observed and lamented that the District of Columbia, the seat of 
National Government, does not have a single library of this description. Outside the 
Executive Departments, the people of the capital have no opportunity for the perusal 
of books at their homes except at their own cost. It is believed that no other city 
of importance in the country is so lacking in this means of public culture, pleasure, 
and profit.

One of the oldest libraries in this group isthe Franklin Library, in Franklin, Mass. 
This town, named in honor of the famous printer-philosopher, received from him in 
1786 a gift of 100 volumes for a town library. The selectmen had suggested that a 
bell would .be an acceptable recognition of the honor conferred, but the saga- 
cious old man replied that he preferred sense to sound, and the books were accepted. 
More than half of them are still in the possession of the library and are cherished as 
a relic of their donor. ?

[Tables 99 and 100.] 
In addition to the public lending libraries already mentioned, public moneys are 
granted in support of many libraries essential or useful to the service of the States, 
Territories, courts, and cities of the country. These are usually reference libraries; 
i. e., their purpose is mainly that of consultation in the library. The contents are 
chiefly documentary, historical, scientific, or legal. 
Every State and Territory, except Utah, reports at least one such collection. The 
presence of the Federal Government, with its Executive Departments, its Legisla- 
ture, its Supreme Court, its National Museum, and other appliances, endows the Dis- 
trict of Columbia with nearly one-third of these libraries and with more than one- 
third of their contents; among these, the Library of Congress stands first in size, 
value of contents, and potential usefulness. 
The entire lack of public free-lending libraries in the District of Columbia is to 
some extent made up by the privilege of drawing books from the libraries of the Ex- 
ecutive Departments enjoyed by the employés thereof. The value of these Depart- 
ment libraries varies, naturally, with the character of their contents and the facilities 
existing for their use. Mrs. Helen L. MeL. Kimball, librarian of the Treasury De- 
partment, thus describes the way in which the collection under her charge is made 
to serve the public: 
“ Until 1875 this library was considered only a reference library, and formed part of 
the Division of Records and Files in the Secretary’s office. The library now has two 
divisions, the circulating and the reference, The hours for giving out books to readers 
are 8 to9 A. M., 12 to 12.30 Pp. M., and 4 to 5pr.M. Our greatest usefulness to others 
than officials is to the children in the schools, whose parents or friends use the library 
for their benefit, and our best work, perhaps, is in this direction.”

supported wholly or partly by public moneys.

LIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES. 
Pusiic ScHoon LipRraRtizs. 
[Tables 101 and 102.] 
  925 
The remarks already made respecting the group of public school libraries presented 
in this chapter should be keptin mind. The table here given does not pretend to in- 
elnde all the libraries of its class; most of them are excluded by their small size ; 
many by the fact that they are included with other statistics in the tables in a pre. 
vious part of this Report; some will be found in the first table (Table 98) of this 
chapter, because they are free lending as well as free school libraries. 
important deductions are made, the remaining libraries are tabulated in this group. 
Among public school library laws, that of California, briefly summarized in the Re- 
port of this Bureau for 1885-86, seems to be one of the simplest and most efficacious. 
A copy of the label used to designate the books in the school libraries of this State is 
here given. 
  
    
  PUBLIC SCHOOL LIBRARY, 
STATE OF CALIFORNIA, 
és School District. 
   RULES AND REGULATIONS.

LIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES. i 9381 
FREE CoRPORATE LENDING LIBRARIES. 
[Tables 103 and 104.] 
The generous spirit so characteristic in Americans is manifest in the support of 
libraries as of schools and colleges. Many of the libraries included in the first group 
considered in this chapter might be included in this group if it were sought to show 
how many such collections depend upon the past or present bounty of our citizens 
for a part of their support. Excluding those previously classified, this group includes 
those entirely supported, so far as known to this Bureau, by private gifts, bequests, 
or endowments. 
Libraries of this class naturally precede those supported by public moneys. It 
is quite possible to imagine the time when they will be practically superseded in the 
older and richer parts of the land; but the time is yet very distant when their use- 
fulness in the South and West shall be gone. In these parts of the country private 
beneficence can find no more useful object, no greater opportunity, than in the en- 
dowing of library corporations, which shall circulate good, useful, and entertaining 
books to all persons in their neighborhood. . 
TABLE 103,—Summary, by States and geographical divisions, of free lending libraries owned 
and supported by corporations.

  LIBRARIES IN THE UNITED STATES. 941 
LipRARIES OF SOCIETIES, ASSOCIATIONS, AND CLUBS. 
[Tables 105 and 106.] 
The fifth group of libraries considered in this chapter is almost without parallel 
in any other country. The entire freedom of associative efforts, social, professional, 
benevolent, and religions—inherentin the structure of American life, makes the forma- 
tion of societies for various purposes easy, and the collection of books almost inevita- 
ble. Notable among social-benevolent associations in library wook is the Independ- 
ent Order of Odd Fellows, and among those of a social-religious kind the Young 
Men’s Christian Associations. 
The southern part of the Union, as might be expected, has more of these libraries 
than any other kind. They are doing a great, though silent, work where it is most 
needed, and deserve every encouragement. The beginnings, almost as a matter of 
course, aresmall, and the difficulties encountered often fatal; yet the fact remains 
that libraries of this kind are springing into existence in the little villages that 
sparsely dot the vast expanses of the South and the far West. 
The use of the books in libraries of this group is confined mainly to members of the 
societies with which they are connected. To a certain extent the families of these 
members have the privilege of use. In nearly all cases a courteous application for 
permission to use the books for reference meets with a cordial assent; but in general 
this group is divided from the others in this chapter by the requirement of member- 
ship in the society as a preliminary to the borrowing of its books. The following 
extract from a letter written by Mr. William H. Baxter, secretary of the Petersburg 
(Va.) Benevolent Mechanics’ Association, shows how liberally some of these associa- 
tions allow their books to be used: 
“The library is entirely supported—all its expenses paid—by the association; 
there are no subscribers and no fees. The library and reading-room are open daily 
from 9 a. m. to 10 p. m. to all persons who comply with the few rules governing the 
use of books and periodicals. The association owns its building—‘ Mechanics’ Hall;’ 
the library room is 70 feet long, 28 feet wide, and 19 feet high; the reading-room is 
18 by 21 feet.” s

  954 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
  Corporate Lenpina LIBRARIES OPEN TO SUBSCRIBERS, 
{Tables 107 and 108.1 
Closely connected with the foregoing group, but characterized by a greater free- 
dom in conditions for the use of their contents, are subscription libraries owned by 
corporations. These indeed are the oldest kind of libraries for public use in this 
country, and they still outnumber those in any other group, though they do not equal 
the public lending, or public reference groups in the number of their volumes. 
The libraries in this group are liable at any moment to become free lending libra- 
ries; @ generous citizen may endow one of these on condition that its books shall be 
lent without charge, or the municipality may make a grant of public moneys upon 
the same condition. 
The losses thus incurred are made up by the continual establishment of new libra- 
ries in new or growing centres of population, Very often the new enterprise results 
from the gift of some resident who gives books or money to buy books, as a begin- 
ning.

LipRarins WHICH ARE BusINESS INVESTMENTS. 
{Tables 169 and 110.] 
The last group considered in this chapter contains circulating libraries conducted 
for the profit of their proprietors. Doubtless this list is very imperfect ; for example, 
all but nine of the libraries mentioned are in the North Atlantic Division. 
‘The libraries in this group, considered as means of public culture, are almost with- 
out value; asa means of personal amusement or relaxation, generally of an innocent 
kind, they serve their purpose and fill some sort of demand. |

REPORT UPON ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN LONDON FOR THE YEAR 
ENDING LADY-DAY (MARCH 25, 1887). 
The following information is derived from the report of Rev. Joseph R. Diggle, 
chairman of the school board for London, and from the reports of the several com- inittees of the board:

The reports, mentioned as the sources of information, do not give further particu- 
Jars relative to voluntary schools. From the report of the committee of council on 
education for the year ending August 31, 1886, it appears that the entire teaching 
staff for state-aided elementary schools in London was 11,392, 
The remaining particulars here given must be understood as relating solely to the 
397 board schools.

In addition to the 6,437 adult teachers enumerated above, the board employed 1,204 
salaried pupil-teachers and 425 probationers without salary. 
The total expenditure amounted to $4, 903,845, of which $3,740,877 were for teachers’ 
salaries. The average expenditure per child was $15.33, of which $9 was chargeable 
te rates, and §1.70 to fees, leaving $1.63 per child to be met from Government grants.

  ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN LONDON. 981 
The results of the inspectors’ examinations show that the teaching of elementary 
subjects has reached the highest point yet attained. The percentages of passes were 
as follows: arithmetic, ¥ writing, 90.6; reading, 95.7. 
With respect to other subjects, Chairman Diggle says: ‘There is a space of time 
daily set apart for the purpose of teaching the children, through Bible lessons, the es- 
sential principles upon which right conduct depends. In every school the children are 
taught to sing, and to sing by note. By means of extension exercises and drill, not 
only is the physical well-being of the children promoted, but those habits of disci- 
pline and obedience are formed, some of the a auaot which were observed last June 
in the admirable bearing. and conduct of the children at the jubilee féte in Hyde 
Park. Throughout the boys’ departments the boys are taught drawing, whilst needle- 
work is similarly taught in the girls’ departments. All the’children take English as 
2 class subject, which means that a certain amount of repetition is learnt, and a 
simple knowledge of English grammar is acquired. 
“Practically, all the boys are taught geography, whilst it is taught to about only 
10 per cent. of the girls. On the other hand, more than 9,000, or about 11 per cent., 
of the girls acquired some knowledge of practical cookery. History, which as a class 
subject is still undefined in the education code, and of which the systematized 
course is left wholly to the discretion of Her Majesty’s inspector and the school 
teacher, is, I regret to notice, only taught systematically to 2,400 boys and 600 girls. 
This shows a slight increase in the number of girls as compared with the previous 
year, but a decrease of 1,000 in the number of boys. Of the children eligible to be 
examined in specific subjects, exclusive of cookery, about 40 per cent. of the boys 
and 20 per cent. of the girls were presented and passed. The principal subjects in 
which the boys were presented were algebra (3,327 passes) and animal physiology 
(4,764 passes). These subjects account for 8,000 out of 11,000 passes. There were 
only 413 passes in French, of which 257 were from Ske division. i 
“The girls were almost wholly presented for examination in domestic economy, 
which subject accounts for 4,300 out of 4,500 passes,” 
He observes, farther, that ‘‘ The great danger which apparently threatens the steady 
progress of elementary education is the pressure which is constantly being exerted to 
render obligatory additional subjects of instruction, without reference to the varying 
circumstances of the children or the settled conditions of elementary school life. We 
are in danger of destroying the efficiency of elementary education by attempting to 
teach a little of many things instead of teaching what it is practicable to teach thor- 
oughly and well. Of the children in the London board schools, 96 per cent. leave 
school before the age of 13 years. Whilst the childiattends school heis taught for about 
5 hours daily for five days in the week. In the case of a large proportion of the chil- 
dren, their home circumstances either altogether preclude, or render extremely diffi- 
cult, the preparation of home lessons in aid of the ordinary school work. When they 
are absent from the influence of the school, they are surrendered to the education of- 
the street. It is quite impossible to carry out an ambitious educational programme 
under such conditions as these. But whatit is possible to do, is to teach the elementary 
subjects thoroughly and intelligently, and in such a manner as to instil into the minds 
of the children the desire for knowledge and a sense of enjoyment in its pursuit.” 
In 1885 the board began an experiment in enanual tearaiie for boys in one of the 
schools. The boys are selected from the seventh standard and instructed in carpentry 
two afternoons in each week. Through the liberality of the city guilds, a sum of 
$4,875 has been provided for the purpose of extending the experiment. In consider- 
ation of the fact that 96 per cent. of the children leave school before they ave 13 years 
of age, the chairman urges the importance of a more efficient system of evening or 
continuation schools by which theirinstruction may be continued long enough to in- 
sure lasting results. * 
Elementary education is conducted, as has been noted, in board and voluntary 
schools. The latter are established mainly by the several religious denominations. 
The following account of the largest and, in many respects, the most remarkable of 
the voluntary schools is from official sources :        
    
     
        JEWS’ FREE SCHOOL, BELL LANE, SPITALIIELDS, LONDON. 
The Jews’ free school, when founded in 1817, was Albee asa Lancasterian school 
for 600 boys and 300 girls. The staff for teaching, as in all similar institutions, con- 
sisted of a principal teacher and monitors. 
These latter, besides giving instruction to the mass of pupils, received special teach- 
ing for their own-benefit. The results produced by this system were neither good nor 
satisfactory. ; 
Up till 1840 the school continued to be conductedrin this way. In that, year Mr. 
Moses Angel was appointed head-master. He soon discovered the weak points of the
-P-A-G-E-982
      982 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. ae 
monitorial method and urged upon the managers the necessity of modifying it. At 
first his representations produced no effect; but when the late Sir Anthony de Roths- 
child became president of the institution, Mr. Angel found in him an enlightened and 
Jiberal-minded supporter. As a consequence, in 1848 the school premises were modified 
so as to adapt them, to what was deemed a better system of education, and since then, 
at various periods, the development of the building has been steady and progressive. 
Tt should be mentioned that much of the means necessary to pay the large cost en- 
tailed by successive structural alterations and additions was provided by Sir A. de 
Rothschild and his coadjutor, Mr. Alfred Davis, for many years treasurer of the school. 
This latter gentleman gave tothe school £30,000 during his life, and at his death 
endowed it with a further sum of £30,000. 
In 1855, on a plan suggested by Mr. Moses Angel, the head-master, six class rooms 
were built for boys, and what had been previously the master’s house was converted 
into class rooms for girls. Meanwhile the numbers of pupils of both sexes continued 
toincrease. In 1865 the committee of management, urged by Mr. Angel, bought a large 
quantity of land and erected on it two immense stacks of class rooms for boys and 
girls. The school was thus rendered capable of accommodating 1,800 boys and 1,000 
girls. Nor was the change in the teaching staff less than that in the building. In 
1853 the school was placed under Government inspection, and forthwith the monitors 
disappeared. Their places were supplied partly by pupil-teachers and partly by adult 
teachers, and in order to insure a proper supply of these officers Mr. Angel inaugur- 
ated a system of training which made the schoo] a normal college as well as a primary 
school. Under this system all male and female teachers, on attaining the proper age, 
were expected to submit themselves to the examination for certificates required by the 
education code; and in addition all male teachers who showed aptitude were edu- 
cated for degrees at the University of London. Great success attended this new de- 
parture. Above two hundred certificated teachers and a large number of graduates 
(including two M. A.’s, one LL. B., thirty B. A.’s) have been pupils of the school, and 
the supply is still going on. 
It having become evident, in 1883, that the buildings were no longer adapted to 
the demands, new plans were formed, and in March, 1884, the old buildings were de- 
molished, and on their site a magnificent set of class-rooms, surrounding a great central 
hall, was erected at a cost of £25,000. By this means the school was rendered capa- 
ble of accommodating 2,250 boys and 1,250 girls, and in a very short time those 
numbers of children were entered on the school registers. And indeed such is the 
popularity of the school, because of its splendid success under inspection, and such 
are its special attractions for the poor foreign Jewish immigrants into England 
(vietims of p cution and oppression in Russia and Germany), who find in it sym- 
pathy and religious consolation and enlightenment, that, notwithstanding the fact 
that the London school board is providing schools with Jewish teachers for the large 
    
numbers of Jews located in the east end of London, hundreds of applicants for ad- 
mission have to be sent away from want of space and impossibility to provide more 
teaching power than at present exists. 
The actual condition of the school as regards staff and accommodation is as follows: 
Boys’ department.—One head-master; one vice-master; thirty certificated assist- 
ants; six assistants who are past-pupil-teachers; twenty-one pupil-teachers and pro- 
bationers ; forty-five class-rooms and the central hall; a library and private rooms 
for the masters and the principal teachers. 
Girls’ department.—One head-mistress; twenty certificated assistants ; eight assist- 
ants who are past-pupil-teachers ; ten pupil-teachers ; three teachers of needle-work ; 
a large staff of domestics for teaching cooking, house-work, washing, ironing, and 
mangling under the direction of the head-mistress ; twenty-eight class-rooms ; a com- 
plete and spacious domestic department, including a dining hall; an extensive laundry 
and its necessary accompaniments; vestiaries and store-rooms, 
Other details.—Annual expenditure of public money about £11,000, of which £3,300 
is earned as grant by the examination under inspection. [In addition to this amount 
a very large sum is provided by private benevolence of Lord Rothschild and his fam- 
ily. By this means every child is clothed once annually, and receives two pairs of 
boots; summer excursions are provided, medical and other aid is rendered avail- 
able, where required, for teachers and pupils; and indeed there is no reasonable 
want felt that is not liberally provided for. ] z 
The property of the school realizes an income of about £3,000. ‘The annual deficit 
is supplied by public contributions. 
Every officer (male and female)-on the teaching staff, except the sempstresses, has 
been trained in this school by Mr. Angel. Si 
The benefits of the’school are conferred on the children gratis. “Thero is a vominal 
cae ee 1d per week, but it is not enforced, and no child is sent home for failure of

The ladies of the Rothschild family, with other ladies, regularly attend to super- 
vise the girls’ department by examination of children and by consultation with the 
head-mistress. 
The board of management meets once a month for general direction, but there is an 
executive committee, consisting of the honorary officers, which meets: whenever re- 
quired. Moreover the president is willing to receive the head-master in conference 
whenever the latter desires to sec him. Besides providing for its own wants in the 
supply of teachers, the free school has sent trained mén and women to fulfil scholas- 
tic or synagogical appointments in various parts of England, in the British colonies, 
and to the United States. The Rev. Dr. Raphael Benjamin, M. s., of Cincinnati, 
Mr. Raphael Dalosta Lewin (of New York); the Rev. Abraham Harris, formerly of 
Charleston ; Mr. Josiah Cohon, barrister at law (originally a teacher), Pittsburg, Pa., 
are among old pupils of the school. 
     
        
  AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION IN FRANCE. 
[The following circular, addressed to the prefects by the French minister of agri- 
culture, gives ina brief form a complete view of the public provision for agricultural 
education in France. ] 
     rt: The importance, every day greater, which agriculture is 
the economic position of nations has attracted to it much attention from 
the various Governments. ‘ 
In France a capital of more than a hundred millions is employed, and the least im- 
provement in working and the smallest invention in machinery bring about an aug- 
mentation of production, which means for the country an immediate increase of some 
hundreds of millions in wealth, 
Parliament and the public authorities have neglected nothing to second private 
initiative; shows, subventions to agricultural associations, publications, etc. ; every-' 
thing has been done to keep French agriculture in the position it has always held. 
Agricultural education, the surest and most powerful means of giving to improve- 
ment a new impulse, is being developed in some countries to a high degree, and in 
France has been the subject of special studies, which has given it a.most complete 
organization. 
As you know, at the head of our agricultural education, reéstablished in 1876 by 
the Republic, is the National Agricultural Institute, which corresponds to higher 
teaching in a university, and which provides the most learned professors and chemists. 
There are the three national agricultural schools of Grignon, Montpellier, and Grand- 
jouan. The schools have been much improved, and are fully equal at present to the 
demands made upon them. 
Then come the practical schools of agriculture founded in 1873, of which the law of 
July 30, 1875, confirmed the existence. Open to the.sons of the numerous class, the 
working and laborious cultivators of the soil, they receive children from the primary 
schools, and maintain them at a lower rate than the smaller colleges, and when they 
are strong enough and their intellectual instruction sufficiently deyeloped, they re- 
turn to their homes in order to assist in the work of cultivation. 
These schools satisfy in that respect the desiderata of those who protest against 
intellectual overpressure, for a portion of the day is devoted to manual and a portion 
to intellectual labor. 
At the present moment these schools number nineteen, and each day we are asked. 
to establish new ones. The time is approaching in the near future when each de- 
partment will have to possess at least one of. these useful institutions; but before 
founding one it will be necessary to examine carefully the needs and resources of the 
department, so as to provide in the school for the study and teaching of certain ques- 
tions relating to culture and the agricultural industry, such as dairying, cheese pro-, 
duction, viticulture, horticulture, arboriculture, irrigation, ete. 
But the children who enter these institutions direct from primary schools must 
have had a certain amount of preparation. In that view it will be necessary, in agri- 
cultural centres, to lirect the courses of higher primary schools especially towards 
agriculture. 
Thus we must organize in the lower primary schools a course of instruction in the 
first ideas and the principal applications of science in reference to agricultural in- 
struction, over which the teachers must carefully keep watch, for it is the basis of 
all the others. 
I must call your attention more particularly to one point. For the higher primary 
schools, and especially in the lower, we never find among candidates. a sufficient

number of teachers capable of giving good and_ sufficient tuition in agriculture. 
This inconvenience is apparent everywhere, and to remedy it the department of 
the Haute Sadne has had recourse to an excessively practical means. 
Each year choice is made among the pupil-teachers coming from the normal school 
of those who’ have shown the most inclination and disposition for agricultural 
studies, and of these a certain number are sent, at the department’s expense, for a 
year, to a school farm or a practical agricultural school. There they finish their edn- 
cation, and then they are engaged as tutorsin the agricultural centres, where they 
render great service. 
We may add, in conclusion, that courses of lectares in agriculture have been started 
in some of our schools and colleges, and that almost all our departments have a pro- 
fessor of agriculture. 
Such is, in its entirety, the organization of our agricultural instruction. We must 
now watch over its development and see to its efficient working, and I reckon upon 
your assistance to obtain its success. You will have to ascertain, among the various 
branches of instruction, that which best meets the needs of your department. You 
will let me know what the conseil-général is prepared to do, either in creating 
scholarships in our agricultural schools for students of the normal schools or in or- 
ganizing practical schools and fields for experiments or demonstrations, or else in 
founding an agricultural course in colleges and the higher primary schools.

TRADE AND INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS IN SWITZERLAND. 
REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE BY THE HON, BOYD WINCHESTER, MINISTER 
‘ RESIDENT AND CONSUL-GENERAL, 
There exists much misapprehension as to what technical education means. There 
is a difference between learning a trade and learning the principles of a trade. Man- 
ual training is, of course, training to manual labor, which has been called the ‘‘study 
of the external world.” The chief object of technical education is not to teach par- 
ticular trades, but to train the pupils to handiness. The object of teaching girls to 
sew is not to train professionai dressmakers, but to make them useful and tidy in 
theirhomes. Workshop instruction is not to make boys carpenters or cabinet makers, 
but it enables them to learn any trade more easily, and makes them generally 
handy. It is no small part of the value of such training that the workman may be 
fitted to make his home more commodiovs, to fit a shelf or cupboard, to replace a 
broken piece of furniture, or possibly to decorate his room. But whether in after 
years the student sees proper to become an artisan is not involved in the idea and 
system of technical education. Its aim is, that when he leaves school he shall carry 
with him an education serviceable for any occupation of life. Developing a dex- 
terity of hand which will prove valuable whatiever his future circumstances may be, 
and at the same time farnish him with a means of healthy enjoyment, surely is to be- 
stow on him that birthright of every child born into the world which the prevailing 
systems of education have only too long withheld. 
While intelligence can not be too much stimulated, and while bright and active 
minds should find every opportunity for development toward the highest tasks for 
which they may be fitted, it is still to be remembered that by far the largest number 
of children are destined to make their living by industrial labor, and that their 
minds should not be carried away from this necessity, but rather reconciled to it by a 
judicious preparation. It has always appeared as though a purely scholastic educa- 
tion made children averse to manual labor. ‘The, counting-house has presented to 
{bem more fascinations than the workshop. It has been found necessary to correct 
this one-sided education, which results in. every boy or girl leaving school being de- 
sirous of engaging in work which is nei ther manual nor what is mistermed menial. 
Asa fundamenial principle, that knowledge which is best for use is also best for 
discipline, since any other supposition,, as Mr. Spencer has shown, would imply an 
enormous waste of energy which is qu'rte foreign to nature in any other field of her 
activity. The best accepted detiniticn of modern public education is that which 
declares its objects to be to equip and enable boys and girls to earn their own living 
when they grow up, and to perform e fficieatly the duties to which they will be called 
* when they reach the estate of manhc od and womanhood ; that all boys, no matter 
whatis, iperr station,in life, should bis taught to use their hands, and the girls should 
be educated so.asto become good hor isewives. The country wants more handicrafts- 
men, the schools produce too many ‘icriveners. The country is crying out for skilled 
     
-P-A-G-E-985

laborers, and the schoolssend them clerks or would-be gentlemen of leisure. The 
farmers and workingmen want wives who can make a home neat and happy, and who 
understand the wise economy of limited resources, and the schools send them women fit 
only to be governesses. In truth, it is coming to be recognized that technical training 
ought to be an essential part of the work of every public elementary school, and the 
children instilled with the idea that there is really no more greet dignified, or 
happy condition than that which may be attained through honest and intelligent in- 
dustry ; that manual instruction, apart from assuring the material requisite of exist- 
ence, is a form of education that is calculated to develop a healthy love of labor, to 
exercise the faculties of attention, perception, and intuition; not simply to make a 
workman, but to train up aman. 
This question has received much intelligent consideration in Switzerland, and, under 
the constitution, the Confederation is authorized to establish and maintain industrial 
and tradeschools. The Polytechnicum, or Technical University at Zurich, a govern- 
ment institution, where instruction is given in applied mechanics, physics, and art, 
embracing a general and thorough scientific curricuium, is well known, and has been 
trequently presented to the public as a model school of practical life. But trade and 
industrial schools, as distinguished from polytechnic, genuine establishments for 
teaching homely trades, are being made a conspicuous as well as compulsory feature 
of the Swiss public educational system. They are to be found in every canton, fur- 
nishing instruction in numerous branches of handiwork, the boys preferring to become 
skilled workmen and foremen, and many a girl, though an indifferent scholar, by be- 
ing taught cutting and thorough needlework, cooking and cleanliness, and methodi- 
cal habits, that bear so much upon the happiness and existence of the home, is pre- 
pared to prove ¢ 
a population not exceeding 300,000 are reported as having as many as one hundred of 
theso schools with over 3,000 pupils. 
Trade schools in Switzerland are of ancient origin, having an intimate connection 
with the great impulse which the watch industry of French Switzerland received in 
the latter half of last century. In the year 1770 a journeyman watchmaker, named 
Louis Faegare, ‘applied to Professor Saussure for some information connected with his 
trade, which the means of ordinary public instruction did not afford to his class. The 
professor readily complied, and the result was a series of lectures or rather conversa- 
ziones held in the great scientist’s own drawing-room. The audience soon increasing, 
a suitable locality was rented and a sort of club formed under the title of Société des 
arts de Gendve. This club, so modest in its beginnings, has survived all the mighty 
political tempests of a troubled age, the violent annexation of the Genevese Re- 
public to France, and its restoration to the Helvetic Union, and to-day it occupies 
a high rank among learned societies, and numbers among its honorary members 
and associates many of the foremost names in modern science. This is the par- 
ent of the celebrated watchmakers’ school at Geneva, with branches at Chaux-de- 
fonds, Bienne, Neuchatel, and Soleure. Pupils are received in these schools when 
they are passed their fourteenth year, and must remain from three to four and a half 
years. For the proper artistic education there is provided a special technical school 
at Chaux-de-fonds, devoted to the art of decorating, which now constitutes a very 
important feature of the watch industry. % 
More humble in their first stages, but scarcely inferior as to practical results, are the 
Swiss straw-plaiting schools, which have succeeded in developing a veritable new   
industry, commanding markets in the utmost corners of the earth. Some of the 
poorest portions of the subalpine districts have become well-to-do and flourishing, 
and it is said at least one little hamlet, which was 1iot to be found in the guide-boo. 
a few years ago, is now, from this trade, a thrifty town of some 10,000 inhabitants, 
The higher instruction in this particular branch extends to the cultivation and ac- 
climatization of various kinds of foreign grasses, furnishing from the coarsest to the 
finest qualities of straw. In Zurich there is a dress-maker’s institute which annually 
“graduates” some 30 or 40 qualified Parisian mistresses and assistant mistresses. 
Bat to turn to trades which either by law or immemorial usage’ are assumed to re- 
quire some years’ apprenticeship: First in order of importance comes wood-carving, 
a Swiss product that enjoys a world-wide reputation, and has long been a source of 
no small part of the country’srevenue. The schools for wood-carvérs seem to havea 
folly organized faculty. The word faculty is used advisedly, for the courses have an 
almost amusing resemblance to an academic course. There are lectures with manip- 
ulatory demoustrations in the use of the plane, saw, lathe, and all needed tools, and 
also in the distinctive characteristics of various woods. A school for ornamental 
work and designs in wood-carving is at Breeng, supported by the communes and 
canton jointly, and at Interlaken the wood-workers enjoy the services Of a ‘‘ master 
modeller,” paid by the canton. Then there are schools for the study of wood-engrav- 
ing, sculpture, and artcabinet-making. Thereis at Wintérthur’a sioémakers’ sthool 
with an average attendance of 40, and it has a p tetic staff of in¥truetois, These

    O86. a4, EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
instructors give lessons at various towns, where classes can be organized, continuing 
from 4 to 6 weeks. This school also issues publications relating to their trade, one 
of the latest being on the structure of the human foot, and the technical reasons of 
the Swiss military authorities for the new regulations concerning the contracts for 
boots and shoes for the army. Other handicrafts have followed the example set by 
the shoemakers ; notably joiners, cabinet-makers, silk-weavers, basket-makers, jewel- 
lers, even to umbreflas and parasols, have their cheap training schools. 
Drawing, industrial, as distinguished from artistic, is taught in all the Swiss schools, 
not as an accomplishment, but is considered a necessity, It embraces mechanical 
and perspective, frequently extending to a course of construction and designing. ' It 
is regarded that “ drawing” lies at the bottom of all industrial training, enabling one 
to delineate with precision that which he wishes to express better than he can doit 
with the language of the pen. In his ‘ Proposed hints for an academy” Benjamin 
Franklin classed ‘‘ drawing” with the three 2s, as subjects necessary for all. It 
ranks with them because it is the language of form in every branch of industry, from 
the most simple to the most complex. It makes the workmen more exact, more effi- 
cient, and more useful; it is always convenient and often indispensable. As an essen- 
og peek of popular education, its claim is universally recognized in all of the Swiss 
schools. 
The agricultural and forestry department of the Federal Polytechnic Institute, in 
its “technology” as signifying science applied to industrial arts, has advanced those 
‘interests to positions that otherwise could.never have been attained. Switzerland in 
physical respects is not a bountiful mother-land, neither the climate nor soil is good 
for agriculture, yet it is surprising what good results are obtained by the general 
diffusion among the agricultural class of much technical knowledge. With them the 
cultivation of the land ex necessitate rei could not be a simple routine, but a science. 
Mere practical farming would not return the labor and expense expended, but as an 
intelligent, educated industry, it has become quite prosperous and profitable. 
The agricultural course in the Polytechnic is therefore looked upon as one of its 
most important, and the course is very thorough and comprehensive as to the Swiss 
conditions, covering the mechanical and chemical composition of the soil, the scientific 
basis as to rotation of crops, the periods of growth at which plants take their nitro- 
gen, how draining improves land, and many other similar questions varied in their 
applications, but ruled by fixed laws, and which can be learned only by some techni- 
cal instruction outside the daily routine of farm life. Take even the single question 
of grasses,” in which Switzerland is so much concerned on account of its extensive 
dairy interest, and the technical information scattered through the influence of the 
Polytechnic has been of incalculable value. It would be incredible to an American 
farmer to whom nature is so prodigal, to see the extent and varied use made of the 
grass crop of the Swiss. To do this, however, he must know something of the chem- 
ical analysis of the grass in both the natural and dried state, the feeding values of 
like weights of the different species, in an equally moist or dry condition, at the final 
stage of growth which they ought to be allowed to attain, their suitability for per- 
manent or other pastures, the adaptability of some kinds of grasses for certain soils, 
the amount of growth attained, the time of maturity, their duration, ability to resist 
drought, strength to overpower weeds, and other circumstances that must be taken 
into account. Then there are questions relating to the extension of pastures, the 
drainage of grass land, cultural preparations, the selection of grasses, laying down 
pastures, the management of old and new grass lands, hay-making, grazing, ensilage, 
and temporary pastures—all subjects on which the Swiss farmer is enlightened and 
kept abreast with the most advanced ideas, It may be added that for the benefit of 
the same class in a great measure are the weekly lectures given at the Polytechnic 
on the subject of ‘ pisciculture.” 
The expenses of the distinctively industrial schools, not including the Polytechnic, 
for the year 1885, were 522,425 francs, paid by the cantons, and 152,041 by the Con- 
federation—a total of 674,466 francs. The chief appropriation of the Confederation 
is to the Polytechni¢, which it entirely sustains. 
From what has been said in this report, and a previous one on the Public Schools 
and Education in Switzerland, it must be conceded that the country enjoys a system 
of education aptly described by the educational commissioner of France as existing 
in that country, ‘‘ at once enlarged and simplitied, instructive and attractive, for it 
does not omit even music and singing ; healthiest, for it takes care of the body as well 
as the mind, and includes gymnastic and manual exercises; more practical, for it 
teaches drawing, which is the key of all industrial and mechanical professions; and 
more moraland patriotic, because it is founded on love of country.” 
‘To this might be supplemented a summary of the special benefits of the technical 
and industrial training so conspicuous in the Swiss system. 
It tends in addition to imparting dexterity of hand, no less to develop the child 
physically, mentally, and morally.    
-P-A-G-E-987

It encourages a love of work in the children. 
It inspires respect for the rougher kind of work. 
It cultivates spontaneous activity. 
It habituates to order, accuracy, cleanliness, and ueatness. 
It accustoms to attention, industry, and perseverance, 
Tt develops the physical strength. 
't acts as a counterpoise to too much sitting. 
It trains the eye, and cultivates the sense of form. 
it leads the child to the conception of harmony and beauty. 
It stimulates a love for intellectual honesty. 
‘The United States takes a just pride in its common school system as sustained by 
the States, and Mr. Atkinson, in summing up the elements that have contributed to 
the vast gain in the conditions of material welfare in the United States, names seven, 
and assigns the third position in the seven to the ‘systems of common schools which 
are now extending throughout the land.” But there isa complaint that the educa- 
tion given at the public expense is not practical enough. That our schools send too 
many boys into trading, teaching, the professions, or ‘living by their wits,” That 
the children of that class constituting so large a majority with us who must depend 
on manual labor, are taught to despise and shun what are called humble callings, and 
to crowd at starvation wages the occupations of the counter and the desk. 
There is no doubt that in the laudable desire to obtain for our children a highstand- 
ard of.general culture, and in omitting to teach the masses the use of the tools by 
which so many of them will have to earn their living, we are unintentionally lead- 
ing them to believe that the bread which has been gained by the sweat of the brow 
is less honorably earned than that which is the result of mechanical quill-driving. 
Our schools send out too many men ‘learned, so called, who know the whole gamut 
of classical learning, who have sounded the depths of mathematical and speculative 
philosophy, and yet who could not harness a horse, or make out a bill of sale, if their 
lives depended on it,” was the opinion of the late. President Garfield. We want a 
popular education which fits for the heat and task of active life in an age which knows 
no rest—an education which gives to the mind fleet and safe modes of reasoning, and 
at the same time in a corresponding degree a clear sight, a firm arm, and training 
suitable for the various trades and occupations which are essential elements of a pros- 
perous national life. 
It is predicted that the closing years of this century are to be distinguished by a 
great industrial war of far more reaching and serious import than mere military wars. 
All through our country scientifically and technically trained foreigners are pushing 
classically educated Americans from their stools and desks. Our competitors in the 
markets of the world are the most systematically instructed and best informed in Eu- 
rope, and we must confront a most serious struggle to hold our own. It is only in the 
matter of technical education that we are deficient as compared with our foreign 
competitors—in the training which fits men for business; our system seems to Bo 
planned too much for a life of leisure. American spirit and energy are unequaled 
and need but proper training and education to give an earnest of unbounded success 
in maintaining the future eminence of our country in the world’s great field of hu- 
man art and human industry. The question of manual and industrial instruction 
which, at first sight, might seem of interest only to those more nearly connected with 
the organization of our schools, may, if further examined, be found to involve such 
far-reaching issues that the statesman cannot afford to treat it with neglect. Might 
not the spirit of cheerful domestic industry which the cultivation of handiwork is 
calculated to promote do much to banish those evils of intemperance, violence, and 
social discontent which of late have shown such alarming symptoms? The moral in- 
fluence it exerts might prove the proper and effective antidote to these evils.. There 
can be no doubt that the ranks of the unemployed and misery and erime are largely 
swelled by the want of proper training in youth in industrial handicrafts and tech- 
nical arts; that with a general dissemination of the rudiments of useful trades and 
employments there would be won a larger share to productive labor, for it would be 
shown how to put brains into it, and make it more honorable. Thus workshop teach- 
ing in the elementary schools would not only give a superior equipment to the chil- 
dren, but might furnish a remedy, an easy, popular, cheap, and healthful remedy 
for some of the social ills that threaten us. In the words of Mr. James Blake, ‘Let 
us head-train the hand-worker, and hand-train the head-worker. For manual train- 
ing and head training together form the only whole education.” Apart from the 
practical advantages, it has an ethical value in enabling men and women to use all 
their faculties, for ‘‘no man can distort himself by exclusive attention to one order 
of faculties and especially by neglecting to keep good balance between the two fun- 
damental codrdinates of his being—body and mind—without finding the distortion 
repeating itself in moral obtuseness and disorder.” b abe

    988 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87, 
AMERICAN COLLEGES IN ASIA MINOR. 
REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE BY H, M. JEWETT, U.S. CONSUL’ AT SIVAS, 
TURKEY. 
The leading educational institutions of Turkey are American—that is, are founded 
by American societies, taught by American teachers, and supported in large part by 
American money. 
The provincial schools supported by the Turkish Government are of a most inferior 
grade. They teach little besides reading and writing and the memorizing of large 
portions of the Koran. Much attention is paid to the last. Even in the large cities 
the Turkish schools are of inferior quality, and but a small proportion of the children 
attend them. In Sivas, for instance, a city of some 40,000 or 50,000 inhabitants and 
the capital of a province of 850,000 population, there are but five Turkish common 
schools, with a total attendance of 937 pupils. ‘The higher institutions consist of a 
normal school with 60 students, a military school with 202 students, and a high school 
with 104 students. 
There is, on the other hand, a growing aspiration among the people for the dignity 
and advantages of Western civilization, a desire, especially among the Armenians, 
for liberal education, and astruggle for institutions affording it. hestruggle, how- 
ever, without help from abroad, is nearly futile. There is neither the necessary ex- 
perience nor the pecuniary ability, The help indispensably necessary to educational 
interests in Turkey has been extended by American hands. 
The codperation of American benevolence and native desire for better means-of 
culture has resulted in the establishment, under American auspices, of primary 
schools, high schools, and colleges in every part of Asia Minor. These schools have 
already accomplished great good, not only as relates to their own pupils, but as a 
pear for the native schools, forcing them to raise their standard and improve their 
methods. 
The people of the United States send annually some $200,000 through the American 
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions for the support of the work of that or- 
ganization in Turkey. For many years the work of the board and its missionaries 
was devoted almost exclusively to religious teaching. Of late years, however, much 
attention has been devoted to secular education. This branch of missionary work 
has rapidly increased, until now, as stated, the schools of the highest standard 
throughout Asia Minor are those founded by the board, and in large part supported 
by American money. The people of tie United States being therefore so largely in- 
terested in educational work in Turkey by large outiays of money as well as by sym- 
pathy in the work, some observations on the character of these schools may properly 
be considered as within the province of a consular report. 
_ There are three American colleges in Asia Minor, viz, Aintab College at Aintab, Eu- 
phrates College at Harpout, and Anatolia College at Marsavan. The last named is 
in this vilayet, and as I can speak of it from personal observation I shall confine this 
report mainly to it, it being a fair representative of all. 
Marsavan, the location of Anatolia College, is some 60 miles southwest of Samsoun, 
the nearest port on the Black Sea. Itis in the main thoroughfare connecting Sam- 
soun, Sivas, Cesarea, Yosgat, and other large cities, and is easy of access from all 
parts of northern and central Asia Minor, the districts for which it is intended to 
provide. 
This institution, as it stands related to the Turkish Government and to its support- 
ers in the United States, is one department of a more extended system of education. 
In 1863 an institution of learning was founded at Marsavan by missionaries of the 
American board. It was called a theological seminary, but aimed at the. prepara- 
tion of both theological and scientific instructors for the people. As time passed 
the scientific department grew in importance, and without change of principle or gov- 
ernmental relation was developed into a vollege, complete in itself, assisted by foreign 
and native contributions, but still holding its original status and becoming the nat- 
ural development of the original broad idea. One branch of the original institution 
is scientific, with its constitution and administration, and is Anatolia College. The 
other branch is the theological department, with its own rules and administration, 
the former being subservient to the latter in that for those who study theology it fur- 
nishes the necessary scientific preparation and mental discipline. The distinctly 
scientifie branch of the institution dates from 1881, being then separated in the form 
of a high school. The formal organization as a college dates from September, 1886. 
While the college is not founded in the interest of any one nationality, but is open 
to all, its main constituency is among the Armenians and Greeks. The laws and ad- 
istration of the college bar no student from the free exercise of his religion, and 
y no restraint apo’ him beyond such av is required by pure morality and ‘the laws 
of health and godt order,   
-P-A-G-E-989

The attendance of the college during the year just closed was 135, of whom 108 were 
Armenians and 27 Greeks. 
The distribution of their residences was as follows:

‘Total 185 
The college has accommodations for about 170 students, including 125 boarders. 
The buildings occupy a portion of a lot’ of four acres, finely situated in the highest 
part of the city. They are built in American style, and, while plain in structure, ‘form 
the most attractive feature in the city. 
The cost of the buildings in use for the college and theological seminary together 
was about $7,000, nearly all of which was contributed by the American board. 
The college has as endowment the income of $20,000 set aside for that purpose by 
the American board, and that of $4,400 from native sources. ‘There are on hand be- 
ginnings of philosophical, astronomical, geological, and chemical apparatus. There 
is a library of two thousand volumes, ‘mainly English, Armenian, and Greek, with 
something in French and Turkish. 
The yearly charges for students are: For board, ene 63; for tuition and minor ex- 
penses, £T. 243 for French, extra, £T.1; total, £19 $41. These charges indicate 
the cheapness of living ; that for board covers the whole expense of food and cooking, 
Four American missionaries give the whole or a part of their time to the college, 
The following salaries are paid native teachers:

classes. There are nine regular instructors besides five ‘advanced pupils teaching 
preparatory classes. A number of the students assist in payment of board by taking 
care of the rooms and other work. An industrial department is begun, and will be 
developed as means are secured. 
The language of the college is English. Most of the text books are in English, and 
after the freshman year the teaching of the sciences, etc., is almost entirely i in that 
language. Besides this, a thorough course is given in classical Armenian for the 
Armenians, in Greek for the Greeks, and in Turkish for all. 
The course of study, aside from languages as stated, is in detail as follows: 
  
Term. Freshman year. Sophomore year. Junior year. Senior year. 
First torm...| Geometry (Eng.)...| Coniesections(Eng,);| Book-keoping(Eng.);| Mental philosophy astronomy (Eng.).| chemistry. in Armenian and Greek; physiolo- gy.

Regarding the influencé the college has indirectly upon the people at large, Rev, 
Mr. G. C. Tracy. president of the ‘Anatolia College, writes: * *,.* “Though ibhe 
college is so new an institution its stimulating and formative influence upon, they pop- 
ulation seems to be very considerable. The most direct result is the wakening of as- 
pirations in young men. There follows immediately the raising of the grade i in the 
common schools and the establishment of higher schools prepa ratory* to the college,

        990 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
It is already shown that the college tends to lift the whole population to a higher 
educational level. The influence on Mohammedan schools is not slight. Indeed, 
the American colleges established in Turkey make it impossible for the Government 
to hold its own with the people without strenuous efforts in the same direction. This 
stimulation is healthful and beneficial. If there is some unreasonable jealousy of 
these institutions there is also increase of friendly relations on account of them. In 
Marsavan, relations (between the authorities and the missionaries) have never been so 
kindly as since the development of the college. The city governor has honored him- 
self by cordially aiding the college. + 
“The governor-general of Sivas, Sirri Pasha, on a recent visit’ of inspection declared 
this to be the best school in the region by far, and that no teaching of the Turkish 
language in the highest Turkish school of the city could equal that taught in Anatolia 
College. * * * It is but fair to say that the institution could never have reached its 
position nor could it maintain that position without the friendly offices of the Amer- 
-ican legation.” 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
Of almost equal importance with the colleges are the American high schools in 
most of the larger cities of Asia Minor. Their general character may be judged from 
the following course of study, that of the high school at Casarea:

EDUCATION IN THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC. 
FROM A REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE BY EDWARD L. BAKER, U. S. CON- 
SUL AT BUENOS AYRES. 
It is generally conceded that the crowning glory of the United States is our system 
of free common schools, the education of the people being considered by us as the 
surest support, protection, and defence of our republican form of government. And 
it speaks well for the Argentine Republic that its rulers and statesmen generally are 
, fully aroused to the importance of placing their country upon a higher educational 
level, as the necessary means of strengthening and perpetuating their own free insti- 
tutions. In this respect they are not only practically imitating our example, but 
not content, as we have done, with leaving the education of the people to the difter- 
ent provinces or States, they have made it a national concern and have engrafted the 
sacred principle in their fundamental law and hedged it around by the safeguards of 
their constitution. The sixty-seventh article provides as follows: 
“ Congress shall have power to provide whatever may conduce to the prosperity of 
the gonutty, the advancement and happiness of the provinces, and the increase ot en- 
Jightenment, by decreeing plans for general and university education,” etc.! They &   
1The constitution farther eeanirey (Art. V) that ‘the constitution of cach proyince shall provide 
Yor primary education and the administration of justice,” thus making the support of common schools 
obligatory upon them.

have gone even further than this, :a showing their appreciation of the importance of 
education of the people, by making education a department of the Government, under 
the charge of a cabinet officer. ; 
ITS MOST EFFICIENT PROMOTERS. 
While great credit is due to General Mitre, first President of the Argentine Repub- 
lic under its present constitution, and to Dr. Rawson, the chief of his cabinet, as also 
to Dr. Eduardo Costa, to the late President Avellenada, and to Dr. Legnisaimon, all 
three of whom at different times occupied the position of minister of public instrue- 
tion, for their persistent efforts in behalf of popular education, and for their services 
in developing and extending the system of Argentine common schools, perhaps the 
place of honor belongs to Dr. Domingo I’, Sarmiento, LL.D. He-was for 6 years 
Argentine minister plenipotentiary to the United States, and having been a school- 
master in his early manhood, he was during his sojourn with us thoroughly impressed 
with the excellence of our public educational system. His intimacy with the late 
Horace Mann greatly assisted to develop his ideas on that subject ; and when, having 
meanwhile been elected President of the Argentine Republic, he returned to take 
charge of the high office, he brought back with him the most advanced opinions and 
at once proceeded, through the influence he was able to exert, to put them in practi- 
cal operation here in his own country. 
DIFFICULTIES WITH WHICH EDUCATION HAS HAD TO CONTEND. 
In asparsely settled country like the Argentine Republic, in which there are widely 
extended regions entirely uninhabited and where the centres of population are remote 
from each other, of course the application of our American system has met great diffi- 
culties and inconveniences, but within the last few years the efforts of the Argentine 
National Government to place the education of the people upon a firm and abiding 
foundation, with uniform regulations for all the provinces, are beginning to produce 
their legitimate effects, and this country to-day stands at the head of all the nations 
of South America in the matter of its public schools, not excepting Chili or Brazil. 
The position has not been won without a severe struggle and great persistency; for, 
though the country was a republic, a large and influential portion of the inhabitants 
could hardly be considered as republican. There lingered with this class a very 
strong infusion of the old Spanish “‘hidalgo ” exclusiveness, which would not admit 
or consent that their children should be placed on the same level of school equality 
with those of the more humble citizens. It is only within a few years that the ‘‘ upper 
classes” would permit their children to attend the public free schools, but sent them 
to special or private schools. With the increase of republican intelligence this feel- 
ing, however, is gradually dying out; and now quite all classes of the community, 
without regard to condition, are to be seen in the public schools of the seyerai prov- 
inces. 
THE NATIONAL SUPPORT, 
The Argentine Government has not assumed to take the matter of public education 
out of the control of the different provincial governments; but, as far as possible, 
has left the organization and details of the schools to the districts themselves, limit- 
ing its action to a subsidy for their support iu these cases where the means of the 
provinces may be insufficient. This subsidy consists of such an amount of pecuniary 
aid, each year, as Congress may provide by law. The “ plans” and curriculum, how- 
ever, as the constitution provides, are under the ultimate supervision of the General 
Government? 
  
1“ Primary education is already obligatory in some of the provinces, although in the remote districts where within a diameter of 10 leagues perhaps not five or six school children may be found, there are peculiar difficulties in the way ef uniting them for the purposes of instruction. “Chis and ther local causes are obstacles to progress. Indeed, there is no other country where s6’many difficulties in the way of public instruction have to bo combated; and if, notwithstanding all, the Argentines have 
placed themselves at the head of South America in respect to popular education they are really to be congratulated upon their success.” Republica Argentina por Ricardo Nap., p. 376. 2'The interest which is felt in the cause of education will bo understood from ex-President Rova’s message to the Argentine Congress. He said: ‘The department of public instruction has been one 
of the chief attentions of the Executive. I may say that the subject of free schools has become of such importance that it is a public passion, as any one may well observe by the general moyement in this respect in every centre of population.” And President Uelman, in the address he delivered at his recent inauguration, says; “A government of the people by the people requires thatthe people shall be educated. ‘Tho foundation of republican governmout is the enlightenment of the people; and one of the most important duties of statesmen is to aid and assist it,” ete.

COMMON SCHOOL STATISTICS. 
The progress whieh has been made in popularizing these public schools will be seen 
from the following table, showing the attendance from 1864 to 1886: 
  
  
    ] Number | ‘Number 
Year. in Year. in 
| attendance. attendance. 
39, 000 | 1883. 124, 900 
82, 679 || 1884. 145, 660 
180, 768     116, 517 | 1886 
  
There has, thus far, been no regular or reliable census of the Argentine Republic ; 
and hence it is difficult to state the exact number of children in the country be- 
tween the ages of 6 and 14. That of 1869 put the school population at 409,876; that 
of 1884 at 497,949. Assuming these figures to be approximately correct, there are 
then in the Republic over 300,000 (or more than two-thirds) of the children who do 
not attend school. 4 
Of the 497,949 children comprehended between the ages of 6 and 14 years, 262,763 
were males and 235,186 were females, the excess of boys over girls thus reaching to 
11.7 per cent. of the entire number; 467,010 were native and 30,939 foreign born. 
Of the 145,660 pupils in attendance in 1884, 70,187 were males and 68, 473 were 
females; 104,139 attended fiscal or public schools and 41,521 private schools. 
The total number of fiscal schools was 1,817, conducted by 2,877 teachers, at an 
expense of $2,560,181. 
From these figures it will be seen that the average cost of each scholar was $24 per 
annum. The average number of scholars to each school was 95; and the averago 
number of scholars to each teacher was 46. ¢ 
It further appears from the census that the number of schools in 1884 under the 
direction of the National Government was 505; under that of the provincial goy- 
ernments was1,010; under that of municipalities, 142; under that of charitable organ- 
izations, 41; under that of religious orders, 32; under that of private teachers, 364. 
The total number of persons teaching in the primary schools of the Republic, 
whether fiscal or otherwise, was 4,078, of whom 2,925 were Argentines and 1,153 were 
of foreign birth. Of the teachers, 1,502 were males and 1,290 were females; of the 
assistant teachers, 461 were males and 825 were females; so that, of the entire staff 
of teachers, 1,963 were males and 2,115 were females.   
SALARIES OF PRIMARY TEACHERS, 
The salaries which the teachers receive depend a great deal upon the locality and 
the conditions of theschool. The following table shows the maximum prices per 
month during the year 1884: 
       “Male school: bas Per month. Directors or principals . $165. 00 
‘Teachers - 100.00 
Assistants 50.00 
Female school : 
Directors or principals . 95.00 
~ Teachers - 70.00 
Assistants 50. 00 
  In very few of the primary schools, however, are these extreme salaries paid. The 
average would scarcely exceed one-half the above figures. 
NATIONAL COLLEGES. 
The primary or elementary schools are supplemented by what are known as national 
colleges. They quite correspond to our own well-known high schools, colleges, and 
seminaries. One of these colleges is located in cach of the provinces, generally at 
_ the capital. 
The buildings for these colleges are all of them the property of the nation, and are 
sufficiently comniodious to accommodate such of the students as desire it with board 
and lodgings. 
‘Lhe number of professors varies with the importance of the college. The national 
college here in Buenos Ayres has a staff of 34 professors, while that in the province 
of San Luis has only 7 professors. In the fourteen national colleges there is a total 
of 282 professors and 106 assistants. The monthly salaries of professors range be- 
tween $50 and $170, according to the number or the importance of the branches 
tanght. The rectors receive from $100 to $250 per month. Of those teaching in the 
national colleges in 1884, 268 were Argentines and 108 were of foreign birth, nearly all 
nationalities being represented.

From the above figures it will be seen that the national colleges united are capable 
of receiving seven times the number of scholars at present in attendance. 
‘The full course of studies in these national colleges comprises a period of six years, 
and embraces the following branches, to wit: History, geography, elementary mathe- 
matics, physics, chemistry, philosophy, higher mathematics, natural history, ancient 
languages, modern languages, political economy, book-keeping, literature, drawing, 
music, gymnastic exercises, etc. eS 
Only a small proportion of the students go through with the entire course. The 
great majority after two or three years quit school for good and enter into active 
life. During the year 1884 only 52 were duly graduated, while 638 left the colleges 
before terminating their studies. 
SCHOOL OF MINING ENGINEERS. 
Some of: the national colleges have special schools attached to them. That in San 
Juan has a schoolof mining engineers, founded in 1871, under the charge of a director 
and two professors, in which inorganic chemistry, geology, mineralogy, metallurgy, 
surveying, cosmography, and other such studies are prosecuted. In 1884 it was at- 
tended by 25 special students, The national Government has 20 scholarships in the 
school at $25 per month. 
NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL SCHOOL. 
Connected with the national college at Mendoza is a national agricultural school, 
established in 1870, in which the science of crop-raising in all its details is proposed 
to be tanght; but I can obtain no statistics in regard to it. I know there are several 
professorships attached to the institution, but the Argentines are not generally what 
imay be called ‘agriculturally disposed,” and I do not think that the school enjoys a 
very extensive patronage.   
   
  NATIONAL MILITARY COLLEGE, 
A military college under the direction of the National Government was established 
in 1870 here in Buenos Ayres, in the “‘ Palermo Palace,” formerly oceupied by the Dic- 
tator Rosas. It comprehends a five years’ course of study, not only in the ordinary 
branches of education, but in ordnance, cavalry and infantry tactics, topography, 
fortifications, artillery, military hygiene, international law, ete. The staff of teachers 
comprises 22 professors. In 1884 the number of scholars was 121. Applicants for 
adwission must be at least 14 years of age and not more than 18 years. Besides the 
usual clementary branches, they must be acquainted with at least one foreign lan- 
puage. 
2 There is alsoa military school of a lower grade, which is called the school of corpo- 
rals and sergeants, established in 1881, under the charge of 14 professors and a’ 
director, the greater part being officers detailed from tbe army. Besides the ordinary 
branches, practical instruction in the threo arms of the service is given. In 1884 
there were 120 persons in attendance. 
NATIONAL NAVAL SCHOOL. 
In 1872 the national Government founded a naval school here in Buenos Ayres with 
16 professors, 5 of whom are officers detached from the navy. ‘The course of studies 
occupies 3 years. Those who are admitted are maintained by the Government. ‘he 
conditions for admission are that the applicant shal! be an Argentine, be from 14 to 
17 years of age, and pass an examination in the branches of secondary education,.

NATIONAL NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
With other valuable information which President Sarmiento acquired while in the 
United States, in reference to education, was the importance of having the public 
schools under the charge of competent teachers; and one of his’ first acts, after his 
return to the Argentino Republic, was that of organizing normal schools on the basis 
ofour own, The first one was established in 1871, There were in 1884 16 normal 
schools in different parts of the Republic, 5 of which are for the education of male 
and 11 for the education of female teachers. These schools had accommodations for 
7,268 pupils, but only 3,616 were in attendance. The totalnumber of teachers was 185. 
Since the taking of the census of 1884, several additional normal schools have been 
‘established: one for males in Santa Fé, one for females in San Luis, one for females 
in Cordoba, one for males in Mercedes, and perhaps others.! 
The course of study occupies three years, upon the completion of which and after 
a satisfactory examination the alumni are entitled to diplomas as competent teachers 
in any of the fiscal schools of the country. 
The national Government has 517 scholarships in the different normal schools, 
which are worth from $15 to $20 per month. 
At least 200 male and female teachers are fitted for their profession in these differ- 
ent schools each year, 
The teachers are of various nationalities; but a large proportion of the females are 
from the United States on contract, President Sarmiento having initiated the move- 
ment'¢o supply teachers from there from his personal knowledge of their capacity and 
marked ability. The salaries range from $300 to $150 for directors, and from $180 to 
$75-for teachers per month, 
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION. 
The educational system of the Argentine Republic is made complete by the two na- 
tional universities of Cordoba and Buenos Ayres; and they are about the only land- 
marks which are left to commemorate the former glory of the mother country.

The University of Cordoba is, excepting that of San Marcos, of Lima, the most 
ancient seat of learning in either South or North America.? Its origin dates back to 
the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Society of Jesus having established it as 
a “Collegio Maximo” in 1610. In 1618 Fernando de Sanabria, Bishop of Tucuman, 
made a donation to the institution of all his property, with an annual income of $2,000, 
under the name of the College of San Francisco Xavier. As early as 1614 full 
courses of academic studies were inaugurated ; and in 1622 the college, by both royal 
and pontifical sanction, was raised to the rank of a university, with full power to 
confer the degrees of bachelor, licenciate, master, and doctor. The first degree con-. 
ferred was that of bachelor of arts in 1623. In the year 1664 the constitution and 
by-laws of the university were revised by Father Andres de Rada, then rector of the 
institution, whereby it was provided that ‘‘ above all things the studies pursued 
should be theological,” and thus for upwards of a century and a half its destiny was 
fixed as an institution specially dedicated to the education of priests. There were, 
however, two distinct faculties, one of arts and one of theology, the first requiring 
@ coursé of 3 years and the other of 4 years, the management of the university be- 
ing under the control of a cloister of the doctors and masters having professorships, 
About the same time two other institutious were established alongside of the uni- 
versity, that of the College of Monserat, and that of the College of Loreto, but under 
the same government. 
In the month of July, 1767, by order of Charles III, the Jesuits were expelled from 
all the Spanish possessions; their property was everywhere confiscated, and the Uni- 
versity of Cordoba was, by royal decree, entrusted to the Franciscan order. In 1791, 
a faculty of law was organized in the university, and thus, after an existence of 173 
years, it ceased to be a purely theological institution. The first degree of doctor of 
Jaws was conferred in 1797, In 1800, by royal letters patent, the university received 
the name of Royal University of St.Charles and of our Lady of Monserat. In 1808 
the celebrated Dean Gregorio Funes was elected rector of the cloister, and through 
his influence and exertions the institution was entirely secularized. In 1812 all cor- 
porations of the regular clergy were excluded, and the university was organized for 
three faculties, to wit: of theology, of civil and canon law, and of philosophy, the 
first two with 4 professors and the latter with 5 professors, 
_ In the long lapse of 75 years since the Argentine Republic threw off the Spanish 
yoke and declared its independence the university, though it has encountered many 
adverse fates and been subjected to various misfortunes, has continuously kept its   
1Tobserve by President Celman's message just sent to Congress that there are now 27 normal schools in the Argentine Republic. yee 2Qur own oldest institution of learning, Harvard University, was founded in 1636.

halls open to the reception of prpils and to tho conferring of the learned degrees. 
In 1854 the uniyersity was formally taken in charge by the national Government. 
Its support has since then been the care and concern of Congress, and numerous re- 
forms have been inaugurated. In 1873 a faculty of natural sciences was organized 
under the well-known German savant, Dr. Siewart, and others, and an academy of 
exactsciences, under the celebrated Dr. Burmeister, now director of the Public Museum 
of Buenos Ayres. In 1877 a department of medicine was established, with 4 profes- 
sorships in the different branches of the science. 
UNIVERSITY OF BUENOS AYRES, 
The University of Buenos Ayres is much more recent in its origin, Some, however, 
date it back to about the be, pinning of the seventeenth century. They say it was 
first called the San Carlos College of the Society of Jesus, and was under the charge 
of priests of that order. In 1621 Bishop Pedro Carranza, out of his own private 
income, established a professorship of Latin, but after his death the college seems to 
have been without the necessary support. Following that epoch, according to the 
Chronieles of Superior Education in Buenos Ayres, compiled by the Argentine historian, 
Dr. Juan Maria Gutierrez, there is a vacuum of a century and a half, What colleges 
were established or continued during that period we do not know; but in 1773 we 
learn that the “College of San Carlos” had professorships of theology, philosophy, 
and languages, with 338 students, the population of Buenos Ayres at that date being 
24,205, and said college still being under the charge of the Society of Jesus.! In 1776 
the name of the institution was changed to that of the College of the Southern 
Union. In the same year a royal decree was issued by the Kiug of Spain for the 
foundation of a university in Buenos Ayres, which should be open for the usual 
courses of a liberal education and with power to confer degrees. But we are told, 
go little interest was manifested in the cause of education during those unfortu- 
nate times, that the viceroy was content with the college already in existence; 
and the university remained buried in oblivion.” It was not until 1819 that the 
question of establishing the university was again agitated; and “the sovereign — 
Congress, having carefully examined the proposition for the.erection of a university 
in the capital, formally authorized the establishment, with the proyiso that the 
forms and laws of the same should be first approved by Congress.” On the 9th of 
August, 1821, the captain-general of the province of Buenos Ayres, Martin Rodriguez, 
issued an edict for ‘the erection of a university of the first grade, with academic 
power and jurisdiction, under a board of doctors, which shall be composed of all 
those who may have obtained the.degree of doctor in other universities and are natives 
of the province, married or domiciled in the same.” Three days after, the univer- 
sity, absorbing the College of the Southern Union, was formally opened with great 
pomp and ceremony. Faculties of theology, jurisprudence, medicine, and the nat- 
ural sciences were duly organized and supported by the provincial government. 
Bonpland, the companion of Humboldt, ‘was one of its first professors, President 
Rividavia also secured from Europe the services of Dr. Lanz in mathematics, and 
Dr. Carta in natural sciences. During the dictatorship of Rosas the institution, 
which had so auspicious a beginning, was suffered to languish from the apathy and 
terror which possessed the community, and the statistics of the country reveal nothing 
in regard to its progress. After his expulsion from the country, however, in 1852, the 
University of Buenos Ayres again received the attention of the Government. It has 
lately been entirely reorganized, with full faculties in the departments of law and so- 
. cial sciences, of medicine, and of the natural sciences, 
RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THESE UNIVERSITIUS, 
Such are the two great seats of learning of the Argentine Republic, In the Uni- 
versity of Cordoba there are 26 professors; in that of Buenos Ayres there are 40, Of 
the professors in the University of Cordoba 13 are foreigners and 13 are native Argen- 
tines; of those in the University of Buenos Ayres, 9 are foreigners and 31 are native 
Argentines, 
The attendance in the University of Cordoba in 1884 was 167 in all departments; 
in that of Buenos Ayres it was737. 
In the University of Cordoba the annual matriculation to the lectures and courses 
of study is $4 for each department, In the University of Buenos Ayres it is $16 for 
law and social sciences, $15 for medicine, and $16 for the physical sciences, etc, 
While the University of Cordoba, owing to its locality and surroundings, has 
ceased to enjoy the prestige which it possessed in former years, it isnow under such 
influences as must ultimately give it an increased prosperity and a stronger hold on 
those who are seeking the higher educational privileges. On the other hand, the 
University of Buenos Ayres, since the interest which the Government has directly 
taken in its maintenance, has rapidly attained to a high position as an institution 
“yWhether the ‘San Carlos College” of 1621 and this ‘College of San Carlos” of 1773 are one ang 
the same institution does not seem to be clearly settled,

  for professional learning ; and to-day, I think I am correct in saying, it surpasses any 
similar establishment in South America, and in some respects may compare favora- 
bly with those of the United States. i 
PRIVATE AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS. 
I have thus given a general view of the public educational system of the Argentine 
Republic, i. ¢., of all snch schools and institutions of learning as are sustained di- 
rectly by the General Government or the respective provinces, or both conjointly. It 
includes primary and graded schools, national colleges, mining, agricultural, military, 
and naval schools, normal schools, and two universities. Besides these, however, 
there are various schools, seminaries, colleges, convents, etc., which are either pri- 
vate, i. ¢., supported by their matriculation, or religious, i. e., supported by religious 
orders or societies. These educational establishments are to be found in all the dif- 
erent provinces; and some of these, for the teaching of such branches as appertain 
to a secondary education, are of a very high rank. Cordoba, Santa Fé, Mendoza, and 
Buenos Ayres are especially noted for their Catholic colleges and convents. In the 
city of Buenos Ayres the convents of the Merced, the Visitation, and the Sacred 
Heart, and the Colleges of San José and of San Salvador, both under the control of 
the Society of Jesus, are wealthy and well-ordered seats of learning. 
ANNUAL EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES. 
    It is difficult to state very exactly the total amounts which are annually expended 
by the national and the several provincial Governments for educational purposes, 
for the reason that I have not before me the district school reports of each province; 
I have, however, compiled from the report of the Minister of Public Instruction the 
following figures, which approximately show the total annual expenditure for pri- 
mary schools. The figures are for the year 1885, and exhibit in separate columns the 
amounts provided by the nation and the provinces respectively :

The appropriations of the Argentine Government for the two Universities of Cor- 
» doba and Buenos Ayres for 1885 were $231,724; for the fourteen national colleges, 
$510,972; for the eighteen normal schools, $479,712; for the Agricultural School at 
Mendoza, $50,988 ; for the School of Mining at San Juan, $21,792, ete. 
NATIONAL OBSERVATORY AT CORDOBA. 
eas It is not out of place, in treating of the educational establishments of the Argentine 
Republic, to mention the National Observatory at Cordoba, founded under the admin- 
istration of President Sarmiento, in 1865. Dr. Benjamin A. Gould, late of Harvard’ 
University, a name well known throughout the scientific world, was appointed its 
first director, and continued until about two years ago to have the charge of the in- 
stitution. The work which it has already accomplished, and especially that of cata- 
‘loguing the stars of the southern hemisphere, has been recognized for its thorough- 
ness as a most important addition to astronomical science, and has already placed the 
observatory in the first rank. Since the resignation of Dr. Gould the observatory has 
been under the charge of Dr. John M. Thome, of Pennsylvania, promoted from the 
position of first assistant astronomer. 
A meteorological bureau was originally allied to the observatory ; and it has al- 
ready by its publications done a great work in acquainting the world with the climatic 
conditions of the widely extended Argentine Republic. During the last year this 
bureau has been separated from the observatory and organized into a distinct de- 
partment, under the direction of Prof. W. G. Davis, of Pennsylvania. Its meteorolog- 
ical stations now extend from Cape Horn to Jujuy.?   
  
1The Uranometria Argentina was published in 1280. Since then various other volumes of Catalogues 
and Results have been published. 
?In Volume V of the Meteorological Annals of the Argentine Republic, 1887, I find a letter from 
Dr. Gould, the former Director, who says: ‘‘The object for which this bureau was established is to 
study and make known the climate of the country and the laws which govern it; and I think [am 
able to say with the greatest satisfaction that in the few years of its existence the results which have

ARGENTINE NATIONAL MUSEUM. 
Another important adjunct to scientific study is the National Museum, located in’ 
Buenos Ayres. It was founded by the distinguished statesman General Revidavia, 
in 1823. It received but little support or encouragement, however, until 1854, when, 
under the protection of the Government, it was connected with the University of 
Buenos Ayres. It being necessary to place the museum under the charge of a person 
especially learned in natural history, the Government (General Mitre being Governor 
and General Sarmiento Minister of the State) selected the celebrated savant Dr. Her- 
man Burmeister, of Germany. He has continued to be the director since 1862. The 
museum is divided into three sections, to wit: The artistic, the historical, and the 
scientific. The latter is especially attractive, from the fact that the province of 
Buenos Ayres has the most abundant deposit of antediluvian animals of any place in 
the known world. Indeed, the most complete and curious skeletons of fossil animals 
which are to be seen in the museums of London, Paris, Madrid, Turin, ete., have all 
been taken from the province of Buenos Ayres. Their exportation has now been pro- 
hibited by law, it being required that all such discoveries shall be placed in the Pub- 
lic Museum of Buenos Ayres, Mr. Bravard, in his report upon the geology of the 
Pampas, counts fifty species of antediluvian animals extracted from the earth of Bue- 
nos Ayres, of which only eight were known before his investigations in this country. 
Among the animals whose fossils are now to be found in the Argentine National Mu- 
seum are the Megatherium, Mylodon, Glyptodon, Toxodon, and a veritable fossil horse, 
ete. These collections of extinct, as well as of living animals, render the museum of 
very great importance to persons who wish to dedicate themselves to the study of 
natural history ; while Dr. Burmeister’s great work on the physical characteristics of 
the Argentine Republic is a monument of patient and exacting labor.! 
SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES. 
Nor are scientific societies wanting in the Argentine Republic. Among these may 
be mentioned the Argentine Zoélogical Society, the Argentine Geographical Society, 
the Argentine Scientific Society, the Argentine Historical Society, the National Acad- 
emy of Sciences, Argentine Ethnographical Society, etc., all of which give to the 
public yearly publications in the form of Annuals and Reports. 
PUBLIC LIBRARIES. 
The importance of public libraries as powerful agents to assist in the instruction 
of the people is now coming to be fully recognized by the Argentines. Although 
it is only a few years since the Government made a movement in the matter, there 
are already upwards of 300 of these libraries distributed through the different prov- 
inces. There is now alaw which provides that the General Government shall con- 
tribute an equal sum to that which may already be subscribed to the foundation of 
new libraries or to the increase of those which are already in existence. There is a 
central commission here in Buenos Ayres whose business it is to facilitate the acquisi- 
tion of books for these libraries, to make exchanges, and to generally aid in the for- 
mation of new libraries. The most important of these public libraries is that of 
Buenos Ayres, which now contains about 50,000 volumes, as also many valuable man- 
uscripts concerning the earlier history of tho Spanish colonies. The library of the 
University of Buenos Ayres, as also that of the University of Cordoba, has a collection 
of about 15,000 volumes, and their archives also contain numerous interesting man- 
uscripts of historical value. That of Cordoba was at one time the largest in South 
America, but the fortunes of 300 years of civil wars and private thefts have left the 
collection in a deplorable plight. When I last visited it, a few years ago, it was in 
amost uncared for condition. Tho national library attached to the Department. of 
Public Instruction in this capital, although of recent origin, is the nucleus of what 
is intended to be a grand book repcsitory. It is already beginning to assume impor- 
tant proportions, and merits notice for the attention which it shows for books which 
illustrate the history and developm ent of the country. 
THE IVEWSPAPER PRESS, 
In regard to the public press—tha,s most efficient and persistent means for the po- 
litical instruction of the people, and for the education of public opinion—the Argen- 
tine Constitution has hedged it aroi md with the amplest safeguards. That instru- 
ment expressly provides that ‘the I: »deral Constitution shall not dictate laws restrict- 
ing the liberty of the press nor estab lish any Federal jurisdiction over it.” It further 
provides that ‘all the inhabitants o f the nation shall enjoy the right to publish their   
been obtained are far greater than at the b with much exactness many important cii Republic; and we have succeed imation to the truth for the entire sou 1 Description physique de la Republig 
  ginningI had reason toexpect. We havealready obtained 
a He data for a large number of points in the Argentine in drawing the isothermal lines with a very close approx- hern. half of South America.”

ceedingly severe. The rights of private persons as well as public officials are care- 
fully guarded against malicious libellers; and any abuse of the liberty of the press is 
a criminal offence, for which on proper complaint the offender is promptly arrested. 
Conviction is followed by fine and imprisonment. It may be generally said, however, 
that the political newspapers of the Argentine Republic are well conducted, and few 
of them ever venture below the line of fair and legitimate criticism. In this respect, 
I think, they compare favorably with those of other countries where free discussion 
is allowed. As with ourselves, the newspaper in the Argentine Republic is looked 
upon not asa luxury, but as an indispensable necessity, Everybody reads it. News- 
papers are now published in all the principal, towns of all the different provinces, 
generally each party having its distinctive organ; and they are following the march 
of development and civilization to the farfrontiers. Indeed, with so sparse a popula- 
tion, the wonder is how so many of them can manage to secure the requisite support. 
‘They especially abound here in Buenos Ayres. With a population of 400,000 inhabi- 
tants, there are published in this capital 34 daily papers, 18 weekly papers, and 19 
monthly papers or periodicals. While many of these publications exhibit but little 
of what we would call ‘(newspaper enterprise,” some of them are as ably edited as 
any in the world. The Nacion, for instance, is edited by ex-President Mitre; the 
Censor, by ex-President Sarmiento; and the Prensa, by Dr. Davila. Other nation- 
alities have also their newspapers, there being in Buenos Ayres three printed in the 
English language, 4 in the German, 3 in the French, and 4 in the Italian. Among 
the monthly periodicals are those devoted to agriculture and rural interests, to com- 
merce and finance, to home industries, to schools and education, to the medical sci- 
ences, to law, and to general literature, many of them exhibiting a high degree of 
ability and merit. 
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. 
It is hardly necessary to add, that in the Argentine Republic there is the utmost 
freedom of religion and of conscience. The Constitution of the country provides (Art. 
II) that “the Federal Government shall maintain the Apostolic Roman Catholi¢ 
Faith.” For this maintenance and support of the state church there is an annual 
appropriation by Congress of about $200,000. The church establishment consists of 
one archbishop, whose see is in Buenos Ayres, and four diocesan bishops, who reside, 
respectively, at Paranda, Cordoba, San Juan, and Salta, together with other lesser 
dignitaries. The head of the Argentine church is elective; thatis to say, the Senate 
selects a list of three persons, from which the President chooses one te propose to the 
Pope. ‘The inferior dignitaries are also selected and invested by the Government. 
Aside from the established church, however, the Federal Constitution (Art. XIV) 
provides that “all the inhabitants of the nation shall enjoy the right to profess freely 
their religion ;” and (Art. XX) “ within the limits of the nation foreigners shall en- 
joy all the civil rights of citizens, and freely profess their religion.” In pursuance of 
these provisions, there are in the different parts of the Republic numerous churches 
of other creeds. In the city of Buenos Ayres there is an English Episcopal church, a 
Scotch Presbyterian church, a German Lutheran church, two American Methodist 
churches (one of which is a missionary church), and a Jewish. synagogue, all with 
duly installed clergymen, whose functions in marriages, baptisms, deaths, etc., are 
fully respected and recognized by Argentine law. Most of these churches have re- 
ligious or Sunday schools attached to them, and some of them have received assist- 
ance from the Government. 
CONCLUSION. 
Tt will thus be seen that the Argentine Republic not only fully recognizes the great 
importance of the education and culture of the people by making it a distinet branch 
of the national administration, but that it is well on the way towards an efficient and 
liberally supported system of public instruction, which embraces primary and second- 
ary schools, national colleges, normal schools, scientific schools, and the highest 
branches of university and professional training. In what it has thus far accomplished 
it has achieved a peaceful victory, far more glorious than any it may have won by 
the strength of its arms since its independence. 
Statistics or ELEMENTARY Epucatioy ix Forrign Countrirs. 
[Table 112,] 
Table 112 presents the princjpal statistics relating to elementary education in for- 
. eign countries whose reports have been received at this Office. As few countries ro- 
ort their school population, the total populations have been given in Column 2, Paré 
, of the table, as a basis for comparing school enrolment. 
   
-P-A-G-E-999
ELEMENTARY EDUCATION IN FOREIGN counTRIns. 999 
Where tho latest census antedatvs by sevoral years the year of the school report, 
estimates of the total population for a nearer date have been employed when attain- 
able. The fact is indicated by a foot-note. Such estimates have been taken from the 
educational reports, or from the Statesman’s Year Book for 1887. 
The school ages reported from 36 countries range from 6 to 16 years. From an in- 
spection of Column 3, Part II, it will be seen that 7 countries report a longer period 
than 9 years, while eight report a shorter period than 8 years. The average period is 
8.2 years. The statistics of school population and enrolment in Hungary include the 
youth 6 to 15 years of age, which are accordingly given as the limits of the school 
age. In fact, attendance upon elementary schools in Hungary is obligatory from 6 
to 12 years of age, inclusive, and upon the “review ” or “continuation” schools from 
12 to 15 years. The latter may be day, evening, orSabbath schools. In them the 
branches pursued in the ordinary elementary schools are reviewed, and somewhat ex- 
tended. ‘The school age in Bavaria includes also 3 years in the review schools. 
In England and Scotland it is customary to include only six-sevenths of the popu- 
lation in estimating the number of children for whom provision should be made in 
state-aided elementary schools. As the omission of one-seventh of the population in 
these estimates is misleading when the statistics are tabulated with those of other 
countries, the numbers showing the entire child population as given in the official 
reports from those countries are used in this table. : 
It will be observed also that the school population of England and Wales is given 
for the years 5 to 14, and also 3 to 14; the former is the obligatory school period. 
Children are, however, admitted at 3 years of age, and the enrolment includes pupils 
ag young as that, together with a small number above 14 years of age. 
In the case of Finland the enrolment includes pupils in infant schools. 
The ratios of school enrolment to total population, and to school population when 
reported, are shown in Table 113. 
In England and Wales the school population used in the computation is that of 3 to 
14 years of age. 
Care has been taken to confine the tablo to.the statisties of elementary schools, 4. ¢., 
schools below the high school grade, which is substantially the same for all countries. 
Ina very few instances the distinction is not clearly preserved in the original reports, 
and the totals of enrolment and teachers possibly include high schools. Itis certain, 
however, that in these cases, which are few, the totals are not greatly affected thereby. 
A glance at the columns setting forth the number of schools and the school enrol- 
ment will show that the word ‘‘school,” or its foreign equivalent, has various appli- 
cations. It sometimes signifies the scholars in charge of one teacher, and sometimes 
a collection of such bodies forming a séries of grades in one building. 
In the case of Wiirtemburg, the number of teachers’ positions is given in Column 
12, the number of teachers employed not being reported. Pupil teachers are a feature 
of the school systems of England and Wales, Scotland, New South Wales, and Japan. 
They are included in the totals of teachers for the three former countries, the num- 
bers being 27,804, 3,782, and 931, respectivély. The teaching force reported for Ire- 
land includes 665 work mistresses and temporary assistants. 
The expenditures reported include as a rule teachers’ salaries, and cost of super- 
vision and administration. For France the amount given is the sum expended by the 
State only. : 
For Saxony the amount includes expenditure for 1,892 Fortbildungsschulen and two 
schools for deaf-mutes ; for England and Wales and Scotland the cost of night schools 
is included; and for Ireland and Jamaica the amount is the reported income of the 
schools, which is presumably equivalent to the expenditure. 
In the following countries represented in the table, the elementar, 
schools: France, Italy, Switzerland, Algeria, British Columbia, Manitoba, New 
Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Costa Rica, Guatemala, 
Argentine Republic, Chili, Ecuador, Victoria, Queensland, and New Zealand. In 
these the cost of elementary education is defrayed by state and local funds, 
In Venezuela also the law provides for free schools, but this provision does not ap- 
pear to have been carried into effect. In the remaining countries a portion of the 
cost is met by tuition fees. 
       
schools are free 
       
FRANCE, 
In addition to the elementary schools of Francv included in Table 112, the following 
statistics of superior primary schools are presented: Number of schools, 251; number 
of teachers, 2,133; number of pupils, 21,939, 
School libraries for the use of pupils are reported to the number of 33,800, contain- 
ing 4,159,208 volumes; also 2,626 pedagogical libraries with 803,419 volumes for the use of teachers,

PAPERS ON EDUCATIONAL SUBJEOTS. 
CAN SCHOOL PROGRAMMES BE SHORTENED AND ENRICHED? 
A PAPER READ BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT OF SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE NATIONAL 
EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION, AT WASHINGTON, FEBRUARY 16, 1888. 
By Cuaries WitLiam Ettot, LL. D. 
President of Harvard University. 
In the process of improving the secondary schools, colleges, and professional 
schools of the United States—a process which has been carried on with remarkable 
energy since the Civil War—certain new difliculties have been created for the higher 
education in general, and particularly for colleges. These difficulties have to do with 
the age at which young men can get prepared for college, and therefore with the ages 
at which boys pass the successive stages of their earlier education. The average age 
of admission to Harvard College has been rising for sixty years past, and has now 
reached the extravagant limit of eighteen years and ten months. Harvard College 
is not at all peculiar in this respect; indeed many of the country colleges find their 
young men older still at entrance. The average college graduate is undoubtedly 
nearly twenty-three years old at graduation, and when he has obtained his A. B. he 
must nowadays allow at least three years for his professional education, 
In respect to the length of time required for a satisfactory professional training, 
there has been a great change since the War. Twenty years ago the period of resi- 
dence at Harvard University for the degree of bachelor of laws was eighteen months; 
nowit is three years. Many of the States of the American Union have passed laws 
which practically make three years the normal period of study before admission to 
the bar. Ambitious medical students are giving four years to their medical training. 
Twenty years ago the leading colleges were satisfied to take men just graduated in 
arts as tutors in Latin, Greek, and mathematics. Now they expect a candidate for 
tutorship or instructorship to have devoted two or three years to study after taking 
his bachelor’s degree. School boards and trustees have become correspondingly ex- 
acting. In short, professional education in the United States is becoming constantly 
more thorough and elaborate, and is therefore demanding of aspirants to the profes- 
sions more and more time. The average college graduate who fits himself well for 
any one of the learned professions, including teaching, can hardly begin to support 
himself before he is twenty-seven years old. 
This condition of things is so unreasonable ina new country like the United States— 
being hardly matched in the oldest and most densely settled countries of Europe— 
that some remedy is urgently demanded; and the first partial remedy that suggests 
itself is to reduce the average age of admission to college to eighteen. This reduc- 
tion would save about a year. In effecting this saving of time it is greatly to be 
wished that no reduction should be made in the attainments which the average can- 
didate for admission now brings to the American colleges; for it is probable that 
the saving thus effected will not be sufficient in itself, and that the public interests 
will require in addition some shortening of the ordinary college course of four years. 
College men, therefore, are anxiously looking to see if the American school courses 
_ can be both shortened and enriched ; shortened so that our boys may come to college 
at eighteen instead of nineteen, and enriched in order that they may bring to college 
at eighteen more than they now bring at nineteen, so that the standard of the A. B. 
may not be lowered. 
The anxiety with which men charged with the conduct of college education look at 
this question is increased by the relative decline of American colleges and universi- 
ties as a whole. This relative decline, which was pointed out nearly twenty years 
ago by President Barnard, of Columbia College, is very visible of late years. The 
population of the United States is supposed by the best authorities to increase about 
one-third in every period of ten years. In the ten-year period from 1875 to 1884, in- 
clusive, the universities and colleges included in the tables published by the Com- 
inissioner of Education show an increase in their number of students of only eleven 
per cent., instead of thirty-three and one-third per cent. If we select from the same 
1005
-P-A-G-E-1006
    1006 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
tables the ten-year period fror 1876 to 1885, the increase is sixteen per cent.; but 
the explanation of this higher percentage of increase is that the total number of 
students in the year 1876 was abnormally low, being 2,400 beneath the number of 
1875. If we add to the institutions enumerated as universities and colleges all the 
schools of science, and all the higher institutions for the education of women, we 
still find that this enlarged list of institutions has not gained students at the same 
rate at which the population has increased, although the schools of science have 
made very large gains in the decade referred to. Thus the increase in the number 
of students in universities and colleges, schools of science, and women’s colleges, 
all taken together, was only twenty-three per cent. in the ten years from 1875 to 1884, 
inclusive. Obviously there are serious hindrances affecting all the institutions which 
receive young men and women at the age of eighteen or nineteen, to keep them under 
liberal training for three or four years. One of these hindrances undoubtedly is that the 
colleges as #*whole held too long to a mediwyal curriculum; but a greater hindrance, 
in all probability, is the burden imposed upon parents when their elaborately edu- 
cated sons can not support themselves in their professions until they are twenty-seven 
or twenty-eight years old. Hence the importance of the inquiry: Can school pro- 
grammes be shortened and enriched? . 
In studying this problem it is natural to turn first to the schools sometimes called 
preparatory—that is, to the best high schools and academies; but if we examine the 
courses of study in these schools, we find that the four years during which they 
keep their pupils are generally crowded with work. Thus the Phillips Academy, at 
Exeter, N. H., one of the best academies in the United States, has a four years’ 
course which is so full that hardly any suggestion can be made for compacting or 
abbreviating it. But what are the requirements for admission to Exeter? - ‘Some 
knowledge of common school arithmetic, writing, spelling, and of the elements of 
English grammar.” These requirements might reasonably be made of a boy leaving 
the primary school at eight years of age; yet the average age of admission to Exeter 
is sixteen and one-half. Now, Exeter is an academy which does not content itself 
with such low terms of admission unless under compulsion. It would require more 
if it could get more from the average candidate; but it draws its pupils from a wide 
area, and its experience is against making greater demands. The Exeter course is 
_ itself encumbered with some studies suitable fora boy of ten. Thus it devotes much 
time to arithmetic, and teaches the very elements of English and English literature. 
A secondary school which is obliged to take its pupils in the average condition of 
the boys who enter Exeter can hardly do more for them in the four years between. 
sixteen and twenty than is now accomplished at that academy. What is true of 
Exeter is true of the whole body of upper schools, They have to make good defi- 
ciencies of the lower schools, It is necessary, therefore, to examine the American 
school programmes from the beginning, to start with the primary school and go on 
through the grammar school and the high school, searching for the places where time 
and labor can be saved. ' 
The subject seems to be one chiefly interesting to colleges, but really it has a much 
broader scope. In the first place, whatever improves the school programmes for 
those children whose education is to be prolonged, perhaps, until they are twenty- 
five years old, will improve the programmes also for the less fortunate children whose 
education is to be briefer. The public schools will never send to higher institutions 
any very large proportion of the children who are trained in them; but their pro- 
grammes may best be made substantial and systematic by fitting them to the needs 
of their most intelligent and fortunate pupils. Moreover, we may reasonably strive 
to make every grade of the public school programme, primary, grammar, and high— 
and, indeed, every year in any programme—a thing good in itself, as well as a good 
introduction to the course of study which lies beyond it. he better the programme 
is in itself, the better it will be as a preparation for further study. To the primary 
and grammar schools this principle applies in all its fullness, In the high school and 
academy the principle needs qualification for the foreign languages only, and for 
that portion of the programme options should be allowed. The question, Can Ameri- 
can schoo! programmes be at once condensed and enriched? has, then, a wide scope, 
‘and touches the interests of the whole population. \ 
As evidence conducing to the formation of a just opinion upon the practicability 
of shortening and enriching our school programmes, an actual comparison of two 
public school programmes—one French and one American—covering the ages of eight 
to seventeen, inclusive, is printed on pages 1010-14, One programme is the pro- 
gramme of the French secondary schools, which is followed all over France in the 
institutions called lyeées; the other is the programme made by uniting the first three 
years of the Boston grammar schools with the complete programme of the Boston 
Latin School, It is assumed that the Boston schools are a fair type for the country. 
Indeeil, the Boston Latin School is supposed to be the best, as it is the oldest, Ameri- 
ean classical school which is supported by local taxation, In the tables referred to 
the programmes are placed side by side, so that the courses for the same years of age 
can be conveniently compared. It is in each case the classical course which is tabu-
-P-A-G-E-1007
  SCHOOL PROGRAMMES. 1007 
Jated; but a similar comparison could be instituted between the corresponding pro- 
‘grammes in which Latin and Greek are replaced by other subjects. In the French 
schools Latin and Greek can be in large part replaced by mathematical and scientifie 
studies, and in Boston the English High School offers a programme like that of the 
Latin school, but with similar substitution of mathematical and scientific studies 
for all the Greek and some or all of the Latin. The present purpose can be fully 
accomplished by limiting the comparison to tho classical programmes. Tho French 
programme was chosen rather than the programme of a German gymnasium, because 
it is a lower term of comparison, the German programme being more comprehensive, 
elaborate, and difficult. The French programme is a recent reduction of a programme 
in force from 1880 to 1885, the reduction amounting to about twenty per cent,, and the 
number of recitations per week in the two programmes (French and American) ig 
nearly thesame. It is the best of foreign programmes as a term of comparison, be- 
cause Franco is socially a democratic country, politically a republic, and industrially 
a country whose chief reliance, in the strenuous competition to which its population 
is exposed within and without, is the intelligence and skill of its producing classes, ‘ 
In all these respects France and the United States closely resemble each other. More- 
over, the French boy has no possible advantage over the American boy in strength of 
constitution, intelligence, or endurance; on the contrary, he is not so large a boy ag 
the American on an average, and he is not so well fed. 
A very brief examination of these two programmes side by side reveals several im- 
portant facts. The French programme is decidedly the more substantial; that is to 
say, it calls for greater exertion on the part of the pupil than the American, intro- 
duces the children earlier to serious subjects, and is generally more interesting and 
more stimulating to the intelligence. Vor example, at eight years of age the French 
boy begins to study a foreign language, either English or German; the American 
boy begins to study a modern language five: years later, at thirteen, when the best 
period tor learning a foreign tongue is already passed. The French boy of eight be- 
gins the study of history in a yery interesting and stimulating way through the study ' 
of biography; the American boy gets no history until he is thirteen, when he begins 
Greek history, The French boy of eight gives just one-third the time to arithmetic 
that the American boy gives, and in the whole course does not give to that subject 
more than one-third the time the American boy gives; yet, for practical purposes, the 
French are quite as skilful with numbers as the Americans. The French boy gets at 
natural history earlier than the American boy, and in better subjects, Again, the 
French programme represents an actual fact, the large majority of French boys pass- 
ing popularly through it at the ages indicated in the programme; whereas the pro- 
gramme of the Boston Latin School, prepared for the years from eleyen to sixteen, in- 
elusive, actually covers the years from thirteen to eighteen, inclusive. In comparing 
the attainments of the Boston boy with those of the French boy we must, therefore, 
add two full years to the ages set down in the American programme. The inferiority 
of the Boston programme, then, becomes very conspicuous. There is no single sub- 
ject touched in the American programme in which the French boy does not accom- 
plish more than the American, This appears very clearly on comparing the amounts 
of Latin and Greek set down in the two programmes, but equally plainly in geome- 
try and physics. Moreover, the French course extends a year beyond the American 
course, and in the class called philosophy gives a comprehensive suryey of philosophy 
and ethics, a thing never attempted in the United States with boys of seventeen, yet 
found practicable and in the highest degree useful in the French Republic. The pre- 
ponderance of the French language, the mother tongue, in the French programme is 
most noticeable. Until Latin and Greek are introduced French occupies half of the 
whole course. When the study of Latin and Greek is at its height French still claims 
a substantial portion of the programme; and in the final year, the year ealled phi- 
losophy, French resumes almost exclusive possession of the programme. Great im- 
provements have been made during the last ten years in the study of English and 
English literature in the best American schools; but the mother tongue does not yet 
hold anything like the place in American schools that French holds in the French 
schools. In the French lycées geometry comes before algebra, and with the help of 
drawing is treated thoroughly before algebra is seriously attacked, plane geometry 
peing finished by the time the boy is fourteen years of age. At the Boston Latin 
School, on the other hand, plane geometry is not completed until the boy is seven- 
teen according to the programme, and nineteen in reality. This brief discussion of 
the two programmes may reasonably convince any one that the French boy makes a 
much greater total attainment by the time he is eighteen than the American boy has 
a chance to make at the best American schools by the time he is nineteen. Thorough 
study of them will only strengthen this conviction. 
The comparison thus instituted gives no warrant for impatient, revolutionary act- 
ion. The transformation it suggests is not to be wrought in a year, but should be 
the aim of patient labor during many years, Everybody knows that foreign institu- 
tions of education can not be imported; that a nation’s educational institutions are 
strongly influenced by its political, ethical, and industrial conditions, and that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-1008
    1008 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
improvement of schools and colleges must ‘aecessarily be slow. It may, however, be 
justly inferred from this comparison of programmes that the condition of second- 
ary schools in the United States is at present one of inferiority; that the countr 
ought not to be satisfied with that condition, and indeed should strenuously exer! 
itself to improve it, there being opportunity in American programmes for both con- 
densation and enrichment. If it be said that the American boy turns out pretty well 
after all, and that the American community, as a whole, is as intelligent as the French 
or the German community, the ready answer is that free institutions are in them- 
selves a considerable education for the population, but that the advantage which the 
nation has over Europe in possessing free institutions ought not to reconcile it to a 
poseon of inferiority as regards schools ; it ought to aim to have the best schools, too. 
f it be practicable to make American primary and secondary schools better, the 
work of improvement should be set on foot. 
The fair inference from the above tables being that it is practicable, it will not be 
unprofitable to consider some of the means of improving the American public school, 
from the primary grade through the high school. 
1. In the first place, better programmes need better teachers. The great difference 
between the French and German secondary schools and the American is in the quality 
of the teachers. ‘Two modes of improving the general body of teachers in the public 
schools demand special attention. In the first place, school committees, superin- 
tendents, teachers themselves, and all friends of public education should constantly 
strive to procure a better tenure of office for American teachers. The American 
- schools will never equal the schools of Germany and France until well-proved teachers 
can secure a tenure during good behavior and efficiency, like teachers in those coun- 
tries. Consideration, dignity, and quietness of mind go with a permanent tenure, 
and the public school service will never compete successfully with the service of 
private educational corporations in this country until the public employ is as good as 
_ the private employ in this regard. Secondly, the average skill of the teachers in the 
ublic schools may be increased by raising the present low proportion of male teachers 
in the schools. Herein lies one of the great causes of the inferiority of the American 
teaching to the French and German teaching. The proportion of women teachers in 
American schools is vastly greater than it is in Europe. The larger the proportion 
of women in any system of public schools, the larger will be the percentage of new 
appointments every year and the larger the amount of work done by temporary sub- 
stitutes. New appointments and substitutes generally mean inexperienced teachers, 
or, at the best, teachers suddenly put to work in unaccustomed places. This superior- 
ity of men as teachers has, of course, nothing whatever to do with the relative intel- 
ligence or faithfulness of men and women, It is a well-known fact that many women 
enter the public schools as teachers without any intention of long following the busi- 
ness, and also that women are absent from duty from two to three times as much as 
men. Young men who take up teaching as a temporary expedient are also unsatis- 
factory material. The schools need the life-work of highly trained and experienced 
teachers. After these two most important means of raising the average quality of 
public school teachers come lesser means which ought not to be neglected; thus, 
superintendents and committees can do something to improve teachers by invariably 
advocating the expenditure of money for teaching, rather than for mechanical appli- 
ances or buildings. Cheap teachers and expensive apparatus and buildings are pre- 
cisely the reverse of wise practice, particularly if the fine buildings are not fire-proof 
after all. Again, the teaching of the public schools can, of course, be improved by 
the establishment of teachers’ examinations, which secure a better preparation in 
the average teacher, and by methods of supervision which make known the relative 
merits of teachers who are on probation. Good progress has been made in this direc- 
tion during the past ten years. 
2. The second direction of untiring effort should be to the improvement of pro- 
grammes ; for the programmes are all important to the steady development of the 
whole system of schools from top to bottom. A good programme will of course not 
execute itself; it must be vivified by the good teacher; but an injudicious programme 
is an almost insuperable obstacle to the improvement of a city’s schools, As a rule, 
the American programmes do not seem to be substantial enough, from the first year 
in the primary school onward. There is not enough meat in the diet. They do not 
bring the child forward fast enough to maintain his interest and induce him to put 
forth his strength. Frequent complaint is made of over pressure in the public 
schools, but Fredrich Paulsen is probably right in saying that it is not work which 
causes overfatigue so much as lack of interest and lack of conscious progress. The 
sense that, work as he may, he is not accomplishing anything will wear upon the 
stoutest adult, much more upon a child. One problem in arithmetic which he can 
not solve will try a child more than ten he can solve. One hour of work in which 
he can take no intelligent interest will wear him out more than two hours of work 
in which he can not help being interested. Now, the trouble with much of the work 
in the public schools is that it is profoundly and inevitably uninteresting to the 
childish mind, ‘To enrich the school programme, therefore, and to make serious sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-1009

jects follow each other in it more rapidly than now, is not necessarily to increase the 
strain upon the child; it is, however, to necessarily increase the skill demanded of 
the teacher, and hence the improvement of teachers must go hand in hand with the 
improvement of programmes, ‘The best way to diminish strain is to increase inter- 
est, attractiveness, and the sense of achievement and growth. American teaching 
in school and college has been chiefly driving and judging; it ought to be leading 
and inspiring. Here are these beautiful fields—i will show you the way through 
them. Here are these rewarding exercises—I willshow you how to practice them. 
Here are these heights—I willlead you up them. 
3. Much time can be saved in primary and secondary schools by diminishing the num- 
ber of reviews and by never aiming at that kind of accuracy of attainment which 
reviews, followed by examinations, are intended to enforce. Why should an accu- 
racy of knowledge and of statement be habitually demanded of children which 
adults seldom possess? How many well-educated adults can add long columns of 
figures correctly or find the least common multiple or the greatest common divisor 
of six or eight numbers? Nothing but practice can keep one skilful in these exer- 
cises, and we may reasonably be grateful that few people are compelled to keep in 
the necessary practice. Few adult minds retain accurately considerable masses of 
isolated facts, and it is commonly observed that minds which are good at that are 
seldom the best minds. Why do we try to make children do what we do not try to 
do ourselves? Instead of mastering one subject before going to another, it is almost 
invariably wise to go on to a superior subject before the inferior has been mastered— 
mastery being a very rare thing. On the mastery theory, how much new reading or 
thinking should we adults do? Instead of feviewing arithmetic, study algebra; for 
algebra will illustrate arithmetic and supply many examples of arithmetical pro- 
cesses. Instead of re-reading a familiar story read a new one; it will be vastly more 
interesting, and the common words will all recur—the common words being by far 
the most valuable ones. Instead of reviewing the physical geography of North Am- 
erica, study South America. There, too, the pupil will find mountain-chains, water- 
sheds, high plateaux, broad plains, great streams, and isothermal lines. The really 
profitable time to review a subject is not when we have just finished it, but when we 
have used it in studying other subjects and have seen its relations to other subjects 
and what it is good for. For example, the French programme puts a review of arith- 
metic, algebra, and geometry into the last year. With all his mathematical powers 
strengthened by the study of algebra and geometry, and with all the practice of 
arithmetic which his study of mensuration and algebra has involved, the boy returns 
at seventeen to arithmetic and finds it infinitely easier than he did at fourteen. 
Further, the French boy has escaped those most exasperating of arithmetical puzzles 
which a little easy algebra enables one to solve with facility. Many an educated 
New Englander remembers to this day the exasperation he felt when he discovered 
that problems in Colburn’s Arithmetic, over which he had struggled for hours, could 
be solved in as many minutes after he had. got half way through Sherwin’s Algebra. 
Is it not an abominable waste of the time and strength of children to put them to 
doing in a difficult way, never used in real life, something they will be able to do in 
an easy way ayeat or twolater? To introduce any artificial hardness into the course 
of training that any human being has to follow is an unpardonable educational sin. 
‘There is hardness enough in this world without manufacturing any, particularly for 
children. On careful search through all the years of the public school programmes 
now in use, many places will be found where time can be saved and strain lessened 
by abandoning the effort to obtain an exaggerated and wholly unnatural accuracy 
of work. It is one of the worst defects of examinations that they set an artificial 
value upon accuracy of attainment. Good examination results do not always prove 
that the training of the children examined has been of the best kind. 
4, In almost all the numerous collections of school statistics which are now pub- 
lished in this country, it appears that the various grades contain children much too 
old for them, who have apparently been held back. This phenomenon seems to be 
due partly to the ambition of teachers and partly to the caution of parents. To illus- 
trate with a specific case: In the Boston primary schools, which are’ intended 
for children of five to seven years of age, inclusive, 44 per cent. of all the chil- 
dren for three years past were over seven; and in the grammar schools of the same 
city, which are intended for children of from eight to thirteen years inclusive, 
from 20 to 24 per cent. were over thirteen. It has already been mentioned that 
the average age of admission to the Latin school is not eleven years, as indicated 
in the programme, but thirteen years. It is really thirteen years and three months. 
For three years past, from one-third to one-half of the graduating classes of the 
Boston grammar schools have been more than six yearsin the schools, the programme 
calling for but six years. In the Boston primary and grammar schools the tendency 
is in the wrong direction; that is, in 1887 there was a larger proportion of pupils over 
age than in 1877. The ambition of teachers tends to keep children too long in the 
several grades, because they desire to havo their pupils appear well at the periodical 
examinations, and also because they like to keep in their classes the bright children as

aidsto the dull ones. The caution of parents tends to produce the same difficulty be- 
cause they fear overpressure; not comprehending that with children, as with adults, 
it is not work so much as worry that injures, or finding that the existing system adds 
worry to work. The exaggerated notion that it is necessary to master one thing be- 
fore a child goes to another is also responsible for the retardation of children on their 
way through the regular course. The result of this retardation is that the boy comes 
too late to the high school, or to the Latin school, and so fails to complete that higher 
course if he is going into business, or comes too late to college if his education is to 
be more prolonged. The great body of children ought to pass regularly from one 
grade to another, without delay, at the ages set down on the programme; and any 
method of examination which interferes with this regular progress does more harm 
than good. Of late years many experiments have been made on semiannual promo- 
tions, and other means of hurrying forward the brighter children. The aim of these 
experiments is laudable; but the statistics suggest a doubt whether semiannual pro- 
motions really promote, and whether they do not disturb to an inexpedient degree 
the orderly progress of the school work. In general the work of any school must be 
laid out by years, and on this account irregular promotions will hardly provide a 
remedy against the common evil of retardation. 
5, If we look back a generation, or two generations, in the history of American 
schools, we shall find that the time spent in school by children during a year hag been 
decidedly reduced, although great improvements have been made during the same 
period in the ventilation of the school buildings; and various bodily exercises, such 
as singing, gymnastics, and military drill have been introduced. This reduction of 
school hours has gone quite far enough, and some steps need to be taken in the other 
direction. The ideal school should be so conducted that the child’s physique is not 
impaired by attending it, or his enjoyment of his daily life lessened. Then longer 
school hours would not be unsafe or unwelcome. It should be the teachers that need 
rest and vacation, and not the children. In cities vacation schools seem to be a de- 
sirable addition to our present organization. A long vacation may be a very good 
thing for children who have at home some intellectual resources, or who can go to 
the country or to the sea in vacation, and there learn some things not found in books; 
but for children of ignorant or heedless parents, who have nothing of intellectual 
life to offer them at home, a lony vacation is likely to be a serious injury, particu- 
larly in cities and large towns. Vacation schools tend to bring forward, or keep up, the 
least favored children, thus accelerating the general rate of progress during the year. 
The chief objects of this paper were, first, to point out a serious difficulty which is 
embarrassing the whole course of American education; and, secondly, to indicate 
briefly a few of the directions in which labor may be wisely spent in improving our 
school system, to the general end that the pupils may receive a better training in a 
shorter time. The professional experience and zeal of superintendents and teachers 
will know how to devise and execute appropriate measures of relief and improvement.

  THE HIGH SCHOOL QUESTION. 1015 
THE HIGH SCHOOL QUESTION. 
ADDRESS AT THE DEDICATION OF THE INDIANAPOLIS HIGH SCHOOL BUILDING, 1885. 
By Joun W. Houcomse. 
Superintendent of Public Instruction of Indiana. 
The high school argument has been made, the fight has been fought in this State 
and the high school is accepted as an essential part of our common school system. 
Yet, as we have been advised that we ought often to re-examine the grounds of our 
beliefs, however well settled, such an occasion as this ought not to pass without some 
inquiry into the principles upon which our public education in its different parts and 
institutions is based. The question is a large one, and but a small part of it can be 
gone over in the time allowed this sree 
The familiar proposition that the state has a right to educate because intelligence 
is essential to good citizenship—from which it follows that it has a right to educate 
only so far as may be necessary to make good citizens—certainly needs re-examination. 
That the justification of the state’s expenditures for education is the necessity of 
securing intelligence among the people, 80 that they will in turn preserve and main- 
tain the state, is an inversion of ideas and an argument at variance with the genius 
of our institutions. 
For what is the state? The French King, inheritor and perfector of an autocratic 
despotism, said: “The state, that is I!” ‘The Spartans conceived the state as the 
corporate unity of all, absorbing into itself all powers, all rights, before which the 
individual stood stripped of every essential attribute of personal liberty. The French 
King might have said consistently: “If I ye my people a certain kind of training 
it will be to the advantage of the state, and that is my advantage. I will give it to 
them. May I not do that Iwill with mineown’?”’ The Spartan Government in effect 
said this. It assumed control of every citizen in his childhood and relaxed not its 
hold till old age, training his heart in devotion to Sparta, his intellect in cunning for 
her service, his body in the hardships, discipline, and tactics of war, for her aggran- 
dizement and defence, regulating his domestic relations, practically destroying his 
private life—and all for the state, nothing for the man. 
But with us, what is the state? Is it the governor—to-day one man, to-morrow 
another? Or is it the entire body of men who administer the public business—State, 
county, city, town, and township officers, including school trustees and superintend- 
ents? But perhaps it were safer not to attempt a precise definition of our notion of 
the state. It is at any rate very different from the Spartan’s, still more different 
from the French king’s. It is the res publica, the commonwealth, the interests that 
are public and common to all the people. What these interests are, after the few 
general classes always entrusted to the governing agency, may give rise to differences 
of opinion. Various socialistic and communistic theories are based upon the belief 
that the control of government should be extended over a greater or less number of 
interests beyond those usually committed to it. But, in this country at least, the 
maintenance of schools is undertaken by society in its corporate capacity, either as 
the State, the town, or the district; the property of all contributes to the common 
education. In this we are communists; but we are a practical people, and do not 
take fright at names. A communistic practice that proves to be of general advantage 
we adopt. But, if the distinction be appreciable, the people establish and support 
schools not in their political capacity, but in their corporate social capacity. 
The support of education at the public expense is justified on the grounds of utility, 
economy, and the general good, without special reference to eivic duties. From the 
general diffusion of ry age results, of course, a higher citizenship, better gov- 
ernment, a more perfect state ; but to say that the state educates the people to make 
them good citizens is to substitute effect for cause. 
May we not say instead, ‘‘The people, wishing to give their children and to secure 
to the community the benefits of education, find that they can do this cheapest and 
best and with greatest advantage to society by means of free common schools?” 
There is tho all-sufficient justification of the system. No need to elaborate strained 
theories as to the right and power of the sovereign State. It is a purely economic 
and social question, not TAM to understand. 
It will not be doubted that the average taxpayer secures the education of his 
children in the public schools cheaper than he could in private schools. The amount 
he pays in school taxes is less than he would otherwise pay in tuition for equal ad- 
vantages. Thisis true of the large majority, the people of small and moderate means. 
The systeth is justified to them on the score of economy. 
The case is somewhat different with the wealthy. The greater their wealth, the 
larger their tax. A few contribute far beyond the mere cost of educating their own 
children. Some also have no children, and yet must contribute in proportion to their 
property. Do these receive any return commensurate with their outlay? They do,
-P-A-G-E-1016

beyond a doubt. Thoy are benefited in their property. What would be the shrinkage in values in this city if the public schools were forever swept away? ‘The panic of 73 would not comparo with it. If property holders reflect well on this point they will never complain of the school taxes. 
But many contribute nothing—the poor who pay no taxes. To them the free 
schools are a precious boon, affording te their children the means of escape from poy- erty and crime. : 
Ignorance and poverty are inseparable. Careful calculations based on the statistics 
of several States show that a common school education adds 50 per cent. to the pro- 
ductive power of the laborer, an academic education 100 per cent., a collegiate edu- 
cation from 200 to 300 percent. Also, that of the illiterate about 1 in 10 is a pauper, 
while of the educated the paupers are but 1 in 300. Whence it may be inferred that 
ignorance is the very probable road to poverty, while education is the almost certain 
way to competence. 
The statistics of crime are not less instructive. An examination of the returns of 
twenty States shows that one-sixth of the crime is committed by persons wholly illit- 
erate, one-third by persons wholly and substantially so, and that in proportion to 
numbers there are ten times as many criminals among the illiterate as among the 
educated. 
Property holders can, therefore, well afford to maintain schools in which the non- 
taxpayers enjoy equal privileges; for ifthe outlay for this purpose were cut down to 
any great extent, it is not rash to say that for every dollar so saved two would be 
paid for the support of paupers and the punishment of criminals. Thus the free 
school is again justified to the taxpayer on the score of economy alone. 
But there are other considerations. Cyrus the Younger said that the greatest orna- 
ment to a prince was to be surrounded by prosperous and happy friends. So we may 
say that the greatest ornament to a citizen is to live in the midst of prosperous and 
intelligent fellow-citizens, The greatest addition to his dignity, his personal and 
social privileges, his opportunity for.an elevated enjoyment of life, is secured by res- 
idence in a cultivated community. Such a community can be created only by the 
general diffusion of knowledge; for the average can not be high if a large number be 
left in ignorance. ae 
But while admitting the need and utility of free schools affording instruction in the 
elementary branches of learning, many doubt the advantage to society at large, and 
hence the right of society to maintain the high school, It can be supported, they 
say, only in cities and towns, and in these it is reached by but a small proportion of 
the pupils; so the people ought not to be taxed to sustain an institution so limited 
and so partial in its benefits. 
The charge that the entire State is taxed te support high schools in cities and towns 
may be answered by a general denial. In nearly every instance the high school is 
entirely supported by the community which enjoys its benefits. This city, for in- 
stance, with a lower rate of taxation than is permitted to townships and towns, not 
only maintains her entire graded system for nearly ten months in the year, but out 
of her abundance contributes many thousand dollars for the payment of teachers 
throughout the State. The aggregation of wealth here produces a large revenue, the 
aggregation of population makes it possible to furnish instruction at a less rate per 
pupil than in thecountry. The same is true of all centers of population in proportion 
to their wealth and numbers. 3 But confining the question within tho city limits, can we justify the maintenance 
of the high school, which is patronized by so few? I think wecan. _ Ree | 
The term high school is perhaps misleading, as suggesting a school different in kind 
and separate in some way from the grades below, which are often spoken of as the 
common schools. Such is not the case. The high school is as much common in every 
proper sense as the lowest primary grade. In the words of the constitution, it is 
equally open to all and tuition in it is without charge. It is merely the continuation, 
without break or interruption, of the graded course of study as far as the number of 
pupils desiring advanced instruction will justify its being carried. Upon what other 
principle can the course of study be abridged? There are but half as many pupils 
in the fifth year as in the first primary. If those grades only are to be kept up which 
accommodate the greatest number, an average might be struck and all above the fifth 
year abolished. ees By the immemorial custom and law of the English-speaking race the age of majority 
is fixed at twenty-one years. All our institutions, statutes, and social arrangements 
tally with that theory. So it is held that a person is entitled to school privileges till 
he is twenty-one years of age. As Socrates would have asked, Is he entitled to re- 
ceive instruction suited to his advancement or not suited to it? The answer is ob- 
vious, as to most of Socrates’s questions. As the conditions of life adjust dhemselves 
the larger number of pupils in the schools will be young, under fourteen; but many 
will remain after that age ; some will be willing to remain as long as they can receive 
instruction suited to their needs. Such instruction should be furnished whenever a

sufficient number desire it. It should not be a question of the grade but of the num- 
ber of pupils. If this be sufficiently large to justify the employment of teachers and 
assignment of rooms for their benefit, they ought to be accomodated. It is not ap- 
preciably more expensive to provide for fifty pupils instruction in advanced studies 
than to teach the same number the elementary branches. 
This principle applies to all times and places. The country district is not prevented 
from maintaining higher grades by lack of money, but by lack of numbers. When 
the numbers are collected the money is forthcoming. As a neighborhood becomes 
thickly settled the district school expands into a graded school, growing as the popu- 
lation grows; and as the village becomes a town and the town a city the school 
develops intoa graded system, the higher departments, in such a city as this, sur- 
passing in variety and extent many colleges of fifty years ago. 
Even on the citizen-making theory the high school can not be dispensed with. 
Reading, writing, and arithmetic may qualify a man to cast an intelligent vote, if 
he uses these acquirements to advantage; but the collective citizenship of the State 
must furnish much more than voters. The citizen is now a voter, now a legislator, 
now a judge, and now a governor. If the State undertakes to make good citizens 
she must give the men who will fill allthe positions incident to citizenship the nreans 
of qualifying themselves for their duties. 
But whatever theory we may prefer, the return to the public and to every individ- 
ual upon an investment in a high school is rich and abundant. It is a center of 
elevating influences, drawing up all the lower schools, awakening the ambition of 
the young, and making for the ambitious a way to the “career open to talent.” 
More than any other agency it raises the average intelligence and the general tone 
of thought and manners, sending into the homes of the people disciplined minds, 
enlarged views, refined tastes, and somewhat of that admirable but indefinable con- 
dition of mind and heart called culture—qualities belonging to the realm of infinite 
values, not to be measured in gold;—making ‘the poor man’s hour of leisure richer 
than the baron’s of old time.” The high school is essential to the dignity of the city 
and the well-being of the citizens. 
THE RAISON D’ETRE OF THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL! 
By GzeorcE Sruart, A. M., 
Professor of Latin in the Oentral High School of Philadelphia. 
Our ordinary ideas of the ground on which the public high school rests and of 
its relation to the body politic are too ofteri loose and shifting. At one moment the 
institution is regarded as the result of a kind of benevolence on the part of the 
state, and the money appropriated for its support as a public gratuity. At another, 
the institution is looked upon as one in which the children of a well-to-do favored 
few may, for their own individual advantage or distinction, add a few finishing 
touches or some ornamental appendages to the education acquired in the lower 
schools. Too rarely is the public high school regarded as an essential part of the 
social structure, and in the same sense in which halls of legislation and of justice or 
systems of police are parts of the same structure. 
To fix and focalize our loose and shifting ideas on this subject, let us ask and answer 
the following questions: 1. What is the reasonable ground upon which the public 
high school rests? 2. What is its relation to the body politic? 3. What are its func- 
tions and how should it perform them ? 
In what we have to say on this whole subject, let it be understood that by body 
politic we mean a ‘government of the peop for the people, and by the people,” 
and that reasoning which may be irrefragM#®le when used in reference to such a 
government may fail utterly when applied to other forms of government; and that 
by public high school we mean any public institution imparting superior as distin- 
guished from elementary instruction ; and that institution in which the principles of 
art, literature, and science are explored to their farthest limits is our ideal public 
high school, whether it be called academy, school, college, or university. 
The application of the argument herein presented is necessarily limited to a popu- 
lar government; for under other forms of government there are privileged classes, 
with class prerogatives and strongly guarded barriers separating the classes. But it 
is the peculiar glory of a free people that the individuals of whatever classes exist 
pass freely from class to class, or rather gravitate from class to class under the at- 
traction of conspicuous fitness, and he who is governed to-day may be a governor to- 
morrow.

1018 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
What, then, is the reasonable ground on which the public high school rests? We @ 
shall begin the answer by showing that the state does not establish charitable or 
benevolent institutions from motives of charity or benevolence. On the contrary, 
the principal motive is undoubtedly selfishness. In proof of this assertion it is not 
necessary to say that charity can not be predicated of states or thut corporations are 
soulless. The state simply aims at compassing a certain end for its own well-being. 
It cares not whether A or B is to be the beneficiary; its purpose is that those who 
are to be beneficiaries shall be the best fitted to be beneficiaries. It recognizes that 
there always will be beneficiaries entailing burdens and discomforts upon the citi- 
zens, und it believes that it is best for the body politic not to leave to chance the relief 
of such persons; and, notwithstanding the expense incurred, society is the gainer in 
decency, in comfort, and in safety. The state neither gives, ror has the right to give, 
value for nothing. It always expects at least an equivalent; and if the equivalent 
be not received, or forthcoming, it either miscalculates or\is defrauded. The exist- 
ence of private charitable and benevolent institutions does not alter the case with the 
state; these depend on chance, upon which society must not depend; and thus 
while they lessen, they do not remove public responsibility. 
We shall next observe that the state does not establish prisons and penitentiaries 
from motives of vindictiveness. Here again the principal motive is selfishness. The 
state does not care one whit whether A or B is to be imprisoned; its intention is that 
those who are to be imprisoned shall be the best fitted to be prisoners. It recognizes 
that the violation of law and the commission of crime will be constant, and it be- 
lieves that it is best for society not to leave to chance the removal of this constant 
menace to its well-being ; and notwithstanding the expense incurred in supporting 
penal institutions, society isthe gainer in good order, peace, and safety. The exist- 
ence of private reformatory institutions does not alter the case with the state. Such 
institutions aid in the work of repression and reform; but the state believes that, 
while they lessen, they can not remove public responsibility, and it finds solid foun- 
dation for its belief in the sree brie UIE atrocities of lynch law and vigilance com- 
mittees. 
Similar arguments may easily be framed in defense of other institutions established 
by the body politic for its own well-being ; as the lazaretto, quarantine, public sani- 
tation, illumination of cities, coinage of money, regulation of commerce, etc. In 
each instance the decision of the state is that the welfare of society demands that 
the object which the institution has in view shall not be left to chance, whatever pri- 
vate enterprise may contribute to its accomplishment. 
Itis wholly in recognition of public responsibility that common schools are estab- 
lished by the state, and the almost universal consent with which this responsibility 
is acknowledged is evidence of its weight. Equality of civic rights, equality of civic 
responsibilities, and equality of civic duties belong to all the citizens of a free state. 
Without a full enjoyment of rights, a full comprehension of responsibilities, and a 
full discharge of duties, either the state or the citizen suffers. If the state suffers, 
the rights of all are menaced; if the citizen suffers, his equality isimpaired. Hence 
the citizen must know ; he must receive the elements of education ; his intelligence 
must be awakened and his mind developed ; he must learn his relation to the body 
politic, and while he learns how to enjoy his civic rights, he must also learn not to 
neglect his civie responsibilities and his civic duties. Hence the popular verdict is 
that the education of free citizens for citizenship can not be left to chance, and that 
the public school system stands in precisely the same relation to the body politic as 
other great institutions established for the well-being and safety of society. The 
existence of numerous private schools can not alter the case with the state; these 
aid in the dissemination of knowledge and the broadening of intelligence, and, while 
they lighten, they can not remove public responsibility. They are schools for such 
of that small, rich minority as may prefer them. The failure of any state to estab- 
lish free public schools lessens the citiggn’s responsibility. But recently, in a Euro- 
pean city, during the prevalence of the cholera, some soldiers sent to apply disinfect- 
ants as 2 means of sanitation were assailed and. either killed or wounded by an igno- 
rant and superstitious mob, who imagined that the disinfectants were in some strange 
way responsible for the cholera. Such ignorance and superstition can uot exist by 
the side of the free public school. The pupils of att a school soon learn that 
Heaven never helps aman when he can help himself, and that it is vain at such a time 
to pray against the force of inertia. 
At this point we make the digressive remark that the efficiency of the American 
public school in training for citizenship is likely to be severely tested in the near 
fature. Until within recent years, the immigration into our country was nearly 
homogeneous and largely sympathetic, and assimilation was comparatively easy. 
But recently there has appeared in our midst an element peculiariy alien in race 
and sympathies, or revolutionary in tendencies, and in numbers sufficiently large to 
disturb the calm posture of our social forms and the settled traditions of centuries. 
Against the subversive influence of this element our common school is our tower of 
strength, and civics as a branch of instruction assumes paramount importance.

  THE RAISON D’ATRE OF THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. 1019 
We come now directly tothe public high school. How is its existence as a part of 
the social structure justified? How dves it appear that society receives far more than. 
an equivalent for its cost and is the gainer by it? 
To genius and superior abilities is due the progress of the centuries. The thou- 
sand comforts that solace modern social life and the many artificial beauties that 
surround and adorn it are all the products of art, literature, and science, and due to 
the directive power of genius and superior abilities. We are in almost every way 
immeasurably better off than were our forefathers. Blot out that progress and 
measure the distance separating the two social planes. Does the difference startle 
you? How does your rush light compare with yon are light shining like a nascent 
sun? The difference in power between those two lights is the exact measure of the 
amount of benefit that the directive power of genius and superior abilities has con- 
ferred upon society. Now sum up the whole cost of developing and utilizing those 
abilities and compare it with the benefit to society. Shall we retain the cost or the 
benefit? Nay, it is the constantly accruing benefit that enables society to pay the 
cost and still have a rich surplus. 
Society has manifold need of directive power. It is needed in executive, legisla- 
tive, and judicial seats. It is needed in state, church, and school. It is needed in 
the administration of finance and in the conduct of social institutions. It is needed 
in the development and application of art and science, in journalism and in litera- 
ture. We need inventors and discoverers to give us the best that nature has for us; 
and we need a whole army of literary workers to form our judgments, guide public 
opinion, cultivate our tastes, and minister to our intellectual and moral wants. And 
when these needs are supplied, it is not merely the whole body politic that is bene- 
fitted, but it is in an especial manner that great majority of it which is not gifted with 
superior abilities. In the parable of the talents, he that received five talents and he 
that received ten each returned with splendid usury the trust committed to him; 
while he that received the one talent pci do nothing but bury it in the earth and 
stand and fold his arms. What would he have done and what would have been done 
for him under competent directive power? ‘Education is growth, and develops a 
force that presses outward, ever enlarging its sphere until it pervades all the region 
of thought and carries its inquisitions into every field of enterprise and speculation. 
It does not unify, but diversifies our ideas, sentiments, and convictions. To teach 
men to think alike is compression. To teach men to think apart is expansion. The 
force of education is not conservative ; it is radical.”! 
Genius and superior natural abilities are the inheritance of comparatively few. 
Rich indeed is that state which has the largest endowment of them, for it has the 
prime elements of greatest material, moral, and intellectual strength. We can not 
create them, but we can develop, train, and utilize them to the maximum of their 
potential, and we can create an hereditary tendency to the transmission of them. 
Any loss of superior natural ability through lack of the proper development or train- 
ing is a loss of wealth and power to a community. But great natural abilities are 
the rare inheritance of rich and poor alike; and the poor (or those who would be un- 
able to pay for higher education) in every state always constitute a very large 
majority of the people; and, what is noteworthy in this connection, the rich lack the 
spur of necessity, which is the proverbial mother of invention. That a “government 
of the people, for the people, and by the people” should be without the public high 
school, and should look for its manifold directive power to chance and that quota of 
superior natural abilities furnished by a small rich minority is a paradox reaching 
the climax of folly and the eclipse of reason. 
Whither, then, can the state or society look for directive power but to its public 
high school, college, or university? It is needless here to enlarge upon the value of 
individual directive power. The total directive power of society is always a whole 
greater than the sum of all its parts. Yet in times when physical strength in battle 
counted much more than at present, the directive power of Regulus was rated at a 
thousand common soldiers. Newton gave a new basis to the solar system and a sure 
foundation to the nautical almanac. One electric arc light may be equal to six 
thousand candle-power. At one electric touch the earth contracts her ancient dimen- 
_ sions and New York confers with London at call, London with Calcutta. The Psalm 
of Life is a perpetual soul-building homily radiant with heavenly philanthropy. The 
discovery of electric welding during the present year by Prof. Elihu Thomson, a 
graduate of a public high school, will, it is estimated, save in time and material 
millions of dollars aniually; and to the State of which he is a native it will certainly 
save in the same way an annual sum far greater than that appropriated to the high 
school of which he is an alumnus. The military and naval academies of our country 
furnish additional illustration of the value of directive power and of its benefit to the 
state. The cadets, admitted on tests and subjected to wholesome mental strain and. 
discipline, are the foster-sons of the Government. For their costly maintenance and 
education the state expects a quid pro quo. Is this cost a gratuity? With what

golden usury it is returned our history bears ample witness in many a national dan- 
ger averted, in many a national blessing won; yet the laureled fasces never wear a 
more joyous look than when entwined by the fruitful olive-branch. ‘ 
The public high school thus stands on solid ground and becomes an essential part 
of the social structure. It is not merely an essential part, but it is the essential part 
which originates, moves, and directs all the other parts. Itis the eye and sensorium 
of the body politic and the state’s perpetual policy of insurance. The money appro- 
priated for its support is not a gratuity, but a public investment which elevates and 
enriches society and makes the intellectual greatness and the material strength of 
states. 
The argument which thus necessitates the public high school also prescribes its 
character. Consider the word high in this connection ; emphasize it a little; give it 
voice and a tongue and it will speak eloquently. In order that the resources of art, 
literature, and science may be realized in ever fresh benefit to society, their under- 
lying principles must be explored to their farthest limits. Equipment, appliances, _ 
and corps should be thorough and complete, and instruction in principles sufficiently 
extensive to lead the student up to original research. Mediocrity in these respects 
is mental stagnation ; inferiority, intellectual starvation and death. Preparation 
for college or any other private institution is not a necessary function of the public 
high school, which should either be in itself, or culminate in, a State university. 
This ideal public. high school has already been realized in several parts of our coun- 
try, and reveals the destined trend in which all our educational lines are surely mov- 
ing to convergence, 
The existence of private high schools, colleges, and universities can not remove 
public responsibility. These supplement, in some degree, State delinquency, and 
have in the past furnished considerable directive power. But they are institutions 
for a small rich minority, and the sum annually paid for higher education in them is 
a convincing proof of the value of that education in developing and utilizing great 
natural abilities. And let us not forget that we are speaking for a ‘‘ government of 
the people, for the people, and by the people.” 
Notwithstanding the directness of the reasoning which thus constitutes the public 
high school an important part of the body politic, a few objections to it are still 
urged. Of these some are trivial, some specious, but none of them true. The rich 
man without children, or sending them to private institutions, objects to paying the 
high school tax because, he does not directly participate in the benefit. O for Mene- 
nius Agrippa to relate again, as once at the Sacred Mount, the fable of The Belly 
and the Members. For, dullard that he is, this rich man must then either consent 
or refase to pay the tax for street-lighting because a public lamp has not been 
placed before his own door, or the poor tax, because none of his family is inthe poor- 
house. This rich man is, however, rapidly disappearing. 
The remaining objections may all be classed together as those resulting from so- 
called over-education. These are the most specious and the most dangerous because 
they are urged by respectable journals and newspapers. The crying evils of this 
over-education are all summed up in the following extract from one of our most in- 
fluential journals; the students in our public high schools are ‘“ aiming at something 
beyond and above their social rank and condition.” Do you, Mr. Editor, really need 
to be informed that the object of the most rational system of education is to develop 
and utilize to their maximum all the child’s inherited abilities? Or is it for you to 
tell us, contrary to reason, just how much of his abilities it will be best to develop 
and utilize? Do you, an expounder of democratic principles, need to be told that it 
is the freeman’s inalienable right to do that work in society to which his conspicuous 
fitness is his best title? Or do you mean that it is a serious objection to be too skil- 
ful a machinist, too able an engineer, or perhaps too clever an editor? But, pardon 
us, Mr. Editor; we mistake your meaning. You mean that by some hook or crook 
society may appoint the graduate to some field of labor for which he is not qualified. 
That would indeed be a serious blunder; and so much the worse for the society com- 
mitting it. Now listen to us, Mr. Editor, while we address the same students: 
“Young men, it is a praiseworthy ambition in you to be aiming to better your con- 
dition. Strive to develop and utilize all your inlferited abilities. Society has a just 
right to expect this of you. Conspicuous fitness is the American citizen’s only title 
to superiority. Let great examples stimulate your activity. Recall those wortbies 
the results of whose achievements are in us and around us, graven upon the form 
and features of the times; which are materialized in a higher plane of social com- 
fort, moralized in broader, more practical, and self-reliant character, and spiritualized 
in a kindlier vein of charity and benevolence and in works of high art and high 
literature.” Is there any demagogism in this, Mr. Editor? 
From the reasoning which necessitates the public high school and determines its 
relation to the body politic we are enabled to deduce, as natural and easy corollaries, 
its funetions, and the manner in which they’should be performed. The State recog: 
nizes that all its directive power must be selected from those of its citizens having
-P-A-G-E-1021
THE RAISON D’ATRE OF THE PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. 1021 
the best natural abilities according to their conspicuous fitness, and that, as it is the 
developing and utilizing power of higher education which gives to directive power 
its greatest value and efficiency, it can look with confidence and justice for this 
higher education only to its public high schoo! or State university. It therefore fol- 
lows that the chief function of the public high schoolis to furnish the State with the 
directive power necessary for its political and social well-being. 
A-secondary function of the high school in each State or subdivision of it must 
necessarily be to stimulate into greater activity and keener competition all the lower 
schools, and to actas aradiating centre of thought and mental activity, and thus to ele- 
vate and refine the general tone of the community. For the “force of education is 
centrifugal.” The location of the school should always be near the source of largest 
supply, or in centres of population. The exclusion of everything partisan or sec- 
tarian from the course of study tends to develop a character without prejudice or 
bias, and free intercourse on a plane of entire equality gives to that character a 
breadth and homogeneousness in harmony with the spirit of our government quite 
unattainable in private institutions, where the pride of wealth and social distinc- 
tions based thereon too often build around themselves a narrowing wall of ex- 
clusiveness. 
The doors of the public high school are open to rich and poor alike. The State 
does not care whether A or Bis to be admitted. Its purpose isthat those who are to be 
admitted shall be the best fitted to be admitted. Conspicuous fitness is the only title 
to admission, and this fitness must be determined by competitive examination. The 
quota system of admission is wholly illogical and is based on a misconception of the 
functions of the school. Socrates justly ridiculed the Athenians for choosing some 
of their public officers by lot. Promotion in the school should be determined by the 
same criterion, Tests should increase in severity with the progress of the course. 
Wholesome mental strain sustained by wholesome exercise is a wholesome hygiene. 
When the limit of capacity in any case is reached, a vacancy shauld be declared. 
Limit of capacity is a safe indication of limit of fitness. The public high school is 
neither a reformatory nor an asylum for feebleness. The State builds its greatest 
expectations on the survival of the fittest. 
The curriculum or course of study should connect closely with the studies of the 
next lower schools. The reason for this is obvious. The educative process is a suc- 
cession of ascending steps connected like the links of a chain. 
“From nature’s chain whatever link you strike, ‘Tenth or ten-thousandth breaks thé chain alike.” 
Until within recent years higher institutions of learning had a single undivided 
curriculum, in which the classics and the humanities played a dominating part. 
‘These served mankind long and well. But an evolution was in progress mightier 
than classic veto or papal bull or warning voice of Cassandra. The latent forces of 
material nature began to be utilized, and science clamored for recognition. A fierce 
struggle ensued. Science thrust and the classics parried, and the issue seemed 
doubtful, until science, opening its subterranean and celestial armories stored with 
wondrous wealth and power, led its Titan forces—steam, heat, light, electricity, 
geology, and the wonder-working analyses of chemistry—into the field and drove the 
classies and the humanities from more than half the educational arena. Then they 
compromised, joined hands, and divided all mastery between them. To science fell 
directive power over matter; to the classics and the humanities directive power 
over mind. Thus, directive power is utilized— 
ON THE MATERIAL Srpz, in mining, metallurgy, AND ON THE HuMAN SIDE, in law and legislation, 
engineering, architecture, ship-building, ap:  judicature, politics, police, sociology, journal- plied chemistry, applied’ physics, manifold ism, literature, theology, painting, ‘sculpture, manufacture, applied mechanics, ete. music, oratory, ete. . 
Hence all our higher institutions of learning now divide the curriculum into two 
main branches, which may be called scientific and literary. There is, of course, even 
in the highest university courses, a frequent overlapping of these branches, and each 
becomes contributory to the other. This division of the course became a necessity 
resulting both from the vastness of the intellectual field and the utility of the 
economic principle of division of labor. The field demands almost infinite energies ; 
yet, by the distribution of finite energies to its several parts, this almost infinite de- 
mand is readily supplied. Itis better to know everything of something than some- 
thing of everything. 
At what point in the curriculum of the public high school this division may be 
safely made depends upon the quality and quantity of the requisites for admission. 
The average stage of preparation attained in our public grammar schools makes 
necessary a common curriculum for some time after admission, and for obvious 
reasons. Some studies have a high disciplinary value, some a high culture value, 
and some have both. For example, higher mathematics, aside from high scientific   
-P-A-G-E-1022
  | 1022 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
value, has also a high disciplinary value; language studies, literature, and history have a high culture value; and the study of a netted language not vernacular 
has both a high disciplinary and a high culture value. Such studies give roundness, 
fulness, and symmetry to mental development, and avert that one-sidedness which results from the pursuit of special courses without due preparation for them. We do not mean that all such studies are negessary. We believe that in a curriculum 
of four years, common studies for the first two years would be ample preparation for 
special scientific and literary courses. The arrangement of curricula for the latter 
courses presents little difficulty, and the only limitation in it is the element of time. 
There are sometimes taught in public high schools subjects which have no relation. 
whatever to the end in view. Such subjects are book-keeping, type-writing, pho- 
nography, sewing, and cooking. The criterion of fitness in any subject to be a brartch 
of instruction is extensive application of principle and prospective benefit to society. 
Benefit that remains wholly with the individual or individual interests can found no 
claim to public recognition. Judged by this criterion, how can any of these subjects 
be justified? The mathematical principles of book-keeping are taught in arithmetic, 
and balancing accounts may very properly be taught as a practical application of 
them. Type-writing and phonography are manual operations involving no principle 
whatever, and have just the same title to public recognition as shoemaking and 
tailoring. The benefit remains wholly with the individual. Sewing and cooking 
can be justified as branches of instruction only on the ground that those who are 
taught will either sew and cook or teach sewing and cooking for the public, and that 
society will be benefited thereby. The normal school is justified as a public institu- 
tion solely on the ground that its function is to furnish teachers for the public schools. 
And now in conclusion.- The scientific movement before mentioned advanced with 
ever-widening flow. Matter, material force, and mechanism became the ruling deities. 
They open vistas richer than the wealth of Ormus or of Ind. Their products choke 
the avenues of trade and line all the ways of commerce. The prospect of riches 
stimulates every activity. The altars of Mammon smoke with a perpetual sacrifice, 
and too often the sole object of our vows is the golden though fatal gift of Midas. 
Money is at last our supreme good, because in it we have found the measure of a 
man, the next of kin to heaven. ‘‘In fact, if we look deeper, we shall find that this 
faith in mechanism has now struck its'roots deep into man’s most intimate, primary 
sources of conviction; and is thence sending up, over his whole life and activity, in- 
numerable stems, fruit-bearing and poison-bearing. The truth is, men have lost 
their belief in the invisible, and believe and hope and work only in the visible; or, 
to speak it in other words, this is not a religious age. Only the material, the imme- 
diately practical, not the divine and spiritual, is important to us. The infinite, ab- 
solute character of virtue has passed into a finite, conditional one; it is no longer a 
worship of the beautiful and good, but a calculation of the profitable.” 1 
Against these poison-bearing stems and against a tendency so materialistic our 
methods in scientific training should provide some preservative. The neglect of pure 
culture studies—the neglect of the humanities—especially the neglect of them in 
scientific education, is in some measure responsible for much of our materialism. 
Education means vastly more than a mere whetting of the intellectual faculties; it 
also means spiritual growth, a sensitizing of the moral faculties, and the moulding of 
character for manhood. But let us not therefore undervalue science and its golden 
freightage of blessing. ‘‘ Science is noble and good, but the progress of the soul is bet- 
ter. Genius isa bird of morning, and its song is always the exponent of the most 
recent pulse of human passion, human knowledge of beauty, human sympathy with 
the joys and sorrows of the world. The rocks 1 give up the last secret of their 
hearts; the sea, too, may disgorge its treasures; but at last it is the soul of man that 
is the poet’s field of study—the soul that walked with God upon chaos in the dark 
hour before the dawn of creation, the soul that still walks with him as the morning 
twilight slowly @roadens into perfect day.” 
Mere science, without cultivation on the human, the moral, and the spiritual side, 
is apt to be unimpassioned, unimpressive, and unimaginative. No mere science ever 
writes poetry, and no pathos heaves the diaphragm of the phonograph. Let not 
science be made ignoble by the clod of materialism, Let it roam the macrocosm in 
full sympathy with the microcosm. While it finds melody only in sonorous vibra- 
tions, still let the golden planets, beating against the tides of ether, peal out to fancy’s 
ear ethereal chimes ; and while it sees the birth of dewy morning only in luminous 
undulations, still let its eye of poesy behold the steeds of Aurora, breaking from the 
barriers of night,    
       
“arise, 
And shake the darkness from their loosened manes, 
And beat the twilight into flakes of fire.”

The results of some investigations about the relation of medical colleges to the 
medical profession in the United States are considered by the Commissioner of Edu- 
cation to be of enough value to justify their insertion in the Annual Report of his 
Office for the year 1886-87. They are here concisely presented at his request. In 
order that the statistics and discussions of the current year in another part of this 
volume may be considered by themselves and in their general relations to the other 
parts of the Report, these results are printed as a special article. 
The annual reports of the Board of Health of the State of Illinois and the catalogues 
and announcements of the medical colleges in this country are the sources from which 
the facts have been drawn. A very careful comparison in many places between the 
statements of the Illinois board and those of the college publications has shown so. 
much care and correctness, that the reports of that board, so far as they contain the 
facts, are used and quoted without demur. 
For the careful collection of these facts through many years, and for their clear and 
logical presentation, the country owes a debt of gratitude to Dr. John H. Rauch, 
secretary of that board; yet this is only one of the many useful and continued services 
of that accomplished and indefatigable officer and physician. 
When the Federal Census of 1880 announced that there were 85,671 physicians or 
alleged physicians in this country, or one to 584 of the entire population, it simply 
ave a definite form to a long-felt impression in most minds. That the medical pro- 
ession in the United States was scandalously overcrowded was known long before 
that year; that it is so still, the comments and complaints of the medical journals 
every spring bear witness. The evil must be endured until in process of time effective 
measures are devised and applied for its correction; it will never cure itself, as long 
as human vanity, greed, and laziness are permitted to act unchecked. 
Fortunately the facile descent toward the medical Avernus has awakened a good 
deal of professional and some public alarm; and, in consequence, medical licensing 
acts and other devices have been adopted in many States for the purpose of regulating 
the conduct, character, educational acquirements, and professional relations of medi- 
eal men to the public. 
The purpose of this paper is to show how medical colleges may co-operate in the 
good work of increasing the qualifications of medical predates, and thereby pre- 
Reo ae or hindering the entrance of incompetent or indolent persons into the medical 
profession. 
The method here described is not new; it isin vogue in several colleges of medi- 
cine already with the happiest results, and only needs to be extended to all medical 
schools in the country to produce a most beneficial effect upon the number, quality, 
and value of aspirants for medical success. 
The greater number of medical schools in the United States still pursue the ancient 
method of educating their students. This consists, essentially, of a requirement that 
the applicant for graduation shall have attended ‘‘two courses of lectures” upon the 
main topics included in medical training; but in practice these ‘two courses” are 
really one and the same course, given each year with but little variation. 
Amore modern and more sensible method is followed by the minority of our medical 
schools; these require, before graduation, attendance upon three courses of lectures, 
in which the subjects of instruction are arranged in such a way as to be graded in 
correspondence with the attainments and progress of the students. 
I have taken the facts given in this article as to the numbers of matriculates and 
graduates of one hundred and twelve medical colleges existing in this country dur- 
ing the scholastic year 1885-86 from the reports of the Illinois Board of Health. T 
have grouped the colleges requiring three graded courses of instruction together, and 
those not so requiring also together; in the discussion of these groups, the graded 
group is entitled ‘‘A,” and the other “ B.” 
The period of time chosen covers five scholastic years; for each of these and for the 
quinquennial period the table on pp. 1024-27 gives the matriculates and graduates 
appertaining to each of the schools above indicated. - 
I do not mean to assert that all the schools in Group A required graded courses 
during the entire quinquennial period, but only that they so required in the last 
year of the period. Nor do I assert that all the schools in Group B are properly 
placed therein ; but only that they appeared to me, upon a careful examination, to 
belong therein rather than in Group A. For errors of judgment in this respect I beg 
the indulgence of my readers.

  1028 EDUCATION REPORT, 1886-87. 
Group A contains twenty-four ‘‘Regular”’ and five Homeopathic medical schools; 
Group B consists of sixty-three “Regular,” eight Homeopathic, ten Eclectic, and two 
Physio-medical schools. 
Having given the facts for each school and each year in detail, I now append a 
summary showing the number of matriculates in each year and for the entire period 
in each group in the several professional sects, if the latter term be allowable, and 
in all the schools considered together. Eighty-four per cent. of these students at- 
tended ‘‘Regular” schools, more than nine per cent. went to Homeopathic schools, 
and the rest mainly to Eclectic schools. 
The matriculates decreased in number year after year until 1884-85, when the low 
point was reached; an upward tendency, noticeable in all the varieties of doctrine, 
began with 1885-86. This is true of both groups in general. The matriculates in the 
“ Regular” schools in Group A were,-however, least numerous in 1883-84, while the 
Homeopathic schools in the same group for the same year show their largest enro!- 
ment during the period. There is no doubt that the general population of the country 
increased as rapidly as usual during each year of the time under review, though the 
number of medical students fluctuated as indicated.

In order to direct attention to other points of interest, the concrete numbers of the 
summary under review are now transformed into percentages. 
These show that the colleges included in Group A, when compared with those in 
Group B, gradually and slightly increased their proportion of matriculates; this is 
also true of both the ‘‘ Regular” and the Homeopathic schools. 
The proportion of Homeopathic matriculates in Group A is greater than that of 
“ Regular” matriculates therein. 
When one observes that, during the five years, seventy-nine medical students at- 
tended the repetition-course schools, while only twenty-one attended the graded- 
course schools, one can not avoid asking why such was the case? Of course many 
who attended schools in Group B did so because the schools were more numerous; 
but it is probable that a goodly number preferred them because they were thought 
to be less exacting of labor by their students. Men who desire to obtain a degree 
with the minimum of labor or delay are naturally repelled by the announcement of 
schools like those in Group A; like water, they flow in the direction of least resistance. 
This summary doves not indicate that degrees are obtained more easily in Group B 
than in Group A, but that some men prefer the group that seems to ask its students 
to spend less time, and, presumably, to take less pains at each step in their progress.

  MEDICAL COLLEGES AND PROFESSION. 1029 
The next summary shows for each year, for the five years, for all kinds of schools, 
for each kind, and for each group, the number of graduates—*hat is, the number en- 
tering the profession of medicine and surgery. 
The year 1884-85 is low tide in this respect, as in the matter of matriculations. 
Eighty-four per cent. of the graduates were from ‘‘ Regular” schools, nearly ten 
per cent, from Homeopathic schools, and the rest mainly from Eclectic schools. For 
most of the increase of the medical profession for which the schools are account- 
able, those teaching the “Regular” or Innominate doctrines are shown to be directly 
responsible,

The proportion of graduates from the groups is shown in the percentage table next 
presented. Eighty-three per cent. graduated from schools in Group B, as against 
seventeen per cent. from schools in Group A. This proportion holds for the “ Regu- 
Jar” graduates; but twenty-five per cent. of the Homeopathics graduated from 
schools in Group A. 
This is a very serious matter indeed, when properly considered. The legitimate, 
ascertained, and best-educated element in the increase of the medical profession, 
during the five years under review, graduated from schools whose standard of attain- 
ment was much lower than that recognized in any foreign country, and lower even 
than the standard set by many schools in this country.

Finally, we must consider the proportién of graduates to matriculates for the pe- 
riod under review. . 
Somewhat more than a third of the medical students became doctors of medicine ; 
but the proportion of graduates to matriculates in Group A was twenty-seven per 
cent., a little more than a fourth, while in Group B it was thirty-five per cent., or 
more than a third. Ifthe proportion of graduates in Group B had been the same as 
in Group A, the number of graduates therefrom would have been about 12,500 in- 
stead of about 16,300, as heretofore shown. If, on the other hand, the graduates in 
Group A had been as numerous in proportion as in Group B, they would have risen 
from about 3,300 to about 4,300. 
The rigid application of the requirement for a graded course of instruction for three 
years by all medical colleges during the five years under present consideration, would 
have resulted in reducing the number of graduates from about 19,600 to about 15,800. 
Whether this diminution of graduates would be beneficial as a whole to the medical 
profession, is a subject upon which men may differ; but there is no question that the 
graded course would tend to raise the standard of qualifications needed for gradua- 
tion, and would supply a better quality of graduates for employment in the work of 
the medical practitioner.

CHAPTER XX. 
INDEX TO THE PUBLICATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, FROM 1868 TO 1887. 
For nearly twenty years this Office has been issuing annual and special reports, 
circulars of information, and other occasional publications for the information of Con- 
gress and of the public. These documents now number some twenty-five volumes 
and comprise as many thousand pages; reference to their contents has become some- 
what of a task; and the lapse of time makes it advisable that many bibliographical 
data respecting them should be committed to print before they are entirely lost. 
In order, therefore, to render reference to the contents of these publications easy, 
and to preserve useful memoranda respecting them, the accompanying list and index 
has been prepared.

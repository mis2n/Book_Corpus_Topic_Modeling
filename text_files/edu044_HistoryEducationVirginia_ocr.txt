  PREFACE 
In the preparation of this volume, I have 
been actuated by a desire to make the history 
of Education in Virginia accessible to teachers 
and students, and to place it within the reach 
of all who have any wish to become acquainted 
with the story of the educational progress of 
the State. 
It need not be said that it is impossible to 
describe within the limits of this volume the 
whole history of education in Virginia. Out 
of the mass of material which would have filled 
many volumes, the effort has been made to 
select only the essential facts and tell a brief 
story of the growth centering about these salient 
features. 
Throughout the course of this book, I have 
tried to acknowledge in the text the valuable 
help I have received from numerous published 
works; but it gives me pleasure to record my

INTRODUCTION 
Lire in colonial Virginia was more nearly a 
reproduction of English society than that in 
any other colony. In his famous sermon be- 
fore Lord Delaware and his company on the eve 
of their departure for the colony, the Cambridge 
divine, Cranshaw, said, refuting the charge 
that the Virginia settlers were the offscouring 
of England — “They are like those left behind, 
even of all sorts better and worse.” The Rev. 
Hugh Jones, writing in 1724 on “The Present 
State of Virginia,” stated that the gentry 
“live in a neat manner, dress after the same 
modes and behave themselves exactly as the 
gentry in London.” Even more to the point, 
so far as this study is concerned, is the famous 
reply of Governor Berkeley in 1671 to the in- 
quiry of the home government as to the course 
taken concerning churches and schools. The 
ix

    INTRODUCTION 
governor replied, ‘“‘The same course that is 
taken in England out of town; every man ac- 
cording to his ability instructing his children.” 
Another portion of the testy old governor’s 
reply, thanking God that there were no free 
schools or printing, is often quoted, but the 
really significant statement quoted above is 
seldom given. 
Neither the efforts nor the needs of a sparsely 
settled frontier country, no matter how well- 
to-do the aristocratic class, could be expected 
to result in an extensive system of schools. 
The apprentice education for the laboring class 
confined to agriculture; tutorial education in 
the homes of the wealthy landed proprietors; 
endowed Latin grammar schools for youth as- 
piring to the professions; a university for the 
training of teachers in church and common- 
wealth —this was the plan of education 
evolved. It closely paralleled the educational 
scheme which sufficed in England until near 
the close of the nineteenth century. 
For the first three quarters of a century of 
our national existence, Virginia’s educational

problem was more complicated than that of 
most of her sister states. In politics she had 
accepted a democratic government, while her 
society was organized on an aristocratic basis. 
A system of human slavery was also included 
which hindered any radical modification of the 
actual social structure by the new political 
theories. However, these theories had their 
natural result in the field of education, and a 
system of free schools was instituted by law, 
based on a general state fund — the Literary 
Fund — which was generous for the times and 
probably as adequate a beginning as that made 
by other states. 
Few if any of the so-called free school sys- 
tems of the ante-bellum period were in reality 
free. All were founded on a combination of 
appropriations from state and local funds with 
large contributions from the parents of the 
pupils in the form of rates for tuition. In New 
’ York and New England the state and local 
funds were used to support in each locality a 
free school for a period. This being in almost 
all instances short, the school was continued as 
xi

INTRODUCTION 
a pay school, rates for tuition being collected 
from the pupils. Naturally the poorer chil- 
dren dropped out and the public school became 
a private school. In Pennsylvania and other 
states farther south the public funds were 
used to pay the tuition charges of all children 
whose parents were not able to pay, and the 
school was not free to the well-to-do for any 
part of the year. Consequently the free school 
became a “charity school” or a “pauper school” 
and could not thrive in a country where demo- 
cratic principles were professed. However, it 
is to be noted that this charity school plan was 
quite in accord with the individualistic senti- 
ments then generally accepted in all the states, 
— principles which were commonly identified 
with democracy and quite as commonly op- 
posed to any increase of governmental ac- 
tivity. Pennsylvania and the newer western 
states, some of which had followed the charity 
school plan, in time abandoned it for a school 
system which was free in fact as well as in 
name. Virginia, with her dominant aristo- 
cratic sentiment and under the fundamental

INTRODUCTION 
economic influence of the system of slavery, was 
unable to do this. But, hated by its supposed 
beneficiaries, scorned or manipulated by those 
responsible for its administration, the charity 
school could not thrive. 
' After the war the problem remained. Com- 
plicated by economic impoverishment and the 
burden of the freedmen, free public education 
which previously seemed undesirable now 
seemed impossible even if desirable. Yet a 
free school system was adopted and earnest 
efforts were made to materialize all its features. 
Nevertheless much of the old aristocratic op- 
position remained and much indifference was 
evident. 
Two decades passed and another era opened. 
The new heart of a broader social vision, the 
new blood of economic energy, the new nerves 
of renewed political life, revivified the educa- 
tional system. Out of the “new south” came 
the “educational revival.” Virginia with her 
neighboring states formed the vanguard in 
that movement in which all of our common- 
wealths must engage if our nation is to retain

its leadership, in that effort to make political 
right practicable, the distribution of economic 
good equitable, the dissemination of intelli- 
gence universal, the participation of the com- 
mon man in the racial achievements assured. 
Never before has democracy been so put to 
the test as it is now and will be in the coming 
generations. Education offers the greatest hope 
for the successful meeting of the issue. But it 
must be an education which affects every 
_member of society, giving him efficiency in con- 
tributing to the welfare and the progress of 
society, and at the same time fitting him for a 
satisfactory life of his own. 
Toward this goal the new education is striv- 
ing. Virginia has definitely committed herself 
to this new crusade. To the training of the 
teachers upon whom the greater burden falls 
every support should be given. Instruction 
which makes clear to them the setting as well 
as the object of their work, which shows what 
has been overcome as well as what remains to 
be done, is of value. To this end, this volume

CHAPTER I 
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND AT THE TIME OF THE 
SETTLEMENTS IN AMERICA 
The Roots of American Institutions. — The 
roots of American institutions are to be found 
particularly in England, whence came the early 
settlers of America. This is particularly true 
of early Virginia institutions. Many laws of 
England were put into force and remained in 
force for some time in Virginia during the 
early years of the Virginia colony. These 
laws were abandoned only when the condi- 
tions in the new country were such as to de- 
mand new and different methods of meeting 
the various governmental problems.' 
The apprenticeship laws of 1672, in force in 
Virginia at that time, were exactly the same 
1 See “Institutional History of Virginia,” Bruce, Vol. I, pp. 465-67. 
B 1
-P-A-G-E-20
    HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
as the English laws governing apprentices in 
that country. The following extract from the 
old Virginia laws indicates this fact: 
That the justices of the peace in any county doe 
put the laws of England against vagrants and idlers and 
dissolute persons in strict execution, and the respective 
county court shall and are hereby empowered and author- 
ized to place out all children whose parents are not able 
to bring them up apprentices to tradesmen.! 
~The English church was transplanted bodily 
to Virginia soil. Social customs, forms of 
government, and educational institutions were 
patterned after those of England, if not trans- 
ferred in identical form to Virginia. That we 
may better understand this interesting historical 
fact, it is well to take a brief view of some 
educational institutions in England at the time 
Virginia was being settled. 
The Church and Education in England. — 
The history of education in England is closely 
connected with the history of the church in that 
country. There was no general legislation re- 
garding education during the early centuries 
of English national life. It is an interesting

EDUCATION IN ENGLAND 
fact that the English nation was the last among 
the great nations of Europe to develop a na- 
tional system of education. America, even, 
with her unique system of state education, 
preceded England by half a century or more in 
developing an effective system of education for 
the American people. Between 1539 and 1833 
there was no legislation in England encouraging 
schools, except a few acts concerning colleges 
and secondary schools. 
The Dissolution of the Monasteries. — The 
dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII 
in 1539 transferred to the king about one thou- 
sand religious institutions. Among other or- 
ganized activities connected with these institu- 
tions was the care of the vast number of poor 
in England, which consisted of about one-sixth 
of the total population. By means of vast 
tracts of land owned by these religious organi- 
zations, they were able by rents to collect the 
means by which to care for the material wants 
and give training to the poor of the realm. 
This sweeping bit of legislation transferred to 
the king the enormous responsibility of caring 
3  
-P-A-G-E-22
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
for the poor. By way of meeting this new re- 
sponsibility, Parliament passed that remarkable 
series of acts known as the “‘ Poor Laws,”’ which, 
while not educational in their intent, neverthe- 
less formed the basis for the training of a vast 
number of children in the simple arts of life. 
Apprenticeship and Poor Laws.—A series 
of acts in the reign of Edward III formed the 
basis for the apprenticing of all the unemployed 
in the realm. The main features of these laws 
were: (1) any one not apprenticed should be 
bound to the first applicant; (2) wages were set 
by law, and in the case of any one receiving 
higher wages, the apprentice and the one to 
whom he was bound were punished; (3) these 
laws were enforced by the magistrates (civil 
officers), who belonged to the gentry class, and, 
in this way, the upper class was in complete 
control of the lower or dependent class; (4) the 
statutes of labor provided that any one not em- 
ployed could be forced to be bound to a man for 
husbandry; (5) women unmarried between the 
ages of twelve and forty could be forced into 
service, especially at harvest time; (6) it was 
4
-P-A-G-E-23
  
EDUCATION IN ENGLAND 
necessary that parents who apprenticed a child 
should own a certain amount of property; 
(7) the master of the apprentice was bound 
to give to his ward all the arts, secrets, and 
mysteries of the trade; (8) no apprentice could 
quit work without the consent of two magis- 
trates. 
All-this—-was—a_form_of_teaching-.where~the 
master—was._responsible for the teaching.. In 
Virginia these same laws were carried out in 
the early period of the colony. In England 
these laws sought to place the populace under 
the control of the gentry class. If any one was 
able to work and did not, he was punished by 
longer service under the master. At the second, 
offence_one~ear_was cropped, and at the third 
“offence he was put.to death. There are on the 
statute books of England as many as eighty 
offences. punishable by death. im 
Direct Tax for the Support of the Poor. — In 
1553 two officers were appointed in each com- , 
munity or county to collect money for the sup- 
port of the poor. They had the power_after- 
ward to force those able to give, to contribute 
5 5

KN   HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
to this cause. This is known as the “ first 
relief” of the poor and was spoken of as “ vol- 
untary gifts.” ( { 
There are two interesting aspects of these laws: 
(1) the state’s responsibility for providing in- 
dustrial training for the poor, and (2) the right 
to levy taxes for securing funds for this training. 
/ The main purposes of these acts were: (1) to 
/ put all children to work; (2) to put all adults to 
work; (3) to furnish hemp, flax, etc., — material 
for the children to _work with; and (4) the 
_ support of the deaf and the blind. 
These were the practical provisions of the 
Poor Laws which formed the basis of the social 
system of England and the basis of the laws of 
America whereby the poor were trained. 
Summary of the English Poor Laws. — From 
1563 to 1597 the English Poor Laws contained 
the following provisions: (1) the requirement 
that all youth not of independent living should 
be bound to masters; (2) the distinct obligation - 
of those in authority to provide for the appren- 
ticing of all such children. From 1597 to 1661 
~ there was further development of these laws, 
6
-P-A-G-E-25
  EDUCATION IN ENGLAND 
providing (1) that the overseers of the poor 
should furnish materials to be used by the poor 
children; (2) that these officers should have the 
power to use the funds procured from a general 
tax rate for the support of these apprenticed 
children; and (3) that these overseers should 
have the right to purchase material for the 
use of the children. 
These laws are the basis of all early colonial 
plans for education in America. Virginia fol- 
lowed them more strictly than the other | colonies. 
Privileges ‘of the ‘Schoolmasters. — School- 
masters were favored remarkably by being 
exempt from taxes and “ ordinary payment” 
and personal service usually charged upon other 
subjects. In 1582 all schoolmasters were as- 
sessed, and there being some question about the 
rights of schoolmasters, they sent a petition to 
the Chancellor and Lord of Exchequer, praying 
that they be relieved from this unusual action of 
the assessors. The court decided in favor of 
the schoolmasters, and they continued to enjoy 
their usual privileges. This is probably the 
first instance of combining among schoolmasters. 
7
-P-A-G-E-26
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
In matters of religion the schoolmaster-was 
allowed no freedom. The Oath of Supremacy 
(Statute 5, Elizabeth, 1562-3) was administered 
to all schoolmasters and private teachers of 
children. Many of the grammar foundations 
became elementary schools. With the changes 
in religious controversies and the changes in 
the rulers, the teaching in the grammar schools 
was more than elementary training. Latin was _ 
the core-of_the curriculum. A knowledge of 
this language was necessary for the learned and 
state officials. Without Latin, the social) ma- 
chinery of the land. would have been clogged. 
In every manor was found some one who could 
write and keep accounts in Latin. It was the 
language of the ecclesiastics; their rubrics, 
canons, liturgies, and ‘the Bible itself were 
written in Latin. Ecclesiastical correspondence 
all over the world was in this language. 
The one main object of the grammar schools 
~ then was -the teaching of the Latin language. 
The civic, the ecclesiastical, and the social 
demand for this language made it a most 
practical aim in education. 
8 
 
-P-A-G-E-27

Licensing of Teachers. — The church au- 
thorities maintained the strictest control over 
the schoolmaster. The training they gave in 
the schools was thought of as a preparation for ,/ 
taking part in the church service and not so 
much a matter of preparing the children for 
citizenship or vocational activity. For this 
reason, it was very important that the clergy 
of the Church of England control the content 
of the teaching in the schools; so from 1560 
to 1640 there are records of various orders sent 
out by the bishops to the parish clergy, mak- 
ing inquiry into the condition of the schools 
and the schoolmasters within their respective 
parishes, particularly inquiring into their re- 
ligious beliefs and practices. In 1580 the Arch- 
bishop of Canterbury issued a letter on the sub- 
ject of schoolmasters “falling off” from the 
Church of England, and ordered that they be 
examined and, if found “ corrupt or unworthy,” 
they be replaced by “ fit and sound. persons.” 
The following quotation from their orders shows 
the definite nature of the demands of the church 
on this point.

IV Item. What schoolmasters are within their parish 
and what their names are, that teach publicly or privately 
within any man’s house within your parish, of what state, 
calling or condition soever he or they be, in whose house 
or houses any such schoolmaster or teacher is? 
V Item. Whether any such schoolmaster or school- 
masters is reported known or suspected to be back- 
ward in religion, now established by the laws of the 
realm, that are thought any way to be secret hinderers 
thereof ? 1 
A statutory act of the realm followed these 
orders in 1581, which required teachers to hold 
licenses from the bishop or ordinary, on pain of 
his allowance being withheld, and if a teacher 
were found “teaching youth” contrary to 
this act, he shall “ suffer ymprisonment with- 
out baile or maineprise for one yeare.” A 
little later (December 12, 1582) the Bishop of 
London issued an order for all schoolmasters, 
public and private, to be examined, to the end 
that those of unsound religion may be re- | 
moved. The form of the license was as follows:

of all England, primate and metropolitan: To all Chris-

tian people to whom these presents shall come, sendeth 
greeting in our Lord God everlasting. These are to let 
you understand that upon receipt of sufficient testimony 
of the good life and conversation of William Swetnam of 
the parish of St. Margaret Patens in London, fishmonger, 
and upon further examination of him, being first sworn 
in due form to the supremacy of the Queen’s Most Excel- 
lent Majesty and subscribing to the articles agreed upon 
by the clergy in Anno 1562, we have licensed and by these 
presents do license the said William Swetnam to teach 
and instruct children in the principles of reading and 
introduction into the accidents and also to write and cast 
accounts in any parish within the city of London.! 
The license was to be in force during good 
behavior, and further duties were enjoined 
upon William Swetnam to instruct the children 
in the catechism and to bring them to the 
service on Sabbaths and feast days. 
Grammar and Charity Schools in England. — 
The church in England developed two distinct 
types of schools: (1) the Latin Grammar Schools _ 
(secondary—-schools), and (2)_the-Chantry—and 
Charity Schools (elementary schools). The 
only really effective schools in England at the 
time of the Reformation were the grammar

schools. When the Chantries were dissolved 
(1539) by Henry VIII, the whole of secondary 
education in England would have been swept 
away had not some of the provisions for the 
instruction of the middle classes been made by 
continuing some of the educational endowments 
which “pious founders had previously pro- 
vided.” 1 
The Curriculum of the Grammar Schools.? — 
The whole number of boys in school was divided 
into five or six ranks, the undermasters teaching 
the first three classes and the head-master the 
three upper classes. No one was admitted to 
the school who could not read readily and did 
not know by heart in the vernacular the Lord’s 
Prayer, the Angelic Salutation, the Apostles’ 
Creed, and the Ten Commandments. The 
following is an abbreviated statement of what 
the boys studied in each form or class: 
The first class. — The boys learned the rudi- 
ments of English, put together the parts of

‘EDUCATION IN ENGLAND 
speech, and were taught to turn a short phrase 
of English into Latin. 
The second class. —The boys were required 
to know the genders of nouns, the inflection 
of verbs, written in Latin. They were to 
run through Cato’s Verses, Aisop’s Fables, 
and Some Familiar Colloquies. 
The third class. — The boys were given train- 
ing in making sight varyings on the nouns and 
anomalous verbs. They were to learn Ter- 
ences Comedies and Mantuan’s Eclogues. 
The fourth class. — Here the boys took up the 
study of Latin syntax. They were practised 
in the stories of the poets and letters of learned 
men. 
The fifth class. —The boys committed to 
memory the figures of Latin oratory, and the 
rules for verse-making and polishing themes. 
They were required to translate parts of “the 
chastest poets ” and the best historians. 
The siath class. — Were the boys were in- 
structed in the formulas of the copiousness of 
words and things, written by Erasmus. They 
learned to make varyings of speech, to acquire 
13
-P-A-G-E-32
    HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
the art of speaking Latin, “‘as far as it is possi- 
ble for boys.” They were required to “taste” 
Horace, Cicero, and other authors. In addition 
to all this, they had exercises in disputation 
with one another, and also exercises in declama- 
tion. All this they had that they might be well 
learned in the “ school of argument.” 
General Summary. —It will be ’ observed 
from the foregoing brief statement concerning 
some of the types of schools in‘England at the 
time America was settled (1) that. there was a

trades ; (2) ~that funds from the general tax rate

ing, Latin, and the art of disputation. With 
these facts in mind, one is able to understand 
better the early educational activities in Vir- 
ginia.

The Early Settlers. — The London Company 
numbered among its stockholders some of the 
greatest noblemen of England. The first 
party landing on Virginia soil at Jamestown in 
1609 consisted of fifty-five gentlemen out of 
one hundred persons. Twelve of this hundred 
were servants; the rest were workmen. In the 
first supply were one hundred persons, thirty- 
three of whom were gentlemen. The rest were 
“aborers and footmen.” In the second supply 
there were seventy persons in all, twenty-eight 
of whom were gentlemen. The third supply 
was spoken of by John Smith as a “lewd 
company.” Among them were “unruly gal- 
lants, packed thither by their friends to escape 
ill destinies.” Of the five hundred persons

alive in Virginia in 1609, all but sixty had died 
by May of the following year.! 
The London Company evidently was not 
pleased with the result of the first attempt to 
establish a commercial enterprise in Virginia. 
During the following years they sought to 
encourage a different type of emigrants to settle 
in Virginia, — men who were more suited to 
the rough task of clearing away the woods, 
building huts, and planting corn. The immi- 
grant vessels were now filled with laborers, 
artisans, tradesmen, apprentices, and inden- 
tured servants.” 
In 1617, 1871 laborers came to Virginia, In 
1625 they had a system of land grants which 
provided that for every servant brought over 
by any one, one hundred acres of land would 
be given.’ This system tended to people 
Virginia with two distinct classes, a strong 
upper or gentry class and a large servant class. 
Many of these tradesmen and “ indentured ”

servants in time became powerful and _ held 
important positions in the government, and 
later became influential in the economic and 
social affairs of the colony. After the colony 
had gotten a good start, there was opportunity 
for amassing wealth in the tobacco trade and 
commerce in other commodities of Virginia. 
In 1644 there were 15,000 people in Virginia. 
In 1666 there were 40,000. In 1671 Goy- 
ernor Berkeley estimated that 1500 came an- 
nually to Virginia. Many of these were 
prisoners of war. From 1653 to 1655 hun- 
dreds of unfortunate Irishmen suffered the 
consequence of their resistance by being 
banished to the plantation.! The Scotch Re- 
bellion (1678) was the occasion of another ex- 
portation of captive soldiers to Virginia and 
elsewhere. The Scotch and the Irish, while 
prisoners of war, were sold as indentured ser- 
vants to the Virginia planters. Some of these 
were cultured persons, and in some instances 
men of means. There are many instances of 
persons of gentle blood becoming indentured

servants to lawyers and physicians in order 
to acquire a knowledge of those professions.! 
Tutors were sometimes brought over from Eng- 
land under terms of indenture. During the 
period from 1620 to 1750, about 80,000 inden- 
tured servants and redemptioners were brought 
to Virginia.? It will be understood from these 
figures that a great majority of the people 
brought to Virginia during the colonial period 
were of the lower or servant class. A conten- 
tion has arisen among some historians as to 
whether or not the Virginia aristocracy de- | 
veloped within the colony itself by the rise of 
some of this lower class into economic and social 
influence. Whatever the fact, it must be con- 
_ ceded that the Virginia planters, though few 
in number, were the ruling class for nearly two 
centuries, and were responsible for the aris- 
tocratic type of society in Virginia. 
It will be seen from the foregoing facts that 
the Virginia colonists were made up of three © 
classes of people: (1) the higher class of cul-

tured Englishmen, known as gentlemen, includ- 
ing the clergy; (2) a more or less heterogeneous 
class of merchants, tradesmen, skilled laborers, 
and cultured indentured servants; (3) the 
lower class of laborers to work in the tobacco 
fields, including the negro slaves. The second 
class became in time, as they grew economically 
independent, more powerful, and developed into 
a strong middle class in the latter part of the 
eighteenth century. The planters who came 
early developed the plantation system which is 
dependent upon a large servant class. The people 
of Virginia in the early colonial period were often 
spoken of as “‘ gentlemen, officers, and servants.” 
The Plantation System in Virginia. — The 
London Company was most interested in mak- 
ing an industrial enterprise out of the Vir- 
ginia settlement. The main purpose was to 
increase English commerce. The climate, soil, 
rivers, and creeks lent themselves readily to 
agricultural activities, especially after the com- 
mercial value of tobacco had been demon- 
strated. Many persons, after having engaged 
in mercantile business for a time, bought lands 
20
-P-A-G-E-39
  
ANTECEDENTS OF THE VIRGINIA COLONISTS 
and raised tobacco. This was the most profit- 
able pursuit in the colony, and, as lands were 
cheap and plentiful, it was a comparatively 
* easy matter to develop the industry of tobacco- 
raising to large proportions. It required many 
laborers of the unskilled type. These had to 
be provided for, and the living arrangements 
necessary for this large number of workers 
had to be considered by the planters. In 
this way the plantation system of carrying 
on agricultural activities was developed in 
Virginia. A few men, by grants or purchase, 
held large acreages, and, in time, established 
homes, having erected large mansion houses, 
and, with the income from the sales of their 
products, they were able to import to Virginia 
all the furnishings in the way of comforts and 
luxuries that might be found in the well-to-do 
English homes. It often happened that one 
man owned all the land within a radius of six 
or ten miles of his mansion house. This 
made him lord of everything within that 
territory. The numerous rivers and creeks 
were navigable far inland by sea-going vessels. 
21

HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
The planters built their houses along the rivers 
for the convenience of shipping. The various 
governors, by authority of the English sove- 
reign, made efforts to establish manufactories 
and build towns, but these efforts failed, and 
Virginia has always remained an agricultural 
and rural community. The plantation system 
prevailed, and the planters were the most 
powerful men in the colony. They, by reason 
of the vast number of workmen in connection 
with the plantation, learned to govern their 
  men, and, as a result, their power was felt, 
socially, economically, religiously, and_politi- 
cally. They were looked upon as the natural 
leaders, and they were elected to the important 
offices in the colony. All the round of arts 
and industries went on in connection with the 
plantation. The plantations were the local 
centres of population, and the planter was the 
overlord. General John Mason gives an in- 
teresting picture of plantation life: 
My father had among his slaves carpenters, tanners, 
curriers, shoemakers, spinners, weavers, knitters, and even 
a distiller. 
22
-P-A-G-E-41
  
ANTECEDENTS OF THE VIRGINIA COLONISTS 
The raw materials for these artisans were 
found on the plantation. Colonel Mason had 
five hundred persons on his estate, and is 
known to have shipped from his private 
wharf 23,000 bushels of wheat in a single 
shipment.; 
Social and Political Influence of the 
Planters. — After the first decade of struggles 
connected with the settlement at Jamestown, 
the Virginia colonists began to develop large 
agricultural enterprises. The men who first 
developed this type of life in Virginia were 
“gentlemen.” A few were of the titled 
nobility from England, and were the natural 
leaders in all important affairs of the colony. 
They brought with them from England the 
social and political customs of the mother 
country. They held the offices in the govern- 
ment of the colony, and were the social leaders 
and church officials. They were the educated 
and cultured class in the colony. They had 
immediate control of the lower class, either as 
hired workmen on their plantations or as inden- 
1 “Qld Virginia and Her Neighbors,” Fiske, Vol. I, p. 234. 
23 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
tured servants.!. In such a social system an 
aristocratic form of society will always prevail. 
This was the type of social system that 
developed in Virginia and persisted for at 
least two centuries. 
Influence of the Physical Features. — Most 
of the large plantations lay along the deep 
rivers of the tidewater country, where the 
planters had private wharfs. These rivers and 
creeks permeated the country so thoroughly 
that there was no need of the building of roads, 
for these streams were the highways of travel. 
Fiske speaks of Virginia as a “ sylvan Venice.” 
One receives the impression in reading of colonial 
Virginia that all the world lived in country houses on 
the borders of rivers.” 
Hugh Jones wrote (1724): 
No country is better watered, for the convenience 
of which most houses are built near some landing place 
so that anything may be delivered to a gentleman there 
from London, Bristol, etc., with less trouble and cost 
than to one living five miles in the country in England; 
1 The term of indenture was from four to seven years, but this term 
might be prolonged indefinitely by reason of offences committed. “Old 
Virginia and Her Neighbors,” Fiske, Vol. II, p. 177.

for you pay no freight from London and but little from 
Bristol; only the party to whom the goods belong is in 
gratitude engaged to ship tobacco upon the ship to her 
owners in England. 
There were no towns in the colony of any great 
size. Jamestown was a mere village; Hampton, 
Norfolk, Williamsburg, and Richmond were very 
small towns in 1700. This state of affairs made 
necessary the system of plantation manufacture. 
Summary. — The first leading settlers of Vir- 
ginia were largely gentlemen. They brought 
with them to the wilderness in Virginia the 
traditions, customs, and ideals of Englishmen 
in the mother country. They engaged in the 
cultivation of corn and tobacco. The latter 
soon became the most valuable commercial 
product, the raising of which required a 
great army of unskilled laborers. The large 
profits realized from the tobacco industry, 
both to the Virginia planter and the English 
merchant, stimulated the interest in the im- 
portation of slaves and other kinds of inden- 
tured servants and redemptioners. Even the 
skilled workmen and merchants who came to 
25  
-P-A-G-E-44
ee eee neat oc nee en ang 
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
carry on trades and mercantile business were 
encouraged to give up their lines of work 
and engage in raising tobacco. Thus there 
developed the plantation system by which 
large acreages were owned and operated by a 
single planter, who, in this way, grew economi- 
cally, socially, and politically powerful, and not 
only managed his large estate with hundreds 
of workmen, but held in his control the affairs 
  of the colonial government. These are some 
of the factors that made possible, if not impera- 
tive, for the time, at least, the highly aristo- 
cratic form of society in Virginia. Roughly 
speaking, there were two classes of people 
making up the population in Virginia: (1) 
the rich planters who were comparatively few 
in number, and (2) the various classes of 
laborers or servants. There was no / strong 
middle class for nearly two centuries. The 
planters, or upper class, naturally were in- 
terested only in an educational system that 
affected their own children, and hence intro- 
duced the tutorial system, to which they were 
accustomed in England.

institutions to America. During the first half 
hike wovenicouth century Virginia settlers 
set up the same institutions, social, political, 
ecclesiastical, and educational, to which they 
were accustomed in the mother country. This 
transplanting process was more truly carried 
out in Virginia than in the other colonies in 
America: (1) because of the distinctive English 
type of the settlers ; (2) because of the definitely 
commercial purpose of the colony; and (8) be- 
cause of the religious, political, and social ideals 
of the people who came to settle in Virginia.

the New England settlements, where whole 
families came over to make their permanent 
homes in the new world. 
Orphans Sent to Virginia. — The early educa- 
tional interest among the people of Virginia con- 
cerned itself with orphan children that were sent 
over from the hospitals and asy asylums in England. 
The famous Poor Laws and 1 Apprenticeship 
Laws of England attempted to care for these 
children. The English colonies in the different 
parts of the world furnished a refuge for a 
great number of these children from England. 
Virginia received her quota of these orphans. 
In 1619 provision was made for one hundred 
children to be sent to the Virginia colony. 
They came from London, and five hundred 
pounds was sent for their apprenticeship among 
the colonists, the only stipulation being that 
they should be taught “some good trade” 
by their masters. It must have been a very   satisfactory arrangement, for in 1620 the colony 
requested more children. 
Apprenticeship Law of 1643. — In 1643 we 
have the first general legislation regarding the 
28

care of these orphans. The law provides that 
these children be brought up in the “ Christian 
religion” and in the “rudiments of learning 
according to their estates.” The law says: 
The guardians and overseers of all orphants shall care- 
fully keep and preserve such estates as shall be com- 
mitted to their trusts either by order of court or other- 
wise. And shall likewise render an exact accompt once 
everie year to the commissioners of the several county 
courts, respectively, of the said estates and of the in- 
crease and improvement, who are hereby to keep an exact 
register thereof. And all overseers and guardians of such 
orphants are enjoyned by authority aforesaid to educate 
and instruct them according to their best endeavors in 
Christian religion and in the rudiments of learning and to 
provide for their necessaries according to the competents 
of their estate.! 
It will be noticed that this legislative provi- 
sion called for a type of industrial training in 
‘ some of the trades and for the “ rudiments of 
learning,” which most likely meant reading 
and writing. It will be noted also that the 
authority for this training was vested in the 
civil power (County Courts), but it is most 
likely that the church provided the teaching

force so far as the “rudiments of learning ” 
were concerned, and, in addition, exercised a 
supervisory power over this education. 
Apprenticeship Law of 1646.— This act of 
1646 is more specific. It provides that the chil- 
dren shall be brought up in good breeding (learn- 
ing) and in good and lawful trades. This act 
contains the interesting description of the school 
building required and is the first account of 
this sort of workhouse school in America. It 
was to be a school for teaching trades. Because 
of its unique provisions the act is quoted in 
full. 
Commissioners of the several counties shall make 
choice of two children, male or female, eight or seven 
years at least, to be sent to James City (Jamestown) to 
be employed in the public flax factory work under such 
master and masters as shall thus be appointed, in card- 
ing, knitting, spinning, and so on, and that said children 
shall be furnished from the counties with six barrels of 
corn, two coverlids, one rugg, one blanket, one bed, one 
wooden bowl or tray, two pewter spoons, a sow shote of 
six months, and two laying hens, convenient apparel, both 
linen and woolen, with hose and shoes. That there be 
two houses built by the first of April next, forty feet long 
apeace with good substantial timber. The houses to be 
twenty feet broad apeace, eight foot high in the pitche,

and a stack of brick chimney standing in the midst of ~ - 
each house, and that they be lofted with sawne boards 
and made with convenient partitions, commissioners have 
caution not to take up children from such parents who 
by reason of their poverty are disable to maintain and 
educate them. That the governor hath agreed with the 
Assembly for the sum of ten thousand pounds of to-bo 
to be paid him the next crop to build said houses.! 
It is not certain that this plan for an indus- 
trial school at Jamestown was ever put into 
actual operation, but there is definite evidence 
that there were attempts to establish such 
schools in some of the counties about the   middle of the seventeenth century. We have 
direct evidence that this plan for industrial 
training was carried out in some of the schools 
of secondary grade at this time. The presence 
of these general laws indicates at least that 
there was a well-defined sentiment for education 
among the colonists. The documentary evi- 
dence for the execution of these laws is to be 
found only in the proceedings of the ‘‘ Orphans’ 
Courts” in the various counties in Virginia, 
and in the parish proceedings of the church

wardens. There is a general statute which 
” provides that the ‘‘ County Courts ” shall give 
at least one sitting every year for the exclusive 
purpose of adjusting matters relating to orphans 
in their respective counties. These county 
records must have contained orders concerning 
these individual cases, and in nearly all of the 
executions the master was to see to it that these 
children were taught a trade and to “read, 
write, and cipher.” Many times the order 
contained the stipulation that they were to be 
trained in the Christian religion. There are 
provisions in the laws that if an orphan’s estate 
is not sufficient to give him a “ free” (liberal) 
education, he shall be apprenticed to work; 
also that the courts shall see to it that the or- 
phans are taught trades and the “ rudiments of 
learning.” 
Apprenticeship Law of 1672.— The act of   1672 contains substantially the same provision 
that we find in the Apprenticeship and Poor 
Laws of England. It says: 
That the justices of the peace in every county doe put 
the laws of England against vagrants, idlers, and disso-

lute persons, in strict execution, and the respective 
county courts shall and are hereby empowered and 
authorized to place out all the children whose parents are 
not able to bring them up apprentices to tradesmen, 
the males till one and twenty years of age and the fe- 
males to other necessary employment till eighteen years 
of age and no longer, and the church wardens of every 
parish shall [be] strictly enjoyned by the courts to give 
them an account at their Orphans Courts of all such 
children within their parish." 
Other general laws (1705) provide that masters 
shall_be_compelled_to_teach orphans to—‘read 
and write.’ This is the first legislative pro- 
vision requiring reading and writing to be 
taught.? 
The law of 1748 provides that “ any persons 
adjudged by the County Court incapable of 
supporting and bringing up their children in 
honest courses or to take due care of the educa- 
tion of their children and their instruction in 
the principles of Christianity in any such cases 
it shall be lawful for the wardens of the church 
parish where such children inhabit by order of 
their court to bind each child apprentice in the

same manner as the law directs for poor orphan 
children.” ! 
This last act provides for the compulsory 
apprenticing of many of the children, and in its 
intent is a sort of compulsory education law, 
thereby insuring elementary training for all 
the poor children, first, in some good trade, 
and next, in reading, writing, and in the cate- 
chism. However, there is no available evidence 
that these laws were rigidly enforced. 
Summary of these Apprenticeship Laws. — We 
have thus far seen how the makers of the general 
laws of Virginia in the early history of the colony 
looked upon the necessity of elementary educa- 
tion of those children (1) who were sent from 
England to live in the colony of Virginia and 
ultimately to become a part of its social fabric; 
(2) those children whose parents were incapable 
of supporting and caring for the education of 
their children; and (3) all children and idle 
persons who seemed to have no guardian care. 
While these general apprenticeship laws were 
not really educational laws, they nevertheless 
1 Hening, Vol. VI, p. 32. 
34
-P-A-G-E-53
  
THE RISE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
contained the necessary provision for the educa- 
“tion of a large class of children in Virginia. It 
was a scheme by which the highest authorities, 
civil and religious, in the colony attempted to 
provide training for the children along industrial, 
religious, and educational lines. Of course, this 
scheme provided only for the poor children. 
Early Types of Virginia Schools. — There 
was a great number of children in the colony 
who did not fall under these general laws. These 
were the children of parents who were more 
fortunately situated from an economic stand- 
point, and were therefore able to look after the 
training of their own children. For the facts 
concerning the education of these children, we 
shall have to examine a different source of evi- 
dence. It should be stated here that there 
were throughout the colony in the latter part of 
the seventeenth century many different types of 
schools,! and the masters of apprenticed children 
often took advantage of fulfilling their obliga- 
1 In Surrey County alone there were fifty instances between 1679 and 
1684 where bonds were given by guardians stating that wards should be 
taught in schools. 
35 
   
-P-A-G-E-54
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
tions to the courts by sending their wards to 
these schools. Otherwise, the master himself 
or some member of his family taught the chil- 
dren the “rudiments of learning” or he may 
have been put to the necessity of employing a 
teacher for these orphan children. 
During the seventeenth and part of the eigh- 
teenth century there developed among the 
Virginian colonists various types of schools pro- 
viding for the education of the children in the 
elementary school branches: (1) The-grammar 
school, which, in addition to the higher branches 
taught, gave instruction in the elementary sub- 
jects of “reading, writing, and ciphering”’; 
(2) an endowed free school, whose primary 
purpose was to give training in the elementary 
forms of learning; (3) a com ity school, 
later~known as the private school, where the 
heads of various families living in the same\neigh- 
  borhood combined in the employing of a teacher 
for their children; (4) the tutorial system, a 
method the rich planter used in providing in- 
struction for his children and sometimes, in 
addition, for the children of his neighbor.

THE RISE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
Governor Berkeley's Famous Words. — 
Governor Berkeley’s famous words in 1671, “I 
thank God that there are no free schools in 
Virginia,” are not to be taken as having very 
much foundation in fact. In another part of 
the report to the English Commissioners re- 
garding “ schools in Virginia ” he states that the 
schools are conducted very much as they are in 
England. Those who are able educate their 
children by tutors in their homes, and the poor, 
by the apprentice system.1_ When he answered 
these questions, he was within a day’s ride from 
the Symms and Eaton schools, which were in a 
flourishing condition. Eleven years before he 
had shown extraordinary activity in efforts 
to secure a school in the colony which was to 
partake of the joint character of a college and 
free school. He really had subscribed an 
amount of money to this enterprise. It is 
quite certain that there were a number of free 
schools in Virginia at the time the famous 
governor sent this report to England. 
Grammar Schools.— The term grammar 
1 “Tnstitutional History of Virginia,” Bruce, Vol. I, p. 360. 
37
-P-A-G-E-56
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
school usually means an institution of secondary 
or college grade where the classical languages 
and perhaps mathematics are taught. But in 
Virginia, as well as in England, they often com- 
bine the primary instruction with the higher. 
The teaching force of these schools usually con- 
sisted of a master and an usher. The latter 
was an assistant to the former, and was usually 
assigned the instruction in the primary branches. 
The best known examples of this type of school 
in Virginia are the Symms and the Eaton schools 
in Elizabeth City County. These were known 
as free schools and were endowed by philan- 
thropic individuals of wealth. In England this 
type of school was often known as a “ charity 
school.” The Eaton School in Virginia is 
often referred to in the records as “ Eaton’s 
Charity School.” Eaton himself had been 
educated in one of these Latin Grammar 
Schools of England. There seems to be 
some confusion regarding the word “free” 
in connection with schools of this time, both 
in England and in America. { A “free” 
school in some cases means a school where a 
38
-P-A-G-E-57
  
THE RISE OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS 
“liberal? education may be had. This is 
evidently the meaning in connection with some 
of the schools in America in the seventeenth 
century. The other meaning of the word 
“ free” is the usual or ordinary use of the word. 
It meant a school at which there were no fees 
for tuition, and in some instances no cost for 
board or clothing. It was an endowed “ free 
school.” There were many attempts to es- 
tablish such schools in the seventeenth century. 
Some of these failed because of various unfore- 
seen disasters, which, in some _ instances, 
threatened the very life and existence of the 
colony.! The facts, however, are interesting 
in the educational history of Virginia, because

colonists to provide educational advantages 
for their children as good as the early colonists 
had enjoyed in England before coming to |

  CHAPTER IV 
EARLY ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH FREE SCHOOLS 
IN VIRGINIA 
In the mother country some of the most 
useful of the smaller institutions of learning 
had been founded by philanthropic individuals, 
and from generation to generation had enabled 
the English youth to acquire at least a primary 
education. Among the early immigrants to 
Virginia, there were some who were animated 
by the same fine philanthropic spirit as those 
persons who had endowed these institutions 
of learning in England. “Had the colony’s 
different communities been as thickly inhabited 
as the English, which would have assured the 
success of a free school, with far more certainty 
than the sparsity of population, there is reason 
to think that the number of endowed grammar 
foundations would have been as great in Vir- 
ginia as in England.” !

ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH FREE SCHOOLS 
The First Plan for a Free School in Vir- 
ginia.— The first plan for a free school in 
Virginia was designed for the education of the 
Indian youth. This was in 1619-20 while the 
London Company still had control of the 
colony. Some one who did not reveal his name 
gave the munificent sum of nearly $14,000 
in gold, with the direction that the money 
should be used in instructing a “ convenient 
number of Indian youth in the art of reading ” 
and in the principles of the Christian religion. 
The donor further stipulates that this instruc- 
tion should be given to the Indian children 
from the ages of seven to twelve, and after that, 
to the age of twenty-one, they were to be 
carefully trained in some useful handicraft. 
Provision was also made for some of the money 
to be used by two “ trust-worthy persons ” 
who should have oversight of this work and 
report to the treasurer of the London Company 
quarterly an account of the execution of the 
purposes of the fund, together with a list of 
the names of the pupils receiving instruction. 
After several attempts to use the money in 
41 
   
-P-A-G-E-60
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
the way indicated in Southampton Hundred 
and Martin’s Hundred, the company finally 
invested the entire sum in the erection of iron 
works from whose profits thirty Indian children 
were to be educated. The great Indian 
massacre of 1622 seems to have brought to an 
untimely end both the laudable scheme of 
education for the Indian youth and the iron 
works.! 
The Second Attempt to Establish a Free 
School. — The second attempt to establish a 
free school was intended for the white children 
of the colony. This was to be known as the 
“* East India School.” The plan had its origin 
in a collection taken among the passengers of 
the Royal James, a ship returning from the 
Indies. The ship’s chaplain, Rev. Mr. Cope- 
land, at whose suggestion the money was con- 
tributed, was made rector of the school. In 
1622 steps were taken to build a house, and a 
Mr. Dike of England was appointed master, 
with the understanding that he was to secure

an assistant who was a good writer to give 
“instruction in arithmetic.” The school was 
to be located at Charles City. Teachers were 
to be engaged for five years. The London 
Company was to supply them with the neces- 
sary books, and in addition to the salary of 
Mr. Dike, he was to receive a patent of one 
hundred acres of land, and at the end of his 
term, an additional five hundred acres. These 
instructors were to obtain a certificate to teach 
from the governor of the colony. This scheme 
of education seems to have shared the same 
fate of other like enterprises, and was brought 
to a premature end by the great catastrophe 
of 1622. Whatever became of these founda- 
tions after the revival of the colony from the 
Indian massacre is yet to be found out; for 
we hear nothing’ more of these early efforts to 
provide primary education for the children of 
Virginia. 
We shall now turn our attention to some 
more substantial efforts on the part of the 
colonists to provide educational facilities in 
Virginia. 
43
-P-A-G-E-62
    HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
The Symms Free School. — Bearing date of 
1634, the will of Benjamin Symms bequeaths 
the foundation for a free school in Virginia. 
This was the earliest provision for effective 
free education in America and precedes by at 
least two years the famous gift of John Harvard 
to the college in Massachusetts. Symms gave 
for the establishment of the free school two 
hundred acres of land, the proceeds from the 
sale of milk, and the increase of eight cows. 
This school was to be located in Elizabeth 
City County and to afford free education for 
the children living within the bounds of that 
county. This school was soon put into actual 
operation, for in March, 1643, the General 
Assembly takes occasion to pass a special act in 
which it recognizes the “godly disposition and 
good intent”’ of the benefactor and expresses 
a determination to carry out his wishes to the 
letter. In 1647 the school seemed to be work- 
ing on a firm foundation with a complete house 
for the purpose. In 1694 Robert Crooke 
makes known his desire to resign as master of 
the school at the next “fall of the leaf,” and 
44
-P-A-G-E-63
  
ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH FREE SCHOOLS 
Samuel Snignell petitioned the County Court 
to appoint him master. In 1647 the herd of 
cows had increased five times, and, with careful 
husbanding of this increase, would have, in 
time, provided ample foundation for running 
the school through the succeeding generations. 
So far as can be learned, this school was in con- 
tinuous session through the seventeenth and 
eighteenth centuries. 
The Eaton Free School. — There soon fol- 
lowed another example of the Symms gift. 
Dr. Thomas Eaton gave for the establishment 
of a free school five hundred acres of land 
stocked with “‘ two negroes, twelve cows, two 
bulls, and twenty hogs.” The estate must 
have been under a high degree of cultivation, 
and therefore of considerable value, for the 
bequest included a lot of household furniture. 
This school was located somewhere in Elizabeth 
City County and was designed to give training 
to the children residing within its bounds. The 
school was to be under the management of a 
Board of Trustees, composed of the clergymen, 
the church wardens of the parish, and the 
45 
 
-P-A-G-E-64
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
justices of the County Court. This body 
appointed a master who served as the active 
manager of the bequest. In 1691 Ebenezer 
Taylor was serving in this capacity, and seems 
to have been responsible for the care of all the 
stock ; for a court order of that time requires 
that he provide clothing for an old slave be- 
longing to the estate. In 1697 George Eland 
was master of the school. 
The Symms and the Eaton Free schools 
were permanent institutions and served as 
models for other sections of the colony.! It is 
quite certain that there were a good many 
schools of this type throughout Virginia at 
the beginning of the eighteenth century. As 
early as 1652 Hugh Lee gave orders for the 
establishment of a free school in Northumber- 
land County. | John Moon, in 1655, Isle of 
Wight County, made provision in his will for 
the education of orphan children in a free 
school already founded. Richard Russell, in 
1 These schools were united in 1805 as Hampton Academy. In 1852 
the fund amounted to $10,000, and it is preserved as a separate fund from 
the public school fund. A portion of this was used in 1902 in the erection 
of the Symms-Eaton school building in Hampton. 
46

1666, lower Norfolk, provided means for the 
education of poor children at a school then 
in operation. Mr. King, 1668, bequeathed one 
hundred acres of land for the purpose of estab- 
lishing a free school. Henry Peasley, 1675, 
provided for the endowment of a free school in 
Gloucester County, giving six hundred acres, 
ten cows, and one breeding mare. Francis 
Pritchard, the same year, Lancaster County, 
left a large estate for the establishment of a 
free school. William Gordon, 1685, Middlesex 
County, gave one hundred acres for the estab- 
lishment of a free school. 
There are large tracts of land, houses, and other things 
granted to free schools for the education of children in 
many parts of the country, and some of these are so 
large that of themselves they are a handsome main- 
tenance to a master; but the additional allowance which 
gentlemen give with their sons render them a comfortable 
subsistence. These schools have been founded by the 
legacies of well-inclined gentlemen, and the management 
of them hath commonly been left to the direction of the 
county court, or the vestry of their respective parishes.! 
We should like to take a look into one of 
these schools to find out what they taught and 
1 Beverley’s “History of Virginia,” p. 224. 
47 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
how they taught, but there is little available 
evidence as to these facts.! It is certain, 
however, that the master was required to teach 
English grammar in the Eaton School, which 
no doubt carried with it instruction in Latin 
as a part of the course. It is very certain 
also that the primary subjects, such as reading 
and writing, were among the subjects taught. 
It ought to be observed here that the con- 
trolling authority of these free schools was 
vested in a combined ecclesiastical and politi- 
cal body. This was the type of control that 
characterized the Virginia schools in the seven- 
teenth and far into the eighteenth century. In 
1619 we learn that the County Courts in Vir- 
ginia were required to return to the council 
office at Jamestown a list of all the schools 
situated in its own jurisdiction and also a 
statement as to whether the persons filling the 
position of teacher had obtained licenses or not. 
Community Schools.— Another type of 
school developed in Virginia was the com- 
munity school, more commonly known at a 
1 Many of the county records during the vicissitudes of war were burned. 
48
-P-A-G-E-67
  ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH FREE SCHOOLS 
later time as the “ Old Field School.” “ Per- 
haps the greatest proportion of the children 
who during the seventeenth century received 
an education obtained it in what became 
known as the Old Field School.’’! These com- 
munity schools were the outcome of a spirit 
of codperation among neighbors for the pur- 
pose of education. Such a school was estab- 
lished in some spot convenient to every boy 
and girl in the whole neighborhood. The 
building was constructed by the members of 
the community in some abandoned field or 
lone spot. During the hours school was not 
in session it remained locked and vacant. The 
leading members of the community employed 
a teacher at a stipulated sum or fee for each 
pupil. The sessions were usually held in the 
summer months from April to September. The 
authority for the establishment and control 
of such a school was wholly in the hands of 
the local community, and the church or state 
had no other connection than that of granting 
certificates to teachers.

HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
It should be remembered, however, that 
many times the teacher was the regular clergy- 
man of the parish or community, and in this 
instance the school was usually held at the 
parish house. This seems to have been the 
custom of the clergymen as a means of adding 
to their income over and above that of their 
regular salary. “There could hardly in those 
times have been found outside of the great 
seats of learning a class more competent to   teach than these early Virginia clergymen.” ! 
These men had been educated in the best 
English schools, and it is quite natural that 
the colonists should look to them as the most 
capable for bringing up their children in learn- 
ing. The church “readers,” in the absence 
of the regular clergyman, often performed the 
duties of teacher in these schools. The sparsely 
settled sections of some parts of the state 
combined the office of “ reader ” and “ teacher.” 
This plan seems to have appealed to the House 
of Burgesses, for in a recommendation to the 
governor they requested that he license cer-

: 50

tain “readers ”’ to teach in the more remote 
sections.' 
We have noticed before that the teachers of 
these schools were required to hold licenses 
either from the Bishop of London, in whose 
diocese Virginia was included, or from the 
governor of the colony. There seems to have 
been a very strict adherence to the rule of re- 
quiring teachers in Virginia to obtain licenses 
from one of these authorities. Sometimes the 
magistrates or the wardens of the parish would 
recommend to the governor persons suitable 
to teach; so it must have been the first step of 
a teacher toward opening a school to petition 
the County Court to obtain for him the neces- 
sary license from the governor. In this way, 
the justices practically decided who should be 
allowed to teach in the schools. Indeed, the 
granting of licenses was purely a formal act 
  on the part of the governor, and the fee was 
only a few pounds of tobacco, except in a few 
cases where the governor took this as an 
opportunity to swell his revenue by exacting 
1 “Institutional History of Virginia,” Bruce, Vol. I, pp. 332-35. 
51
-P-A-G-E-70
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
a larger fee.1 Some of the County Courts 
offered inducements to draw  school-teachers 
within their counties by exempting them from 
paying of taxes for a period of time.? 
In the records of the settlements of estates 
there are many entries of sums due school- 
masters which give interesting information as 
to the source of the salary of such officials. 
The fee is very often spoken of in terms of 
tobacco, but the usual annual fee amounted 
in our currency to about twenty-five dollars 
a pupil. In 1691 the General Assembly refused 
to adopt a proposition that the schoolmaster’s 
salary be determined by law.’ 
Again we have no definite documentary evi- 
dence as to what was taught in these schools. 
It is safe to say, however, from more or less in- 
direct sources, that the usual primary subjects, 
such as reading, writing, and the “casting of 
accounts,” which was another name for arith- 
metic, made up the curriculum for these schools. 
1 Governor Howard was accused of this practice (1682-95). 
* Henrico Justices exempted Mr. Nathaniel Hall in 1686. This was by no means an uncommon practice in the Virginia counties.

There are a number of records, particularly 
among deeds of transfer, that indicate that 
these Virginia schoolmasters accumulated 
enough money to purchase considerable es- 
tates. This may not mean very much in view 
of the fact that land was very cheap at that 
time.! 
Private Tutors. — One of the most effective 
forms of instruction in England was the tutorial 
system. The families of the upper classes in 
the mother country always employed a tutor 
for their children. Some of the most noted 
educators of England served in this capacity. 
The well-to-do planters in Virginia selected 
this plan for the education of their children. 
The plantation system and the absence of 
towns in Virginia made this method of instruc- 
tion the most satisfactory. The effort to 
build cities in the colony of Virginia in 1680 
had as one of its good results the encourage- 
ment of better educational facilities in the 
colony. The plantation was a complete com- 
munity in itself, having grouped together a

-P-A-G-E-72
    HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
great number of people. There were carpenters, 
blacksmiths, laborers for the tobacco fields, 
and, in fact, artisans of all the handicrafts. 
The teacher was one of these necessary indi- 
viduals in such a concentrated community. 
The rich planter employed a tutor from 
among the young men who were candidates 
for Orders,| and from many arrivals from 
England or Scotland. Often these teachers 
G were from among the class known as “ inden- 
tured servants,” and included many cultured 
Scotchmen who took this opportunity of get- 
ting away from unwholesome social and political 
conditions in England.? These private tutors 
1 Out of forty ministers answering the Bishop of London’s,inquiry 
(1723) as to schools in Virginia nearly all answered “None.” A few 
referred to “charity schools.” Private tutors at rich gentlemen’s houses 
gave all the means of education and the poor had no access to them. 
See Bishop Meade’s “Old Churches and Families,” Vol. I, p. 190. 
? Hugh Jones, in his “Present State of Virginia,” p. 28, says: “The 
assured good Report of this vast tract of land and happy Climate en- 
couraged Several Gentlemen of condition and good Descent to transport 
themselves and Families and settle in this new Paradise; some, for the 
Sake of Wealth, some for Religion, and others because they could not well 
live elsewhere; and others because they dared not, or cared not to stay 
at Home. One particular occasion that sent several families of good 
Birth and Fortune to settle there was the Civil Wars in England. This 
safe Receptacle enticed over several Cavalier Families where they made

very often carried their pupils into the rudi- 
ments of higher. learning which served as 
preparation for admission into the grammar 
schools either in Virginia or in the mother 
country. Many of the rich planters, from the 
earliest days of the colony, sent their children 
to England after a period of tutorage at home. 
This must have been the custom long before 
William and Mary College was founded? 
These tutors taught the girls of the family as 
many laws against Puritans though they were free from them which had 
this good Success that to this day (1724) the people are as it were quite 
free from them being all of the Church of England, without the odious 
distinguishing characters of High and Low among themselves.”

Fairfaxes, and Dawsons are some names of Virginia families who had sons 
matriculated at Oxford and other schools about the close of the seven- 
teenth and the beginning of the eighteenth century. See William and 
Mary Quarterly, Vol. II, p. 172.

and able masters. Drawing, music and dancing are extra charges.”

well as the boys, but the instruction beyond 
the rudiments of reading and writing took a 
little different course with the girls. However, 
there are a number of instances in the first 
part of the eighteenth century where the girls 
must have had the classical training to a very 
considerable extent, for we know that some of 
the noted men in the colony received their 
preparation in the classics for entrance to Wil- 
liam and Mary College from their mothers.’ 
The girls’ training was more often directed 
into the field of literature with lessons in elo- 
cution and English grammar. After the 
beginning of the eighteenth century, we find 
many instances of the planters employing ladies 
as tutors. This was the beginning of the pres- 
ent custom in Virginia of employing governesses 
in families. This kind of school is probably 
the nearest approach in Virginia to the Dame 
Schools of New England. 
This tutorial system of instruction, so popu- 
lar in England, seems to have been held in

ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH FREE SCHOOLS 
the same high esteem in Virginia, particularly 
among the planters. 
A tutor was engaged under contract to be 
furnished “meat, drink, lodging, and wash- 
ing,” and sometimes it was stipulated that he 
should have a few acres free of rent upon 
which to plant tobacco and vegetables. In 
addition to this he was to receive a stipulated 
fee which usually amounted to about twenty- 
five dollars a year for furnishing tuition to the 
children of the family. When the planter’s 
family was large, the schoolhouse was always 
found in the group of plantation buildings. 
In order that the tutor might add to his 
usually meagre income, he was permitted to 
have as pupils the sons and daughters from 
neighboring families, the daughters usually 
boarding at the planter’s home during the 
time the school was in session. 
The school day was divided into three 
periods: (1) from six to eight, after which a 
recess was given for breakfast; (2) from nine 
to twelve, when they had lunch; (3) from three 
to six, when school was out for the day. It is 
57

interesting to note that it was the custom in 
the seventeenth century and far into the 
eighteenth for the schools to be in session from 
        April to September instead of during the winter 
months as at present. 
- . Summary. — From the statement of the fore- 
egoing facts regarding the early elementary 
( education in Virginia, it will be observed: (1) 
‘ that the general laws providing for the training 
of the children were in the nature of apprentice- 
ship regulations containing provisions for the 
  training of the children in reading, writing, the 
catechism, and in the art of some trade, these 
laws referring exclusively to orphans and poor 
children of the colony; (2) that, by the philan- 
thropic spirit of some men of wealth in the 
colony, free schools were endowed at which 
poor children of many parishes received their 
elementary training; (3) that community 
schools were organized and set up by a co- 
operative spirit among the families of the 
planters and merchants, who, agreeing upon a 
teacher, paid a fee for the tuition of their 
children; (4) that the leading planters and 
58 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
  ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH FREE SCHOOLS 
most wealthy men of the colonies depended 
almost wholly for the education of their chil- 
dren, in the elementary branches at least, nee 
a tutor employed by the family. 
The first two types of these schools provided 
training in reading, writing, the catechism, and 
the art of some trade. The last two concerned 
themselves with the instruction of the rudi- 
ments of learning, as reading, writing, and the 
“casting of accounts,” and in some instances 
instruction in the beginnings of Latin, Greek, 
and, in rare instances, French. 
The support and control of these schools 
were vested in the combined authority of 
church and state; the state appointed trustees 
for the direct control of the endowed free 
schools and to it was given the authority to 
license teachers. The church, in many in- 
stances, furnished the teaching force, and 
often in conjunction with the civil authorities 
exercised the right of supervision over these 
schools. | 
The community schools were independent of 
public or church support and were maintained 
» 59 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
by fees determined upon by teacher and parent. 
The family school, conducted by tutors, was 
still more independent of church or civil con- 
trol! There was no attempt even to license 
the tutors. The employing of a tutor was 
an entirely individual matter and rested wholly 
with the planter. 
There was but little system or order in the 
educational activities in the early history of 
Virginia, particularly in regard to elementary 
instruction. It was laissez faire in its nature. 
Educational legislation in Virginia concerns 
itself mainly with (1) the organization of a 
college or university, (2) individual schools 
of secondary grade, and (3) apprenticeship 
education for the poor. 
During the first half of the eighteenth cen- 
tury the types of schools in Virginia were 
similar to those which had been developed in 
the seventeenth century, consisting of private 
tutors or governesses for the wealthy class; 
1 These schools were supported by tuition fees and were not dependent 
upon any authority other than the good sense of the parent and pupils.

the community or Old Field schools for the 
middle class; and the grammar schools for 
secondary training, which continued through- 
out this century and on into the nineteenth 
century. There was no attempt to work out 
a state system of education until Jefferson’s 
plan of 1779.

  CHAPTER V 
HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA DURING THE 
SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES 
Early Attempt at Founding a College. — The 
London Company during the entire time it had 
control in Virginia concerned itself at various 
times with the establishment of a college. 
Not many years after the first settlement in| 
Virginia the colonists attempted to establish a 
college designed for the education of Indian 
youth in the Christian faith, but it was also in- 
tended to furnish the planters’ children with an 
opportunity to obtain advanced instruction. 
The people in England, ever since the discovery 
of America, had expressed great interest in the 
religious welfare of the Indians, and the educa- 
tional institutions planned for the early colo- 
nists always took into, consideration the educa- 
tion of the Indians. 
The first real effort to establish a college in 
Virginia was the sending of a letter by James I 
62
-P-A-G-E-81
  
HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
to all parts of his kingdom, asking for contribu- 
tions for the establishment of a college in Vir- 
ginia. At a meeting of the general court at 
Jamestown in 1619 announcement was made 
by the officers of the London Company that the 
amount of $35,000 in gifts and money had been 
contributed for this purpose. Something over 
$4000 of this was in actual money. It was 
thought unwise at this time to use any of the 
money in erecting buildings. Large acreages 
were set aside for the support of the college at 
Henrico on the James River. A grant of 10,000 
acres lying on the north and the south sides of 
the James River was turned over by the London 
Company as part of the endowment of the col- 
lege. It was suggested that fifty tenants be 
brought over from England and settled upon 
these lands for the purpose of putting them in a 
state of tillage. One-half of the income from 
these tenants was to be used in putting the col- 
lege on its feet and maintaining instructors. 
The fundamental orders of the company in 
1619 required that a commission of five or seven 
persons be appointed annually to have charge of 
63
-P-A-G-E-82
NE ee Le ere SAP ee ANE Oy eh em Te en re ene ee 
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
| the building and the management of the college. 
The treasurer of the London Company was 
ordered to keep a separate account of these 
funds, and he was authorized to solicit subscrip- 
tions among the colonists for this purpose. 
Benevolent persons in England contributed 
money and gifts, a number of them withholding 
their names. Some gave “ faire plate and other 
rich ornaments.” Some gave a communion 
table for the chapel; — still others, books, 
among which were some rare translations of 
St. Augustine and the writings of Dr. Perkins, 
a distinguished clergyman of strong Calvinistic 
inclination. 
  According to the general plan the income for 
the support of the college was: (1) the pro- 
ceeds from the tenants; (2) amounts received 
for the support of pupils from scholarships and 
fellowships offered by the East India school; 
(3) interest accruing from the general college 
fund; (4) tuition fees from the planters. This 
was an endowment, ample and sufficient at that 
time, for the conduct of a higher institution of 
learning.

In 1620 George Thorpe, an Englishman, was 
appointed to take charge of the college. He 
was a member of the king’s Privy Council and _ 
had a reputation for “ being learned in scholar- 
ship and zealous in piety,” and for his general 
support they gave three hundred acres of land, 
together with ten tenants, the income from whose 
work was to be the basis of his salary at first. 
Some time before, a number of mechanics had 
been sent out to erect the buildings. A contract 
was let for the bricks to be used in the main 
structure, and when all seemed to be going well 
and giving happy promise of the early useful- 
ness of the college, the Indian plot of 1622 
brought all this good work to a sudden close. 
It is known that seventeen persons, at least, 
on the college land lost their lives in that catas- 
trophe. Thorpe himself, in spite of his extraor- 
dinary zeal and interest in the welfare of the 
Indians, and particularly in their conversion, 
was not saved from the fatal stroke of the 
tomahawk. 
This Indian episode thoroughly disorganized 
the plans for further work on the college, but 
F 65

the company refused to yield to a’ feeling of 
discouragement. Thirteen months after the 
massacre took place there were still attached 
to the college lands numerous persons who had 
survived the Indian assault. The company 
seems to have given strict instructions to the re- 
maining tenants to erect substantial buildings, 
lay off gardens, plant orchards, and, in addition 
to working six days for the public benefit, to 
give annually to the public store one pound of 
silk, twenty bushels of corn, and sixty pounds 
of tobacco. The company ordered the gov- 
ernor and council to see that the bricklayers 
engaged by Thorpe be compelled to go on and 
carry out their contract. ‘The work, by the 
assistance of God, shall again proceed,” the 
company proudly declared. But in the midst 
of all these hopeful signs of carrying the project 
to a successful issue there came a greater catas- 
trophe, which destroyed for all time the plans for 
the erection of a college at Henrico. This was 
the revocation of the charter of the London 
Company in 1624. “The original plan of 
making the education of the Indians its primary 
66

object would have been rejected altogether 
in consequence of the massacre, and the insti- 
tution would have stood as the earliest of all 
the seats of learning established on the Ameri- 
can continent for the benefit of the trans- 
planted English... . Virginia, in such an 
institution, would have possessed a foundation 
that would have been clothed with the deeply 
romantic interest thrown around the colleges 
of the old world by the beautifying touch of 
time and by the glorious achievements of their 
sons on every stage of action through a succes- 
sion of centuries.” + 
The college itself soon became a mere name, 
and the latest reference to it in the old records 
was in 1666, when one of the tracts belonging 
to the college was referred to as the college 
plantation. 
Another Attempt to Establish a College. —In 
1624 Edward Palmer of London gave all his 
lands in Virginia and New England to the 
establishment of a university and schools in 
Virginia, to be called Academia Virginiensis

et Oxoniensis. This plan provided for a system . 
of schools with a university as head and subor- 
dinate schools or academies. The donor laid 
out a very elaborate plan for these schools. In 
laying out the grounds the greatest care was 
to be taken. The plan was to have the whole 
plat with a series of streets or alleys not less 
than twenty feet in breadth. The fact that 
this bequest was conditioned on a failing of heirs 
in a certain line of descent accounts for the 
failure of the whole scheme ; at ae there is 
no evidence that anything definite was done 
toward establishing such a system . institu-

CHAPTER VI 
WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE 
Establishment of William and Mary College. 
— The period between 1624 and the close of 
the century found the colonists occupied with 
matters more or less political, and we hear~ 
-nothing-of a further effort to establish an in- 
stitution for higher learning until the one which 
resulted in the organization of William and 
Mary College at Williamsburg. The rich 
plaiters; during all this time, followed the prac- 
tice of sending their boys and sometimes their 
girls to the grammar schools and colleges in the 
mother country. Virginia students were regis- 
tered at the various schools in London and in 
Liverpool, at Oxford and Cambridge. Their 
fathers, now settled permanently in the new 
world, had been educated in the most con- 
spicuous schools in England, and it was but 
natural that in the absence of such schools in 
69

America they should look to the mother country 
for the proper tuition of their children. But the 
remoteness of England, together with the ex- 
traordinary dangers of a voyage across the 
Atlantic, made them hesitate to depend upon 
this source for the education of the dics genera- 
tion in Virginia; so, after the restoration of 
Charles I, we find a sentiment among the Vir- 
ginia planters and heads of the government 
growing in favor of the establishment of a col- 
lege in Virginia. All this time the colony had 
increased in population, and the people had 
begun to feel that this was their permanent home 
and it behooved them to set up all the various 
institutions that characterized a people of cul- 
ture and a growing civilization. It was this 
combination of feelings and this situation that 
led to the establishment of William and Mary 
yy College.   
, 4 » First Step in the Establishment of a College. —   As early as 1660 an act of the General Assembly 
  runs “‘ that, for the advance of learning, educa- 
tion of youth, supply of ministry, and the pro- 
motion of piety there be land taken upon pur-

chases for a college and free school, and that 
there be, with as much speed as may be conven- 
ient, housing erected thereon for entertainment 
241 of students and schollers, The king was to 
be petitioned for letters patent, authorizing 
collections from ‘ ‘ well-disposed people in Eng- 
_land for the erection of colleges and schools 
in this country.”” This is an evidence of genuine 
interest in education on the part of the legis- 
lature. Governor Berkeley, members of the 
council of state, and the Burgesses subscribed 
liberally to this cause. The initiative for edu- 
cation in this early time always came from the 
governing authority, and this sentiment for 
education among the colonists grew more and 
more, but the period that followed after the res- 
toration was a period of distress and high taxes, 
and no really definite action was taken until 
1691, when the Rev. James Blair, a Scotchman, 
and one of the leading clergymen in Virginia, 
was sent to England by the General Assembly 
of Virginia for the purpose of carrying a memo- 
rial prepared by that body to the king and

queen of England, and to secure a ehbtes for 
a college in Virginia. Mr. Blair spent almost 
two years in England before securing the object 
of his visit. This time was spent in represent- 
ing the cause to the ecclesiastical, civil, and royal 
dignitaries of England, some of whom delayed — 
I in the 
necessary legal procedure through which the for months the execution of their pa: 
matter had to pass.!. While waiting on these 
officials, Blair took advantage of certain rather 
unique situations for securing funds for his in- 
stitution in Virginia. He secured three hundred 
pounds from a group of merchants who were 
trading very largely in Virginia commodities. 
He also received three hundred pounds from 
some pirates who were at that time making a 
settlement with the English government. 
Royal Endowment.— The English govern- 
ment, under the direction of Queen Mary and 
1 Seymour, the attorney-general, to whom the matter was referred, 
was in no hurry, and Blair, eager to return to Virginia, remarked that 
the college would prepare ministers for the Virginia colony, the people 
of which had souls to save as well as the people of England. To this, 
Seymour replied: “Souls! Damn your souls. Make tobacco.” See 
“William and Mary College History and Work,” Lyon G. Tyler, 
p. 12.

King William, made the following donations to 
the endowment of the college : (1) 1985 pounds 
in money, (2) tax on the export of tobacco from 
Maryland and Virginia to the other British 
plantations, (3) profits of the office of surveyor- 
general of the colony, (4) 10,000 acres of land 
in the Pamunkey Neck in Virginia and 10,000 
acres on the Blackwater.!. This was a handsome 
endowment. In addition, the Rev. James Blair 
secured a gift for the college from the executor 
of the will of Hon. Robert Boyle, who had re- 
cently died in England, leaving a sum of four 
thousand pounds sterling, the income from which 
‘ was to be employed for “ pious and charitable 
uses.” All the rents from this investment, 
except ninety pounds, were applied to the college 
in Virginia, for which the college obligated itself 
to keep as many Indians as this sum would 
support in meat, drink, clothes, medicine, books, 
and education. These Indians were to remain 
at the college until they had received the

training necessary to be given “orders” and 
sent as missionaries among their own race in 
Virginia. 
Colonial Endowment.— The subscriptions 
among the colonists for the endowment of the 
college amounted to something over three 
thousand pounds. The Virginia House of 
Burgesses added to the English gifts all ex- 
port duties on skins and furs. This was in 
1693. In 1726 the General Assembly gave 
two hundred pounds per annum for twenty- 
one years out of the duty of one penny a 
gallon on liquors, and in 1734 they gave the 
whole of this tax to the college for the re- 
mainder of the term. The tax on liquors was 
continued throughout the colonial period, and 
was in 1764 the greatest single source of revenue, 
817 pounds. In 1759 a special tax was levied 
on pedlers, and this was turned into the college 
fund. The annual revenues of the college up to 
the Revolution amounted to about two thousand 
pounds, or about $30,000 in present money.

and Mary College Quarterly, Vol. XI, pp. 149-53.

Scholarships. — There were ten scholarships. 
The House of Burgesses established three. 
Colonel Hill of Shirley and Robert Carter (King 
Carter) together established one; Mrs. Sarah 
Bray of New Kent, one; Mrs. Elizabeth Harri- 
son of Surry, one; Rev. James Blair, of Williams- 
burg, two; and Philip Lightfoot of Sandy Point, 
two. 
The Board of Trustees, the governing board 
of the college, was originally elected by the civil 
authority, the House of Burgesses, and the 
council. One-fourth of the number of members 
was to come from the clergy class. This body 
was to have the power of filling vacancies in its 
number, and just as soon as the college was fully 
organized according to the charter they were to 
transfer the active control of the institution to 
the president and the masters of the college, 
the Board retaining visitorial powers only. 
The following is a list of the first Board of Trus- 
tees: Francis Nicholson, governor, William 
Cole, Ralph Wormley, William Byrd, John Lear,

inson, Charles Scarborough, John Smith, Benja- 
min Harrison, Miles Cary, Henry Hartwell, 
William Randolph, and Matthew Page. Ac- 
cording to the charter, the college society was to 
consist of one president, six professors, one 
hundred, more or less, scholars. The faculty, 
or, as it was called then, “the Society,” 
was to elect from their number or from the 
Visitors or from “‘the better sort of inhabit- 
ants’ one burgess to represent them in the 
Assembly.! 
The Location of the College. — The General 
Assembly had within its power the right to pass 
finally upon the site of the college. The trustees 
selected first a site on York River, just above 
Yorktown, known as Townsend’s land, but seri- 
ous objections having arisen, that site was aban- 
doned. In October, 1693, after an address by 
the Rev. James Blair, the Assembly selected the 
Middle Plantation as the most “ convenient and 
1“ A writ is ordered to be issued for electing a Burgess to represent the 
college of William and Mary in the room of Sir John Randolph, deceased,

proper site,” and ordered that the college be 
erected as near as possible to the church (Bruton 
Church) then standing in Middle Plantation. 
On December 20, 1693, the trustees purchased 
from Col. Thomas Ballard, for 170 pounds, 
330 acres west of the church. 
The Erection of Buildings. — Thomas Hadley, 
whom Dr. Blair had brought from England, 
was given the management of the affairs con- 
nected with the construction of the college. 
The plan for the college buildings had been 
drawn by Sir Christopher Wren, the eminent 
architect who had designed St. Paul’s Cathe- 
dral, London. The buildings consisted of a 
rectangular structure two and a half stories 
high, 130 feet long, 40 feet wide, with two wings 
60 feet long and 25 feet wide. The bricks used 
for its construction were made near the site by 
Col. Daniel Parke. The walls of the building 
were three feet thick, and the outer course was 
laid in English bond, having alternate courses 
of stretchers and glazed headers. In 1697 the 
rector of the college, Rev. Stephen Fouace, 
reported to Governor Andros that they had 
V7
-P-A-G-E-96
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
completed the front and north side of the pro- 
posed rectangle. The first two floors of the front 
contained recitation rooms and the north wing 
was used for an assembly hall and a dining- 
room. The offices and rooms for the president 
and scholars were in the garret of the front and in 
the hall of the wing. The rear was never built. 
Financial Difficulties. — Owing to some dis- 
agreements between the governor and Presi- 
dent Blair, the subscriptions so generously made 
by the colonists at the beginning of the agitation 
for a college had not been promptly paid, and it 
seems that of the three thousand pounds sub- 
scribed only eight hundred and fifty pounds 
had been collected (1697). The General As- 
sembly felt called upon several times to pass 
resolutions urging the payment of these sub- 
scriptions. Even this legislative action was 
not sufficient to make a complete collection of 
the amount subscribed, and some of the sub- 
scribers were sued in the courts. The king of 
England sent a personal letter to the governor 
of Virginia, requiring him to do everything 
possible to secure the amount subscribed.

WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE 
The Opening of the Grammar School. — The 
original plan was that there should be a grammar 
school in connection with the college where stu- 
dents might secure the necessary training in 
Latin and Greek for entering upon the studies 
of philosophy, divinity, and mathematics. Rev. 
James Blair, wisely anticipating all the needs 
of the college, while in England secured the ser- 
  vices of a Scotchman, the Rev. Mongo Inglis, 
Master of Arts, Edinburgh University, as head- 
master of the grammar school. He was assisted 
by Mr. Mullikin as usher, and also by a writing 
master. This school was opened in 1694 in a 
building already in use for that purpose. In 
May, 1697, the members of the House of Bur- 
gesses attended the scholastic exercises and were 
‘‘ impressed and pleased with the proficiency of 
the scholars.”” The commencement exercises 
of the college in 1700 were attended by people 
from many parts of Virginia, others coming from 
Maryland, Pennsylvania, and even New York. 
  The salary of the master of the grammar school 
was at first eighty pounds a year and varied at 
different periods from that to one hundred and 
719 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
fifty as the school and college developed. The 
usher received anywhere from thirty to eighty 
pounds per annum. There were always extra 
fees which usually amounted to twenty shil- 
lings a year from each scholar. 
The Opening of the College. — The first 
building was burned October 20, 1705, before 
it had been used for any purpose except the 
grammar school and offices for the government 
and a meeting-place for the Assembly while 
the State House was building at the other end 
of Duke of Gloucester Street. By 1710 the col- 
lege had been rebuilt on the old walls, and in 
1729 the south wing was added according to the 
original plan, and was made the chapel. Gradu- 
ally, as the interest in learning increased and 
students of the grammar school advanced in 
the studies of Latin and Greek, which were then 
regarded as a necessary preparation for the 
studies of philosophy, divinity, and so on, one 
chair after another was established, and some 
of the best scholars from Oxford and Cambridge 
were called, till the six professorships provided 
for in the charter were filled. Not till 1729 were

all the departments founded; then, pursuant to 
the charter, the trustees signed the deed trans- 
ferring all the college property to the president 
and masters, who took charge of the college 
affairs by subscribing their assent to the Thirty- 
nine Articles of the Church of England and 
taking oath de fideli administratione. 
The Curriculum of the College. — The course 
of study was divided into three distinct depart- 
ments: (1) the grammar school, where the 
Latin and Greek languages were taught. The 
boys entered this school at about nine years 
of age and while there were called scholars. 
(2) Next came the school of philosophy, which 
was divided into two parts; the first consisting 
of moral philosophy, rhetoric, logic, and ethics, 
and the second, “ physicks, metaphysics, and 
mathematics.” The boys entered this depart- 
' ment at about fifteen years of age, assumed the 
cap and gown, and were known as students. It 
was the college proper. Two years were re- 
quired in this school for the Bachelor of Arts 
degree and two years in addition for the Master 
of Arts. In 1878 this was changed to four years 
@ 81  
-P-A-G-E-100
  
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
for the Bachelor of Arts degree and seven years 
for the Master of Arts. (3) The third depart- 
ment was the divinity school, in which there 
were two professors. The one taught Hebrew 
and the other explained the “ common places of 
divinity and the controversies with the heretics.” 
In all these schools the student had constant 
exercises in debates. The president lectured on 
theological subjects once a week, but conducted 
no regular classes. 
Besides these schools, there was an elemen- 
tary school for the Indian boys, to which the 
little boys of the town were admitted, presided 
over by one of the faculty. 
The Powers Vested in the Faculty. — The 
president and faculty elected all officers of the 
college, such as usher of the grammar school, 
bursar, librarian, janitor, cook, butler, gardener, 
and so on. According to the old monastic view 
of colleges in England, the professors were un- 
married. Only the president had the privilege 
of having a family, and the violation of this rule 
brought about much disturbance in the college. 
Two professors were removed for marrying dur-

dents before the American Revolution never 
exceeded one hundred and twenty, which, how- 
ver, compared well with the northern colleges. 
a Brasserton School. — By the gift of 
Robert Boyle, Indians had been trained at 
William and Mary. In 1712 there were twenty 
Indians at the college. Governor Spottswood 
kept a watchful eye on the Indians in Virginia 
and demanded of the chiefs some of their sons to 
be sent to the college and retained as hostages,? 
hoping that after a period of training in the 
Christian religion they would return to their 
respective tribes and serve as missionaries to 
their people, but it seems that no lasting good 
came from this policy of educating the Indians. 
Catechetical training was not the kind of teach- 
ing that would elevate this crude man of the 
1In 1758 Rev. William Preston and Rev. Thomas Robinson were 
removed for marrying and keeping their families at the college, “contrary 
to all rules of seats of learning.” 
2.After the Revolutionary War the Brasserton fund was withdrawn 
from the college through a suit brought by the Bishop of London and 
diverted to the education of negroes in the West Indies. The Indian 
school was discontinued.

forest into the culture and civilization of the 
white man. At this time there were a few 
mission centres among the Indians in different 
parts of Virginia, maintained jointly by the As- 
sembly and charitably inclined people in Vir- 
ginia and England.1 
The college was operated on the general plan 
of Oxford University. Nearly all the professors 
had received their training at this great educa- 
tional institution in the mother country and 
brought to William and Mary the ripest scholar- 
ship and highest culture of England. Dr. Blair, 
who was president of the college for fifty years, 
died in 1743. He was the most scholarly man in 
the colony, and his influence was effective and 
vigorous in all matters pertaining to the ecclesi- 
astical, educational, and political affairs of the 
colony. William Dawson, professor of Moral 
1 Rev. Charles Griffin conducted a school among the Saponies at 
Fort Christiana in Brunswick County. At one time he had as many as 
seventy-seven Indians in his school. Griffin was afterwards transferred 
to the Indian school at the college (1720). The Rev. Hugh Jones, in 
speaking of this, says the Sapony Indians so loved and adored Mr. 
Griffin that he had seen them hug him and lift him up in their arms. 
They would have made him the king of the Sapony nation. See “ Present 
State of Virginia,” Hugh Jones, p. 15.

Philosophy, who succeeded Dr. Blair as presi- 
dent, had spent nine years at Oxford. William 
Stith, another president, was a native of Virginia, 
but had studied in the grammar school at Wil- 
liam and Mary and later had graduated at 
Oxford. 
The College the Centre of Learning. — The 
seat of culture in Virginia shifted from James- 
town to Williamsburg. The intellectual atmos- 
phere of the college and the situation of Williams- 
burg on higher ground, with a more salubrious 
climate, were the chief factors in bringing about 
this change. Ultimately, in 1698, the capital 
was moved from Jamestown to Williamsburg. 
The Assembly held its sessions from 1700 to 1704 
in the college buildings while its State House was 
being built at the other end of the Duke of 
Gloucester Street. Williamsburg became the 
centre of the political and social life of Virginia.

to attend William and Mary College, and the 
daughters to enjoy the social and cultural at- 
mosphere of the capital. Not only the lighter 
and more enjoyable features of social life were 
indulged in, such as dancing, musical entertain- 
ments, theatre-going, and private social func- 
tions, but there was an interest in the more 
intellectual matters, as is evidenced by the

During the presidency of Rev. Thomas 
Dawson, 1705 to 1761, dissensions arose over the 
“Two Penny Act.” This quarrel between the 
ministers and the people generally developed 
into a great political turmoil throughout the 
colony. Suits were brought by several of the 
ministers against the vestries for losses incurred 
in their salaries. One of these suits was the oc-

There was a rapid succession of men holding

Rev. John Camm was the last of the colonial 
presidents. He was a graduate of Trinity Col- 
lege, Cambridge, England. He was a stanch 
friend of Lord Dunmore, the last colonial gov- 
ernor of Virginia. The Rev. John Camm was

Camm was a Loyalist. In his sermons he never 
spoke of heaven as a kingdom but as that 
“* great republic where there was no distinction 
of rank and where all men were free and equal.” + 
During the war the faculty consisted of only 
three members, and the college was in session 
during the years of turmoil except a few months 
before and after the siege of Yorktown. 
The Organization of the First Greek Letter 
Fraternity in America. —- The Phi Beta Kappa 
Society was originally organized at William and 
Mary College, December 5, 1776. In 1779 
Elisha Parmalee, a student at William and 
Mary from Connecticut, was given permission 
to organize chapters at Harvard and Yale. 
From this parent organization at William and 
Mary College, all the Greek letter fraternities 
in the United States have sprung. There was 
a still older fraternity, of which Thomas Jeffer- 
son was a member, known as the “Flat Hat 
Club,” founded in 1750.

_ William and Mary College after the Revolu- 
tion. — William and Mary College suffered 
severe losses as a result of the Revolutionary 
War. Though President Madison was made the 
first bishop of the Episcopal church in America, 
the college never again had an official connection 
with religion. The capital of Virginia was re- 
moved from Williamsburg to Richmond in 1780. 
The state laws for its support were discontinued. 
Three years after the Revolution, its available 
capital amounted to 2503 pounds and four 
shillings. It still retained extensive land grants, 
and, in 1784, the General Assembly voted to 
the college some public lands in and around 
Williamsburg and Jamestown. 
Some Innovations at William and Mary Col- 
lege. — Through the influence of President 
Madison and Thomas Jefferson, then a member 
of the Board of Trustees, the college was re- 
organized in 1779 and made a University. The 
grammar school was abolished, also the two 
divinity schools, and, instead, were introduced 
schools of (1) modern languages, (2) municipal 
law, (3) medicine. Under this arrangement, the 
90

faculty was composed of James Madison, D.D., 
president, professor of Natural Philosophy and 
Mathematics; George Wythe, LL.D., professor 
of Law and Police; James McClurg, professor 
of Anatomy and Medicine; Robert Andrews, 
A.M., professor of Moral Philosophy, the Law 
of Nature and of Nations, and Fine Arts; and 
Charles Bellini, professor of Modern Languages. 
Charles Bellini was the first professor of Modern 
Languages in the United States, and George 
Wythe was the first professor of Law. Presi- 
dent Madison was the first to introduce into 
a college curriculum a regular system of lectures 
on political economy. 
Dr. William Small had been the first to intro- 
duce the lecture system in college teaching in 
lieu of the formal recitation from the text-book, 
and in 1779 a faculty minute reads: 
Resolved, That the lectures in the different schools 
shall commence for the ensuing year on the 17th of 
January. 
The same year the elective system was in- 
troduced into William and Mary College, by 
which the student was permitted to choose his 
91
-P-A-G-E-110
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
course at college. In that year a faculty min- 
ute reads: 
That the student on paying annually one thousand 
pounds of tobacco shall be entitled to attend any two of 
the following professors, viz., of law and police, of natural 
philosophy and mathematics, and of moral philosophy, 
the laws of nature and of nations and the fine arts; and 
that for fifteen hundred pounds he shall be entitled to 
attend any three professors, the fees to be paid at that 
period of the year when the course of lectures commences. 
The principle upon which the honor system ! 
is based also had its origin at this time in William 
and Mary College. The policy of the faculty, 
in controlling the students without harassing 
them with petty regulations or subjecting them 
to embarrassment by espionage in the class room 
and on examination, was put into effect. The 
principle was carried out without any rules and 
received printed recognition in 1817, when the 
statutes of the Visitors contained a provision 
requiring students to “give evidence on their 
honor respecting offences.” 
Subsequent Events Connected with the Col- 
lege. — President Madison died in 1812. Dur-

ing his administration the college prospered and 
served the state and the nation well in prepar- 
ing men who later took important part in the 
building up of the nation in America. Williams- 
burg and the college became the hotbed of re- 
publicanism. French rationalism and atheism 
were rampant in society. Drunkenness and 
duelling caused the professors much trouble from 
1802 to 1808. 
In the endeavor to establish a state univer- 
sity there was a strong effort to move William 
and Mary College to Richmond, but, by the in- 
fluence of John Tyler, the rector, and John B. 
Seawell, of the trustees, and Judge Semple, of 
the faculty, the college remained at its ancient 
- site. This effort to remove the college and the 
opening of the University of Virginia had the 
effect of causing a period of decline, but it 
maintained itself up to the Civil War without 
a decrease of its productive endowment. Dur- 
ing the administration of Thomas R. Dew 
(1836-46), the attendance was probably greater 
than that at the university. In 1839, the num- 
ber reached 140, of whom thirty were law 
93

students. This was the largest number that 
ever attended the college before 1889. At the 
opening of the war the faculty and students 
hurried off to join the Confederate Army. In 
1862 the main building was burned while 
occupied by the Federal troops. 
The College after the Civil War. — In 1869 
the college was reopened, with Col. Benjamin 
S. Ewell as president. The buildings had been 
restored and the faculty was again recognized, 
but the institution had passed through so many 
adversities that it was impossible to restore the 
college to its ancient prestige, and it closed its 
doors in 1881, not to open again for seven years. 
In 1860 the endowment fund raised since the 
Revolution by the sale of its landed estate 
amounted to only $150,000, but the war had left 
in 1865 not over $30,000. 
The College Transferred to the State. —In 
1888 the trustees of the college sought aid from 
the state legislature and presented a bill for its 
reorganization. It was received with favor, 
and the General Assembly appropriated annu- 
ally to its support ten thousand dollars and 
94
-P-A-G-E-113
  
WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE 
provided that twenty men should compose the 
Board of Trustees. Ten of the old Board were 
retained and ten were appointed by the governor, 
the superintendent of public instruction being 
an ex officio member. Dr. Lyon G. Tyler was 
made president, and the college started off on 
a new era of service. Another act passed in 
1906 put the college upon the basis of a regular 
state institution. The property of the college 
was transferred from the old corporation to the 
new, styled “ the College of William and Mary 
in Virginia.” This act provided that the corpo- 
ration should consist of eleven members ; namely, 
the state superintendent of public instruction 
and ten gentlemen appointed by the governor, 
each to serve for four years. 
The college prospered under this management. 
It now has a productive endowment of $154,000, 
and receives from the state annually $40,000. 
It has twelve buildings, fairly equipped, a library 
of 18,000 volumes, and a corps of twenty-five 
instructors with over 240 students. The college 
maintains a department of education and a 
practice school. In addition to retaining its 
95
-P-A-G-E-114
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
ancient character as a classical college, it is 
the pedagogical school for the training of men 
teachers for the state. It serves the specific 
function of preparing principals and super- 
intendents of schools. The last report of 
the state high school inspector shows that 
William and Mary College furnishes more grad- 
uates teaching in the public schools than any 
’ other college in Virginia. There is an ever in- 
creasing and ever widening demand for the 
specific work that it has undertaken. 
Summary. — William and Mary College is 
the second oldest institution for higher educa- 
tion in the United States, and was the first to 
have a full faculty of regular professors. The 
college was more. typically English than any of 
the other higher institutions of learning in Amer- 
ica, having been established by the king and 
queen of England and named for them. It 
received a coat-of-arms from the College of Her- 
alds in London. William and Mary College is 
conducted upon the same plan as Oxford, main- 
taining the same curricula and holding to the 
same ideals. One of its primary functions is to 
96

WILLIAM AND MARY COLLEGE 
prepare ministers for the churches in Virginia 
and missionaries to the Indians. It also per- 
forms the function of preparing learned men for 
the professions of law and medicine, and public 
men for the state and the nation. President 
Tyler, in summing up the main points in the 
history of William and Mary, maintains the 
following : 
It was the first college in the United States to have 
a full faculty of professors (1729); the first to adopt the 
lecture system (1758); the first to establish the elective 
and honor systems (1779); the first to widen its scope 
into that of a university (1779); the first to establish 
courses in municipal and constitutional law (1779), 
modern languages (1779), political economy (1779), his- 
tory (1803); the first to organize a Greek letter inter- 
collegiate fraternity, the Phi Beta Kappa Society. 
The alumni of William and Mary College prob- 
ably exerted a greater influence in making the 
nation than the alumni of any other institution. 
Among’ these were included many illustrious 
names in American finial Peyton Randolph 
was the first president of the Continental Con- 
gress in 1774. Thomas Jefferson wrote the Dec- 
laration of Independence, 1776. John Tyler

Sr., carried through the Virginia legislature the 
proposition for the Annapolis Convention, 1786. 
Edmund Randolph opened the proceedings of 
the Convention at Philadelphia by submitting 
the “ Virginia Plan” in 1787. John Marshall 
settled the construction of the constitution. 
Three presidents of the United States were Wil- 
liam and Mary graduates. From 1789 to 1861 
sixteen out of the twenty-seven senators from 
in were William and Mary College men. 
“ After the Civil War, through the exhaustion 
of its funds, the college came to a state of sus- 
pension for a period of seven years, but in 1888 
the state came to its rescue, and the college since 
then has had a continuous development along 
the old lines of preparing men for position in 
society, and the new lines of preparing high-grade 
‘\teachers for our public school system. 
William and Mary College was a state crea- 
tion at first, and the state contributed to its sup- 
port, but, after the Revolutionary War, the 
state and. the college drifted apart. However, 
in 1888, the state again came to its aid and had 
partial control of its affairs. In 1906 the old

college was completely taken over and became 
a fullsfledged state institution, and since that 
time it has-adjusted its course of study and set 
up new ideals and aims for the future and 
entered upon a period.of direct service to the 
state. Thus the “ancient college of William 
and Mary, though modernized and under com- 
plete state control, still maintains some of its 
fine classical standards of scholarship and ancient 
prestige.

  CHAPTER VII 
THE FIRST STATE SUPPORT OF PUBLIC EDUCA- 
TION 
Elementary Education. — The people of Vir- 
ginia have always manifested a genuine interest 
in education. However, they have not always 
provided for the training of all her people. Po- 
litical and social conditions at this time were not 
ripe for so democratic an institution as the public 
school system, owing to the presence of a strong 
and powerful upper class and a great mass of 
people who could be denominated “poor.” The 
latter were for centuries exploited more or less 
by the aristocracy., The idea of universal 
public education was slow to take form. Pub- 
lic education, administered by the state, was 
looked upon by the aristocracy as being in- 
tended for paupers. The poorer class resented 
the attempt to pauperize themselves by accept- 
ing the proffered aid by the state in giving 
100
-P-A-G-E-119
  
STATE SUPPORT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
training to their children. Public education 
was looked upon, on the other hand, by the more 
powerful and ruling class as a means of charity 
intended for “‘ indigents ” or dependents. Thus 
public education could find no place in the social 
fabric of Virginia, until a strong and powerful 
middle class developed a truer democracy in 
which public education could best prosper. 
Jefferson’s proposed plan of public education 
in 1779 was based(upon his political philosophy 
of local self-government and frowided | for no 
higher authority for administration than the 
local district or county. (The matter of deter- 
mining whether a school should be established 
at all was left to those same local authorities, 
This was the main reason for the failure of the 
scheme, for those in authority represented the 
aristocratic element, and in many instances 
they did not see the logic of taxing themselves 
to establish an institution which they themselves 
would not patronize. Many Assembly meetings 
of Virginia from 1779 to the Civil War took 
up for consideration the bill drafted by Jefferson 
and his friends. In 1796 they passed the 
101 
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
famous act providing a system of primary 
schools according to Jefferson’s plan, though 
amending it in sucha way as to defeat the 
purpose of the bill in its very incipiency. The 
famous-amendment stated : 
The court of each county shall determine the year 
in which the aldermen shall be appointed and until they 
so determine no election shall be held. 
The courts were careful not to “ determine the 
year” for such an election, and of course no 
schools were established under this act. 
From this time on to the Civil War there were 
notable efforts by the different legislatures to 
establish a system of free public education. The 
session of 1817-18 had up for consideration a 
bill which, if it had passed, would have pro- 
vided a good scheme of public education, and 
would have served as a nucleus for further de- 
velopment into an effective system of state 
education. The Lower House passed the act 
by a large majority (66 to 49), but the Senate 
tied (7 to 7), and the speaker of that body 
cast the deciding vote against the bill. 
From 1818 to 1846 the people of the state 
102
-P-A-G-E-121
  STATE SUPPORT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
became more interested in higher education and 
secondary education than in a system of primary 
schools. Jefferson concentrated his efforts on 
the establishment of a great university for the 
state, which resulted in the University of Vir- 
ginia in 1818. The various church denomina- 
tions were at this time busy establishing colleges 
for Christian education. Hampden-Sidney, 
Washington and Lee, Emory and Henry, and 
Randolph Macon came into existence during 
this period. The public was absorbed in the ef- 
fort to get these institutions firmly established, 
and this scheme for providing free schools was 
neglected and had to wait until 1846 or even 
later for a more effective system of free, public 
education. The act of 1846 provided for a 
system of primary schools, but was only per- 
missory. The act required the assent of two- 
thirds of the electors of the county before the 
plan could be put into operation. In a few 
specific instances the plan was adopted by a 
majority: vote of the electors." 
1 Albemarle, Norfolk, and Washington counties were given this special 
privilege. Norfolk County probably made the best use of this scheme of 
public instruction. 
103 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
This general plan was adopted by nine 
counties, and survived in a few up to the Civil 
War. This scheme provided no state control. 
The funds for its support came from local taxa- 
tion and the distribution of the moneys from 
The Literary Fund, the establishment and evo- 
lution of which we now come to examine. 
The Literary Fund.— The Literary Fund 
was established by act of February 2, 1810. 
This formed the nucleus for the support of 
free schools in Virginia. The act ordered that 
all ‘“‘escheats, confiscations, fines, penalties 
and forfeitures, and all rights accruing to the 
state as derelict, shall be set aside for the en- 
couragement of learning.” In 1816 the Legis- 
lature added to this accumulative fund the 
amount of $1,210,550, which represented a 
loan to the federal government for the War of 
1812 and was returned to the state. The consti- 
tution of 1851 provided that one-half of the capi- 
tation tax should go to The Literary Fund, 
and the General Assembly of 1853 appropriated 
all the tax from this source to this fund. 
In 1811 an act defined the purpose of this 
104
-P-A-G-E-123
  
STATE SUPPORT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
fund as “ providing schools for the poor in any 
county of the State.” By the same act, the 
governor, the lieutenant governor, treasurer, 
attorney-general, and the president of the 
court of appeals were made a corporate body, 
to have control of this fund under the title, 
“President and Directors of The Literary 
Fund.” This Board was to invest the funds 
and dispose of the interest as directed by the 
General Assembly. 
The Legislature had provided also that when 
the income from this fund amounted to $45,000 
annually, it should be used for the education of 
the “indigent” white children, distributed on 
the basis of the white population in the counties. 
The second auditor of the state distributed 
these funds to the counties according to the 
order of the General Assembly. 
In each county the respective County Courts 
appointed commissioners, varying in number 
from two to thirty-two, according to the size 
of the county, whose duty it was to seek out 
the “indigent ”’ pupils in their respective com- 
munities and to employ a teacher for these pupils 
105 
   
-P-A-G-E-124
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
at the rate of three and a half to four cents a 
pupil for each day they were in actual attend- 
ance. 
At first none of this fund could be used for 
building schoolhouses or for equipment, but in 
1829 the General Assembly passed an act pro- 
viding that ten per cent of the allotment could 
be used for building schoolhouses, or if the local 
community should pay three-fifths of the total 
cost of the house, $100 of the fund could be 
used provided the patrons should raise a like 
amount. In this case the school was to be free 
to all. 
This distribution of the fund was kept under 
the direct control of the General Assembly from 
the time this fund was established to the Civil 
War. The fund was used by the members of 
the Legislature as a political “ plaything.” 
Primarily, it was intended for the education of 
G > 
the poor, but when the “ poor ”’ were reduced 
to a state of pauperism by taking advantage of 
it, they often refused to send their children to 
school, though one was provided within easy 
reach of them. It often happened that there 
106

was great difficulty in spending the money, 
and the commissioners apologized for the ac- 
cumulation of a surplus. The Legislature then 
sought other ways of using the fund and ap- 
propriated it to higher institutions of learning 
and to academies; $15,000 annually was ap- 
propriated to the University of Virginia from 
1818 to the Civil War. In 1824 the General 
Assembly appropriated $180,000 to the debts 
incurred on the buildings of the University of 
Virginia. In 1842, $1500 was allowed the 
Virginia Military Institute at Lexington. 
Seventeen academies in various parts of the 
state received appropriations for short periods 
of time. From time to time Hampden-Sidney 
College and Emory and Henry received gifts 
by the Legislature from this fund. The Medi- 
cal College in Richmond received $25,000 from 
this fund in 1850. In 1861 the income from 
The Literary Fund was appropriated to the 
defence of the state. Much of the fund was 
invested in Confederate bonds and other un- 
certain paper, which resulted in a loss of a great 
part of the fund. Between 1810 and 1871

$440,837 was lost by bad investments. In 
1871 there was available for the fund $1,596,- 
069.1 
In 1910 the fund amounted to $2,308,300 and 
accumulated at the rate of $80,000 a year. 
The average rate of accumulation is $30,000 
ayear. Before 1871, when the public school 
system of the state was put upon a permanent 
basis, this fund was the only means available 
for educational purposes, and, as the above 
facts indicate, the members of the Legislature 
kept it in their own control and used it often 
to further their political interests, the success 
of a lawmaker depending largely upon the 
amount of “free money” he could extract 
from the state for use in his district. The 
Literary Fund was one of the available sources 
for that purpose. 
Despite all this, the fund provided instruc- 
tion for many children throughout Virginia, 
though it took almost half a century to get the 
people to recognize the system as an effective 
method for the support of public education.

In 1851, 65,370 poor white children attended 
school, 31,486 of whom were in actual daily 
attendance fifty-four days a year, at a cost of 
four cents a day. In 1859 the attendance was 
54,232 for fifty-nine days, at a varying cost of 
from two to six cents per day.! The total 
amount spent that year was $165,530. 
Schoolroom Activities. — The following ex- 
cerpts from a description of an “ Old Field ” 
school by Professor Edward 8S. Joynes give an 
interesting picture of the activities of an ele- 
mentary school in Accomac County in 1847. 
The Building. “But at intervals, as I have said, I 
went to what was often called at that time, the ‘old 
field’ school. This name was doubtless due to the fact 
that the neighborhood school house was usually built 
on some piece of land which, left out as an ‘old field,’ 
now exhausted and usually growing up in small trees, was 
of little pecuniary value, and at the same time furnished 
a grateful shade. In this case, however, the school house 
stood in a grove of fine old oaks, near the roadside, and 
only a quarter of a mile from the county town, or court 
house; hence it was a better structure and style than 
was usual in the country. It was built of boards not Jogs. 
It had a great open fire place, for wood of course. There

were benches, with backs and without backs. Around 
the wall were sloping and planed plank boards, which 
served as a desk on which we wrote; but no one had the 
privilege of occupying permanently a seat at the desk. 
The teacher sat in a big armed chair. The classes, as 
they were called, came and stood up before him while 
they recited; and here, too, was the awful spot at which 
‘discipline’ was administered. 
Gradation. “Of gradation there was no thought. 
Each boy and girl recited, either alone or in class, as his 
or her condition required. School was from nine to 
twelve, and in winter from one to four; in summer from 
two to five. There was no regular school term. There 
was always school when there was a teacher; and as in 
those days a teacher usually meant anybody who could 
find nothing else to do, it usually continued, with some- 
what irregular intervals, all the year round. Attendance 
was, of course, conditioned more or less by the necessi- 
ties of farm work at home; but that made no difference. 
Each fellow, on returning, entered just where he could. 
Discipline. “In this school house prevailed a certain 
rude and severe, yet natural and wholesome discipline. 
Learning lessons aloud —a habit contracted before by 
many — was strictly forbidden, as was all whispering or 
talking or prompting. Suwm cuique — every one for him- 
self — was the rule which I think honestly prevailed. 
Telling was shameful, even if one had to bear another’s 
punishment. Outside of ‘keeping quiet’ and ‘behav- 
ing,’ we had a good deal of liberty. A big bucket of 
water, with a dipper, was on a stand: to go for water 
some distance from the school house, was the privilege

of that one of the big boys who had said his lessons best. 
Of ‘rewards’ there were none. Of punishments I re- 
member but, one — the tingle of which I can still feel on 
my back; I got it almost every day. — The punishment 
was administered not only for misbehavior, but for per- 
sistent defect in lessons. A ruler, a horse whip, or a 
leather strap (under different teachers) served equally 
well for this benign function. We got used to it, expected 
it, craved it; a boy who flinched was despised. | 
The Curriculum and Method of Teaching. “Our tasks | 
were set in the book, and we ‘said them’ from the book, 
and, usually, word for word. Often the questions were 
at the bottom of the page, which saved trouble to both 
scholars and teacher. We wrote our copies over and over ; 
we ‘ciphered’ till we ‘got the answer’;— no questions 
were asked. If, after due trial, we could not get the 
answer, we were thrashed, and, after brief explanation, 
we tried again. In this way, I ‘ciphered’ through Pike’s 
and other arithmetics. In grammar the rule was: Com- 
mit the big print the first time; on review the big and 
little print, verbatim. So I went through Smith’s English 
Grammar on the ‘productive plan’ (what it ‘produced’ 
in me Heaven only knows) and, later, Rosses’ Latin 
Grammar. Almost all lesson-getting was by heart. 
“We studied but few subjects — literally the three R’s, 
but these we studied thoroughly. We read every day 
from Marshall’s Life of Washington. We wrote day 
after day, and year after year, till good penmanship was 
the rule among us. Spelling was our specialty and our 
pride. Not only did each class spell every day but every 
morning, before dismissal, the whole school was lined up 
111   
 
-P-A-G-E-130

for a general ‘spell’; and to be at the ‘head’ of the 
class was the most coveted honor. And we spelled not 
only through the spelling books, but through the diction- 
ary — alphabetically, every word —and then reviewed 
it with the definitions !— How I ever learned to read it 
would be impossible, in the light of modern ‘methods,’ 
to explain. I began with ab, eb, etc. — We used Olney’s 
Geography; we got the text book by heart.— Of the 
philosophy of geography and of physical geography, as 
now taught, we knew nothing. But what we did learn 
we learned so thoroughly, and reviewed so often, that 
when I was ten years old there was hardly an important 
town, seaport, or waterway in the world that I did not 
know, by name and location at least. This, I now see 
was a very slender and superficial kind of knowledge; 
but, such as it was, it was positive and it was accurate. 
We doubtless had some history also of an elementary sort, 
but I cannot now recall it. If we did we learned and 
recited it by rote, and were required as in every other 
study to know, and to ‘say’ exactly what was in the book. 
Play Time. “One hour in winter, and two in summer 
was playtime indeed. The town boys went home to 
dinner; the countrymen — boys and girls —had the 
house and grounds to ourselves. And play we did, in- 
doors and out, according to weather or inclination. There 
was no wall or fence to separate the boys and the girls. 
We played as we chose separately or together. Kissing 
games were popular but as the kisses were always im- 
posed as a forfeit of course they were not enjoyed! The 
supreme penalty was to kiss all the girls in school; and 
then I always began with the ugliest and closed with the

"prettiest, but more usually, it was to kiss the girl you 
love best — and who could refuse so pleasing a function ! 
We fought, of course, now and then and ‘Cat’ and 
“town ball’ and ‘Sally’ (a beautiful game that I have 
never seen since) we often played. We cultivated the 
germ that has grown into modern ‘athletics.’ We had 
our fun, and we got our rest, and were ready for the 
afternoon work. The horrible exaction of lessons to be 
got out of school was so far as I can remember quite 
unknown. 
The Walk Home in the Evening. “After school came 
the walk home, often the pleasantest part of the day. 
Usually we came singly, but we left in groups. Along 
my road went a half a dozen or more boys and girls 
altogether for a time and then gradually, one after an- 
other dropped out until I who lived farthest of all was 
left to walk or usually to run, the last mile alone. Oh! 
those delightful home walks in summer ! We lingered 
slowly, ‘creeping like snails.’ We played marbles or 
‘tag’ in the road; we picked blackberries from the 
fence corners; we posted sentinels and climbed apple 
trees (I was caught in one by an irate farmer who took 
his seat on the tree root and kept me there till near night 
fall and then dismissed me with my pail full of the best. 
— That was his joke!) We walked aside with the girls, 
talking foolishness that seemed the sweetest wisdom. 
More than one of these companions, before I was twelve 
years old, I had loved (‘not wisely but too well’) — 
grandmothers are now dead, but not forgotten! Yet 
none of us were ever the worse for these sweet dreams and 
loving words.”

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
The Administration of Elementary Schools. — 
The president and directors of The Literary 
Fund, composed of the governor, lieutenant 
governor, attorney-general, and the president 
of the court of appeals, represented the state 
authority in control of public education in 
Virginia from 1846 to 1868. Their function 
extended no further than the matter of investing 
The Literary Fund and distributing it to the 
various counties according to the population. 
This Board had no power to devise ways and 
means for the encouragement of public education 
among the people of the state. It had no au- 
thority to license teachers or supervise the in- 
struction. It had no power to provide school 
buildings and equipment. These matters were 
left entirely to the local commissioners, who were 
appointed by the County Courts. The number 
of these was left entirely to the Court’s dis- 
cretion.’ The idea was to have a commissioner 
in every large community. He was to find the 
number of “ indigent” children in the com- 
munity and then employ a teacher. This was

one of the difficult tasks for the commissioner. 
Oftentimes he could find no one who would 
agree to teach the children at the meagre salary 
he could offer. He would then find tuition for 
the “ indigent ” children in a school, known as 
a “pay school,” already established by some 
teacher. Oftentimes these teachers would re- 
fuse to admit the poor children to their classes. 
It. was also the commissioner’s duty to visit 
> 
the schools where the “ poor” children were 
taught. Everything depended upon the school 
commissioner. This official was likely to be a 
man with little or no idea of what good school 
work should be. In some instances there is 
evidence that they were very negligent of even 
the meagre duties imposed by law. The people 
for whom the school existed had a strong prej- 
  udice against being looked upon as paupers, 
and for that reason refused to send their chil- 
dren to these schools, after persistent efforts 
on the part of the commissioners.

HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
reports of the commissioners of the various 
counties of the state will indicate the ineffec- 
tiveness of the system at the close of the 
period under discussion: 
“Many prejudices exist against the system owing to a 
false pride and children grow up in ignorance rather than 
be educated from public funds.” Clarke County Com- 
missioners. 
“The main defects of the system are: lack of qualified 
teachers and prejudiceamong the people as‘ poor schools.’ ” 
Augusta County, Supt. Jno. Imboden. 
“We recommend an increase per diem. Teachers of 
the higher grade, particularly classical teachers, are not 
willing to instruct indigent children for the present com- 
pensation, and other persons who are competent to give 
elementary instruction are debarred for the same reason.” 
Brunswick County Commissioners. 
“320 indigent children were instructed in the County. 
These children are entered in higher schools where higher 
teachers are paid the allowance and they consider it an 
act of charity to accept these children. Two dollars per 
child will not educate children in this county. Without 
an increase of funds the greater number of children 
must grow up in ignorance.” Charlotte County Com- 
missioners. 
“There is a great difficulty to get people to act as 
school commissioners. When they do undertake the 
duties, they are not half attended to.” Franklin County 
Commissioners. 
116

STATE SUPPORT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
“Commissioners are of the opinion that there should 
be some stated plan specially adopted for furnishing the 
common schools with some uniform system of school 
books and at the lowest possible rates. The age limit 
should be from 8 to 18 instead of 6 to 16.” Frederick 
County Commissioners. 
“There are no schools especially established by the 
commissioners, but several are confined to indigent chil- 
dren, and there does not appear to be any difference in 
the progress of indigent and other children.” Fluvanna 
County Commissioners. 
“Many teachers of the county will not admit children 
at the rate set by law. There is a large balance on hand 
that we cannot use.” Henrico County Commissioners. 
“Considerable difficulty in obtaining teachers. We 
recommend an increase of rate to five cents. Think 
teacher could then be induced to take indigent children.” 
Isle of Wight County Commissioners. 
“Per diem should be raised to five cents. Six of the 
commissioners could not establish schools. The com- 
missioners will endeavor to provide against so large a sur- 
plus next year. Indigent children are decreasing in the 
county in consequence of increase of wealth and the high 
price of labor. They have lost the ridiculous pride which 
has heretofore characterized them in refusing to go to 
school under the charge of the state.” King William 
County Commissioners. 
“Commissioners do not visit the schools. Teachers 
are not selected by them. They have to send the poor 
children to schools already established.” Matthews 
County Commissioners.

“Different neighborhoods in the county are supplied 
with schools, therefore it is unnecessary to establish 
schools. Funds not deemed sufficient to educate all the 
poor children. Board selects females and such others as 
are most needed.” Madison County Commissioner. 
“Commissioners have visited schools and find the 
pupils advancing. The amount unexpended is consider- 
able, due to the increase of capitation tax.”” Montgomery 
County Commissioner. 
“Commissioners remiss in their duty. Rule passed 
that any commissioner who does not make report as re- 
quired will forfeit his quota.”” New Kent County Com- 
missioners. 
“Some of the commissioners have not attended a 
board meeting for two years. Recommend that com- 
missioners be paid for their time in attending their duties.” 
Pittsylvania County Commissioners. 
“The parents of many indigent children cannot be 
prevailed upon to send their children to the schools.” 
Rappahannock County Commissioner. 
“Commissioners fail to discharge their duty. Recom- 
mend that teachers be not employed who cannot file a 
certificate from the Superintendent.” Smythe County 
Commissioners. 
“Greatest difficulty in inducing parents or guardian 
to send their children to school regularly.” Spottsylvania 
County Commissioners. 
“Board allowance teaches 300 poor children. Volun- 
tary contributions are made. This permits such salaries 
as will secure good teachers.

tiful. I reckon it may be regarded as the banner dis- 
trict of the State. Teachers have a county organization.” ! 
Norfolk County Commissioners. 
“Schools well conducted. Poor children make as 
much progress as the others. No teachers employed 
without being examined.” Washington County Com- 
missioners. 
From the foregoing excerpts from the reports 
of the Second Auditor, who was the only state 
supervising officer and the custodian of the in- 
come from The Literary Fund, it will be seen 
that the main difficulties with the system were: 
(1) insufficiency of funds to employ competent 
teachers; (2) no school buildings and other 
equipment, no means available for that purpose ; 
(3) strong prejudice against the idea of placing 
their children under the charge of the state 
for education; and (4) a generally careless atti- 
tude toward the system on the part of the com- 
missioners. Some of these difficulties lie so 
deep in the social fabric as to require years of 
time and effort to overcome. In the light of 
modern ideas concerning educational affairs, 
it seems ridiculous that the commissioners felt 
1 This was probably the first county organization of teachers in the state, 
119  
-P-A-G-E-138
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
called upon in their reports to apologize for not 
being able to spend the amounts allotted. In 
September, 1855, the Second Auditor reported 
undrawn quotas $10,381.11 and undrawn capi- 
tation tax $13,929.02. 
In connection with this law providing schools 
for the poor, special acts give the privilege to 
certain counties by vote to establish a system of 
free schools, by which a special tax was levied 
and a superintendent and a board were elected 
by the people for the conduct of the schools. 
This type of school was known as District Free 
School, and was intended for all children, rich 
and poor alike. The following counties oper- 
ated systems of free schools under special acts: 
Elizabeth City, Henry, King George, North- 
ampton, Norfolk, Princess Anne, Washington, 
Albemarle, and Augusta, together with the cities 
of Lynchburg, Petersburg, and Norfolk. Nor- 
folk County was the only one operating under 
this law at the beginning of the Civil War. 
These counties received their quotas from The 
Literary Fund in addition to the local tax levies 
for educational purposes. This was the period 
120

of industrial development in America, when 
railroads were being built everywhere and the 
enthusiasm for this sort of improvement eclipsed 
the other interests of the state and the atten- 
tion of the people was turned away from educa- 
tional matters. The following memorials to 
‘the directors of The Literary Fund by the school 
commissioners of Hanover and Matthews 
County are particularly interesting in this con- 
nection: 
An Appeal for Better Schools. “The Literary Fund is 
failing of its purpose with respect to primary schools. 
1. Insufficiency of compensation (4 cents per diem) 
fixed by law to secure services of teachers well qualified 
for this purpose. 
2. The competent teachers will not take poor children.” 
The memorial closes with this significant 
argument: 
While so much of the talents and energies of the 
legislators, so much of the pecuniary resources of the 
state is directed to clearing out obstructions from exist- 
ing channels for getting produce to market; while hills 
are being cut down, and valleys being filled up in the con- 
struction of new channels for the commendable purpose 
of developing the latent resources of the Commonwealth 
and bringing into active and profitable use materials now

utterly worthless, may we not indulge the hope, that the 
favorable opportunity for doing something for the cause 
of general education will not be permitted to pass by un- 
improved: but rather may we not flatter ourselves that 
as far as practicable the obstructions will be removed out 
of the way of enlightening the dark and uninformed of 
the poor of our state. That some plan will be devised 
which will operate as a permanent channel for communi- 
cating information to that large class of our citizens 
which will be sensibly felt in perpetuating our free insti- 
tutions by developing the latent resources of genius now 
covered with a heavy mass of rubbish, converting igno- 
rance into intelligence, vice into virtue, idleness into 
industry, and want and misery into happiness and use- 
fulness.

The Commissioners with much deference would sug- 
gest that a part of the enormous sums annually expended 
in abortive schemes of internal improvement might be 
more successfully directed to the objects of education 
and with absolute certainty of success. This is the begin- 
ning place. The moral power and prosperity of the 
people of Virginia should have their foundation laid in 
enlightening the minds of all, by providing the means of 
a general plan of education. Other improvements are 
of a secondary character and will follow as a matter of 
course.

STATE SUPPORT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION 
Summary. — It will be clearly seen that the 
system of public education in the state was not 
adequate: (1) the financial support was far 
short of the needs, as recognized by some of 
the leaders; (2) there was no effective system 
of administration and supervision; (3) public 
opinion as to the state’s taking control of pub- 
lic education had not definitely crystallized ; 
(4) the improvement of the physical aspects 
of the state, such as the building of railroads, 
canals, and forms of navigation, were receiving 
the attention of the people and were regarded 
as the prime function of government. As a 
consequence, primary education was neglected.

CHAPTER VIII 
PERIOD OF THE ACADEMIES 
Academies and Classical Schools. — Before 
1800, there were as many as twenty-five acade- 
  mies in Virginia. They were generally known 
as “Classical Schools.” The term “ Academy ” 
came a little later when the sciences were be- 
coming popular and some of them were taught 
in these secondary schools. This type of school 
had arisen in New England and New York 
State. In the latter half of the seventeenth 
century they had multiplied very rapidly 
through the other sections of the country, not- 
ably in Maryland, Virginia, and other southern 
‘states. The graduates of Princeton and Yale 
colleges came down into Virginia and estab- 
lished these schools in sections of the state 
where the strongest church centres were. 
124
-P-A-G-E-143
PERIOD OF THE ACADEMIES 
Some of these early academies became the 
nuclei of the leading colleges in Virginia." 
Prince Edward Academy (1775) later be- 
came Hampden-Sidney College. Liberty Hall 
Academy (1776) was the beginning of Wash- 
ington College, now Washington and Lee 
University, at Lexington. Fredericksburg 
Academy (1783) later became the charity 
school there (1796) and_ still later Freder- 
icksburg College. Shepherdstown Academy 
(1793), Hoge Classical School (1805), was the 
nucleus of Shepherdstown College (now a state 
normal school in West Virginia). Albemarle 
Academy (1803), later Central College (1818), 
became the University of Virginia. Richmond 
Seminary (1803) developed into Richmond Col- 
lege. Salem Academy (1826) later became 
Roanoke College. Monongahela Academy 
(1814) was the nucleus for West Virginia 
University. Marshall Academy (1838)  be- 
came Marshall College (1858), later changed

to a state normal school (1867) at Hunting- 
ton, West Virginia. Norfolk Academy (1788), 
Winchester Academy (1786), Petersburg 
Academy (1794), Margaret Academy (1807), 
Staunton Academy (1810), New Market Acad- 
emy (1817), Concord Academy (1809), Alex- 
andria Academy (1785), had a long and use- 
ful existence, and some of them are still in 
a flourishing condition as private preparatory 
schools or military academies. 
Besides these academies, there grew up one 
or more of these schools in every county of 
the state. From 1800 to 1860, there were 
about two hundred and fifty of these schools 
incorporated by the General Assembly, and 
it is safe to say that many others of less signifi- 
cance in operation did not apply for incorpo- 
ration. 
The following table shows the growth of 
academies from the Revolutionary War to 
the close of the Civil War. It should be noted 
that about twenty of these would fall within 
the territory of the present state of West Vir- 
ginia. It will be noted that the period from 
126

1820 to 1860 was the most active in establish-

the educational revival in America from the 
30’s to the 50’s. The people of Virginia were 
as much interested in the education of girls as 
boys. The academy was the type of school 
that spread through Virginia and served as 
the means of education for the majority of the 
children of the state. These schools, while they 
taught the classics, higher mathematics, and 
the sciences (physics, chemistry, and botany), 
also gave instruction in the elementary subjects, 
which was a: necessary preparation for this 
secondary instruction. The state had no other 
connection with these academies than the mat- 
ter of chartering them or passing acts enab- 
ling them to conduct lotteries for the purpose 
127
-P-A-G-E-146
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
of raising funds to erect buildings or to add 
to their endowment.' It gave no money for 
their support except to the few (seventeen) 
that received a meagre appropriation from The 
Literary Fund at different times. The more 
substantial of them were endowed and con- 
trolled by a board of trustees which was a 
self-perpetuating body. The main means of 
support was by tuition fees paid by the 
students. 
Public Sentiment for Popular Education. — 
From the 30’s to the 50’s, a great wave of dis- 
cussion arose as to the best system of education 
for the state. The churches were particularly 
interested in the fostering of secondary and 
higher education. They were demanding that the 
state subsidize the institution they had already 
established. There was a strong feeling among 
a class that the state should adopt a complete 
system of education under state control. 
Charles Fenton Mercer, in 1817, drew up and 
1 From 1784 to 1817, acts authorizing the raising of money by means 
of lotteries, for the establishment and maintenance of academies, were 
passed by the Legislature. 
128
-P-A-G-E-147
  
PERIOD OF THE ACADEMIES 
presented to the Legislature a bill providing 
for a Board of Public Instruction, with a perma- 
nent secretary, for a system of primary schools 
free to all white children ; for a system of acade- 
mies (three of these for girls) ; and for colleges 
and a university. This bill passed the House 
but failed of passage in the Senate. The acade- 
mies had proved ‘so well their efficiency that 
almost all proposed legislation regarding educa- 
tional matters included this type of school. 
There were some people who thought “ nothing 
worthy could come from statutes in matters 
of education.” One man went so far as to 
argue that The Literary Fund should be 
abolished as a “ public nuisance.” 
The people were deeply concerned with ad- 
justments and readjustments. There was a 
strong prejudice against old forms and customs. 
They feared taxation and meagre publicity 
and central control of public matters. Hence, 
public education lagged in such a spirit and the 
idea of complete local control in matters of 
education prevailed. In such an atmosphere, 
academies survived as the best type of educa-

tion in Virginia. Education conventions were 
held at Richmond and at Clarksburg (now in 
West Virginia), in 1841, each offering sugges- 
tions for a more satisfactory system of educa- 
tion. 
Plans Submitted. — The House Committee, 
Directors of The Literary Fund, Henry Ruffner, 
and Superintendent Smith of V.M.I. all sub- 
mitted plans for a better system of education 
for the state. In these reports, one finds as 
suggestions all the characteristic aspects of 
modern public education. Some of them are: 
(1) support of colleges, (2) eight months’ 
session for the common schools, (3) establish- 
ment of normal schools, (4) schools for girls, (5) 
pensions for teachers, (6) State Board of Educa- 
tion, (7) state superintendent of schools, (8) 
school journals, (9) division superintendents, 
(10) school libraries, and (11) better school- 
houses. But nothing came of all this full 
and abundant wisdom. The academies went 
on furnishing, for the most part, the training 
for the boys and girls of Virginia until 1869, 
when the present school system was inaugurated. 
130   
-P-A-G-E-149
  PERIOD OF THE ACADEMIES 
In 1860 there were 13,204 pupils attending 
academies in Virginia, with 720 teachers. Our 
present system of high schools in the state 
grew by gradual stages out of these academies 
so well distributed over the state.’ 
The Curriculum of These Academies. — The 
curriculum for these academies in the higher 
departments was largely the old traditional 
subjects, Latin, Greek, mathematics, and 
rhetoric. In addition to these, such sciences 
as physics and chemistry, and sometimes bot- 
any, were taught; and bookkeeping was often 
comprised in the course. In the classical 
schools, the work was confined more to the 
ancient languages. This was regarded as the 
preparation for college. The discipline was 
usually harsh and severe. There were no 
short cuts or easy methods. Three typical 
cases will illustrate how school work proceeded 
in some of these old academies, some of which 
went by the name of “Old Field ” schools.

HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
Beyond the Blue Ridge schools are very scarce. 
About this time (1776) my father went on a trading 
expedition to Baltimore and there purchased several 
convict servants. Among these was a youth about 
18 or 20 named John Reardon of Ireland but reared 
in London. He had been at a classical school and had 
read Latin as far as Vergil, as well as a little Greek 
Testament. He wrote a fair hand and had some knowl- 
edge of bookkeeping but had never been accustomed to 
labor. The young fellow it was thought might teach 
school in default of a better, and accordingly a hut of 
logs was erected near a spring. The place was a mile 
from our house by the direct path along the creek, whither 
I trudged along every day. The school was large and 
some of the scholars were nearly grown. It consisted of 
both boys and girls. The custom was to read with as 
loud a voice as we could while getting our lessons as it 
was called. When within a quarter of a mile of a country 
school one might hear, like a distant chime, the united 
voices of the scholars.! 
Concord Academy was Frederick Coleman. Coleman 
was an A. M. from the University of Virginia. There 
can never be such a school. Every man for himself, — 
that was all. Be a man, be a gentleman — nothing more. 
Obedience, truthfulness, — these were the only virtues 
recognized, — obedience to Fred Coleman. His wrath 
was something terrible, a tornado in its irresistible and 
undisciplined fury. Lying and cowardice were not given 
for they were impossible at Concord. Fighting was not

prohibited; only it must be a fair fight, old Fred would 
see to that. 
This was a school with absolutely no method, no hour 
was appointed for any of the classes. Ben, the trusty 
servant, who equally feared and worshipped his master, 
would ring the bell and announce the class at any hour. 
The law of place was as uncertain as that of time; classes 
would meet anywhere without law or method ; in disregard 
of every rule of order or decorum was laid the foundation 
of that scholarship which made Concord famous among 
schools. Coleman held that the first books of Livy con- 
tained all Latinity, and all the glory that was Greece was 
to be found in the “ Hecuba” of Euripides. ... Every 
line, phrase form, idiom was made a center of citation. 
We used only complete texts without notes at Concord 
—a Latin or Greek grammar I never saw there. He 
was a massive power of body and will. Through this 
power he dominated all his boys — impressed honesty 
upon them — controlled them by his immense will power, 
moved them by his mighty sympathy, startled them into 
life by his stentorian voice, and molded them by his 
dynamic mind. As a teacher he was the greatest of his 
age. ‘There has been no other like him.! 
“When I was about eleven years old I was transferred 
to what I may call the Latin school. This was a private 
school, taught at the residence of the teacher. The 
school was held in an outhouse, which in all its appoint- 
ments was as plain and meager as the other — (the Old 
Field school) a few benches — no wall maps or black-   1 The Morrison MS., Concord Academy, 1835.

boards — I never saw either of these until I was sent off 
from home. I call it the “Latin school” because Latin 
with some Greek was mainly taught there. The teacher 
was a graduate of the University of Doublin; had been 
classical instructor in one of the best colleges of that day, 
where he had earned a high reputation. Spending a 
vacation on the eastern shore of Virginia he had met and 
married a beautiful and refined woman who, dying, had 
left him two lovely daughters; now, in his old age, he 
had settled down to teach a school for boys. I wish I 
could give more of his personal history, for he was a 
remarkable man. Yet I know the case was not alto- 
gether exceptional, for I have heard of other distin- 
guished scholars teaching at that day in equally remote 
parts of the south. 
Curriculum and Method. “The usual advanced 
branches of that day were taught more or less — usually 
less ; — for Latin and Greek were the staple of the school, 
and in these alone the teacher delighted. And he made 
us delight in them. I learned to love Latin, and I studied 
it with loving zeal. The method was old-fashion; Gram- 
mar lessons learned by heart; paradigms studied so 
thoroughly as never to be forgotten; parsing and weari- 
some detail, with infinite repetition but with absolute 
accuracy; and reading, reading, reading: — of written 
exercises I never so much as heard. My teacher was one 
of the brightest classical scholars I have ever seen. Large 
portions of the text — the poetry especially — he knew 
so well that he could hear our lessons without a book. 
As we recited he would pace across the room, chewing 
his great quid of tobacco, yet watchful of every word or

intonation — now and then interpolating brilliant exposi- 
tion or apt renderings, which fired us with interest and 
emulation. Here I read Cesar, Sallust, Virgil (the 
eclogues, Georgics, and six books of Aineid); Cicero’s 
Oration against Catiline and Verres; and Horace, Odes 
and Satires,—all in two years,—and I read them 
thoroughly, understanding, if not the subject-matter, at 
least the language. — As I rose to the dignity of the “first 
Latin” class, we were left to do as much Latin as we could 
or would, and I remember that, at last, we reached an 
average of over 200 lines per day. Of what else, indeed, 
I did in this school I have little or no recollection; but 
I did learn Latin — to know Latin and to love Latin; — 
and for a boy of twelve to learn to know and to love any 
one great and good thing, is, I submit, a good beginning 
of education. At the age of thirteen my country school 
education ended. A few months I was sent to a famous 
Academy at Newark, Delaware.” ! 
Summary. — The academies, so numerous in 
Virginia during the first half of the nineteenth 
century, developed out of the old classical 
schools, known in some sections of the state 
as the “ Parson’s Schools” and “Old Field 
Schools ” of the previous century. The acad- 
emy of this later period came to represent the 
coming of science, as a part of the college and

secondary curricula. Here and there the old 
classical schools persisted, being patronized par- 
ticularly by the more influential and aristocratic 
classes and by those intended for the clergy. 
The teaching of the sciences came with the 
movement that demanded a more practical 
type of training, and were patronized and 
maintained by the growing influence of the 
middle class, and the wide-spread movement of 
the industrial, economic, and new political life 
of the state. This type of education persisted 
so long in Virginia because of the transition in 
political ideals, represented by Jefferson’s po- 
litical philosophy of local self-government, and 
the fear of centralized power in matters of 
state control. The evolution of American educa- 
tion has gone along with the idea of a certain 
degree of centralized power. The efficiency 
of the American system of education depends 
upon: (1) the fundamental democratic principle 
of equal opportunity for all; and (2) the pro- 
vision for state support and supervision of 
schools.

Dissenters in Virginia. — About the time of 
the Revolutionary War, streams of migration 
from Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and 
New York flowed into Virginia. These immi- 
grants settled in various parts of the state, 
particularly in the Piedmont and the upper 
regions of the James River and in the Shenan- 
doah Valley, and represented various religious 
denominations, such as Presbyterians, Bap- 
tists, Methodists, Quakers, Lutherans, German 
Baptists,! and Mennonites, and were generally 
known among the other Virginia settlers as 
“dissenters.” They were a sturdy people and 
had learned to differ from the old and estab- 
lished forms of worship in England and other 
sections of Europe, and carried with them into 
1In 1908, the General Conference changed the name to “Church of 
the Brethren.” 
137 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
this new country the spirit of the Reformation, 
which had been the cause of so much controversy 
in Europe. They came into clash with the es- 
tablished church of England so firmly estab- 
lished in Virginia. The outcome of the political 
conflict ending with the Revolutionary War 
gave the “ dissenters ” the advantage, and other 
influences in the subsequent history of the state 
brought them distinctly into the ascendency. 
By the close of the war they had established 
themselves into strong centres of population 
and had begun to organize themselves in accord- 
ance with their own ideals of religious, social, 
educational, and political standards. The Pres- 
byterians were probably the most active in 
taking part in moulding the politics of the state. 
They were of the Scotch-Irish stock and held to 
their proverbial thirst for knowledge. They 
had a reverence for learning, and schools soon 
and sacredly followed upon their churches. 
The German Baptists and Mennonites were 
slow to provide education or to take an active 
part in that provided by the state a little later. 
The Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, and 
138
-P-A-G-E-157
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
Lutherans each in their turn established col- 
leges, and for a long period (1775 to 1860) these , 
institutions provided the most effective system 
of higher education in Virginia. 
We shall next trace the development of these 
influential church schools and a little later 
follow the development of the higher education 
provided by the state. 
Hampden-Sidney College, 1775 
Next to William and Mary College, Hampden- 
Sidney College is the oldest institution for higher 
learning in Virginia. It grew out of the needs 
of the Presbyterian communities in Prince 
Edward, Hanover, and Cumberland counties. 
The pastors of the Presbyterian churches in 
that part of Virginia were largely graduates of 
Princeton College, and it was but natural that 
they should desire for their people the same sort 
of educational advantages to which they were é 
accustomed in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. 
Princeton was the model for the college in Vir- 
ginia. ‘‘ The college in New Jersey ” is often 
referred to in the early documents connected 
139
-P-A-G-E-158
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
with the establishing of Hampden-Sidney Col- 
lege. The Virginians wanted the same sort of 
institution. This college was established when 
the clash between the Church of England and 
the “dissenters”? was at white heat. The 
earliest document referring to the establishment 
of an academy in Prince Edward County ap- 
peared in the Virginia Gazette of October, 
1775. It is a full announcement of the opening 
of the Academy, November 10, of that year. 
This document says the college will be “ subject 
to the visitation of twelve men of character and 
influence in their respective counties, the im- 
mediate and active members being chiefly of 
the Church of England.” 
Further on, it says: 
The system of Education will resemble that which is 
adopted in the college of New Jersey, save that a more 
particular attention shall be paid to the cultivation of 
the English language than is usually done in places of 
public Education. 
Another statement of special interest is : 
The public may rest assured that the whole shall be 
conducted in the most catholic plan. Parents of every 
140
-P-A-G-E-159
“under the signature of “ Luther ’ HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
denomination may be at full liberty to require their 
children to attend any mode of worship which either 
custom or conscience has rendered most agreeable to them. 
Here we have indeed a broad “ catholic ” basis 
for an educational institution. It is probably 
true that the members of the Board of Trustees 
representing the Church of England did not 
accept the honor of serving on the Board, for 
‘a man writing in the next issue of the Gazette 
’ calls atten- 
tion to the effort to establish a college in Prince 
Edward and also to the danger of having the edu- 
cation of the youth placed under the care of 
“‘ dissenters’ who profess doctrines not only 
repugnant to the doctrine of the Church of 
‘ England, but in his opinion even “ subversive 
of morality.” He closes with a plea to every 
Church-of-England contributor to the Academy 
to withhold his subscription from a college con- 
ducted under such auspices. 
Here we have the results of a long and bitter 
controversy between the two prevailing ideas of 
the purpose of education: the one, that a col- 
lege education was a preparation primarily for 
  141  
-P-A-G-E-160
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
service in the church, and the other, that higher 
education served the purpose of preparing one 
for service as a citizen of the state. This con- 
flict had been fought out at Harvard, Yale, and 
Princeton long before. Hampden-Sidney Col- 
lege immediately lent its influence to the political 
affairs of the country, which had become tense 
and critical prior to the Revolutionary War 
and the consequent founding of a new form 
of government in America.1 On November 16, 
1776, the trustees sent a memorial to the 
House of Delegates at Williamsburg which 
has all the earmarks of a fundamental political 
document full of wisdom and advice regarding 
the establishment of a free government in 
America and incidentally calling attention to 
1 A petition of sundry inhabitants of the county of Prince Edward 
whose names are hereunto subscribed (the first petition of dissenters

American States will long continue free and independent . . . that justice 
to themselves and posterity makes it their indispensable duty in particu- 
lar to entreat that without delay all church establishments might be

general laws of the land. Journal of the House of Delegates, October 11, 
1776. 
142
-P-A-G-E-161
  
HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
the importance of Hampden-Sidney College as 
an institution which represents the ideals of 
the new government. The college long kept 
in close touch with the political movements 
of the time, and its roll of graduates includes 
the names of scores of Virginia statesmen and 
leaders in national affairs as well. This identifi- 
cation of the college with the state turned the 
ears of the legislature to its appeals for aid 
many times. 
The men who have held the position of presi- 
dent of Hampden-Sidney College make a galaxy 
of great names. Some of the greatest scholars 
of America have been connected with this in- 
stitution of learning. Patrick Henry and James 
Madison were one-time members of the Board 
of Trustees (charter members). The college has 
constantly held to the policies of its founders: 
(1) that sound learning be promoted; (2) that 
the principles of liberty and patriotism be im- 
pressed upon the youth of the land; (3) that 
true religion be conserved and the Kingdom of 
Christ be advanced. The college has wielded 
a great influence in every line of professional 
143
-P-A-G-E-162
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
service. Its cultural influence has been far- 
reaching. She trained thirty-three presidents 
of colleges and universities and one hundred 
professors in like institutions. Three times the 
students and members of the faculty have en- 
listed as a body and marched to war. In re- 
ligious service the college rendered a like con- 
tribution to the country. Fifty per cent of 
all its graduates have entered the ministry of 
the Gospel. This record probably cannot be 
matched by any other college in America. It 
never had a large enrolment of students. The 
largest in any one year was 155. The average 
enrolment has been 75. Early in the history 
of the college the Trustees memorialized the 
Legislature of Virginia on the subject of aid for 
buildings and endowment. The state turned 
over to the college 412 acres of land (1784), 
though this was never very productive. There 
were many attempts to induce the Legislature 
to give money to the college from time to time, 
but little was received from this source.1 In the

144
-P-A-G-E-163
  
HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
early days the college was maintained by means 
of lotteries, subscription, private gifts, tuition 
fees, and rents from rooms. The Board minutes 
are full of schemes by which attempts were 
made to put the college on a firm financial basis. 
The course of studies as prescribed for the 
college in its early years included a full course 
in the ancient languages, mathematics, trigo- 
nometry, and surveying, the French language, 
moral philosophy, physics, and chemistry. This 
curriculum has been adjusted from time to 
time to meet the modern demands. The in- 
stitution has always stood for sound scholarship 
in the old traditional lines. Efforts were made 
at times to establish a medical department at 
Richmond, which seems to have been in session 
from 1837 to 1854.'_ At another time an effort 
was made to introduce manual labor (1835), 
but this was never put into real operation. The 
Union Theological Seminary was organized 
at Hampden-Sidney (1807) and became the 
institution for preparing ministers, particularly 
for the Presbyterian Church.

L 145 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
The seminary was moved to Richmond in 
1898, and has continued its fruitful work in its 
new location. For a few years after this re- 
moval the college passed through a trying 
period of readjustment to new conditions, but 
has overcome the difficulties arising from its 
rural location, and is to-day more vigorous than 
at any time in its long and honored history. Its 
endowment has been increased, its equipment 
made modern and complete, its faculty en- 
larged, and its courses of study are fully abreast 
of the educational demands of the times. 
Thus, Hampden-Sidney College in Virginia 
maintains its honored place among the in- 
stitutions for higher learning in the South, and 
continues to wield a wide and permanent influ- 
ence both in Virginia and in the nation at large. 
Summary. — Hampden-Sidney College was 
conceived, established, and maintained by 
church authority. In this sense it was a church 
school offering Christian education though recog- 
nizing the effectiveness of education for citizen- 
ship and public service. It sought support 
often from the state, and while there was always 
146
-P-A-G-E-165
HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
a strong inclination on the part of the Legisla- 
ture of Virginia to aid the college, it was more 
interested in developing a state university 
over which it could have more direct control. 
Hampden-Sidney’s greatest contribution was in 
the line of religious education, it having inspired 
and furnished the leaders for Union Theo- 
logical Seminary,— first at Hampden-Sidney 
College and later of Richmond,— Princeton 
Theological Seminary, and Austin Theological 
Seminary. Fifty per cent of its graduates 
have gone into the ministry. 
Washington and Lee University, 1776 
Washington and Lee University had its origin 
in the Scotch-Irish séttlement west of the Blue 
Ridge in Augusta and Rockbridge counties. 
The people, like those in Prince Edward County, 
had come from the colonies to the north, and 
directly from Scotland and Ireland, where they 
had had the advantage of a complete education. 
The father of Rev. Archibald Alexander was 
instrumental in establishing a school (1775) at 
Timber Ridge near Lexington, where the classi- 
147
-P-A-G-E-166
Sarre al ee ae ree PR rT Re ree MPT EE Ee ae ee TO eee ee 
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
cal languages were taught by efficient instruc- 
tors. This was the nucleus around which 
Liberty Hall Academy and later Washington 
College grew, and upon whose foundations 
the present Washington and Lee University 
rests. Liberty Hall Academy was established 
in 1776 by the same Scotch-Irish stock that 
founded Hampden-Sidney College, whose love 
for learning and liberty meant so much to Ameri- 
can freedom and education. 
In 1796 General Washington endowed the 
academy with one hundred shares of stock 
in the James River Navigation Company, which 
had been presented to him by the Legislature of 
Virginia, in appreciation of services rendered 
this country in the Revolutionary War. This 
property, added to the original, which was 
already considerable for that time, constituted 
the foundation for the future university. In 
1798 the institution took the name of ‘‘ Washing- 
ton College.’ In 1803 the college was still 
further endowed by a gift from the funds of the 
Cincinnati Society, which at that time was 
dissolved. In 1826 the large estate of John 
148 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
Robinson, of Rockbridge, a trustee of the col- 
lege, was added, which formed the basis of two 
professorships. Other gifts by will have been 
added, making a rich endowment. 
It will be seen that this institution rests upon 
an entirely independent basis, with no direct 
church or state control, though the college was 
established and maintained by Presbyterian 
fosterage. Its affairs have always been managed 
by a self-perpetuating Board of Trustees. It 
has always ranked high among the American 
colleges. In 1865 Gen. Robert E. Lee was 
elected president, and under his management new 
courses were laid out in which large opportuni- 
ties were provided for the study of practical 
and applied science. An overflowing patronage 
followed from all parts of the country, both 
North and South. After the death of General 
Lee, the name of Washington and Lee Univer- 
sity was given to the college. 
Among the ideals of the college are: (1) sound 
scholarship in the classics, mathematics, his- 
tory, literature, and philosophy; (2) high type 
of manhood; (3) a system of honor among 
149 
 
-P-A-G-E-168
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
its students; (4) learning for public service 
rather than for personal achievement or the 
attainment of any kind of success. 
The university has from time to time adjusted 
its curricula to the needs of the people of the 
South, introducing some of the more practical 
arts such as engineering, law, and agriculture. 
It has always encouraged graduate work and 
high scholarship by offering prizes. Students 
preparing for the Christian ministry of any de- 
nomination receive free tuition. Definite ad- 
ministrative policies looking to the habits, 
morals, social, and patriotic welfare of the 
students have been in operation. The student 
body is divided into small groups, and each 
group assigned to a member of the faculty, who 
is responsible for the habits of study and general 
conduct of the members of his group. It has 
long been the policy of the faculty of trusting 
the students and freeing university life from es- 
pionage and deceit. One has but to run over 
the list of the alumni in state and national 
service to ascertain how well these ideals have 
been carried out.

Summary. — Washington and Lee Univer- 
sity is a typical independent institution free 
from direct church or state control. It came 
to serve the country in a peculiar way in fostering 
good citizenship in the nation and the spirit 
of public service which was so important in 
America in the early history of this government. 
It has recently received gifts that make its 
endowment large, and because of this, the 
institution is planning important expansions 
in equipment and curricula. 
Randolph-Macon College, 1830 
Randolph-Macon College was the first in- 
stitution for higher learning established in 
Virginia by the Methodist Church. It was 
inspired by Bishop Asbury, the first head of 
that church in America. At the beginning of 
this century there "were many Methodists 
in America, scattered along the coast from 
Connecticut to Georgia. In 1784 there were 
14,988 Methodists in America. Probably the 
first Methodist Academy in America was es-   tablished in Brunswick County, Virginia, in 
151 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
1785, by Bishop Asbury. It was he who es- 
tablished the first college (1839) of high grade 
for women in America, and perhaps in the world, 
Wesleyan Female College at Macon, Georgia. 
As early as 1820 the Virginia Conference of 
the Methodist Church took up the matter of 
establishing a “Seminary of Learning.” Year 
after year the matter was laid on the table. 
The Conference of 1827 heard the report of a 
committee on a “‘ Constitution for the College,” 
and the members of the Conference were urged 
to obtain subscriptions within the boundaries 
of the Conference for the college. The site of 
the proposed college was fixed at or near Boyd- 
ton, Virginia, largely by the influence of the 
Rev. H. G. Leigh. The Virginia Conference 
included within its bounds the adjacent counties 
in Virginia and North Carolina, and it was 
thought best to locate the college near the 
state line between these two states. In Feb- 
ruary, 1830, the following bill was enacted by 
the Virginia Legislature : 
Br iT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL AssEMBLY that 
there be and is hereby erected and established at or near 
152
-P-A-G-E-171
HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
Boydton in the county of Mecklenburg a seminary of 
learning for the instruction of youth in the various 
branches of science, literature, the useful arts, agricul- 
ture, and the learned and foreign languages. That the 
seminary shall be known and called by the name of 
“Randolph Macon College.” 
The college was named for John Randolph of 
Roanoke and Nathaniel Macon, two prominent 
Congressmen, the former from Virginia and 
the latter from North Carolina. The Rev. 
Stephen Olin, D.D., was the first president. 
The college started off with a faculty of five pro- 
fessors and a Board of Trustees of thirty mem- 
bers. The college flourished from the first 
and took its place as one of the institutions of 
learning of high rank. In 1834 there were sixty- 
six students in the preparatory department and 
eighty-seven in the college.' 
In June, 1839, a resolution was passed by 
the Board to establish a normal department 
for the preparation of teachers. This is the 
year the first normal school was established in 
America at Salem, Massachusetts. The pro- 
visions of the resolution, however, were never

carried out. The college drew mainly from 
the states south of Virginia. 
Along in the 40’s the trustees reported a 
lack of funds to support the college, and at that 
time it seemed the embarrassment would be 
fatal to its future welfare, but in 1846 it was 
reported that $100,000 had been raised for the 
college and a great impetus was given to the 
college during the able administration of Dr. 
W. A. Smith. 
In March, 1847, there was an effort to organ- 
ize a medical department, but it never resulted 
in any permanent success. The college dis- 
banded in 1861, and during the Civil War period 
it was decided to remove the college to Ashland, 
Virginia, where it has ever since remained and 
prospered. 
Some of the most renowned scholars of 
America have been members of its faculty, 
some of whom are Thomas R. Price and James 
A. Harrison. The curriculum in this college

is organized into schools, and the students can, 
with the advice of parents or guardian, elect 
the course they prefer. This is the elective sys- 
tem as carried out in the University of Virginia. 
The chair of English was created at the opening 
of the college at Ashland and put on an equality 
with the ancient languages. The government 
of the college is administered on the same prin- 
ciple of respect for moral improvement of one’s 
self as a gentleman and not according to re- 
strictive regulation. This college has prepared 
many teachers for the secondary schools in 
Virginia. It has sent many students to higher 
institutions of learning for graduate work. 
Richmond College, 1830 
The Virginia Baptist Seminary was an out- 
  growth of the Virginia Baptist Education 
Society, organized in 1830. This seminary 
was founded for the purpose of assisting young 
men who in the judgment of the churches were 
called to the ministry, but others than those 
students for the ministry were admitted to the 
school. The attendance upon this school was

seventy pupils. It had early acquired a consid- 
erable acreage of land, and “ manual labor” was 
compulsory for all students. It will be observed 
that this was a feature of education which 
was strongly advocated by some educational 
leaders in America, and it had its appeal to those 
institutions which had meagre endowments, 
being a time in Virginia when agriculture was 
promoted by more or less active instruction at 
all the colleges. There was an effort to estab- 
lish manual labor as a scheme of education in 
connection with this college (1830). This was 
the time at which the “ Society for the Pro- 
motion of Manual Labor” was active in 
America. This scheme of education had its 
beginning in the Fellenburg movement in Swit- 
zerland (1806).! 
The institution was chartered as “‘ Richmond 
College”’ in 1841, with the Rev. Robert Ryland 
as president. It developed the college curricu- 
lum year by year by adding Freshman, Sopho- 
more, Junior, and Senior courses. In 1845 the

Junior year was added, and in 1849 the first 
graduate received the first Bachelor’s Degree. 
In the 50’s this college was in a flourishing con- 
dition with a considerable endowment and 
apparatus for its use. The college prospered 
up to the Civil War, when its sessions ceased. 
Soon after the surrender, the trustees reorganized 
the college on the University of Virginia system, 
with separate schools and elective courses. 
An endowment fund of $100,000 was raised, and 
the college grew in popularity. In 1870 the law 
department was organized. The General Baptist 
Association raised a further endowment fund.' 
In 1891 the college secured a new charter. 
The number of schools and professors was in- 
creased. In 1895 Dr. F. W. Boatwright was 
elected president, and since that time the en- 
dowment has been increased and a reorganiza- 
tion of the work of the college has been put 
into operation. The curricula now include ad- 
vanced courses in ancient languages, foreign 
languages, mathematics, science, history, and 
politics, philosophy, economics, and education. 
1 In 1878 the college had an endowment of $150,000.

In 1914 the college sold its property holdings 
in the city of Richmond, which had become 
very valuable by reason of the growth of the 
city in that direction, and moved to a large 
acreage at West Hampton and erected commo- 
dious buildings on the plan of Oxford University, 
England, and has affiliated with it West Hamp- 
ton College for women. 
The new buildings and grounds are now 
located outside the corporate limits of Rich- 
mond, but connected by an electric carline, and 
are worth about one quarter of a million dollars 
(the buildings and equipment costing $1,100,000 
inactual cash outlay). The groundsembrace 290 
acres in one solid block. The college at present 
has a productive endowment of $1,020,797.76. 
There are eleven full professors and seven 
associate professors in the academic depart- 
ment. The Board of Trustees has recently 
planned a very important increase in the pro- 
ductive endowment of the college. With this 
rich outlay of college equipment, Richmond 
College has started on an era of increased use- 
fulness to the church, the state, and the nation.

Summary. — This institution is the Baptist 
College sustained and supported by that denom- 
ination. It, however, like the other denom- 
inational colleges, is based on a broad and 
catholic foundation and seeks to give a liberal 
and professional education to people of all 
classes regardless of creed or belief. 
Emory and Henry College, 1838 
As early as 1833 the people of the south- 
western part of Virginia, and especially the 
ministers of that section, realized the need of 
establishing a college in that part of the state. 
This movement was headed by the Rev. Creed 
Fulton, a member of the Holston Conference 
of the Methodist Church. In 1835 the Holston 
Conference passed a resolution, looking to the 
establishment of a college somewhere in south- 
west Virginia. 
At a meeting of the citizens in the Glade 
Springs Presbyterian Church, a subscription 
of $5000 was raised. Presbyterians, as well 
as Methodists, gave liberally to this cause. 
About the same time another meeting was 
159 
   
-P-A-G-E-178
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
held at Abingdon, where $5000 was  sub- 
scribed for the college property. Soon a site 
was selected and a purchase of six hundred 
acres of land was made nine miles east of Abing- 
don. 
The institution was to be a “ manual labor ” 
school, in which the students could spend a part 
of each day in farm labor; by this service they 
were enabled to pay a part of their expenses 
at college. The school opened April 13, 1838, 
with one hundred students in attendance. The 
first president was the Rev. Charles Collins. 
The students were grouped into sections of 
eight or ten, and one of their number selected 
as an overmaster; they worked on the farm from 
two to six o’clock in the afternoons. Each 
student was allowed from two to five cents an 
hour for his labor. This plan, at first compul- 
sory, was soon abandoned, though it was con- 
tinued as a voluntary system for eight or ten 
years.

5.30 A.M., summons to prayers and roll call

HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
The college prospered from the first, but by 
1843 a considerable debt had accumulated, 
when the State Legislature loaned the college 
$18,000 from the Literary Fund; with this 
it cancelled the obligation. After this, the col- 
lege, without endowment or donation, kept 
clear of debt for thirty years. At the opening 
of the Civil War the college had 280 students 
in attendance. After the war the number of 
students fell off to a few more than a hundred. 
The site for the college was chosen because of 
its healthful locality and its remoteness from 
city temptations and distractions. It was lo- 
cated in the heart of the Blue Grass Region 
among the mountains of the southwest in the 
open, rural country. Much was made of this 
fact in the location of colleges in Virginia in 
the early years of the eighteenth century.

noke colleges chose their sites with this idea 
in view, and attention was called to this fact 
in advertising for students. 
Emory and Henry College was named for 
Rev. Bishop John Emory and Patrick Henry, 
the one a noted churchman and the other 
the famous orator and one-time Governor of 
Virginia. The curricula at Emory and Henry 
College included the traditional subjects of 
Latin, Greek, and mathematics. These were 
looked upon as standard subjects for mental 
discipline. The sciences, history, and the mod- 
ern languages later received due emphasis. 
Due time and attention has always been given 
to the mental and moral sciences. 
The college, though maintained and controlled 
by the Methodist Church, did not emphasize 
in its curriculum the distinctively theological 
branches of study, as some of the other de- 
nominational colleges did. The school seeks 
to give a liberal education in a thoroughly 
Christian atmosphere. 
The patronage of the college came from the 
slaveholding class, and the students were not 
162
-P-A-G-E-181
    HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
accustomed to the restraint they found at col- 
lege. Out of this situation there grew up a 
spirit of antagonism, with the student body on 
one side and the faculty on the other. The 
students did not look upon going to college 
as a privilege, but rather as a thing to be en- 
dured. This attitude lasted through the early 
history of Emory and Henry College, and on 
many occasions resulted in student rebellions; 
but this spirit has long passed away and a 
more healthful and wholesome sentiment among 
the student body prevails. Some of the more 
important factors bringing about this better 
state of affairs were: (1) the organization of a 
Young Men’s Christian Association, (2) organi- 
zation of literary societies, and (3) the inaugu- 
ration of a student publication. 
The two literary societies, Calliopean and 
Hermesian, have exercised a great influence 
upon the student life at Emory and Henry. 
These societies were organized about 1840 and 
have passed through the various difficulties 
that such organizations encounter, but at pres- 
ent each is housed in a sumptuously-furnished 
163
-P-A-G-E-182
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
hall, with library and other equipment. A 
splendid spirit of rivalry prevails between the 
two societies, and the debating and oratorical 
contests are the most attractive features of the 
commencement season. 
Summary.—Emory and Henry College is one 
of the typical denomination colleges maintained 
by the Methodist Church. It had its origin in 
the Holston Conference of that church, which 
includes territory in Virginia, Tennessee, and 
North Carolina. The government of the col- 
lege is vested in a Board of Trustees appointed 
by the Conference of the church. It has drawn 
its patronage mainly from Virginia, Tennessee, 
and North Carolina. Many of its graduates 
have gone into the ministry and many more into 
the various walks of professional and political life. 
Emory and Henry College has furnished many 
teachers for the public schools of the state. 
The Episcopal High School, 1839 
The Episcopal High School was established 
at the instance of Bishop Meade by the trustees 
of the Episcopal Theologial Seminary. This 
164
-P-A-G-E-183
    HIGHER. EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
school was opened in the fall of 1839 and was 
intended for the preparation of boys for college 
and the seminary near by. Both of these insti- 
tutions are located near Alexandria, which com- 
munity had long been the seat of various acad- 
emies and free schools endowed by persons of 
wealth, particularly by General Washington, 
whose estate was not far away. 
The High School was established with the 
following objects in view: (1) for a thorough 
education in Christian principles and the exer- 
cise of a wholesome moral and religious influence 
over the youth; (2) for a thorough teaching 
of every branch of preparatory learning, either 
for college or for business. 
The course of study comprises the classical and 
modern languages, English, history, mathematics, 
and the sciences. The work done at this school 
is of such advanced nature as to enable many 
of its graduates to enter the second or even the 
third year of a college course. The theological 
seminary near by is the school for the prepara- 
tion for the Episcopal ministry in Virginia and 
in Maryland. The theological study that had 
165
-P-A-G-E-184
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
been done so long at William and Mary College 
was transferred to this seminary at Alexandria, 
since the latter had become a semi-state and in- 
dependent college. 
The Episcopal High School and the Theologi- 
cal Seminary at Alexandria have, more distinctly 
than any other of the church schools, served 
the church under whose auspices they were 
established. 
Roanoke College, 1842 
The germ of Roanoke College was Virginia In- 
stitute, near Mt. Tabor in Augusta County. 
This school at first was a private venture of Rev. 
David F. Bittle, pastor of a Lutheran Church 
in that part of the county. He succeeded in 
interesting some members of the congregation 
in establishing a school for the teaching of the 
higher branches of English, ancient languages, 
and mathematics. He called to his assistance 
the Rev. Christopher C. Baughman, who con- 
ducted the classes in English and the ancient 
languages, while Dr. Bittle met the classes 
twice a week in mathematics. Two log houses 
166
-P-A-G-E-185
HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 | 
were erected on the land of Benjamin F. Hail- 
man, Esq., the one to be used for classes and 
the other for lodging of students. In May, 1843, 
the Lutheran Synod of Virginia took up the 
question of establishing a classical school within 
the bounds of that Synod. The Virginia In- 
stitute at Mt. Tabor was reported as being in 
such a flourishing condition that it was decided 
to locate the school there. In 1845 the school 
was incorporated as the Virginia Collegiate In- 
stitute. This school prospered for a few years, 
when the question of removing it to a more 
convenient location arose. Accordingly, the 
school was moved to Salem, Virginia, in 1847. 
In 1848, by order of the Trustees, the first 
building was erected on the present campus 
and the school started off on its career of 
usefulness. Funds were solicited in order to 
increase the accommodations at the school to 
meet the growing patronage. About 1853 there | 
was a strong sentiment in favor of turning | 
the institute into a college. There was serious 
opposition to this change among some mem- | 
bers of the faculty and the principal. The first | 
167

steps in the movement for securing a charter 
were taken by the students themselves. They 
held a meeting, passed resolutions, and _pre- 
sented them to Principal Baughman for his 
approval. He reluctantly gave his sanction, 
and a charter was granted by the legislature in 
March, 1853, and Virginia Collegiate Institute 
became Roanoke College. 
Dr. Bittle was elected the first president and 
served in that capacity until 1876. During 
that time the college passed through many diffi- 
culties, but it was substantially on a firm founda- 
tion and had a growing reputation at the time 
of his death. The college acquired property, 
maintained high standards of scholarship, and 
laid down for its ideal the policy of giving a 
liberal Christian education. It has always given   a prominent place in its curricula to courses of 
study in the Christian religion and the Bible. 
It receives its patronage from all religious de- 
nominations. Fifty per cent of its students 
at present are of other than the Lutheran de- 
nomination. During the Civil War Roanoke 
College was one of the few institutions of higher 
168
-P-A-G-E-187
  
HIGHER EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA, 1775-1860 
learning in the state that kept its doors open. 
In 1878 the college had nine members on its 
faculty and 168 students in attendance. The 
college started off with no endowment and re- 
ceived its support from student fees and annual 
contributions from friends of education. 
In 1872 the college organized a normal de- 
partment for the purpose of training teachers for 
the public schools of the state, and many of the 
very best teachers in the secondary schools of 
Virginia got their training here. The evidence 
of the interest in training teachers is manifest 
in the books on the “‘ History of Education ” 
written by a member of the faculty of this 
college, Dr. F. V. N. Painter. The president 
and members of the faculty have given valuable 
service to the educational activities of the state, 
particularly at the time the public school 
system was being organized, by conducting 
teachers’ institutes and offering advantages at 
the college for the training of teachers. Dr. 
Painter originated the plan of a reading course 
for teachers in 1884. The institution has taken 
a firm rank as a standard college. It has 
169

doubled its efficiency in the last fifteen years. 
The college numbers among its graduates some 
of the most gifted scholars in America and 
men in all the walks of political and professional 
life. 
Summary. — Roanoke College is the con- 
tribution of the Lutheran Church and other 
church people to the cause of Christian liberal 
education for the service of church and state.

CHAPTER X 
STATE INSTITUTIONS FOR HIGHER LEARNING. 
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
“Tym great man, whose conception the pecul- 
iar and unique structure of the University 
originated and whose persistent efforts for 
almost half a century at length brought into 
being, always connected University and common 
school education as necessary parts of one 
whole.” ! 
Jefferson’s Early Plan for a System of 
Education. — Jefferson’s plan for an educa- 
tional system for Virginia, as a member of the 
Committee of co-revisers of the laws, to coin- 
cide with the new system of government, 
included a general plan of education for all 
classes of the people alike. It was based on 
the democratic idea that the education of the

1872, p. 109. 
171 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
people is a proper subject and care of govern- 
ment. This plan comprehended three types 
of schools : 
(1) Elementary schools, to be maintained at public 
charge in the local communities. 
(2) General schools, corresponding to academies and 
colleges, or modern, secondary schools, to be supported 
in part by direct State appropriation and in part by tuition 
fees... The course of study in these schools embraced in- 
struction in ancient and modern languages, the sciences, 
mental and moral philosophy, and political sciences. 
(3) A University,! in which were to be taught “all 
branches of knowledge in the highest degree,” and to be 
supported wholly by the state. 
This wise and magnificent plan failed of 
passage at this time. In 1796 a plan for pri- 
mary schools passed, but it was ineffective 
(see p. 102). From time to time the plan was 
submitted to the Legislature, but that body 
felt that it would incur too great a tax upon 
the people and refused to pass the act proposed. 
In 1809 Mr. Jefferson, retiring from the presi- 
dency of the United States to his home at 
Monticello, in Virginia, again took up his pet 
1 It was the original plan to make the state University out of William 
and Mary College. 
172
-P-A-G-E-191
  THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
scheme for a system of education in Virginia, 
maintaining to the last that a scheme for pri- 
mary education should go hand in hand with 
any provision for higher education. In 1810 
the Literary Fund was established and _ pro- 
vided a basis for a permanent state fund for 
educational purposes. In this Jefferson saw 
a possible chance for a scheme to carry, and 
gave the energies of his last years to the accom- 
plishment of this plan.! 
Public education was a part of his political 
philosophy, and ‘while he saw the university 
rise in all its architectural beauty and in its 
provisions for thorough instruction, he must 
have regretted that the people of Virginia 
were so unwise as to neglect so long the pro- 
vision for primary instruction for all the people 
of the state.2 He says: “ Where the press is 
free and every man able to read, all is safe.” 
1In a letter to Hugh White, in 1810, Jefferson writes: “No one more 
sincerely wishes the spread of information among mankind than I do, 
and no one has greater confidence in its effect toward supporting free and 
good government.” 
2Tn a letter to George Wythe, Jefferson writes : “Preach, my dear sir, 
a crusade against ignorance. Establish and improve the laws for educat- 
ing the common people.” 
173 
 
-P-A-G-E-192
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
Jefferson’s Struggle for a University. — 
Jefferson sat in his office at Monticello and kept 
in close touch with all that was going on in 
Richmond while the Legislature was in session. 
He wrote, in the form of letters to his friends 
there, the argument for the university and for a 
system of primary schools. There seems to have 
been some question among the legislators as to 
the good effect of education for: citizenship. In 
the defence of the bill pending in 1817, he writes: 
And will the wealthy have no retribution? And 
what will this be? The peopling of his neighborhood 
with honest, useful, and enlightened people, understand- 
ing their own rights and firm in their perpetuation. So 
when his own descendants become poor, which they do 
within three generations, their children will be educated 
by the then rich, and the little advance he now makes 
toward poverty, while rich himself, will be repaid by the 
then rich to his descendants when they become poor and 
thus give them a chance of rising again. .. . A system 
of education which shall reach every description of citi- 
zen from the richest to the poorest, as it was the earliest, 
so will it be the latest of all public concerns in which I 
shall permit myself to take an interest. Nor am I tena- 
cious of the form in which it shall be introduced. 
In another letter to his friend Cabell he 
taunts the legislators by comparing the prog- 
174
-P-A-G-E-193
    
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
ress in education made in the state of New 
York. He writes: 
Six thousand common schools in New York, fifty in 
each; 300,000 in all. $160,000 paid to the masters 
annually of forty academies. The whole appropriation 
for education is estimated as two and a half million of 
dollars. What a pigmy is Virginia to this and with a 
population almost equal to that of New York, and whence 
this difference? From the difference their rulers set on 
the value of knowledge and the prosperity it produces. 
Jefferson evidently intended that the uni- 
versity should be the capstone of the educa- 
tional system of the state, but there must have 
come a time when he gave up in despair the 
hope of an effective system of primary educa- 
tion and turned all his attention to the estab- 
lishment of a state University. This spirit is 
expressed in a letter to William Barry, July 12, 
1822: 
The reports show that our primary schools are be- 
coming completely abortive and must be abandoned 
very shortly, after costing us to this day 180 thousand 
dollars, and yet to cost 45,000 more until it shall be dis- 
continued, and if a single boy has received the elements 
of a common education it must be in some part of the 
country not known to me. 
175 
     
-P-A-G-E-194
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
" The fight for the state University was a 
long and at times a bitter one. There were 
many factors in the situation that presented a 
strong opposition. (1) It was an innovation. 
It had not been the custom for a state to build 
and maintain an institution for higher learning. 
That for centuries in Europe had been the 
function of the church and it had become the 
custom in America. At least it was not thought 
in Virginia to be a function of government to 
maintain and control higher education. (2) At 
this time (1818) in Virginia there was a great 
fear among the people of taxation, and to create 
a new demand for public money looked like a 
dangerous move. (3) The various church de- 
nominations had already established colleges, 
and these were in a measure endowed and in a 
more or less flourishing condition. These seemed 
to be sufficient for higher training in the state. 
There was a strong effort on the part of these in- 
stitutions, which were well represented in the 
Legislature, to have the state subsidize these 
colleges. This was set forth as a more economi- 
cal plan, and thus it would not be binding upon 
176
-P-A-G-E-195
  
  THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
the state to continue these appropriations 
forever. (4) There was an effort to move Wil- 
liam and Mary College from Williamsburg to 
Richmond, as a direct move to thwart the 
efforts of the friends of the state University. 
(5) There was great difference of opinion 
among the well-to-do people of the state and 
the growing power of the middle class as to the 
value of higher education to the state, such as 
they proposed in the curriculum for the uni- 
versity. All these matters came up in one 
form or another, in the debates connected with 
the establishment of a state University; Jeffer- 
son combated them with all the learning, 
wisdom, and forethought of his masterful mind. 
His enemies accused him of meddling, of in- 
sincerity, of infidelity, and an effort to bring 
additional burden upon the state by adding 
to the already heavy tax rate for a thing looked 
upon by them as a highly theoretical scheme. 
Tt will be seen that the university had its birth 
in the midst of all these conflicting forces, 
political, economical, social, educational, and 
religious. 
N 177

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
The Establishment of the University. — In 
February, 1818, an act passed by the General 
Assembly appropriated the greater amount of 
the proceeds of the Literary Fund to the 
primary schools of the poor, and gave $15,000 
annually to the endowment and support of a 
university to be styled “Tur University oF 
Vireinia.” A committee was appointed to 
determine the site and general plan for the 
institution and report to the next meeting of 
the General Assembly. Then came a rivalry 
among the different cities and towns for the 
location of the institution. Washington and 
Lee University at Lexington was a strong appli- 
cant for the place. Staunton had its supporters, 
but Jefferson, who was a member of the com- 
mittee, and to whom was attributed the prepara- 
tion of the report of the committee, controlled 
matters, and it was decided to establish the uni- 
versity at Charlottesville, with Central College 
as a nucleus. The commission was composed 
of the following leading citizens appointed 
by the government: Thomas Jefferson, James 
Madison, Creed Taylor, Peter Randolph, James

Johnson, and Littleton W. Tazewell. This com- 
mittee met on August 1, 1818, at the tavern   near the top of the Blue Ridge Mountains in 
Rockfish Gap, and after mature deliberation 
they adopted a full report, providing that 
the university be established at Charlottesville, 
“Central College,” and outlined a complete 
plan for the administration and curriculum 
for the university. The following are excerpts 
from the report of recommendations made to 
the General Assembly by that body. 
Excerpts from the Report of the Commis- 
sion. — The objects of primary education deter- 
mine its character and limits. These objects 
would be: 
(1) To give every citizen the information he needs to a 
transact his own business. 
179
-P-A-G-E-198
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
(2) To enable him to calculate for himself and to ex- 
press and preserve his ideas, contracts, and accounts in 
writing. 
(3) To improve by reading his faculties and morals. 
(4) To understand his duties to his neighbors and his 
country, and to discharge with confidence the functions 
confided to him by either. 
(5) To know his rights. To exercise with order and 
justice those he retains; to choose with discretion the 
fiduciary of those he delegates and to notice their con- 
duct with diligence, candor, and judgment. 
(6) And in general to observe with intelligence and 
faithfulness all the social relations [in which] he shall be 
placed. 
And this brings us to the point where com- 
mence the higher branches of education which 
the Legislature required. These were designed : 
(1) To form the statesmen, legislators, and judges on 
whom public prosperity and individual happiness are so 
much to depend. 
(2) To expound the principles and structure of gov- 
ernment, the laws which regulate the intercourse of 
nations, those formed municipalities for our own govern- 
ment and a sound spirit of legislation, which, banishing 
all arbitrary and unnecessary restraints on individual 
action, leave us free to whatever does not violate the equal 
rights of others. 
(3) To harmonize and promote the interests of agri- 
culture, manufactories, and commerce and by well in- 
180
-P-A-G-E-199
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
formed views of political economy, to give a free scope to 
the public industry. 
(4) To develop the reason faculties of our youth, en- 
large their minds, cultivate their morals, and instill into 
them the precepts of virtue and order. 
(5) To enlighten them with mathematical and phys- 
ical sciences which advance the arts and administer to 
the health, the subsistence and the comforts of human 
life; and generally to form them to habits of reflection 
and correct action, rendering them examples of virtue to 
others and of happiness within themselves. 
“These are the objects of that higher educa- 
tion, the benefits and blessings of which the 
Legislature now proposes to provide for the 
good and ornament of their country, the 
gratification and happiness of their fellow cit- 
izens, of the parent especially and his prog- 
eny, on whom all of his affections are concen- 
trated.” 
The report goes on into a rather lengthy 
argument for the practical value of the sciences, 
referring to the fact that there are many good 
people who do not believe that sciences are of 
any use to men. The argument closes with 
the following statement as to the national 
benefits of education. 
181

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
Nor must we omit to mention among the benefits of 
education, the incalculable advantage of training up the 
counsellors to administer the affairs of our country in all 
its departments, legislative, executive, and judiciary, 
and to bear their proper share in the counsels of our 
National government. Nothing more than education 
advances the prosperity, the power and the happiness of a 
nation. 
Outline of the Curriculum. — “ We present 
the following tabular statement of the branches 
of learning which we think should be taught in 
the University, forming them into groups, each 
of which are within the power of a single pro- 
fessor ”’ : 
1. Ancient languages, — Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. 
2. Modern languages, — French, Spanish, Italian, 
Anglo Saxon. 
83. Pure Mathematics, — Algebra, Flexions, Geom- 
etry, Architecture, Military and Naval Science. 
4. Physico Mathematics, (a) Mechanics, Statics, Dy- 
namics, Pneumatics, Acoustics, Optics, Astronomy, and 
Geography. 
5. Physico Mathematics, (b) Physics, Chemistry, 
Mineralogy. 
6. Natural Sciences, — Botany, Zodlogy. 
7. Natural Science, — Anatomy and Medicine. 
8. Science of Government and Politics, — Govern- 
ment, Political Economy, Laws of Nature and Nations.

9. Science of Government, — Municipal Law. 
10. Idealogy, General Grammar, Ethics, Rhetoric, 
Belles Lettres, Fine Arts.1 
The report of the Commission closes with a 
discussion of some other important matters. 
It is greatly to be wished that the preliminary schools, 
either on public or private foundations, be distributed 
throughout the state as preparatory to the entrance of 
students into the University. At these schools a boy 
should be rendered able to read easier authors in Latin 
and Greek and, too, might be taught English grammar. 
The higher branches of numerical arithmetic, the geom- 
etry of straight lines and circles, and the elements of 
navigation ‘and geography to a sufficient degree. 
They speak of gymnastics as a necessary part of 
education at the University, also the use of tools, and the 
arts that embellish life as dancing, music, and drawing. 
No provision is made for these except that they may be 
taught by special teachers, the students paying tuition 
for this instruction. 
We have proposed no professor of Divinity. This 
will be within the province of the professor of ethics. 
1The Analectic Magazine, published in Philadelphia in 1819. The 
editor heads the report of the commission with this statement: “In the 
following paper, our readers will find a characteristic trait of the simplicity 
of our National manners, and a remarkable instance of practical Republi- 
canism. The report is said to be from the pen of Jefferson and contains 
many new suggestions worth the attention of our seminaries of learning 
already established.” Vol. XIII, p. 103.

We have thought it proper at this point to leave any 
sect to provide as they think fittest the means of further 
instruction in their own particular tenets. 
This report is all-inclusive in arguments and 
complete in schemes for higher education. It 
has the stamp of Jefferson upon it. But this 
report did not settle the matter finally. There 
was a strong effort on the part of some members 
of the General Assembly to defeat the bill or 
at least change the site to either Lexington or 
Staunton, but, fortunately for the university, 
the bill passed January 1, 1819. The fate of 
the university throughout the troublous times 
was in the hands of Jefferson at Monticello 
and Cabell in the Senate. The bill provided 
that the immediate control of the univer- 
sity was to be vested in a rector and Board of 
Visitors composed of nine men appointed by 
the governor. Their immediate task was to 
find funds to erect buildings for the university 
and to employ a faculty of instructors. These 
two matters were left almost entirely to 
Jefferson, who gave his personal attention to 
them.

THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
The Funds for the University. — A few years 
before the Legislature had chartered Central 
College, which had been organized and put in 
readiness for college work. All this had been 
done, at least in the mind of Jefferson, to form 
the nucleus for the university. All the lands 
and rights of Central College were transferred 
to the university. The funds for this institu- 
tion were $35,102 in subscriptions, $3195.86 
from the sale of glebe lands in the county of 
Albemarle. In addition, there was about $8000 
available from other sources, making a total of 
$46,000 or $47,000 transferred to the university. 
The annual appropriation from the Literary 
| Fund of $15,000 made up the funds directly 
available for the use of the Board of Visitors. 
The Visitors petitioned the Legislature from year 
to year and secured either additional funds or 
power to borrow funds. By this means a good 
amount from the Literary Fund? was used 
in the erection of the university buildings and 
for the employment of a faculty of instructors.

The University Buildings. “On the 5th of May, 1817, 
Mr. Jefferson presented to the Board of Visitors (Central 
College) a plan for erecting a distinct pavilion or build- 
ing for each separate professor and arranging them around 
a square. With the certainty that characterized all his 
purposes, he suggested, and the Board approved, the 
drawing of parallel lines and the location of the pavilions 
on one or the other of them. In time one of these lines 
became East Lawn and the other West Lawn.” ! 
The proctor was empowered with the funds 
in hand to “agree with proper workmen ” 
for the erection of the first pavilion. The 
style of these was to be of “ regular architec- 
ture.” Year by year, as funds became avail- 
able, the pavilions for the professors and dormi- 
tories for the students were completed. October 
5, 1822, Jefferson writes : 
Ten pavilions are almost finished, and the six hotels, 
three on East Street and three on West Street, will be 
plastered and lathed this fall. Ninety-seven of the 109 
dormitories are ready. 
Jefferson gave his personal supervision to © 
the erection of the ‘‘ Academic Village” he 
had so wisely and tastefully planned. He had

-P-A-G-E-205
  
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
spent many years in European capitals, and 
had made drawings of many of the public 
buildings in Rome and Paris, and with this 
fund of information he, better than any one 
else in America, was able to design the best 
architectural form for an institution like the 
university.1 
The general plan of the buildings is a series 
of pavilions or professors’ homes, ten in number, 
with dormitories for students between these, 
with a Tuscan colonnade so the students can 
pass from school to school under shelter. On 
the north is the rotunda, a copy of the Pantheon 
at Rome, where the library is housed. On 
parallel lines to these buildings on the lawn are 
the east and west ranges. These are made 
up of hotels and dormitories with covered ways 
in the form of cloisteral arcades, the whole 
architectural scheme making one of the most 
unique architectural erections in America. 
Jefferson was always careful to preserve his

original architectural exterior. He did not 
care so much about the arrangement of the 
interior. In a number of his letters Jefferson 
refers to the fact that this type of architecture, 
while expensive, was necessary, if they were to 
be able to induce the best scholars of Europe 
to become professors at the University of Vir- 
ginia. Since these original buildings, others 
had been added: the University Chapel, the 
new academic buildings, enclosing the quad- 
rangle on the south (1897), the Brooks Museum, 
Fairwether Gymnasium, and, still later, Madi- 
son Hall, the home of the University Y.M.C.A., 
and the new hospital buildings on the east, 
the Commons, a spacious home for the presi- 
dent, the new law building, and the Educational 
buildings. 
The First Faculty of the University. — Here 
again Jefferson’s wise counsel prevailed. His 
wide acquaintance with the scholars of Europe 
and America made him eminently fitted to 
secure the sanest assistance in the important 
part of the work of founding a university. He 
was familiar with the scientific movement so 
188

THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
well under way in the European universities, 
and saw the practical possibility of this new 
field of research. This movement, in its more 
advanced form, had not yet reached America; 
therefore, it was not likely that there could be 
found in this country a sufficient number of 
scholars to take up the work of instruction in 
the university. Dr. Cooper of Pennsylvania 
had been secured, but strong opposition to him 
had developed among the church people, on 
account of his radical views on ethical and 
religious matters. Mr. Bowditch of Boston 
and Mr. Ticknor of Salem were offered places 
on the faculty, but they declined. Then came 
a great hunt for scholars in Europe. Mr. 
Francis W. Gilmore was sent to Europe on the 
mission of securing suitable scholars for the 
faculty of the University of Virginia. In March 
of the next year, 1825, we find the following 
professors domiciled at the University, ready 
for work: 
Ancient Languages : Professor George Long, 
Modern Languages : Professor George Blat- 
termann, 
189  
-P-A-G-E-208
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
Mathematics : Professor Hewitt Key, 
Natural Philosophy : Professor Charles Bonny- 
castle, 
Anatomy and Medicine : Professor Robley Dungle- 
son. 
The American members were Mr. Henry St. 
George Tucker, professor of Law, and Dr. John 
Patton Emmett, professor of Natural History. 
Mr. Tucker was elected the first chairman of 
the faculty. 
Scheme of Government for the University. — 
The Board of Visitors committed the admin- 
istration of the affairs of the university to the 
faculty, organized with the chairman as the 
chief .executive officer. There were subordi- 
nate officials with distinct and _ prescribed 
duties. These were proctor, patron, bursar, 
hotel keeper, and janitor. Jefferson had laid 
down some standards in the Rockfish Gap 
Commission’s report concerning the “ govern- 
ment of the young in large collections.” Speak- 
ing of fear as a motive for right conduct, he 
says: 
The human character is susceptible of other incite- 
ments to correct conduct more worthy of employ and of 
190

better effect. Pride of character, laudable ambition, and 
moral disposition are innate correctives of the indiscre- 
tions of that lively age... . Hardening them to dis- 
grace, corporal punishment, and servile humiliations can- 
not be the process for producing erect character.” ! 
But these ideals evidently did not prevail 
after the death of Jefferson in 1826, for in 1828 
students in matriculating at the University 
were required to subscribe to an eight-page 
(printed) document) filled with prohibitions, 
inhibitions, and penalties.2 On several occa- 
sions the students rebelled against these rules, 
and it was with difficulty that matters were 
brought to a satisfactory adjustment.2 The 
fact that so many members of the faculty 
were foreigners and did not understand the 
social customs of southern people had no 
little to do with the antagonism existing be- 
tween the student body and the faculty. Out 
of the spirit of these times germinated the

| Honor System so famous in connection with 
the University of Virginia. None can say just 
when the system was instituted. On July 
2, 1842, Professor Henry St. George Tucker 
offered, and the faculty adopted, the following 
resolution : 
Resolved, That in all future examinations for dis- 
tinction and other honors of the University, each candi- 
date shall attach to the written answers presented by 
him on such examination a certificate in the following 
words: “I, A. B., do hereby certify on honor, that I have 
derived no assistance during the time of this examina- 
tion from any source whatever, whether oral or written, 
or in print, in giving the above answers.” ! 
This spirit has developed into a sort of 
chivalry which goes beyond the mere matter 
of cheating on examinations and has crystal- 
lized into a public sentiment which has regard 
for manliness and the honorable instincts of a 
gentleman.? This spirit has characterized the 
University of Virginia for a century and is unique 
among American colleges and universities.

  THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
The Cardinal Principles of the University 
of Virginia. — The political philosophy of Jeffer- 
son may be recognized in everything his hands 
touched. The following cardinal features have 
always been the fundamental policies of the 
university : 
1. Freedom of teaching in independent elective schools. 
2. Freedom of study, — student selects his own tickets. 
3. The Honor System, —no espionage, freedom of con- 
duct under obligation of observing the laws of the state. 
4. Proficiency in intermediate and final examinations, 
— not class attendance, not daily examinations nor time 
spent, nor degrees attained elsewhere. 
5. No graduation in a degree ; all “cum laude” or none. 
6. No honorary degrees conferred. 
7. Degrees to bear English not Latin names. 
8. No records, no college honors except a certificate of 
having passed the examination in a school or in a number 
of schools. 
9. No compulsory attendance on prayers or services. 
10. Each denomination to send a clergy to conduct 
daily prayers and Sunday service for two weeks.! 
The Service and Influence of the Univer- 
sity. — Probably no other institution of learn- 
ing has wielded a more definite influence in 
higher education in the South than the Uni- 
1 Pamphlet, University Regulations.

versity of Virginia. Its student body was made 
up of men from every section of the country, but 
more particularly did they come from the South 
and West. Upon the schools and colleges 
established in the South after the 40’s one can 
detect the University of Virginia stamp. In 
form of administration and standards of schol- 
arship, methods of instruction and other fun- 
damental policies, the University of Virginia 
has been the model. In the profession of law 
and medicine she has sent a host of graduates 
into every part of the South and Southwest. 
She claims to be unique in the number of her 
sons in the service of the national government, 
_ particularly in the navy and in the legislative 
and judiciary departments. In this regard 
Jefferson’s idealism, as expressed in the report 
of the Rockfish Gap Commission, saw its com- 
plete realization. 
The Great Fire of 1893. — The Annex and 
the Rotunda were burned on Sunday, October 
27, 1895. The Annex, containing laboratories, 
class rooms, and the auditorium, in which hung 
the famous painting, the “School of Athens,” 
194

  THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
were totally destroyed. The walls of the 
Rotunda remained standing, but valuable books 
in the library went up in the flames. Volumes 
which can never be replaced were lost. This 
was a great calamity to the university, but 
friends of the institution responded to its needs, 
and in a few years the university arose, more 
resplendent in architectural design. The Ro- 
tunda was remodelled and new buildings added, 
until to-day the university is more beautiful 
from an architectural standpoint than ever 
before in its history. 
A New Era for the University. — ‘‘When the 
University was established there was no insti- 
tution in the world that closely resembled it. 
The University of Virginia came from the brain 
of one man and that man’s purpose in education 
was the new one to safeguard the liberties of his 
country by increasing the moral and intellectual 
stature of the citizens. In many respects, a great 
chasm separated it from Harvard, Princeton, and 
other dominant institutions of eighty years ago.” +

-P-A-G-E-214
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
To-day that difference is not so great, but 
the old ideals continue vital under a somewhat 
new régime. In recent years there have been 
some important changes. 
(1) Faculty government through a chairman 
has been abandoned, and a president has been 
elected. Edwin Anderson Alderman, an edu- 
cator of wide experience, was chosen to the first 
presidency on June 14, 1904, and his administra- 
tion is now in full progress. The question of a 
president for the university came up a number of 
times, particularly in 1846, and in 1897, among 
the members of the Board of Visitors, but a 
strong conservatism among the alumni and some 
members of the faculty delayed definite action 
for a number of years. 
(2) These changes in the executive affairs 
naturally led to some other consequent changes. 
These have all been made with profound rever- 
ence for the past but with the belief in the wise 
pre-occupation of those who control educational 
affairs in the present and the future. The old 
Jeffersonian system of independent schools in 
which the professor was absolutely free to control 
196
-P-A-G-E-215
  
THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 
in his own way the affairs in his particular field 
of instruction gave place to a new scheme in 
which the relationship between the president, 
the professor, and the faculty has been adjusted 
so as to result in greater unity and coérdination 
in the various departments, but in no essential 
diminution of the freedom of teaching. 
(3) There has ensued a logical reorganization 
of the whole institution wherein its various 
schools and departments have been more clearly 
outlined and their educational and administra- 
tive functions definitely extended and defined. 
The line of separation between the college and 
the university is now sharply drawn. The 
graduate school and the professional schools 
of law, medicine, engineering have found their 
places. The requirements for admission and 
graduation have been brought into closer relation 
to the standards of the educational world of 
to-day, and so ordered as to result not only in 
juster articulation to the secondary schools, but 
also in more perfect relation to the demands 
made upon educated men by the modern world. 
(4) This has resulted in a closer and more 
197 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
helpful union between the university and the 
secondary schools, and thus bound together 
the whole system in codperative ties. 
(5) An enormous expansion of inward power 
and scope has come about, manifested by an 
increase in teaching staff of 100 per cent, of 
income of over 100 per cent, of the value in new 
buildings and laboratories of 25 per cent, and in 
student attendance of 60 per cent. | 
(6) Increased ability and purpose to reach 
and serve the advancing democratic life of the 
people without as well as within university walls 
has come about, testified to by the establishment 
of great new departments like the university 
hospital, the summer school, the department of 
education, the school of economic geology, the 
school of forestry, university extension service. 
(7) Emphasis upon the dignity and necessity 
of social service as the final aim of educated 
manhood has been added to the older and 
eternal concept of integrity, individualism, and 
personal attainment.

STATE INSTITUTIONS FOR HIGHER LEARNING 
(Continued) 
State Schools of Technology 
Virginia Military Institute (1839). — So many 
of the features of the University of Virginia were 
in new and untried fields of education, but 
Jefferson pointed out other fields which the uni- 
versity had not occupied. Some of these were 
the fields which have since been covered by mili- 
tary academies, technological schools, and the 
agricultural and mechanical colleges which have 
developed in the last decade or more. The 
Scotch-Irish people felt more keenly probably 
than any other people the meaning of liberty 
and individual rights, and took part in all the 
movements that have resulted in the basal poli- 
cies of the American government. They were 
always ready to take up arms, if necessary, for the 
protection of these rights. Lexington, Virginia, 
was one of the strongest centres of this Scotch-

Irish population in the state. Very early in the 
history of the state Lexington was made one of 
the points for storing arms and munitions of war 
for the convenience of the citizens west of the 
mountains. A small brick building was erected 
for this purpose, and at times soldiers were sta- 
tioned there to guard the arsenal. All this was 
taken as a matter of course for many years, but 
one night the question of converting this muni- 
tion depot into a state military school became 
the subject of discussion in a meeting of the 
Franklin Literary Society in Lexington (1834) 
and resulted in the state becoming interested in 
the proposition, through the friends of John T. L. 
Preston, and, in the year 1839, the state Legis-   lature passed an act founding a state military 
school on the plan of the military academy at 
West Point. Appropriations for the necessary 
buildings were made, three professors appointed, 
and the school started off with seventeen cadets 
answering to the first roll call. At first the 
Legislature contemplated the organization of the 
school as a department of Washington College, 
but in 1839 repealed that part of the act and 
200
-P-A-G-E-219
en ee re et ee 
STATE INSTITUTIONS FOR HIGHER LEARNING 
gave the school an independent organization.! 
Captain Crozet, who had given up a professor- 
ship in West Point Military Academy, and who 
was now the state engineer of Virginia in charge 
of the construction of the lock-and-dam system 
of improvement of the James River, became in- 
terested in the idea of a military school, and to 
him is due much of the credit for the original 
scheme of organization and development of the 
institution. The school took on a thorough 
military character from the outset. Captain 
Crozet was the chairman of the first Board of 
Visitors. The school has always been technical 
in its tendencies, giving emphasis to the subjects 
of applied mathematics, such as engineering in 
all its aspects, with such accompanying courses 
in history, English, and the modern languages 
as to give a liberalizing effect upon the student. 
Strong emphasis is given to the study of military 
science and the art of war. 
The V. M. I. a Normal School. — In the 40’s, 
when there was felt a strong need for trained

teachers in the public schools, an effort was made 
to use the state school as a place to train 
teachers. Accordingly, the Legislature passed an 
act (1844), providing that sixty state students 
should be educated there, free of charge, on the 
obligation that they teach in the public schools 
for two years. The same rule applied to the 
University of Virginia, and the denominational 
college sought appropriations from the Literary 
Fund for the same purpose. The institution 
has always maintained the highest ideals of the 
soldier. Manly character, courage, self-control, 
faithfulness, and patriotism are some of the vir- 
tues inculcated. The school has always been in 
favor in the state. The record made during 
the Civil War, when the students marched away 
to war and took part in the battle of New Mar- 
ket, where they exhibited bravery and skill in the 
art of war, gave the institution fame which 
reached far beyond the borders of Virginia. 
The buildings were burned by the northern 
army (1864), but they were restored soon after- 
wards and the school reorganized and devel- 
oped along the lines the Board of Visitors had so 
202
-P-A-G-E-221
  
STATE INSTITUTIONS FOR HIGHER LEARNING 
wisely planned for it. The fame of so many 
of its alumni in the service of the Confederate 
Army, and particularly the striking military 
record of one of the members of its faculty, 
Gen. T. J. Jackson, and the record of the cadets 
of the institute at the battle of New Market, 
brought the school into prominence, so that 
after the war the youth of the South flocked to 
the school, and since then its patronage has not 
been confined to Virginia, but students from 
every section of the South have sought entrance 
to its halls. In 1872 there were 230 cadets in 
attendance from other states. The affairs of 
the Institute had been so ably managed that the 
school has never cost the state very much be- 
yond the $1500 annuity coming from that 
source. The school has prospered under the 
two motives that have guided its activities: 
(1) To educate officers for service in our armies. 
(2) To impart general knowledge to the youth of our 
country. 
The last Congress of the United States (1914) 
reimbursed the institute for its destruction 
during the war, which amount ($100,000),

will enable the school to enlarge its usefulness 
and serve the state more effectively than it 
has done in the past, and in larger numbers 
than ever this school will send out efficient 
workers into the fields of teaching, engineering, 
and practical business. 
The Virginia Polytechnic Institute (1872). — 
The Virginia Polytechnic Institute belongs to 
the type of technical schools established by the 
gifts from the United States government in 
land scrip. The Legislature of Virginia passed 
an act in March, 1872, distributing this grant: 
one-third to Hampton Normal for colored people, 
and two-thirds to be used in the establishing 
of the Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical 
College ' to be located in Montgomery County. 
The property of Preston and Olin Institute was 
transferred to the Board of Visitors of the new 
college without cost. The County of Mont- 
gomery gave $20,000 in addition to the prop-

erty of the Institute. The Visitors purchased 
the farm of Col. Robt. C. Preston, containing 
250 acres of valuable land. With the lands 
transferred by the Preston and Olin Institute, it 
made the total acreage 300. The report of the 
Committee of Visitors is an exhaustive state- 
ment as to the kind of school needed at Blacks- 
burg. It quotes authorities on the subject of 
technical education. It describes in detail the 
type of training as carried on in Prussia, Switzer- 
land, Austria, and France, and gives the status 
of technical and agricultural education in 
America. The kind of training to be given un- 
der the Federal Act was definitely set forth in 
the report. First, it was to be a school where 
such “branches as are related to agriculture 
and the mechanic arts shall be taught in such 
manner as the State Legislature shall provide.” 
The Industrial Feature. —It was to be a 
school for the industrial classes. Farmers and 
mechanics constitute the great bulk of popula- 
tion in Virginia. It was estimated at that time 
(1872) that there were 125,000 farmers and 
mechanics in the state. These figures show 
205

where lie the great fields for technical and agri- 
cultural education. In August, 1872, the Board 
of Visitors elected Charles L. C. Minor the first 
president of the institution, and three professors, 
one each in English, natural philosophy and 
chemistry, technical agriculture and mechanics. 
Natural history and farm management were to 
be added in February. It was the plan that the 
students should engage in “ manual labor ” as 
a part of the work of the school. The students 
who matriculated the first years of the institu- 
tion’s history were poorly prepared for the tech- 
nical work planned, so it was necessary to offer 
high school and even grammar school courses.! 
Later Developments. — Military training has 
always been a feature in this institution. In 
1888 the college reported 110 students and eight 
professors. General L. L. Lomax was president 
then. In 1890 Dr. J. M. McBryde was called 
to the presidency of the college, and the school 
was reorganized. It gained in the number of 
students and in efficiency, and in a few years 
came to be a great agricultural and industrial

school. The state made the necessary appro- 
priation to develop an efficient plant and equip- 
ment, so that by 1895 there were 400 students 
in attendance, by which time the name of the 
school was changed to The Virginia Polytechnic 
Institute. It was giving full courses in agri- 
culture, the mechanic arts, foreign languages, 
economics, and history, and the applied sciences 
and mathematics. In 1905 Dr. Paul Barringer 
of the University of Virginia was called to the 
head of the institute, and under his management 
the school added many new practical courses. 
The attendance increased and the school flour- 
ished. In 1913 J. D. Eggleston, former state 
superintendent, was elected to the presidency 
of the school. A great impetus has been given 
to the teaching of agriculture in the last few 
years, and the school more nearly fulfils its origi- 
nal purpose than ever before. 
General Summary. — It will be seen from the 
three institutions just described that\ the state 
has exercised a constructive interest in higher 
education (on three main lines, professional, 
military, and technical. The University of Vir-

ginia at Charlottesville provides higher training 
in academic lines, law, and medicine. The 
Virginia Military Institute at Lexington pro- 
vides military training and kindred technical 
instruction, and the Virginia Polytechnic In- 
stitute at Blacksburg, agricultural and general 
mechanical training. In each of these schools 
efforts were made to meet the needs for the 
training of teachers, but this function was not 
met in a satisfactory way by these schools, so 
the state at a later period established state 
normal schools in various parts of the state to 
meet the need connected with the more efficient 
conduct of the public school system.’ The de- 
nominational colleges continue to furnish train- 
ing in a liberal education under distinct Christian 
influences and instruction in general theology 
and denominational creeds. The statute of re- 
ligious freedom, fathered by Thomas Jefferson 
and passed by the General Assembly in 1786, 
laid down a policy of state institutions of higher 
learning, which left out of account the teaching 
of religion in the state schools. Training in 
this line was amply provided for in the church

It will be seen from the last two chapters that the 
people of Virginia provided amply for the higher 
education of their youth. 
The United States census of 1850 gives the 
following table which shows that Virginia had 
more young men in her higher institutions of 
learning than any of the other states:

  CHAPTER XII 
A STATE PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
1869 
Social and Economic Conditions. — The pro- 
visions for public education which the Legisla- 
ture had made in 1818 and the subsequent acts 
regarding the establishment of primary schools 
in the state did not provide an effective system 
of education for all the children. This plan did 
not include at all the colored portion of the popu- 
lation, so recently freed from the condition of 
slavery. The colored population at this time 
composed two-thirds of the total population of 
the state, and, too, the system of education in 
operation previous to the Civil War did not 
reach more than half the white children in the 
state. The “ poor,’ for whom the schools were 
primarily intended, for reasons of prejudice con- 
nected with the idea of being placed in the 
position of a charge on the state, were loath to 
210
-P-A-G-E-229
  
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
send their children to these schools, and the 
well-to-do refused to patronize them for the 
reason that they were intended for the “ in- 
digent ’ and not for those who were able to pro- 
vide by private means for the education of their 
children. This was not a social order in which 
a wholesome and vigorous system of public edu- 
cation could thrive. It was necessary for these 
conditions to change before a system of public 
education could take root and become effective 
in a society such as obtained in Virginia. 
In the midst of all this came the Civil War, 
with all its deadening and blighting effect upon 
the political, social, and industrial conditions of 
the whole South, and Virginia, more than any of 
the other southern states, felt the awful results 
of this conflict. Dr. J. L. M. Curry, in his “ His- 
tory of the Peabody Education Fund,” makes 
this significant statement regarding these con- 
ditions : 
At the origin of the Peabody Education Fund in 1866, 
not a single southern state within the field of its opera- 
tion had a system of free public schools and only in 
a few cities were any such schools to be found. No state 
organization existed through which this fund could reach 
211

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
the people. The illiteracy of the inhabitants was appall- 
ing and by no means was confined to the “freedmen” 
but included a large per cent of the white population. 
The Legislatures of these states during the period of re- 
construction, largely under the influence of members 
from the northern states, where the common schools had 
been for years a recognized institution and of colored 
representatives who were filled with the laudable am- 
bition for the schooling of the children of their own people, 
had laid out a work entirely and sometimes absurdly 
beyond their people to sustain, for the support of this 
scheme was to fall upon the native white people, who held 
ninety per cent of the remaining property of these Com- 
monwealths. During the war and the five years follow- 
ing, 1860-1870, the property values of these states had 
diminished to the extent of two billion dollars. There 
were in the ex-Confederate States two million children 
and youth within the years of instruction. In the effort 
to organize and put in successful operation a new and 
untried system of public schools adequate to the needs of 
the entire population, the southern states, were under a 
weight of debt beyond their ability in their impoverished 
condition to pay. To add the expense of free education 
to this crushing weight was in their financial condition a 
perplexing and almost impossible task. Free schooling 
was a new question introduced and to be administered 
by novices in this work. To organize the freedom and 
equality of citizenship of a large class, lately the slaves 
of the white people, was not easy, because in conflict 
with the traditions, prejudices, social customs, and legal 
rights of a few years preceding. To impose voluntary,

heavy burdens on the scant property which survived the 
demoralization of the war, so as to educate gratuitously 
their own children and the children of the late African 
slaves was a task of patriotism, of humanity, of civic 
duty which no people ever encountered. 
Virginia was the social and educational leader 
in the eleven commonwealths which had seceded, 
and the close of the war found all of her social 
order and industrial institutions in the state of 
collapse. She had been shorn of an important 
section of her own area in the organization of 
the new state of West Virginia. The remain- 
ing section east of the Alleghanies had been a 
battleground for four terrible years. 
The census of 1860 gave the number of people 
in colleges, academies, and public schools in 
Virginia as 67,024, which was more than nine 
and one half per cent of the white population 
and five and one half per cent of the entire 
population of the state. From 1850 to 1860 
there had been a gain of about two thousand 
upon the illiteracy of the white people, but in 
1870 white illiteracy had increased from 48,912 
in 1860 to 67,997. Besides 207,505 of the colored 
213

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
freedmen, nearly twenty-two per cent of the pop- 
ulation of Virginia, were unable to read and 
write. These were the conditions in Virginia 
under which the public free school system was 
inaugurated. 
The new constitution which contains the 
first provision for a complete system of public 
education in Virginia was adopted July 6, 1869. 
The act of Congress by which Virginia was 
admitted into the Union in 1870 provided that 
The Constitution of Virginia shall never be so amended 
or changed as to deprive any citizen or class of citizens 
of the United States of the school rights and privileges 
secured by the Constitution of the said State. 
The Convention which framed the constitu- 
tion containing these educational provisions 
convened December 3, 1867, and was composed 
of 105 members. There were in this body 33 
conservatives and 72 radicals, 24 of whom 
were negroes. Besides the negroes, the radical 
delegates were: 14 Virginians, 14 from New 
York, 3 each from Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, 
and England, 1 each from Maine, Vermont, Con- 
necticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Washington

City, South Carolina, Ireland, Scotland, and 
Canada. To this cosmopolitan assembly Vir- 
ginia owes the constitutional provision for the 
establishment of the first state-wide school sys- 
tem. Thus, after an agitation of nearly a cen- 
tury, the educational scheme of Thomas Jeffer- 
son, in modified form, was made into law. The 
educational provision for the public school in 
the fundamental law is as follows: 
Constitutional Provision for Education. —(1) The 
general assembly shall elect in joint ballot within thirty 
days after its organization under this constitution, and 
every fourth year thereafter, a superintendent of public 
instruction. He shall have the general supervision of the 
public free school interests of the State, and shall report 
to the general assembly for its consideration, within 
thirty days after his election, a plan for a uniform system 
of public free schools. 
(2) There shall be a board of education, composed of 
the governor, superintendent of public instruction, and 
attorney-general, which shall appoint and have power to 
remove for cause and upon notice to the incumbents, 
subject to confirmation by the senate, all county super- 
intendents of public schools. This board shall have, 
regulated by law, the management and investment of all

school funds, and such supervision of higher grades as 
the law shall provide. 
(8) The general assembly shall provide by law at its 
first session under this constitution a uniform system of 
public free schools, and for its gradual, equal, and full 
introduction into all the counties of the State by the 
year 1876, or as much earlier as practicable. 
(4) The general assembly shall have power, after a full 
introduction of the public free school system, to make 
such laws as shall not permit parents and guardians to 
allow their children to grow up in ignorance and vagrancy. 
(5) The general assembly shall establish, as soon as 
practicable, normal schools, and may establish agricul- 
tural schools and such grades of schools as shall be for 
the public good. 
(6) The board of education shall provide uniformity of 
text-books, and the furnishing of school-houses with such 
apparatus and library as may be necessary, under such 
regulations as may be provided by law. 
(7) The general assembly shall set apart as a permanent 
and perpetual “literary fund’’ the present literary fund 
of the State, the proceeds of all public lands donated by 
Congress for the public school purposes, of all escheated 
property, of all waste and unappropriated lands, of all 
property accruing to the State by forfeiture, and all fines 
collected for offenses committed against the State, and 
all such other sums as the general assembly may appro- 
priate. 
(8) The general assembly shall apply the annual in- 
terest on the literary fund, the capitation tax provided 
for by this constitution for public free school purposes, 
216
-P-A-G-E-235
  PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
and an annual tax upon the property of the State of not 
less than one mill nor more than five mills on the dollar, 
for the equal benefit of all the people of the State, the 
number of children between the ages of five and twenty- 
one years in each public free school district being the 
basis of such division. Provision shall be made to supply 
children attending the public free schools with necessary 
text-books in cases where the parent or guardian is unable, 
by reason of poverty, to furnish them. Each county 
and public free school district may raise additional sums 
by a tax on property for the support of public free schools. 
All unexpended sums of any one year in any public free 
school district shall go into the general school fund for 
redivision the next year: Provided, That any tax au- 
thorized by this section to be raised by counties or school 
districts shall not exceed five mills on a dollar in any one 
year, and shall not be subject to redivision, as herein 
before provided in this section. 
(9) The general assembly shall have the power to foster 
all higher grades of schools under its supervision, and to 
provide for such purpose a permanent educational fund. 
(10) All grants and donations received by the general 
assembly for educational purposes shall be applied accord- 
ing to the terms prescribed by the donors. 
(11) Each city and county shall be held accountable 
for the destruction of school property that may take place 
within its limits by incendiaries or open violence. 
(12) The general assembly shall fix the salaries and 
prescribe the duties of all school officers, and shall make 
all needful laws to carry into effect the public free school 
system provided for by this article.

County organizations. And there shall be appointed, in 
the manner provided for, in Article VIII, one superin- 
tendent of schools; Provided, That counties containing 
less than eight thousand inhabitants may be attached to 
adjoining counties for the formation of districts for super- 
intendents of schools: Provided also, That in counties 
containing thirty thousand inhabitants there may be 
appointed an additional superintendent of schools therein. 
All regular elections for county officers shall be held on 
the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, 
and all officers elected or appointed under this provision 
shall enter upon the duties of their offices on the first 
day of January next succeeding their election and shall 
hold their respective offices for the term of three years. . . . 
School Districts. Each township shall be divided into 
as many compactly located school districts as may be 
deemed necessary: Provided, That no school district 
shall be formed containing less than one hundred inhabit- 
ants. In each school district there shall be elected or 
appointed annually one school trustee, who shall hold his 
office three years: Provided, that at the first election 
held under this provision there shall be three trustees 
elected, whose terms shall be one, two, and three years, 
respectively. 
This was the legal machinery set up for run- 
ning a system of free schools for all the children 
in Virginia. According to the constitutional 
requirement, the Legislature acted promptly 
and elected the Rev. Wm. H. Ruffner, of Lex- 
218
-P-A-G-E-237
    
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
ington, state superintendent of public instruc- 
tion. This proved to be a wise choice, for the 
work of Dr. Ruffner in inaugurating a public 
school system and overcoming the long, tradi- 
tional prejudice of the people of Virginia against 
such a plan of education was a remarkable ex- 
ample of knowledge, wisdom, clear vision, and 
statesmanship. The new superintendent was a 
son of Dr. Henry Ruffner, one time president 
of Washington College, who, twenty years be- 
fore, had submitted a remarkable plan for the 
education of the white children of Virginia. 
This plan was similar to the system which a few 
years before had been put into such successful 
operation in Massachusetts by Horace Mann, 
and which became the model for the American 
system of public education. 
The constitution provided that after a state 
superintendent had been elected, he was to be 
given thirty days in which to prepare a report to 
the General Assembly, in which he was to recom- 
mend a plan for putting into operation the pro- 
visions of the new constitution. In twenty-five 
days Dr. Ruffner submitted to the Legislature 
219
-P-A-G-E-238
| 
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
the proposed plan for instituting a system of 
public schools in the state. The plan submitted, 
with a few modifications by the Legislature, was 
, passed and signed by the governor July 11, 
1870. 
Work of the First State Board of Education. — 
The first work of the Board of Education was 
the appointing of the school officials necessary 
to carry out the intent of the constitution. In 
three months 1400 county superintendents and 
district trustees were appointed. The first 
duties of this army of officials were to organize 
for work, take the census of school population, 
examine and commission teachers, and deter- 
mine the number and location of schools. The 
state superintendent suggested to these officials 
that they open a few schools in each county 
at first, and by this means the plan could be 
tried out, and the effectiveness of such a system 
of education be demonstrated to the people. 
The schools were opened in November, 1870, 
and by the close of the scholastic year there were 
2900 schools, 3000 teachers, and an attendance 
of 130,000 pupils. The average daily attend- 
220
-P-A-G-E-239
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
ance in the state was 75,722, and the percentage 
of school population was, for whites, 37.6, 
colored, 23.4, total, 31.8. The mountain counties 
of the Southwest led in the number of children 
taking advantage of this school system. Gray- 
son County, perched upon a plateau of the 
Blue Ridge, enrolled sixty-six per cent of her 
school population the first year. Previous to 
the inauguration of a state system of free 
schools, many communities were maintaining 
private schools, and in many instances these 
passed over to public charge, together with their 
buildings and endowment. 
The Funds for the Support of the Schools. — 
The sources of money for the support of schools 
were: (1) interest on the Literary Fund; (2) 
capitation taxes ; (3) an annual tax upon the 
property of the state of not less than one 
mill, nor more than five mills on the dollar ; 
(4) each county and district was empowered 
to levy an additional tax not to exceed five mills 
on the dollar. In addition to these constitu- 
tional provisions small amounts were donated 
by private individuals for school purposes. 
221 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
While this scheme seemed to be an ample pro- 
vision for the support of the schools, as a matter 
of fact there were many uncertain factors in it 
that resulted in embarrassment and difficulties 
for the school officers. The schools had opened 
in November, but there were no funds available 
until December, and even then the state super- 
intendent could not anticipate how much money 
could be expected for school purposes. The 
tax collection was slow and uncertain. The local 
communities voted as to the amount of county 
and district tax to be levied.1_ In some cases 
no local tax was levied at all, these communities 
depending upon the state for the funds with 
which to run their schools. The first year the 
aggregate sum of $450,000 was expended in the ~ 
support of the schools. In a few subsequent 
years there was an alarming decrease in the avail- 
able funds from the state for school purposes. 
In 1872 there was a falling off of $130,156 from 
the state and $200,000 from local sources. 
Dr. Ruffner called the attention of the Legis- 
1 Seventy-two counties voted a local tax and twenty-five counties 
did not vote at all. 
222
-P-A-G-E-241

lature (1872) to the fact that there was the 
“frightful deficit in the total revenues of 
$400,856 as compared with last year, a deficit 
of more than one-half the total amount received 
from private funds.” 
Diversion of the School Funds. — Large 
amounts of the funds arising from the constitu- 
tional provision for school purposes were di- 
verted and applied to other uses from 1870 to 
1879. The state superintendent called the atten- 
tion of the Legislature to this fact from time to 
time, but there was no satisfactory explanation 
given by the treasurer and auditors. Finally, 
a resolution was passed by the House of Dele- 
gates requiring the superintendent to call upon 
the auditor for information, with the result that 
the auditor’s balances showed confusion and 
a lack of judgment in disbursing the funds of 
the state. In 1877, when the facts were really 
made public, there was found to be a deficit 
owing to the diversion of the school funds of 
$550,000. The explanation of this condition, 
as given by the auditor, was that he had the 
right of deciding “ what amounts, in his opinion, 
223
-P-A-G-E-242
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
the Treasury could bear.” The claim of the 
schools in his opinion did not rise to the dignity 
of some other governmental claims growing out 
of appropriations made by law. This was vir- 
tually saying that the auditor had the sole 
authority in the use of state funds, regardless 
of constitutional provision. It denied the exist- 
ence of school money, as such, regarding it but 
as income to the state for general use. This 
attitude of the treasurer of the state was an 
effort to weaken and ultimately defeat the public 
school system so recently put into operation, 
and it reflected the attitude of a large element in 
Virginia who were from the first opposed to a 
public free school system for all the children of 
the state. According to Dr. Ruffner’s estimate, 
$1,113,052.56 was the total amount the state 
was in arrears to the public school funds, by the 
pernicious efforts to divert the school funds to 
other uses during the period from 1870 to 1879. 
The Legislature of this last year, after a bitter 
debate involving other state policies, but cen- 
tring around the practice of diverting the state 
school money, brought the matter to a settle- 
224
-P-A-G-E-243
  
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
ment by the passage of a law in which the 
state acknowledged a debt of $382,732.26 due 
the schools, and providing that $15,000 of this 
should be paid over to the school fund every 
three months. Even this law was not executed 
until the auditor, Mr. Taylor, who had been the 
agent in the diversion of the fund during all these 
years, had been displaced by a new auditor.’ 
A Critical Period for the Public Schools. — 
The conflict between the friends of the public 
school system, led by Superintendent Ruffner 
on the one side, and those whose efforts were 
directed toward the defeat of the system on the 
other side, brought the matter to a focus in the 
election of 1879, when the people sent a majority 
to the Legislature pledged to save the new hope 
of the Commonwealth from sacrifice and utter 
defeat. The question as to whether the people 
would abandon their new public school system 
in order to pay the interest on the public debt 
was the prime matter for settlement. 
The superintendent defended the school sys- 
1 This law didn’t become operative until 1880. See U. S. Commis- 
sioner’s Report, 1903, p. 441. 
Q 225

tem in one of the ablest discussions on the impor- 
tance of universal education to the public wel- 
fare that has ever been presented to the people 
of the state.? 
The trouble originated in the famous “ fund- 
ing act” of 1871, which provided a scheme 
for paying off the interest on the state debt. 
This scheme armed the bondholders with cou- 
pons which covered the school moneys along with 
other moneys, with certain means of collecting 
the interest on the bonds. The question of 
“funding” the state debt created a “ furious 
political commotion” throughout the entire state. 
The act was the basis of the claim of the auditor 
in the practice of using the school funds for 
other than school purposes. It was this practice 
that Superintendent Ruffner referred to as the 
“ diversion of the school funds.” He says: 
Here in the famous act of 1871 we have the root of 
the matter, and from this inherent and vigorous root have 
grown all the financial evils which have plagued succeed- 
ing Legislatures and crippled the school system more and 
more, until now its enemies point to it and say, “What 
a poor thing is your school system.” 
1 See School Report of 1878. 
226
-P-A-G-E-245
  
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
On account of the lack of funds and the “ im- 
measurable discontent” among the people 
of the state, resulting from the uncertain and 
unsatisfactory financial support of the schools, 
there was an alarming falling off of attendance 
in the number of schools in the state. The 
state superintendent had predicted this in his 
reports to the Legislature previous to 1878. The 
year 1878 closed with a debt of $250,000 to the 
teachers. There was a loss of 127 schools over 
the previous year. There was a decrease in 
attendance of 27,300 pupils and a reduced 
expenditure for education of $88,451. The 
loss for the colored race was greater than 
for the white children. The superintendent 
declared that the loss of education to 100,000 
children would cost the state $1,500,000 for 
the previous schooling of $500,000 for three 
years. 
By the year 1880, the disputed points had 
been settled in a satisfactory way. Happily 
for the school system, its friends had saved it 
from defeat and ruin, and it was settled for all 
time that public free education for all the chil- 
227 
 
-P-A-G-E-246

dren of the state was to be one of the main func- 
tions of the state government. The superin- 
tendent reported that year that the past year 
had been the “ best in all respects,” —a larger 
sum of money had been turned over to the 
schools than any previous year. The number 
of schools had almost been doubled. Two hun- 
dred new buildings had been erected and nearly 
$100,000 added to the value of school property. 
The total expenditure for education that year 
reached the sum of $946,109.33. 
Public Sentiment concerning Public Schools. 
— One of the duties of the school officials was 
to create a public sentiment in favor of public 
schools. Jefferson, in his efforts to establish 
primary schools in the state from 1796 to 1818, 
often became impatient with the state of leth- 
argy among the people of Virginia regarding 
public education. The people of the state had 
been accustomed for twenty-five years to the 
schools for the “ poor ”’ or “ indigent,” and when 
the public free schools were inaugurated they 
associated these with the type of inferior school 
under the old régime and naturally had a preju-

dice against them at first. The new system 
had to be proved before it would be accepted by 
a large class of people. Then there were a great 
many very influential leaders in the state, who 
openly and uncompromisingly were opposed 
to the system, on the broad ground that it was 
not a governmental function to educate all the 
children; that it created hopes and aspirations 
that could never be realized by the laboring 
classes. There was a strong general sentiment 
against educating the negroes Dr. R. L. 
Dabney of Hampden-Sidney was most active in 
the opposition to the public school idea. He 
sought all opportunities in print and on the plat- 
form to stay the growing public sentiment in 
favor of the new system of free schools. 
The people of Virginia had long been accus- 
tomed to look upon education as a function 
of the home and an individual responsibility. 
They were slow to realize the appropriateness of 
the state’s taking over this function of educating 
all the children of the state, white and colored

alike. Particularly were they opposed to the 
state’s fostering education among the latter 
class, so recently their menial servants. All 
this opposition had to be combated in establish- 
ing a system of free schools in Virginia. Dr. 
Ruffner often called the attention of the school 
officials to this important fact through the 
medium of the public press and through the 
Virginia School Journal. In 1872 he inquired 
through the division superintendents as to the 
public sentiment in favor of the new school 
system. They answered in general that there 
was a growing sentiment in their favor. The 
following excerpts from some of their reports 
indicate this fact. 
Excerpts rrom THE Reports or Division 
SUPERINTENDENTS ! 
Accomac. — “Steady improvement among the masses 
in favor of the schools. We sadly need more school- 
houses. This is the greatest drawback and affords the 
most effective weapon to our foes.” 
ALBEMARLE. — “Public sentiment has undergone a 
great change in favor of the system. Almost all persons 
are now willing to patronize it.”

  PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
Ame ia. — “Opposition of the whites manifestly abat- 
ing. A few prominent men still affect dislike but the 
masses are calling for more schools.” 
Avucusta.— “In most instances, the schools gave 
satisfaction. Individuals who formerly held off came in 
and patronized the schools. There are still many persons 
of prominence and influence who from principle or interest 
oppose the whole system.” 
Brprorp. — “Progress of public sentiment in regard 
to public schools is encouraging to the friends of the 
system. True, there are many objectors who are deter- 
mined in their opposition and earnest in denunciation.” 
Brunswick. — “There is a considerable change in the 
public sentiment of the County in relation to the present 
free school system. It was at first looked upon with 
great disfavor. It is now regarded with a more favorable 
eye.” 
CampBELL. — “Some hostility still exists, but the fierce 
opposition encountered at first has abated.” 
Cuurrrrr. — “Favorable. If each neighborhood had 
a school there would be very little opposition or dissatis- 
faction.” 
Henrico. — “Public sentiment is no less in favor of 
public free schools than when I submitted my last report 
(1871). If there be any difference, perhaps they are grow- 
ing in favor. The people are disposed to grumble because 
the schools are discontinued before the close of the session 
from want of funds.” 
Kine Wituram. —.“A large majority take little or no 
interest in public education and give no thought to the 
matter, except as regards taxes for its support.” 
231

Lunensura. — “The public sentiment in the County 
is largely in favor of the public free schools.” 
Mecxiensura. — “I believe that opposition to the 
public school system has almost ceased.” 
Nexson. — “The sentiment of this county is decidedly 
favorable to the public school system.” 
Nortuampton. — “Public sentiment is gradually be- 
coming more favorable.” 
Pirtsytvania. — “Public sentiment has been rapidly 
growing in favor of the public schools. Two things 
only are required to make the free schools a decided 
success, neat, commodious, and well furnished school- 
houses.” 
RappaHANnock. — “Public sentiment in this County is 
in the main favorable to public schools now, although some 
complain of the injustice, as they call it, of being taxed 
to educate other people’s children.” 
Rocxineuam. — “The public schools’ are gradually 
growing in favor of the masses.” 
Russet. — “I am highly gratified to report that 
public sentiment which was almost entirely against us 
last year was considerably in our favor this year, though 
we have a few noisy opponents.” 
Smiru. — “The people of this County are for the most 
part in favor of public schools.” 
SportsyLvania. — “Public sentiment is not favorable 
to the system of public free schools in this County. Most 
of the people are landowners, and they think their in- 
terests unjustly dealt with, and their prejudice against 
colored schools is very wrong.” 
Wasuineton. — “Public sentiment is growing some- 
232
-P-A-G-E-251

what more favorable toward the schools. The opposition 
is not so violent.” 
Lyncupure Crry. — “Public sentiment has steadily 
undergone a change in our favor during the last year 
until now few have the temerity to avow themselves 
opposers. Every appeal of the council for pecuniary 
assistance has been responded to with cheerfulness and 
alacrity. The High School has made very rapid progress. 
As an evidence of popular confidence and approval I 
may mention that the number of advanced girls in at- 
tendance is increasing in the greatest ratio.” 
Norroik Ciry. — “There has been for many years a 
strong popular current in favor of public schools in this 
city. When the schools were first opened by the city, 
there was a general rush of applicants from all classes 
seeking admission. After a while, there seemed to arise 
a prejudice against these schools, from an impression that 
health and morals would both be endangered from a too 
promiscuous mingling of all elements of society.” 
Ricumonp Ciry. — “Public sentiment has continued 
to grow more and more healthy in reference to our public 
school system.” 
Pererspurc.— “The inauguration of the public 
school system found a portion of citizens opposed and the 
rest either friendly or indifferent. The position is assumed 
by some that public schools, while tolerated, must not be 
good enough to rival private schools. That they must 
not be allowed to attain such efficiency as will gain the 
favor of parents able to pay the private school teachers.” 
ALExaANpRIA City. — “Public sentiment is strongly in 
favor of the public schools. The Finance Committee of 
233  
-P-A-G-E-252
    
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
the City Council, having been instructed to set apart 
$600 a month for school purposes, failed to do so on ac- 
count of the embarrassed condition of the city’s finances. 
On my report of the matter, council took it out of the 
hands of the Committee and confided it to the Treasurer 
who paid up the quota due in advance of all claims.” 
These reports indicate the attitude of the 
people toward the established schools and they 
indicate also the gigantic task of Superintendent 
Ruffner and his officials over the state, of clear- 
ing away the prejudice and other opposing fac- 
tors, so that the effectiveness of the system might 
be demonstrated. The state superintendent 
from the first expressed implicit confidence in 
the ultimate success of the system and it might 
have failed but for the persistent and sane ef- 
forts of Dr. Ruffner through the period of twelve 
years during which the system was on trial. 
In addition, it will be noted that the following 
are some of the difficulties in the way of the suc- 
cessful operation of the public school system. 
(1) Prejudice against the public school system. 
(2) Feeling of poverty among the people. (3) Aversion 
to the education of the negro at public expense. 
(4) Lack of hens schoolhouses and appliances. 
234

(5) Teachers’ lack of professional training. (6) Financial 
annoyances. (7) Trouble concerning the state debt. 
(8) The impossibility of supplying schools for all the 
neighborhoods clamoring for them. 
Normal Schools. — One of the constitutional 
requirements for education in the state was 
that the “State Board of Education establish 
normal schools as soon as possible.” In his 
first report to the Legislature in 1870, Dr. Ruff- 
ner advises that provision be made whereby 
normal schools for the training of teachers be 
established. He gives full arguments from a 
carefully prepared array of statistics showing 
the growth of normal schools in the eastern and 
central states. His advice to the Legislature 
was that, if that body could not at that time 
provide the necessary expenditure to establish 
several normal schools on a substantial basis, 
it might be possible to provide limited finan- 
cial means sufficient to operate what he calls 
2241 “ambulatory normals. The idea was to em- 
ploy a faculty of three or four specialists, paid 
in part by the state, these to travel from one

section of the state to another, and hold ses- 
sions from four to six weeks, and in this way all 
the teachers could be reached in a comparatively 
short time. But this plan was never carried 
out in the form in which it was originally planned 
by the state superintendent. 
Normal Institutes. — The demand for peda- 
gogical training among the more advanced 
teachers of the state resulted in the establishment 
in a few sections of the state of Summer In- 
stitutes, running four or six weeks. These were   designated as “Summer Normal Institutes ” 
and many teachers from a half dozen contiguous 
counties would attend. These sessions were 
usually held in July, followed by the examina- 
tion for teachers’ certificates. Such a normal 
was held at Bridgewater in Rockingham County 
for a great many consecutive summers between 
the 70’s and the 80’s. Later this school devel- 
oped into the Valley Normal. Other more per- 
manent institutes were held in Botetourt County, 
at Strasburg in Shenandoah County, and in 
many other sections of the state. 
A little later (1880) a summer session for white 
236 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
    
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
teachers was held at the University of Virginia 
and one at Lynchburg for the colored teachers. 
Funds for the support of these schools came 
largely from the Peabody Fund, the agent of 
which, Dr. Sears, had made his headquarters 
at Staunton, Virginia. There was an attendance 
at the University of Virginia this session of 467 
teachers, — 212 women and 155 men. The 
attendance at Lynchburg was 240. The em- 
phasis of the work at these two sessions was upon 
the best method of teaching the public school 
branches. The school at the University of 
Virginia was under the management of Dr. 
M. A. Newell, state superintendent of educa- 
tion of Maryland. He was assisted by Profes- 
sors McGilveray of Richmond and A. L. Fink 
of Staunton, and a score of lecturers, among 
whom were Hon. John Eaton, United States 
Commissioner of Education, Rev. A. D. Mayo 
of Boston, and some of the professors of the 
University of Virginia. This was the first 
organized state-wide effort to give an opportu- 
nity for training the teachers for the public 
schools. 
237

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
County Institutes.— From the very first 
(1870) Dr. Ruffner called upon the division 
superintendents to hold institutes at which the 
teachers should demonstrate the best ways of 
presenting the subjects to the children. Often 
the superintendent called to his assistance some 
leading educators in the state and local men and 
women of influence to lecture. This meeting 
had a twofold object: (1) to give professional 
training to the teachers, and (2) to create public 
sentiment in favor of the public schools. It 
soon became the custom in all the counties to 
hold these institutes two or three times during 
the session. They sometimes lasted for a whole 
week. These meetings had much to do with 
creating a professional spirit among the teachers 
and introducing superior methods of teaching 
the public school subjects. 
The Peabody Fund in Virginia.—In 1866 
George Peabody, then living in London, gave to 
education in the southern states the sum of 
$3,500,000 in stocks and bonds. Of this sum 
$1,500,000 of Mississippi and Florida state bonds 
was afterwards repudiated, leaving an available 
238
-P-A-G-E-257
    
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
fund of $2,000,000 for the cause of education. 
Dr. Sears, the first agent of this fund, located 
at Staunton, Virginia, at the time the state 
was establishing its free school system. Dr. 
Sears came to the assistance of Dr. Ruffner many 
times during the first decade in which a public free 
school system was being inaugurated in Virginia. 
Dr. Sears laid down the general policy of using 
the funds for the purpose of an incentive. He 
proposed “ to help those who would help them- 
selves.” This fund was used: (1) to aid graded 
free schools, (2) city schools, (3) summer schools 
for teachers. For this reason these summer 
schools were often designated as “‘ Peabody 
Institutes.”” The programme under which the 
funds were at first distributed was: 
For well-regulated graded public schools continuing 
for nine or ten months with at least one teacher for every 
fifty pupils, the people or the public authorities paying 
at least twice as much for current expenses, the Peabody 
fund will pay :! 
for not less than 100 pupils . . . $300 
for not less than 150 pupils . . . 450 
for not less than 200 pupils . . . 600 
1 See Virginia Educational Journal, Vol. II, p. 75.

-P-A-G-E-258
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
for not less than 250 pupils . . . $800 
for not less than 300 pupils . . . 1000 
During the twelve years of Dr. Ruffner’s 
administration the state received the total 
sum of $233,000 from the Peabody Fund, which 
was about one-fifth of the amount received by 
all the southern states. Thus it will be seen 
that Virginia received the lion’s share of this 
fund. After Peabody College was founded by 
the Peabody Board, at Nashville, Tennessee, 
the fund was distributed on the basis of school 
population, in two hundred dollar scholarships. 
To this school Virginia received during the time 
(1877 to 1910) about $60,000. At this last 
year the entire fund of $1,000,000 was turned 
over to the endowment of the George Peabody 
College for Teachers, at Nashville, Tennessee, 
where a great Teachers’ College is being organ- 
ized for the whole South. 
Summary of Dr. Ruffner’s Administration. — 
The administration of Dr. Ruffner will forever 
stand out as a most remarkable piece of construc- 
tive work in the history of education in Virginia. 
He has already come to be looked upon as the 
240
-P-A-G-E-259
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
“ Horace Mann of Virginia.” Though his work 
came forty years after the Massachusetts edu- 
cator, yet it was essentially the same problem 
and attended with the same or even greater diffi- 
culties. Dr. Ruffner issued twelve reports and 
discussed the same educational topics that one 
finds in the Massachusetts reports. In some 
respects the difficulties encountered by Dr. 
Ruffner were more complicated on account of the 
social and financial conditions in Virginia. The 
people of Massachusetts had no such conditions 
as those relating to the freedmen, and none 
comparable to those pertaining to the social and 
religious conditions in Virginia. The people 
of Massachusetts were more homogeneous, and 
their interests were different from those of the 
people of Virginia. Public education found a 
more ready acceptance in New England democ- 
racy than it did in the more or less aristocratic 
society of Virginia. For these and many other 
reasons the task of establishing a public school 
system in Virginia, even at the late date of 1870, 
was infinitely more difficult than that of Horace 
Mann in Massachusetts.

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
The inauguration of a public school system 
in Virginia was not a matter of a gradual evolu- 
tion among the people, but came rather suddenly 
in the midst of circumstances peculiar and 
unusual. The people of Virginia, together with 
the whole South, were at this time more con- 
cerned about matters political and civil than 
about matters of education. Dr. Ruffner and 
the friends of education in the state had before 
them the great task of turning the attention of 
the people to the function of education, and to 
devise a suitable machinery to carry the system 
forward. This was no small task; only the 
most consummate energy, wisdom, and diplomacy 
could bring to a successful issue such a scheme as 
a system of universal education for the state. 
Regardless of all these almost insurmountable 
difficulties, the system evolved came to be ac- 
cepted in a few years as a most’ effective sys- 
tem of educating the people of Virginia. Dr. 
Ruffner marshalled all the forces in the state 
and focussed them upon the problem of edu- 
cating the whole people. He closed his tenth 
report with these impressive words : 
242
-P-A-G-E-261
    PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM INAUGURATED 
I have now delivered my testimony and perhaps am 
near the end of my public service. Always the time comes 
to lay down the burden. I personally will have no feel- 
ing but that of great relief. My work I commend to 
God, and my conduct to the charitable judgment of my 
countrymen. My part will still live in the noble work 
of educating the people and building up the common- 
wealth. 
How wise he was in all this initial work the 
present and future generations will say. 
With the codperation of a body of such eminent 
educators as Dr. Barnas Sears, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, Pro- 
fessor Edward S. Joynes, Professor John B. Minor and 
others it is not remarkable that the school system estab- 
lished under the administration of Dr. Ruffner has sur- 
vived the assaults of all its enemies and the neglect or the 
indifference of its half-hearted friends. And if the progress 
of the system during the last fifteen years of the century 
seems not to have justified the anticipation of its more 
enthusiastic friends, and other states of the South have 
accomplished more, it has been from the fact that the 
idea of its first great superintendent of schools was prac- 
tically half a century in advance of the possibility of the 
Virginia of 1870-1885 to realize.

the degree of master of arts. He became a leader in Christian and tem- 
perance work; studied theology at Hampden-Sidney and at Princeton; 
was chaplain at the University of Virginia; married in 1850; was pastor 
of the Seventh Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia. On account of ill 
health from overwork he retired to a Virginia farm. He was opposed to 
slavery, though he was never disloyal to his state. From 1870 to 1882 
he was superintendent of public instruction; he was superintendent of 
Virginia’s first State Normal School from 1884 to 1886; he retired near 
Lexington, and died in 1908. Dr. Ruffner was presented with a medal by 
the Chilean government for a plan of public education for that govern- 
ment.

  CHAPTER XIII 
SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE PUBLIC 
FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
The New State Superintendent. — The elec- 
tion in 1881 completely overthrew the party 
that had been in power in Virginia for a century. 
The united votes largely of the people west of 
the Alleghany Mountains and the newly en- 
franchised colored people changed the state 
and congressional representation. This new 
state Legislature elected Mr. R. R. Farr state 
superintendent of public instruction, who held 
that office for the next four years. 
Educational Events in the New Administra- 
tion. — One of the first acts of the new Legisla- 
ture was the appropriation of $400,000 of the 
$500,000 received from the sale of the state’s 
interest in the Atlantic, Mississippi, and Ohio 
Railroad for the reduction of the enormous 
246
-P-A-G-E-265
    DEVELOPMENT OF FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
state debt of $30,000,000, and the remaining 
$100,000 to the establishment of the Normal 
and Industrial Institute for Colored Youth at 
Petersburg. During the year 1882 the sum of 
$1,157,142 was used for school purposes. That 
was the greatest amount yet used for school 
purposes in one year. School attendance in- 
creased, and there was a general forward move- 
ment in education over the entire state. 
In 1882 there was held the first conference 
of county and city school officials in Richmond. 
Out of the one hundred city and county super- 
intendents in the state, eighty-nine were in 
attendance. Addresses were heard from Hon. 
John Eaton, United States Commissioner of 
Education, Gen. S. C. Armstrong, State Su- 
perintendent Wickersham of Pennsylvania, and 
Dr. J. L. M. Curry, agent of the Peabody 
Fund. This meeting gave a great impetus to 
public education in the state. 
An act of the Legislature provided that 90 
per cent of the state school fund be assigned 
to the counties, and provision was also made by 
which more of the deficit by the state to the 
247
-P-A-G-E-266
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
school fund was returned to its original purpose. 
Dr. Curry, the agent of the Peabody Fund, 
urged that the Legislature provide that some 
of the school fund of the state be used for the 
training of teachers, thus carrying out the 
constitutional provision that ‘‘ Normal Schools 
be provided as soon as practicable.” 
State Normal School Established at Farm- 
ville. — The most notable event of the year 1884 
was the legislative act providing that a school 
should be located at Farmville for the express 
purpose of the “ training of female teachers for 
the public schools,” to be governed by a board 
composed of W. H. Ruffner, Dr. J. L. M. Curry, 
Prof. J. B. Minor, Gen. S. C. Armstrong, and 
ten additional members. This board imme- 
diately elected Dr. W. H. Ruffner the first 
president of the school. The property of the 
Farmville Female College was turned over to 
the state and an appropriation of $5000 for 
equipment of the school, and $10,000 for run- 
ning expenses was made. Dr. Curry gave 
$5000 as a gift from the Peabody Fund. The 
original plan of the school as drafted by Dr.

DEVELOPMENT OF FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
Curry did not contemplate limiting the institu- 
tion to girls, but the school has always excluded 
men from attendance. Later William and Mary 
College became the training school for men 
teachers. Dr. Rufiner laid out as elaborate 
a scheme for training teachers as the limited 
funds would permit. Thus the entire provi- 
sion for education in the Constitution of 1869 
was completed, and Dr. Ruffner, by whose 
wisdom the public free schools came into being, 
now was called to fulfil the remaining part of 
the educational provision of the Constitution. 
Teachers’ Reading Circles. — At four of the 
Summer Institutes (1884) reading associations 
were organized among the teachers, under the 
leadership of Prof. F. V. N. Painter, of Roanoke 
College, who rendered valuable service in many 
ways to the cause of universal education in the 
state. 
Final Report of Superintendent Farr. — Su- 
perintendent Farr collected some new and 
interesting statistics regarding teachers; their 
educational preparation, salary, age, sex, 
nativity, number having attended Peabody

Institutes, and grades of certificates held. The 
total number of teachers this year was 6333. 
In 1881 there were 751 more men _ teachers 
than women, but in 1885 there were 55 more 
women than men. The average monthly salary 
this year was for men $31.00 and for women 
$26.88. It was found that 645 teachers were 
not natives of Virginia; 1777 had attended the 
summer normals; 2485 had received their 
training in the public schools of Virginia; 1380 
were educated in the colleges and private schools 
  of the state. The state institutions for higher 
learning had furnished 145, while the denomi- 
national colleges furnished 225. In 1888, 723 
held professional certificates; 2480, first grade 
certificates, 2007, second grade, and 1123, third 
grade. It will be seen that about one-half of 
the teachers held either second or third grade 
certificates. Of the 4789 white teachers, over 
half of them were between the ages of eighteen 
and thirty. 
This last report shows important gains in 
all aspects of the school system, so that Su- 
perintendent Farr says: 
250
-P-A-G-E-269
CR ne, re en eee 
DEVELOPMENT OF FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
The schools have improved in every detail; that the 
system is stronger than ever before and that it now com- 
mands the respect of all classes of people in the state. 
At a meeting of the county and city superintend- 
ents, held during the last year of his admin- 
istration, these officials furnished a brief and 
popular history of the schools in each county 
and city. These were embodied in the su- 
perintendent’s final report. A summary show- 
ing the substantial growth of the schools from 
the time of their inauguration is given. 
The Administration of John L. Buchannon. — 
Mr. John L. Buchannon held the office of su- 
perintendent from 1885 to 1889. The public 
school system had found a permanent place 
in the state. Educational conditions were 
what a Virginia President of the United States 
“e called an “era of good feeling.”’ There is no 
evidence of any widespread hostility to the 
public schools except the feeling against the 
education of the negro race. This last problem 
was being more satisfactorily solved by such 
men as Dr. S. C. Armstrong, head of the Hamp- 
ton Normal Institute, and the agent of the 
251  
-P-A-G-E-270
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
Slater Fund,! who were rapidly turning the 
training of the people of this race into industrial 
lines. But, in general, the inauguration of the 
public school system, fraught with so much bit- 
terness and earnest effort in the past, came to be 
recognized as the system that had come to stay. 
During the administration of Mr. Buchannon, 
there was a continued increase in school patron- 
age, school funds, and school property values. 
One of the new features in educational activi- 
ties in the state was the effort on the part of — 
the State Board to carry out the law by giving 
the schools a uniform series of text-books, and 
as far as possible, the selection of authors was 
made from Virginians. Full reports were pub- 
lished from the various state institutions, each 
of which showed them to be in a flourishing 
condition, though greatly in need of additional 
funds to meet the increasing demand of these 
valuable institutions. 
1Jn 1882 Mr. Jno. T. Slater of Norwich, Connecticut, conveyed to 
Trustees $1,000,000 for the education of the negro race of the South. 
Its appropriations have been devoted particularly to the industrial 
education of the negro youth. The average annual income from this 
fund is about $30,000.

DEVELOPMENT OF FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
Administration of Hon. John E. Massey. — 
At the end of this period of twenty years, the 
public school system emerged as an established 
fact from the violent storm of political conflict 
centring about the payment of the state debt. 
Mr. Massey, who had taken an active part in 
the public debates on this question, had won a 
wide reputation for his power and influence asa 
public speaker, and for his well-known attitude 
toward the public school system, became the 
candidate for the office of state superintendent, 
and was elected to this position in 1890. Mr. 
Massey brought to the public school system of 
the state the power of a strong advocate and a 
discriminating judgment in matters relating 
to the educational needs of the state. He 
could carry an audience with him upon almost 
any topic he chose to discuss before them. He 
travelled extensively in all parts of the state, 
persuading the people to look well to the educa- 
tion of the 600,000 children of school age. He 
put the emphasis upon the “ intensive ” aspect 
of public education, and sought to improve the 
quality of teaching rather than to extend the 
258  
-P-A-G-E-272
  
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
system to a greater number of children. He 
sought to make more worthy of support the 
system already so well established. He set 
for his task the improvement of the teaching 
force of the state. 
Revival of County and State Institutes. — 
In 1890 only forty-seven division superintendents 
reported having held county institutes, which had 
meant so much as a method of improving the 
quality of teaching in the 70’s and 80’s; sixty- 
seven of the superintendents had not held these 
meetings in their counties. These institutes 
were revived, and under the lead of City Su- 
perintendent E. C. Glass of Lynchburg a 
“School of Methods ” was operated every sum- 
mer, first, at Lynchburg (1880), then at Bed- 
ford City, Roanoke, and Charlottesville. This 
summer school became the leading agency of 
its kind in the state, and for a time attracted 
attention over the entire South. Leading ex- 
perts in all the fields of education were employed 
as instructors. The attendance of teachers 
often reached 1200. 
State Superintendent Massey ordered the 
254

examination for certificates to be held at the 
close of this school in August and at the same 
date all over the state, and in this way secured | 
greater control over the matter of certificating | 
teachers than had yet obtained in the history | 
of the state school system. | 
State Educational Conference Organized. — 
At the session of the summer school at Bed- 
ford City, in July, 1891, at a called meeting of 
the superintendents of the state, the Virginia 
State Teachers’ Association was organized and 
has grown to such proportions as to attract 
from two to three thousand teachers at its 
annual meetings, which are held each year at 
the Thanksgiving holiday season. Nearly 5000 
Virginia teachers are members of the Associa- 
tion to-day (1915). 
In 1894, at the urgent suggestion of Su- 
perintendent Massey, the Legislature passed 
an act including the “Summer Institutes” as 
a part of the scheme of popular education, and 
set aside $2500 for their support. With the 
gift from the Peabody Fund to this cause, these 
schools became permanent agencies for the 
255 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
ga aa a i ka a, ak a le a a 
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
training of teachers. The act also provided a 
course of graded instruction for the teachers 
attending, to cover a period of three years. 
The attendance upon these institutes for the 
year 1895 was the largest ever known in the state. 
Another event in the administration of Su- 
perintendent Massey was an attempt to open the 
doors of the University of Virginia to women. 
This came as a response to the movement for ; the higher education of women in the state. 
This scheme provided for the teaching to be 
done nominally under the supervision of the 
  regular professors of the university. The plan 
permitted no women to attend lectures or the 
exercises of the university, but after an examina- 
tion a certificate of proficiency might be given. 
Only one woman applied and the plan was 
finally abandoned. 
After a visit to the North, Superintendent 
Massey recommended that industrial education 
be introduced into the schools. He _ highly 
commended the work done at the Hampton   Normal and Agricultural Institute for Negroes, 
where training in the trades for the boys and 
256
-P-A-G-E-275
  DEVELOPMENT OF FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
domestic science for the girls had been in- 
troduced. Superintendent Massey’s final re- 
port contains interesting figures regarding the 
illiteracy in the state. Of the 665,533 persons 
of school age, 232,949 could not read nor 
write; 117,592 were negroes. One-third of the 
entire school population were illiterate. The 
state superintendent published in his report of 
1896-97 a chart of illiteracy, from which it 
appears that Virginia was the seventh state in 
illiteracy, the order being: Virginia, 30.2 per 
cent, North Carolina, 35.7 per cent, Georgia 
88.9 per cent, Mississippi, 40 per cent, Ala- 
bama, 41 per cent, New Mexico, 45.5 per cent, 
- South Carolina, 45 per cent, and Louisiana, 
45.8 per cent.! 
The final report of Superintendent Massey 
reveals the fact that there were sixty high 
schools in the state, nearly all of which were con- 
nected with the public school system, the details 
of which will be noted in another chapter. The 
following recommendations are made looking 
to the greater efficiency of the schools: (1) 
1 See School Report, 1897.

larger school funds, (2) more efficient teaching, 
(3) closer supervision, (4) graded courses of 
instruction for country schools, (5) institutes 
for normal training, (6) school libraries, (7) 
county high schools, (8) a state Board of Exam- 
iners, (9) better schoolhouses. 
The Administration of Hon. Joseph W. 
Southall. — The most notable forward move- 
ment during this administration was the atten- 
tion and emphasis given to the rural schools. 
The state superintendent sought to check the 
“ruinous policy of the multiplication of rural 
schools caused by the pressure to plant a school- 
house in every little country neighborhood.” 
He urged that efficient graded schools be estab- 
lished in the country districts and a public 
high school in every county. These high 
schools were needed to articulate the common 
schools with the university and other higher 
institutions of learning and to prepare teachers 
for the elementary schools. He repeats the rec- 
ommendation of former State Superintendent 
Massey that a state Board of Examiners be 
instituted and that manual training be intro- 
258

DEVELOPMENT OF FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
duced into the schools, especially in the negro 
schools. 
Summary. — The public school system had 
now been in operation for thirty-two years. 
During that time it had found a permanent 
place in the social and economic system in 
Virginia. (1) It was born of one man, Dr. 
Ruffner, that high-minded statesman and friend 
of public education. (2) It found a place in the 
state only after having withstood the most 
caustic opposition, largely because it provided 
for the education of the negro race. (3) It 
developed into an efficient agent for the educa- 
tion of all the children of the state, although 
in a social system that had defeated the long 
efforts of such a man as Thomas Jefferson, in 
establishing a system of primary schools. (4) 
School enrolment had increased from 131,088 
to 361,772, and the daily attendance from 
75,722 to 215,204. The percentage of attend- 
ance of school population had increased from 
18.4 per cent to nearly 40 per cent. The 
number of months taught had increased from 
4.66 to 6.40. The number of teachers in- 
259
-P-A-G-E-278
  
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
creased from 3014 to nearly 10,000. (5) School 
expenditures had likewise shown growth com- 
mensurate with the growth in other respects. 
The total state fund was at first $362,000. 
After thirty-two years it was $1,228,262. 
Teachers’ salaries had increased from $32.26 
per month to $36.31 for the men, and from 
$26.33 to $28.11 for the women. School prop- 
erty had shown the remarkable increase from 
$188,680 to $8,555,343. (6) A system of elemen- 
tary schools had been provided, and at the close 
of this period high schools were being established. 
Summer institutes for the training of teachers 
in pedagogical method had been developed under 
county and state auspices. A State Normal 
School had been established at Farmville for 
women, and William and Mary College had 
been subsidized by the state for the training 
of men teachers. The method of certification 
of teachers had been systematized, and a uni- 
form list of text-books for the schools had been 
adopted. 
All this was substantial progress, but there 
was much yet to be done to bring the system 
260
-P-A-G-E-279
  
DEVELOPMENT OF FREE SCHOOL SYSTEM 
of education in Virginia to a state of still 
greater efficiency. In 1902 a Constitutional 
Convention was called and the fundamental 
law of the state was revised, particularly re- 
garding educational provisions. The  subse- 
quent history of education in Virginia is marked 
by a renaissance which resulted in a forward 
movement which will stand out as a new epoch, 
the details of which will be taken up in a subse- 
quent chapter.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
Ar the time the state established a system of 
public schools (1870) three Virginia cities had 
already in operation a system of public edu- 
cation. These were Norfolk, Petersburg, and 
Richmond. 
City Schools of Norfolk. — By an ordinance of 
the city council, Norfolk established a system 
of free schools in 1850. The city was laid off 
into four school districts, and a school com- 
missioner was appointed for each. For the 
support of these schools a tax of four dollars 
was levied on every white male inhabitant 
over twenty-one years of age. By 1848 a 
four-room building had been erected in each 
of the four districts. All the schools of one 
building were placed under one administrator, 
who was styled “‘ the rector.”» Thomas C. Tabb, 
Esq., one of the most prominent lawyers of the 
262
-P-A-G-E-281
  
  DEVELOPMENT OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
city, was put in charge of the organization and 
erection of school buildings. The general plan 
called for the segregation of the sexes, the 
boys occupying one room and the girls another. 
However, in 1875, the boys and girls of the 
elementary grades occupied the same room. 
The grades above continued the same plan of 
separating the boys and girls. When the state 
school system was inaugurated, the city schools 
of Norfolk were taken over and became a part 
of the new state system. The colored people 
had two schools under a colored superintendent. 
In 1871 the council passed an ordinance that 
there should be a colored school in each ward, and 
these should be under the same commissioners 
and the same superintendent as the white schools. 
In the year 1871 there were 16 teachers and 
865 pupils in the free schools. The city ex- 
pended $11,472.76 on its schools during that 
year. Dr. Sears, the agent of the Peabody 
Fund, gave $1000. W. W. Lamb was the first 
superintendent appointed by the state Board of 
Education. He had been serving in this capac- 
ity previous to that time. In 1874 Gen. R. L. 
263  
-P-A-G-E-282
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
Page was appointed to fill the place of W. W. 
Lamb, who had died the same year. In 
1882 Rev. Calvin Blackwell was appointed to 
succeed General Page, and in 1884 Maj. 
R. G. Banks occupied the position of superin- 
tendent. 
Free Schools of Petersburg. — A free school 
system was inaugurated by the city of Peters- 
burg in 1868. Dr. Sears, agent of the Peabody 
Fund, visited the city and proffered $2000, on 
the condition that the city raise $20,000 and 
organize a school system free to all classes, white 
and colored, rich and poor.!' The city council, 
after some months of consideration, decided to 
establish a free ‘school system, and. appointed 
nine men as members of the school board. The 
first act of this board was to send the president 
to northern cities to study the school systems 
there and to purchase text-books and equipment 
for the schools. These schools were opened in 
the fall of 1868, with 1500 pupils in attendance. 
The report of the second year shows an enrol- 
1 $1200 was contributed by Mr. Manly of Richmond, who was the 
agent of the Freedmen’s Bureau. 
264

ment of 2661 pupils. During this year an ex- 
cellent school building was erected and dedicated 
with elaborate ceremonies and speeches.! This 
building cost $65,000, some of which came by 
will from a Mr. Anderson, first to his negro body- 
guard, Jumbo, and at his death was to be used 
for the purpose of educating the poor children 
of Petersburg. 
S. H. Owen, Esq., was the first city superin- 
tendent appointed by the state authorities. 
Before this the city had been under the wise 
management of an active Board of Education. 
From the first the city of Petersburg was 
one of the most progressive school centres in 
Virginia. In 1875 Mr. T. P. Leavenworth was 
the superintendent of schools. During that 
year, he published a unique diagram represent- 
ing the average weekly enrolment and the 
average daily attendance in the form of a graph.? 
In 1878 the city showed an enrolment of 2078 
pupils, with an average attendance of 1428. 
1 This was the first public school building in Virginia. One of the 
speakers said: “We have not come to dedicate a free school but a school 
that costs, a school for which every parent is obliged to contribute.” 
2 See School Report, 1875, p. 115. 
265
-P-A-G-E-284
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
In’ 1880 the attendance was 3055, with a 
school population of 7400. 
City Schools of Richmond. — For many years 
Lancasterian schools were in operation in Rich- 
mond, but they were under the control of semi- 
charitable societies. Public schools were or- 
ganized in 1869. A petition, signed by a large 
number of citizens without distinction of party, 
prayed the city council to establish a system 
of public schools. The committee to whom the 
matter was referred recommended an ordinance 
which provided for an appropriation of $15,000 
for a Board of Education, consisting of nine 
members. This ordinance was passed, but the 
amount appropriated was inadequate and addi- 
tional funds were procured from the Freed- 
men’s Bureau and from the Peabody Fund, 
these two gifts amounting to another $15,000. 
During the first year 53 schools were opened, 
with an enrolment of 2400 pupils. A. Wash- 
burne, Esq., was put in charge as superintend- 
ent. The next year the city took entire con- 
trol of the schools, both white and colored, and 
Mr. J. H. Binford was elected superintendent. 
266
-P-A-G-E-285
DEVELOPMENT OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
A new school board of ten members was ap- 
pointed and an appropriation of $42,625 was 
made for current expenses. Bonds to the 
amount of $100,000 were issued for the erection 
of school buildings. Under the leadership of 
Superintendent Binford the schools of the city 
rapidly gained the confidence of the people, who 
very generously patronized them. In April, 
1871, the schools of the city became a part of 
the state system. They were organized into 
primary, first six grades, grammar, four grades, 
and high school, thus affording an opportunity 
for excellent training for the children of the © 
city. 
The high school was organized in 1873, 
which was housed in a rented building, and Mr. 
W. F. Fox was appointed principal. That year 
there were enrolled in the city schools 5328, 
which was two-thirds of the entire school 
population of the city. Under the wise ad- 
ministration of Mr. Binford the city schools 
were organized, the best methods of teaching 
introduced, the funds for public school purposes 
were increased from year to year, new buildings 
267 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
were erected and public confidence heightened, 
so that the system was a safe basis for the future 
development of public education in the city of 
Richmond. In 1899 Principal Fox was made 
superintendent of city schools, and held the 
position until his death in 1908. In his report 
of 1906 he says: 
For the session 1870—71 we had 73 schools, now we 
have 236; then there were 73 teachers, now we have 230; 
then our enrollment was 3156, now it is 11,749; then our 
general expenses amounted to $42,625, now they amount 
to $139,827.09; then the cost of education per capita was 
$13.35; now, including a 5 per cent interest on bonds 
issued for school purposes, it is $13.57; then the city 
owned not a single house, now it owns 17 buildings valued 
at about $400,000: then comparatively few of our citizens 
patronized the public schools; now the public schools are 
so well patronized that 75 per cent of our entire school 
population between the ages of seven and fourteen are 
taught in them. Complaint is sometimes made of the 
increased cost of our public schools. It is only reasonable 
that the education of 11,749 children should cost more than 
- the education of 3156; nevertheless, the fact that the cost 
per capita is but a few cents greater shows that the in- 
creased funds have not been wasted, but, on the other 
hand, have been expended most judiciously and economi- 
cally. Nor do I see how the amount expended can ever 
be less, or in fact how it can again be so small. If our 
268 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  
DEVELOPMENT OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
schools retain their excellence and popularity, there must 
be an increasing demand upon them with the increase of 
our population. It has come to be a matter of city pride 
to be classed as a city of 100,000 inhabitants. As we go 
on towards that standard the expenses of our schools 
must necessarily increase; and all that our people can 
reasonably ask of the school authorities is to see to it that 
the cost per capita shall be just and equitable. 
Subsequent City Systems Established. — At 
the inauguration of the state public school 
system, the cities of Alexandria, Lynchburg, 
Fredericksburg, Staunton, Winchester, Dan- 
ville, Williamsburg, and Portsmouth established 
systems of public schools. The city of Lynch- 
burg took steps to organize a city system in 
September, 1870. A. F. Biggers, Esq., was ap- 
pointed the first superintendent of the city. 
He was also designated superintendent of the 
county of Campbell. At first the city wards 
were organized under the same plans as the 
districts in the counties. Later (1871), by act 
of the Legislature, the trustees were organized 
into a school board, which body had entire 
control of the city schools. Superintendent 
Biggers made a tour of the northern states 
269
-P-A-G-E-288
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
for the purpose of studying the school systems 
there. After his return, the committee reported 
a plan of organization and rules for the conduct 
of the schools, which proved to be so wise that 
they have remained substantially unchanged 
to the present time. In 1871, $30,000 was ap- 
propriated by the city council for buildings and 
$8000 for current expenses. The policy at 
first was to segregate the boys and girls, but 
later coeducation prevailed. The question of 
a high school was early agitated. In 1871 
provision was made for two high schools, one 
for boys and another for girls. In 1878 an 
effort was made to abolish the idea of maintain- 
ing high schools. As a result, there was no 
high school in the session of 1878-79, but in the 
next election for councilmen, the “ school ques- 
tion”? was made an issue and the election 
showed a decided majority for the reéstablish- 
ment of the high schools and rejuvenation of 
the whole school system. In 1879 Superintend- 
ent Biggers died at the age of forty, and Mr. 
E. C. Glass was appointed to take his place, 
and has held the position ever since. Mr. 
270
-P-A-G-E-289
  DEVELOPMENT OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
Glass’s administration is an example of long 
service as city superintendent, and as a result 
the Lynchburg schools have long had the repu- 
tation of being the best organized and most 
efficient city system of education in the state. 
Mr. Glass has been identified with all the educa- 
tional movements of the state, particularly in 
the agencies for training teachers. He was 
the prime mover in the inauguration of a system 
of “Summer Schools” for teachers and was 
for a number of years the conductor of the 
summer school at the University of Virginia 
which grew to such large proportions as to gain 
a national reputation. 
City Schools of Alexandria.— Alexandria had 
free schools early in the eighteenth century. 
A school was in operation in 1732. In 1758 
a schoolhouse was erected in the “ Market 
Square.” The money was raised by lottery. 
This school was the famous Alexandria Academy, 
to which George Washington gave a part of the 
endowment. These schools were practically 
free schools, and the city officials always had 
certain control over them. In 1830 this Acad- 
Q71  
-P-A-G-E-290
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
emy was conducted according to the Lan- 
casterian System, then a form of school adminis- 
tration in vogue in the larger cities in America. 
In 1871 these schools, conducted so long as 
free schools under an endowment, were trans- 
ferred to the state public school authorities 
and the present city system was organized. 
The attendance at first was 640 children. The 
following years there was a falling off in attend- 
ance to 550 in 1874, but after that the attend- 
ance greatly increased. In 1885 there were 
1340 pupils attending the public schools of that 
city. 
City Schools of Fredericksburg. — The people 
of Fredericksburg have from a very early date 
maintained “free schools.” The “ charity ” 
school at Fredericksburg had a long and in- 
teresting history. The public school system 
was inaugurated in 1870. These schools up to 
1883 were operated as a district of Spottsyl- 
vania County. This was done in a number of 
other instances in the state under a stringent 
interpretation of the constitution. Mr. John 
Howison was appointed first superintendent of 
272

DEVELOPMENT OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
the city and county. In 1883 the city entered 
upon a separate and independent management 
of its schools, with Gen. Daniel Ruggles as 
superintendent. These schools were conducted 
in rented quarters until 1885, when, with an 
appropriation from the council, two brick build- 
ings were erected at a cost of $10,000. In the 
80’s, when the Peabody Institutes were held in 
different parts of the state, Fredericksburg was 
often designated as one of the places for these 
summer schools. In 1885 an “ intermediate 
” grade,” or a high school, was organized, with 
forty-five pupils. Professor Jos. G. Swartz was 
principal. 
City Schools of Staunton. — As in some of 
the other cities, the Staunton schools were 
operated at first as a school district of Augusta 
County, and under the jurisdiction of the 
superintendent of that county. Major Jed 
Hotchkiss was appointed to serve as the first 
superintendent, but, on account of his having 
taken an important part in the Civil War, he 
could not qualify, whereupon Dr. Barnes Sears, 
agent of the Peabody Fund, who was a resident 
T 273
-P-A-G-E-292
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
of that city, was unanimously appointed as 
superintendent, and Major Hotchkiss _ per- 
formed the duties of the office. The basements 
of the Baptist and Lutheran churches were 
rented for school purposes, and the schools 
were opened in December of the year 1870. 
In 1871 the authorities procured the buildings 
of the Staunton Academy for public school 
purposes. In the fall of that year Dr. Sears 
resigned as county superintendent and Mr. J. E. 
Guy was appointed in his stead. In 1873, 
at the recommendation of the Staunton Board 
of Trustees, the city was made an independent 
unit for school administration, and Mr. J. J. 
Ladd, then principal of the High School, was 
appointed superintendent of the city schools, 
with a salary of $1500. Dr. Sears gave $1790 
annually to the support of the schools out of 
the Peabody Fund. The colored children were 
taught at first by colored teachers from the 
North, but, on account of these not being 
exemplary in conduct, the colored citizens of 
the city petitioned the council to give them white 
teachers, which petition was granted. In 1875

the city purchased the property of the old 
Wesleyan Female Institute, opposite the Episco- - 
pal Church, and used it for public school pur- 
poses. In 1878 Dr. R. S. Hamilton was made 
superintendent. After a visit to Richmond 
he instituted a complete graded system in the 
schools. In 1882 Mr. William A. Bowles was 
elected superintendent. He had served as prin- 
cipal of the high school for a number of years. 
The schools prospered under his management, 
and in 1885 there were enrolled 934 pupils, 
443 white and 491 colored. Colored teachers 
were again put in charge of the colored schools. 
City Schools of Portsmouth. — Public senti- 
ment was favorable to public education in Ports- | 
mouth long before the act establishing a state 
public school system. In 1845, when Norfolk 
County established a system of public schools 
for all the children, this city was a part of the 
county unit, and maintained schools up to the 
war. They had various sources of revenue 
with which to operate the schools: (1) the 
Literary Fund, (2) direct taxes, (3) tuition 
fees, (4) receipts from Norfolk County ferries. 
275
-P-A-G-E-294
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
After 1870 the Peabody Fund gave annually 
from $1000 to $1500 to encourage the organiza- 
tion of more effective schools. The city owned 
several good buildings, including a brick building 
for the colored schools. Mr. James F. Crocker 
was the first superintendent, and held this 
position from 1870 to 1882. Mr. G. F. Edwards 
was appointed superintendent at this time and 
held the position for a great many years. 
Other City School Systems. — Williamsburg, 
Winchester, and Danville organized systems 
under the state law in 1870. In each case the 
policy was to organize as the district of the 
county in which they were locating. This never 
was a very satisfactory plan. The schools 
did not prosper under this arrangement. In 
these particular centres public education was 
not popular and a laissez-faire attitude charac- 
terized the interest the people took in the 
public schools. The county of James City, in 
which Williamsburg is located, voted upon the 
proposition to levy a tax and establish a sys- 
tem of public schools for the county under 
the act of 1845, but the idea was rejected. 
276
-P-A-G-E-295
a a i il a a a al i ta ER i 
DEVELOPMENT OF CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS 
Williamsburg and Winchester for a long time 
operated under a plan in which the city was a 
part or a district of the county. Danville was 
definitely organized as an independent school unit 
about theyear 1876. It has recently erected some 
splendid modern buildings, and the city system 
has been toned up to a high degree of efficiency. 
The city school systems of Roanoke, Newport 
News, and Bristol are of much later development. 
These towns have grown into cities within the 
last quarter of a century. The school systems of 
each of these cities are organized according to 
the most modern standards of public education. 
Summary. — The cities of Norfolk, Petersburg, 
and Richmond established public free schools 
a few years before the state system was inau- 
gurated. These cities were stimulated by gifts 
from the Peabody Fund and the Freedmen’s 
Bureau, and became models for other centres of 
population in the state, in the way of providing | 
an education at public expense for all the chil- 
dren, rich and poor, white and colored. 
The other cities did not organize public 
schools until the state system was established 
Q77

in 1870. Even then, they sought to fulfil the 
provisions of the constitution and the subse- 
quent act of the Legislature regarding public 
education in the most perfunctory way, usually 
organizing the city schools as a part of the 
county organization with the same superintend- 
ent. There was no school property or equip- 
ment and no local funds, to meet the running 
expenses of the schools. \ The cities were slow 
to provide funds by taxation, or otherwise ap- 
propriate moneys for public school purpose. 
After a few years the effectiveness of the schools 
  was demonstrated, and the city council set aside 
an annual budget for schools and buildings, 
beginning with amounts running from $10,000 
to $20,000. These amounts were increased 
from year to year as the schools have grown in 
efficiency, and public sentiment in favor of public 
education has taken definite form, Dr. Sears 
was wise in distributing the Peabody Fund to 
the cities in order that they might demonstrate 
the effectiveness of public education for all the 
children. These city systems became the 
models for the larger towns and the more pro-

that public education when rightly administered 
was not a cheap thing and could not depend for 
its support upon the meagre allotments from 
the Literary Fund or other amounts from 
philanthropic sources, but its main support 
must come from local taxation.

  CHAPTER XV 
HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN IN VIRGINIA 
Tue first attempt ever made in Virginia to 
establish a school of high grade for girls was 
about the year 1840. A few Methodist breth- 
ren, without the formal sanction of conference, 
procured a charter for a college under the 
name and title of “ Buckingham Female Col- 
lege.” They located it in Buckingham County, 
erected buildings and opened for pupils. It 
started off with very flourishing prospects, 
but at the end of a year or two it came to a 
disastrous close, never again to be opened.! 
The pioneer institutions for higher learning 
for women in Virginia that have endured are 
Mary Baldwin Seminary at Staunton and 
Hollins College near Roanoke. Both these 
schools were established in 1842 and within 
the period of the great “ educational awaken-

  HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN 
ing” in America (1830-50). Both were origi- 
nally established by men from the North, 
interested in education. This was the period of 
the academies, and the tendency was to estab- 
lish schools for girls on the same plan as those 
for boys, only the former usually went by the 
name of “seminary”? and too there was a 
differentiation in the curricula. The schools 
for girls usually contained courses in literature, 
music, and art, in lieu of the old traditional 
subjects of the ancient languages and mathe- 
matics, but Mary Baldwin Seminary and Hollins 
College, early in their history, introduced ad- 
vanced courses which paralleled the courses 
offered in higher institutions of learning for 
men. At a later period other institutions of 
advanced grade for women were established in 
different parts of the state. 
Origin and Early History of Hollins College. — 
The events connected with the origin and early 
history of Hollins College are unique. The 
Rev. Joshua Bradley, a gentleman from the 
North, came to this section of the state. He 
was a minister of the Baptist faith and possessed 
281  
-P-A-G-E-300
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
a strong enthusiasm for education. The 
buildings and grounds of Botetourt Springs, 
one time a popular summering place, but at 
that time in a state of decay, came to the 
observation of Mr. Bradley, and he conceived 
the idea of establishing a school of high grade 
for both sexes. He proceeded to organize a 
joint stock company under the imposing title 
of ‘Valley Union Education Society of Vir- 
ginia.” It was not to be a sectarian school, 
but an enterprise for the general good of society. 
Mr. Bradley was made principal of the school 
and served in that capacity for the first year. 
The school was opened in the fall of 1842, with 
nearly one hundred students. Before the first 
session came to a close the school became de- 
moralized on account of financial difficulties 
and lack of administrative ability on the part 
of the principal. Mr. Bradley resigned at 
the close of the first session and left the state. 
The school continued its work with varying 
degrees of success, under different managers, 
until 1846, when Dr. Charles L. Cocke was 
called from Richmond College to take charge 
282
-P-A-G-E-301
    HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN 
of the institution, which was then known as 
the “ Valley Union Seminary.”’ In 1851 the 
department for boys was abandoned, and the 
name of the school as chartered was “ Female 
Seminary at Botetourt Springs.” This was the 
first chartered institution in the state for girls, 
with broad systematic courses and high stand- 
ards of scholarship. In 1853 the school was 
filled with girls, studying Latin, mathematics, 
and the philosophies. In 1855 the college was 
put on a more substantial basis, standards and 
policies were fixed, and the institution started 
upon an era of continued and increasing useful- 
ness in the field of higher education for women. 
The outstanding stock of the old corporation 
was bought and the institution was placed un- 
der the control of a self-perpetuating board of 
trustees. All this was made possible by the 
efforts and generosity of Mr. and Mrs. John 
Hollins of Lynchburg, who, at the suggestion 
of Dr. Charles L. Cocke, prepared the plans 
and gave varying amounts at different times 
to the school.!. This was the occasion for

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
changing the name to Hollins Institute, by 
which title it was known up to 1910, when the 
name was changed to Hollins College. 
During the period of the Civil War, the school 
kept its doors open and had an average of 130 
students in attendance. From 1865 to 1877 
the school maintained a “ normal department,” 
with the following stated aims: ‘ (1) to give 
the most exact and critical scholarship; (2) to 
instruct the young ladies in the best methods of 
teaching; (3) to give them some experience in 
discipline and management of a school.” This 
was the period of the inauguration of a state 
public school system under Dr. Wm. H. 
Ruffner, who pleaded for the establishment of 
normal schools for the preparation of teachers. 
After the war the school enlarged its plans and 
students came from other states as well as 
from Virginia. 
The College Plant and Equipment. — The 
main buildings at Hollins College are con- 
centrated into a conveniently arranged quad- 
rangle, with colonnades enabling the students 
and faculty to pass to any part of the premises 
284
-P-A-G-E-303
  
HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN 
under shelter. There are nine brick buildings, 
designed especially for college purposes, and 
dormitories that afford accommodations for a 
full faculty and two hundred and fifty students. 
These buildings are completely equipped with 
the most modern appliances, such as scientific 
laboratories, a library of 6000 volumes, offices 
and class rooms, dining hall, completely equipped 
infirmary, and. professors’ homes. The most 
modern sanitary conditions are maintained. 
Besides the immediate college premises, a farm 
of 700 acres, 400 of which are under cultivation, 
belongs to the college. 
The Curricula. — Hollins College has from 
the first constantly maintained a high standard 
of scholarship, although she was forced to main- 
tain a preparatory department and a wide range 
of electives up to a few years ago, on account 
of the lack of standardized systems of secondary 
education in the state and in the South. The 
plan at present is to abandon the preparatory 
department as soon as possible.! 
The requirements for admission to Hollins

HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
College for work leading to a degree are fourteen 
units of secondary school work. Students are 
admitted to elective courses, such as music, 
art, and expression, when they have had suffi- 
cient preparation to pursue these subjects with 
profit. The degree of A.B. is conferred upon 
students who complete sixty hours of work, 
thirty-one of which are prescribed in the fields 
of English, modern and ancient languages, 
history, mathematics, and the sciences. Out 
of 7000 students that have attended Hollins, 
256 have received the A.B. degree. The 
graduates from Hollins are admitted to full 
graduate standing in the higher universities. 
Ideals and Policies. — The policy of Hollins 
College has always been non-sectarian. How- 
ever, it maintains the highest Christian ideals 
and its student body includes representatives 
from all the various church denominations. 
The atmosphere is that of a cultured home where 
all the womanly virtues are encouraged, such 
as health, culture, social grace, scholarship, 
patriotism, and high moral and religious tone. 
In all the long service of this institution it has 
286
-P-A-G-E-305
  
  HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN 
persistently maintained these as ideals, and Hol- 
lins College has set the pace and led the way 
for many institutions of higher learning for 
women in Virginia and throughout the South. 
Mary Baldwin Seminary. — Mary Baldwin 
Seminary at Staunton had its origin in “ Au- 
gusta Female Seminary,” which was planned 
and opened in 1842. The Rev. Rufus W. 
Bailey, a native of Maine, who had been en- 
gaged in educational work in South Carolina, 
came to Staunton and sought the acquaintance 
of Presbyterian ministers and people of that 
faith with the idea of establishing a high-grade 
seminary for the education of girls. After 
many conferences with leading Presbyterians 
of Staunton and Augusta counties, a plan was 
adopted, and a board of trustees, consisting of 
fifteen members, was appointed. The object 
of the school, as stated in the plan, is to “ afford 
the means of a thorough literary and Christian 
education to the female youth of this portion 
of our country.” The board regulations left 
the matter of arranging a course of study and 
selection of text-books to the principal, but it 
: 287  
-P-A-G-E-306
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
distinctly stipulated that “the course shall 
always contemplate a daily recitation by all 
the pupils able to read, of a portion of sacred 
Scriptures.” 
The Rev. R. W. Bailey was elected principal 
and his wife an assistant. The seminary was 
opened in the fall of 1842, in temporary quarters, 
with about fifty students in attendance. There 
were no boarding arrangements connected with 
the school, but the few students coming from 
the country around found board with friends 
in private families. The first session was so 
successful that the board of trustees in- 
augurated an effort to purchase a site and to 
erect suitable buildings. 
In the fall of 1843 an arrangement was made 
between the trustees of the seminary and the 
Presbyterian congregation, by which the build- 
ing for the seminary was to be erected on the 
lot belonging to and adjoining the church. 
One of the conditions was that one room in 
the seminary building was to be used by the 
church, so long as the pastor should be in full 
communion with the Presbyterian Church of 
288
-P-A-G-E-307
    HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN 
the United States, known as the “ Old School 
Presbyterian Church.” In turn, the trustees 
of the church gave the lot in perpetuity, pro- 
vided that three-fourths of the trustees of the 
seminary were ministers or members of the 
Old School Presbyterian Church. The main 
building in the present group is the one erected 
at that time and under those conditions. The 
corner-stone of this building was laid with elab- 
orate ceremonies on June 15, 1844. Among 
the articles placed in the stone was a copy of 
the Bible, with the superscription: ‘The 
only rule of faith and the first text-book of 
The Augusta Female Seminary.” 
The second year of the school there were 
sixty pupils in attendance, among whom was 
Miss Mary Baldwin, who later became principal 
of the school and under whose long and wise 
administration the school attained its high 
standard and national reputation. According 
to a board regulation, it was the custom to re- 
quire all the pupils to assemble in the church 
every Sunday morning for the purpose of 
reciting to the principal or other teachers the 
U 289
-P-A-G-E-308
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
catechism of the Presbyterian Church and such 
Scripture lessons as the principal should ap- 
point. In 1849 Mr. Bailey resigned and left 
the state. 
From this time to the Civil War the school 
passed through a critical period of financial 
and administrative embarrassment. During 
this period, five different men held the position 
of principal, some of whom remained for only 
a part of the year. 
In 1863 Miss Mary Baldwin and Miss 
McClung were induced by the secretary of the 
board of trustees to take full charge of the 
school and operate it without any responsibility 
to the board of trustees. 
The School under Miss Baldwin. — The 
school opened under Miss Baldwin’s administra- 
tion in the fall of 1863, with eighty students, 
twenty-two of whom were boarders. She called 
to her assistance some accomplished teachers, 
and the.school prospered. The standard for 
graduation was determined upon by the advice 
of Dr. McGuffey of the University of Virginia. 
This standard was proficiency in the following 
290
-P-A-G-E-309
iS a ai i i a iia a peat 
HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN 
fields of learning: (1) English literature, (2) 
history, (3) mental and moral sciences, (4) 
mathematics, (5) natural science, (6) ancient 
languages, and (7) modern languages. 
The school gained in popularity from year 
to year. In 1869 there were 13 teachers and 
137 students, representing eleven states. The 
school continued to acquire property and en- 
large its equipment. In 1871 a deed of lease 
from the trustees was executed to Miss Baldwin 
for a term of twenty years, in lieu of improve- 
ments that she had made upon the property. 
All this was substantial progress, and the 
school found a permanent place as an insti- 
tution for the higher education of young 
women. 
In 1895 the legislature granted the school a 
new charter which provided for the change of   name to “ Mary Baldwin Seminary ” and gave 
it authority to grant degrees. Miss Baldwin 
died in 1897, leaving to the seminary large sums 
which she had accumulated during her success- 
ful life. Miss Ella C. Weimar succeeded her . 
as principal. This lady had been connected 
291  
-P-A-G-E-310
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
with the school as a member of the faculty since 
1873, the last years occupying the position of 
assistant principal. 
Present Buildings and Equipment. — The 
school at present has a complete plant in highly 
concentrated form, built around a city block 
with a central court. It has accommodations 
for 250 students. The school has long had the 
reputation of maintaining high standards of 
scholarship and a deeply moral and Christian 
atmosphere. Elective courses in elocution, art, 
and music have always characterized the cur- 
ricula of this school. 
Mary Baldwin Seminary started as a strictly 
sectarian school under the auspices of the 
Presbyterian Church. While this has char- 
acterized the policy of the school, nevertheless 
its student body is made up of representatives 
from all the leading denominations. It draws 
its students from a large territory, twenty-four 
states being represented at present. From 
1866 to 1904, 103 young ladies completed 
the full curricula for graduation. A few de- 
grees have been conferred, but it is not the 
292
-P-A-G-E-311
  
HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN 
policy of the school at present to confer any 
degrees.1 
Randolph-Macon Woman’s College. — The 
Randolph-Macon Board of Trustees was in- 
corporated in 1830 and was empowered by the 
charter to establish and conduct educational 
institutions in any part of Virginia. Under 
this authority, it controls Randolph-Macon 
College for men at Ashland, Randolph-Macon 
Academies for boys at Bedford City and Front 
Royal, and Randolph-Macon Institute for girls 
at Danville. 
In 1891 this Board was intrusted with a 
large fund raised by subscription in the city 
of Lynchburg, and asked to create a college for 
women that should afford higher educational 
advantages equal to those of the best colleges 
for men in Virginia. The following statement 
expresses the purpose of the founders. 
We wish to establish in Virginia a college where our 
young women may obtain an education equal to that 
given in any of our best colleges for men, and under 
environment in harmony with the highest ideals of woman- 
1Mary Baldwin Seminary is given place in this discussion because of 
its historical background.

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
hood; where the dignity and strength of fully developed 
faculties and the charm of the highest culture may be 
acquired by our daughters without loss to woman’s crown- 
ing glory, — her gentleness and grace. 
This institution had no early period of 
struggle. It, as it were, came full grown into 
existence, and its ideals and equipment were 
fully thought out and standardized from the 
first. It went straight toward its goal, that 
of a high standard of scholarship and the 
purest Christian and cultural environment. 
Buildings and Equipment.— The buildings 
for this college were erected near the city of 
Lynchburg on an eminence facing Rivermont 
Avenue and overlooking the valley of the 
James River. The main central building was 
completed in 1893 and the school opened in 
the fall of that year with Dr. W. W. Smith as 
president. Since then, other buildings have 
been added in the form of wings and annexes, 
until at present the group presents one of the 
most attractive forms of college architecture in 
this country. The buildings have a sweeping 
frontage of over seven hundred feet. 
294
-P-A-G-E-313
  HIGHER EDUCATION FOR WOMEN 
These buildings contain a full college equip- 
ment and appliances such as scientific labora- 
tories, a library of ten thousand volumes, a 
gymnasium, society and fraternity halls, dining 
hall, recitation and lecture rooms, a museum, 
and dormitory capacity for about six hundred 
students. 
Curricula and Standards. — The college from 
the first laid down a standard of full college 
requirement for graduation and an entrance 
requirement equal to the work done in the first 
grade high schools of four years’ course. The 
requirements at present are fifteen units of 
secondary work. The requirements for gradua- 
tion for the A.B. degree are sixty hours’ work, 
thirty of which are required in the following 
fields of learning: English, ancient languages, 
mathematics, history, and political science, 
modern languages, natural science, Bible, and 
philosophy. Curricula are offered for the 
Master’s degree. Special elective courses are 
offered in the fields of music and art, and a 
certificate is awarded for the satisfactory com- 
pletion of this work. Full courses in Bible 
295
-P-A-G-E-314
  
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
study are offered, and credit toward a degree is 
given for this work. 
Randolph-Macon College for women is 
operated, fostered, and controlled by the 
Methodist Church, and maintains high stand- 
ards of Christian education. It is in reality 
and actual practice a non-sectarian school, 
following the broad standards of education 
that make for the good of society. This was 
the first college for women south of the Potomac 
and Ohio rivers recognized as an A-1 college 
by the United States Bureau of Education. 
It ranks with Bryn Mawr, Vassar, and Smith 
in the high standards of scholarship required 
for graduation. Its growth in number of 
students has been phenomenal. Beginning 
in 1893 with several hundred students, it 
now has nearly seven hundred, with a waiting 
list. It has a faculty of over fifty members, 
representing advanced scholarship in all the 
fields of learning. At the death of Dr. Smith 
in 1911, Dr. William A. Webb was. elected 
president and holds that position at present 
(1916).

Sweetbriar College. — Sweetbriar College was 
the outgrowth of a large gift for the purpose of 
educating girls and young women in “ sound 
learning ” that fits them to be useful members 
of society. The gifts came by will from Mrs. 
Indiana Fletcher Williams, who died in 1900, 
leaving to a Board of four men a large estate 
of eight thousand acres of land in Amherst 
County and one half a million dollars, with 
the stipulation that a charter should be pro- 
cured and a self-perpetuating Board appointed 
who should establish and maintain on the 
plantation a school or seminary to be known 
as the “ Sweetbriar Institute’ for the educa- 
tion of white girls and young women. The 
will stipulated that, 
The general scope of the school is to impart to its 
students such an education in sound learning and such 
physical, moral and religious training as shall in the judg- 
ment of the directors best fit them to be useful members of 
society. 
The college was chartered in 1901 and the 
Board of Trustees formulated a policy and 
elected Miss Mary K. Benedict, a graduate of

Vassar and a Ph.D. of Yale, as president. The 
policy of the Board of Trustees is distinctly 
stated in a comprehensive document which de- 
fines the scope of the work the institution 
should attempt to cover. It stated: 
That in the North such schools as Vassar, Smith, Bryn 
Mawr, and Wellesley meet the demands for collegiate 
training of young women, that in the West and South the 
demands for the equipment of women in the practical 
vocations are met by the establishment of normal and in- 
dustrial schools exclusively for girls. 
They proposed that it should be the policy 
to combine in this school the best features of 
these two types of institutions. 
According to this policy the proposed new 
institution should offer to young women of the 
South carefully formulated courses leading to 
degrees of high grade in the fields of literature 
and science, and along with that, thorough 
practical training in certain artistic and in- 
dustrial branches. The school was opened for 
students in 1904. 
Buildings and Equipment.— At first com- 
plete plans for the college plant were made. 
298

They consist of a group of sixteen buildings, 
connected by arcades of uniform style of 
architecture. There are to be two quadrangles, 
one residential and the other academic. Up to 
this time one academic building and five dormi- 
tories have been completed. The other build- 
ings are to be added as the demand requires. 
The old Williams homestead contains parlors 
and guest-rooms and offices for the administra- 
tive force. The academic building is fitted 
out with the most complete equipment for 
college purposes, — laboratories, library, lec- 
ture rooms, and assembly hall. The dormi- 
tories are comfortably and attractively fur- 
nished, with every modern convenience. 
Ideals and Curricula.— Students are ad- 
mitted to the work of the college under three 
heads: (1) regular college students, offering 
fifteen units of secondary school work; (2) 
subfreshmen students, offering six units of 
secondary school work; (3) special students, 
offering six units, but such students can elect 
courses in such fields as art and music which 
do not lead to credit for a degree. The work 
299  
-P-A-G-E-318
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
leading to the degree of A.B.! is sixty-one hours, 
thirty-one of which are required in the fields 
of English, Bible literature, ancient languages, 
foreign languages, history and economics, mathe- 
matics, and sciences. Sweetbriar College is a 
highly endowed institution and controlled by a 
Board composed of Episcopalians, although it 
is a distinctly non-sectarian school. The num- 
ber of students has increased rapidly from year 
to year. The territory represented is a wide 
one, and the students come from all denomi- 
national faiths. It has a faculty of thirty-two 
members and a student body of two hundred 
and eighty. 
West Hampton College. — West Hampton 
College is a newly organized institution for 
the higher education of women in connection 
and coérdinate with Richmond College for 
men. It was organized at the time the latter 
was removed to its present site outside the 
city limits of Richmond in 1914. It occupies 
a part of the grounds of Richmond College, 
but has separate buildings, faculty, and equip-

ment. This college for women has been or- 
ganized on the plan of Barnard College at 
Columbia University and Sophia Newcomb at 
Tulane University. It has an entrance re- 
quirement of fifteen units of secondary school 
work, and standard college curricula for gradua- 
tion. Its charter gives it authority to grant 
the A.B. and the A.M. degrees. Practically 
like all the other institutions for higher learning 
for women in the state, it still admits students 
conditionally who have not completed the fifteen 
units for entrance, but this policy will be 
abandoned within the next few years. West 
Hampton College is designed to be a coérdinate 
college of high grade for the education of women. 
Though non-sectarian in its practice, it is con- 
trolled and fostered by the Baptist denomination. 
Summary. — These are the typical schools 
thus far developed for the higher education of 
women in Virginia, according to the highest 
academic standards. Two were pioneer in- 
stitutions, with a long history of struggle, 
without endowment or favorable public opinion. 
The others were established within the last

HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
decade or more, under more favorable circum- 
stances, and with adequate endowments. A 
few might be regarded as sectarian schools, 
on account of the close church fosterage, but 
all of them are growing toward the ideal of 
higher education for the general good of society 
or citizenship. 
Other Schools and Colleges for Girls. — 
There are in Virginia about thirty schools and 
colleges for girls doing varying degrees of 
secondary school and college work, nearly all 
of which have been established within the last 
quarter of a century.!. Some of them are un- 
der church control and fosterage, and others 
are private or corporative enterprises. These 
1The more important of these are: 
Sullins College (Methodist), Bristol; Martha Washington College 
(Methodist), Stonewall Jackson Institute (Presbyterian), Abingdon ; 
Stuart Hall (Episcopal), Staunton; Blackstone College for Girls 
(Methodist), Blackstone; Southern Seminary, Buena Vista; Southern 
College (Methodist), Petersburg; Fort Loudon Seminary, Winchester ; 
Elizabeth College (Lutheran), Salem; Virginia College, Roanoke; 
St. Anne’s School, Charlottesville; Chatham Institute (Episcopal), 
Chatham; Woman’s College (Baptist), Richmond ; Virginia Intermont 
College, Bristol. The following are co-educational: Virginia Christian 
College (Christian), Lynchburg; Bridgewater College (Church of the 
Brethren), Bridgewater; Shenandoah Collegiate Institute (United 
Brethren), Dayton; Eastern College, Manassas.

schools have been doing good service in the 
field of secondary education. Some of them 
offer college curricula and have granted degrees 
in the past, but, during the last decade, while 
the effort to standardize all kinds of education 
has been going on, many of these schools have 
abandoned the practice of granting degrees. 
An educational conscience has been growing 
among the heads of these institutions and all 
are now encouraging uniformly high standards 
for entrance to college work. 
The state Department of Education, under 
the stimulus of the movement to standardize 
all forms of education in this country, has taken 
up the problem of evaluating the work done by 
these various institutions and in general these 
schools have been classed as doing either second- 
ary school work, or, where some satisfactory 
college work is done, such schools have been 
classed as “ junior colleges,” a term recently 
determined upon to designate institutions of 
this character. | 
In 1906 the Virginia Association of Colleges 
and Schools for Girls was formed. This organi- | 
308

zation has accomplished some effective results 
in the way of bringing about uniform standards 
of instruction among these institutions of learn- 
ing. 
Efforts to Establish a Coordinate College for 
Women at the University of Virginia. — During 
the last three sessions of the Legislature a bill 
has been introduced providing for the estab- 
lishing by the state of a college for women in 
connection with the University of Virginia. 
Each time the bill has gained in number of 
supporters. During the session of 1914 it 
lacked only a few votes of passing. The idea 
is approved by the Board of Visitors of the 
University and its passage is urged by President 
Alderman. Each time it has been up for pas- 
sage, however, there has been strong opposition 
to it from the older alumni and some members 
of the faculty of the university. A vigorous 
campaign for its passage has been led by Mrs. 
B. B. Munford of Richmond.

CHAPTER XVI 
EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE IN VIRGINIA 
Tus years making up the close of the nine- 
teenth and the beginning of the twentieth cen- 
tury saw a new awakening throughout the 
whole South. The people of this section were 
forgetting the struggles of the past, and before 
them they saw a new vision of the future and 
felt the return of the old-time consciousness 
of power. A new generation was coming on. 
Certain leaders in the old were giving their full 
energies to the rebuilding of the South out of 
the more permanent and abiding ideals that 
remained from the wreck of war and from the 
industrial, civil, and social disorganization. The 
new South was finding itself, and the rejuvenat- 
ing current of energy and power was ready to 
be directed into channels for the upbuilding of 
her institutions and the development of her vast 
agricultural and industrial resources. It was a 
x 305  
-P-A-G-E-324
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
time when the states south of the Potomac and 
the Ohio were “ taking stock” of their possi- 
bilities, with a view of entering upon a new and 
larger era of economic and social progress. In 
determining upon the essential features in this 
new development, they settled upon popular 
education as one of the first and most funda- 
mental factors that would insure stability and 
sanity to the future progress of her institutions. 
The states of North Carolina, Virginia, and 
Tennessee led in introducing into their political 
campaigns the question of a more efficient sys- 
tem of public education for all the children of 
those states. The governors who were elected 
at this time gained national reputation as 
“educational governors.” Governors Aycock 
of North Carolina and Montague of Virginia are 
remembered to-day for the definite service they 
rendered to popular education in their respective 
\states. 
Educational Conference at Capon Springs, 
West Virginia. — This conference had its origin 
in an idea of the Rev. Edward Abbott, Rector 
of St. James Parish, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 
306 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  
EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
He associated with him Bishop Dudley of Ken- 
tucky, Dr. H. B. Frizzell of Hampton, Rev. A. 
B. Hunter of Raleigh, North Carolina, and 
Dr. Dreher, president of Roanoke College, and 
others, who prepared a programme and sent 
out invitations to the leading educators in the 
southern states. The first conference was held 
June 29 to July 3, 1898. This conference heard 
discussions relating to problems of providing 
more adequate educational facilities for the 
negro of the South and the white population in 
the Appalachian Mountain region, whose edu- 
‘cation up to this time had been largely under 
the auspices of church and charitable organiza- 
tions of the North. An increased interest was 
manifested each year as the conference was held, 
—the first three years at Capon Springs and 
then at different places in the South. At first 
the missionary idea prevailed. Of the thirty- 
four members of this conference, twenty-one 
were ministers. From year to year discussions 
centred upon various aspects of education in 
the South, such as industrial training for the 
negro and more adequate systems for popular 
307 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
education in the southern states. Dr. C. W. 
Dabney, president of the University of Ten- 
nessee, in an address before the conference, 
sounded the note for a more effective system of 
public education among the people of the south- 
ern states. In 1901 the conference was held 
at Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Here the 
Southern Education Board was organized and 
field agents were sent out to carry on a propa- 
ganda of education to every part of the South ; 
the main idea being that ‘‘southern education” 
was a national problem. Funds for this cam- 
paign were contributed by men of wealth and 
philanthropic inclination in the North. Dr. 
Edwin A. Alderman, in one of his characteristic 
utterances, said at one of these conferences : 
If I had a boy and wanted to teach him good, straight 
honest, vital patriotism, I would not much care to carry 
him to a battle-field where men had shed blood and torn 
at each other’s throats, but I would rather wish to bring 
him to such a place as this, where he might see the play 
of human sympathy at its best, where he might see men 
and women of strength and power, unafraid of changing 
their views, unashamed of honest emotion, informed with 
iron purpose and touched as I have never before seen a 
body of citizens with the moral and political values of 
308
-P-A-G-E-327
  EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
childhood, and with meaning to the Nation of the dim 
toiling thousands who dwell untaught in the shadows of 
the world.t 
This programme of propaganda for popular 
education was the motive power that touched 
the social conscience in every rural community 
in Virginia and over the entire South, and re- 
sulted in an era of wonderful achievement for 
popular education. It was a period of liberal- 
izing and unifying of forces. The following reso- 
lution was the basis of the policy for the propa- 
ganda: 
Resotvep, That this conference proceed to organize 
by the appointment of an executive board of seven men, 
who shall be fully authorized and empowered to conduct, 
(1) a campaign of education for free schools for all the 
people by supplying literature to the newspaper and 
periodical press, by participating in educational meetings, 
and by general conferences, (2) to conduct a Bureau of 
Information and Advice on legislation and school organ- 
ization.”

tive Board referred to above was composed of C, W. Dabney of the Uni-

Dr. Chas. McIver, Greensboro, N.C., Hon. J. L. M. Curry, Agent 
Peabody Fund, Dr. H. B. Frissell of Hampton, Geo. Foster, Peabody,

  HISTORY OF ‘EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
Under the lead of these men, together with 
Dr. Ormond Stone of the University of Virginia, 
Dr. S. C. Mitchell of Richmond College, and 
others, the people of the state were aroused to 
a realization of the importance of further educa- 
tional advance in Virginia. ; 
Provisions of the New Constitution. — In the 
year 1902, a new constitution was made for the 
state of Virginia. Its main educational pro- 
visions are: (1) the state Board shall consist 
of the governor, attorney-general, and the state 
superintendent of public instruction. In addi- 
tion to these, there shall be three experienced 
educators elected by the Senate out of the nomi- 
nations made by the faculties of the following 
institutions: the University of Virginia, Virginia 
Military Institute, the State Polytechnic In- 
stitute, the State Normal School at Farmville, 
the School for the Deaf and Blind, and William 
and Mary College, as long as the latter is sub- 
sidized by the state. .(2) There shall be two 
division superintendents, one from the county 
and one from the city, elected in addition to 
those mentioned above, but they shall not have 
310
-P-A-G-E-329
  
  EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
the power of voting in the election of any school 
official. (3) The state superintendent shall be 
an experienced educator and elected by the 
people for a term of four years. (4) The state 
Board of Education shall be authorized: (a) to 
divide the state into school divisions, each not 
less than one county or city, and appoint a super- 
intendent for each division for a term of four 
years, subject to the approval of the Senate; 
(b) to have full charge of the investment, care, 
and distribution of the state school funds, as 
regulated by law; (c) to make all needful rules 
for the management and conduct of the schools. 
These rules shall have the force of law;! (d) to 
appoint a Board of Directors for the management 
of the state library, and appoint a salaried 
librarian. (5) Each magisterial district shall 
constitute a separate school district, with three 
trustees selected according tolaw. (6) The state 
Board shall appropriate all school funds on the 
basis of school population, including all persons 
between the ages of seven and twenty. (7) The 
annual property tax for state school funds shall

not be less than one, nor more than five, mills 
onthe dollar. (8) Each county, city, town, and 
school district may levy a tax of not over five 
mills on the dollar, to be appropriated by the 
local school authorities. (9) The General As- 
sembly may establish agricultural, normal, mili- 
tary, and technical schools of such grade as shall 
be for the public good. (10) The General As- 
sembly may establish compulsory education for 
children between the ages of twelve and eighteen. 
(11) The children of poor parents are supplied 
with text-books. (12) White and colored chil- 
dren shall be educated in separate schools. 
(13) No public school funds can be applied to 
any school not under exclusive control of the 
state. 
This is the broad outfit of constitutional and 
legislative provision that resulted from the new 
awakening among the people of Virginia and 
made possible the realization of so many con- 
structive educational reforms in the state dur- 
ing the more recent years.

EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
germ of the Codperative Education Association 
in Virginia was an all-day meeting held in a room 
in Murphy’s Hotel in 1903, where five men met 
for the purpose of discussing how something 
real could be done to carry into concrete form 
some of the logical conclusions reached by the 
agitation resulting from the Capon Springs 
Conference and the organization and work of 
the Southern Education Board. These men 
were Governor Montague, Dr. H. B. Frissell of 
Hampton, Dr. S. C. Mitchell of Richmond Col- 
lege, Dr. Robert Frazer of Warrenton, and J. D. 
Eggleston, later state superintendent of public 
instruction. It was decided here to perfect an 
organization for the state that would carry 
forward some definite plan, by which the people 
of Virginia would realize the necessity for more 
democracy in education. This was to be done 
through codperation. Ways and means were 
to be devised whereby all the creative educa- 
tional forces of the state could be brought to 
bear upon the single gigantic problem of pro- 
viding education that would vitalize the life 
of the state. The forces started some time 
313  
-P-A-G-E-332

before had been “stung into paralysis.” It 
was now time for action. 
In the spring of 1904, the Association was or- 
ganized with Governor Montague as temporary 
chairman, and Dr. S. C. Mitchell was elected 
permanent chairman. The idea was to codper- 
ate with the Southern Education Board in its © 
educational propaganda for “agitation.” It 
held its meetings semiannually and formulated 
the following platform: (1) nine months’ 
schooling for every child, (2) high schools within 
reasonable distance of every child, (3) well- 
trained teachers, (4) agricultural and industrial 
training, (5) efficient supervision, (6) promo- 
tion of libraries, (7) schools for the defective 
and dependent, (8) citizens’ educational asso- 
ciations in every county and city. 
In December, 1904, at a meeting of the Co- 
operative Education Association, in Norfolk, 
Dr. Ormond Stone of the University of Virginia 
offered a resolution to the effect that Governor 
Montague and President Alderman of the Uni- 
versity of Virginia make a tour of the state in 
May, 1905, in the interest of better education. 
314 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
This was the start of the remarkable “ May 
campaign.” 
Never was a state so bombarded in the interest 
of any cause. Men spoke in the remotest com- 
munities. Candidates of both political parties 
and for all offices turned aside from national 
questions to the earnest advocacy of an ade- 
quate school system for the state. Preachers 
found a fresh application of the principles of 
religion. Editors gave their editorial and news 
columns for the dissemination of knowledge 
and the inspiration of the people. College 
presidents and professors in state and private 
institutions found new fields for useful labor. 
On the political hustings, in places where camp 
meetings were wont to take place, at cross-roads’ 
stores, and ‘old field’ schoolhouses, meetings were 
held in the interest of public education. Dr. 
Bruce R. Payne, then of William and Mary 
College, kept the papers filled with educational 
literature. During the so-called ‘‘ May cam- 
paign ” one hundred of the ablest speakers of the 
state, including the governor, delivered three 
hundred addresses in ninety-four counties at 
315  
-P-A-G-E-334
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
one hundred different meetings. Two hundred 
thousand pages of educational literature were 
issued, and fifty citizen school associations 
were organized. All this was done in thirty 
days. 
During this campaign the facts regarding 
educational conditions in Virginia were set 
forth and compared with northern and western 
states. In the comparison the facts showed a 
woful lack of progress in Virginia, in many re- 
spects, and in some points they showed that 
Virginia was far behind the other states, viz., 
(1) in local school revenues, (2) enrolment of 
pupils, (3) in per capita expenditure, (4) in agen- 
cies for the training of teachers, (5) in the num- 
ber and efficiency of her high schools, and (6) in 
provision for industrial training. 
In 1902 the General Education Board was 
organized in the city of New York, with Dr. 
Wallace Buttrick as general secretary and 
field agent. Some men of wealth, particularly 
John D. Rockefeller, gave large sums of money 
to be distributed throughout the South to stim- 
ulate public education. At first Mr. Rocke- 
316  
-P-A-G-E-335
  
EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
feller pledged $100,000 annually for ten years for 
this purpose. During the years 1902 and 1903 
Dr. Buttrick procured the services of Hon. 
Harry St. George Tucker of Lexington, Vir- 
ginia, and Dr. Robert Fraser of Orange County, 
Virginia, for the purpose of carrying on a 
campaign of agitation in the state of Vir- 
ginia for better educational facilities. They 
travelled into every part of the state, speaking 
at educational meetings, and holding confer- 
ences with educational leaders. All this initial 
work led to the development of organized 
methods of procedure in the form of the Codper- 
ative Education Association in Virginia. 
This organization continued its work of co- 
operating with the state department of educa- 
tion in carrying out the various constructive 
plans for education and has become a permanent 
and positive force in the many phases of school 
improvement throughout the state. Within 
a period of five years after its organization it 
was the means of raising $750,000 in addition 
to the state and local funds for physical im- 
provements in connection with the rural schools, 
317  
-P-A-G-E-336
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
such as fencing the grounds, establishing libra- 
ries, adding to the school equipment, putting 
down concrete walks, installing public drinking 
fountains, and instituting “clean-up days” and 
public meetings. 
Large credit is due for all this constructive 
work to Mr. J. H. Binford, the executive secre- 
tary of the association, to Mrs. B. B. Munford, 
president of the association, and to Mrs. L. H. 
Dashield, whose specific work was the organi- 
zation of Patrons’ Leagues. There are at present 
870 leagues in the state with a membership of 
over 28,000. About $48,000 annually are raised 
for the improvement of the schools through the 
activities of this association. The organiza- 
tion is a sort of “chamber of commerce” for 
the rural community. 
Summary. — In July, 1898, at Capon Springs, 
was held a meeting of men from the North and 
the South to discuss Christian education, cen- 
tring around the church schools for the negro 
race and the white people of the Appalachian 
Mountain region. Ina few years this developed 
into wider significance and spread to a more 
318 
   
-P-A-G-E-337
  
EDUCATIONAL RENAISSANCE 
general interest in public education, maintained 
and controlled by state systems. This widen- 
ing interest was largely due to the addresses of 
Hon. J. L. M. Curry, agent for the Peabody and 
Slater funds. This conference in 1901 devel- 
oped into the Southern Education Board, the 
majority of whose members were southern 
educators, and carried on the initial work of 
organizing the propaganda of agitation for bet- 
ter schools. About this time the General Educa- 
tion Board came into existence, controlling large 
funds for philanthropic purposes. This Board 
came to the rescue of the Southern Education 
Board and materially assisted in the plan and 
work of the latter. The combined forces of 
these two boards wrought the great work of re- 
viving the educational interests of the whole 
South. 
The Virginia Codperative Association was the 
machinery within the state to carry out the de- 
tailed programme for better educational facilities 
for the children of Virginia. All this prepared 
the way for the provisions for education in the 
new state constitution. Thus the people of the 
319

state were prepared for the constructive work 
of the administration of Jos. D. Eggleston as 
state superintendent of public instruction, 
whose election occurred in 1906. ) We shall next 
follow the remarkable achievements of his ad- 
ministration.

  CHAPTER XVII 
MODERN PERIOD OF EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT 
Administration of Joseph D. Eggleston. — Mr. 
Eggleston was the first state superintendent 
of public instruction elected by the people 
according to the provisions of the new constitu- 
tion of 1902. He had been vitally connected 
with the movement for “ agitation ” during the 
previous years, during which time he had urged 
other men to become candidates for the office 
of state superintendent. He called the atten- 
tion of these men to the opportunity for service 
to the state afforded by the office, but when he 
could induce no one else to run, he became the 
candidate himself and was elected. His ad- 
ministration of nearly eight years stands out as 
an era of educational progress remarkable, if 
not phenomenal, in the line of democratizing 
education in Virginia. There are two main 
y 321
-P-A-G-E-340
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
outstanding features that characterize the lines 
of accomplishment during his administration: 
(1) the coalescing of all the various educational 
forces in the state into one supreme directive 
force toward the goal of popular education, 
and (2) the organizing and development of a 
system of extension work that carried a new type 
of practical teaching to the boys and girls in 
every part of Virginia. The secondary lines 
of progress that led to these two large achieve- 
ments were: (1) the creation of a strong, aggres- 
sive department of public instruction; (2) the 
development of an adequate public high school 
system; (3) a constructive attempt to place 
the education of the negro upon a satisfactory 
basis; (4) a richer, socialized curriculum for 
the rural schools; (5) better sanitary and 
hygienic conditions in connection with the rural 
school and the rural home. 
State Board of Examiners. —In 1905, the 
year before Mr. Eggleston’s election, the state 
Board, in carrying out the intent of the new 
constitution, laid off the state into five grand 
divisions, each including about fifteen counties, 
322
-P-A-G-E-341
  EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT 
and appointed an inspector for each. The 
duties of these so-called examiners were very in- 
definitely understood at first, but they soon be- 
gan to organize a system of supervision among 
the schools and inaugurated constructive plans 
that led to the establishment of high schools. 
They also took full charge of certificating 
teachers. Under the wise direction of Mr. 
Eggleston these men became the educational 
dynamos in their respective sections of the state. 
They trained the teachers in a system of sum- 
mer schools, built schoolhouses, consolidated 
schools, established routes for school wagons, 
created public sentiment for better schools, held 
public meetings of patrons in every community, 
codperated with district and county officials 
in securing funds for school buildings and in- 
creasing the’ pay of teachers. All this had a 
wholesome effect upon the schools and increased 
the effectiveness of public education in the 
state. In 1910 the office of Examiner was 
abolished by the state Board of Education and 
some of these same men were retained as “ in- 
spectors ’ or “ supervisors”? of schools under P

Richmond. 
Constructive Legislation..— Mr. Eggleston, 
by a rare combination of tact and leadership, 
held his own with the most astute political 
leaders of the state, and thus saw many of his 
ideas and those of his co-workers take the 
form of law. By a hard fight and a close vote 
the Mann High School bill was passed in 1906, 
which provided for an appropriation of $50,000 
to be given on condition that local communities 
would furnish proper buildings and similar 
amounts for the increase of teachers and salaries. 
This appropriation has since been increased to 
$100,000. The Williams Loan Fund bill was 
passed in 1908. This provided for the lending 
of the Literary Fund of the state to the dis- 
trict boards at the rate of four per cent, to be re- 
paid in ten annual instalments, the loans to 
be made upon buildings whose plans were ap- 
proved by the department of public instruction. 
Later, this provision was extended to all build- 
ings erected in the state for school purposes.

By this means the state department secured 
control of the lighting, heating, and ventilation 
of the school buildings over the entire state. 
The Strode bill of 1908 lumped a series of 
advanced ideas into a compact act which was 
passed with one legislative stroke. One of the 
important parts of this bill was the provision 
by which the division superintendents’ salary 
could be increased by the counties to such an 
extent that they might secure expert men who 
would give all their time to the work of ad- 
ministration and supervision. This led to the 
policy of the state Board to go outside of the 
division, if necessary, to find a suitable person 
for this office. The attempt to carry out this 
policy created a storm of opposition throughout 
the state. Because of this adverse public 
opinion, only a few men whose residences were 
outside of the division were appointed to this 
office. Another important provision of this 
bill related to the subsidy fund of $25,000 
for the encouragement of elementary graded 
schools. These took the place of one-room 
and one-teacher schools in the country districts. 
325 :

  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
Another part of this bill created an educational 
commission which was composed of a group of 
leading educators of the state, whose duty it 
was to make a critical study of educational con- 
ditions and methods of taxation, and report 
to the Legislature suggestions as to the best 
methods of preventing duplication and waste 
in the state system of secondary and higher 
education. However wise these suggestions, 
they were never acted upon by the Legislature. 
The provisions of this bill, while leading to 
central executive control, at the same time en- 
couraged local initiative. The funds thus pro- 
vided for by the state have called forth twice 
and even three times the amount, as a result 
of local agitation and action. Some of it was 
in the form of taxation and some of voluntary 
subscriptions. The entire fund for school pur- 
poses increased from $2,500,000 in 1905 to 
$5,000,000 in 1911. There has been a corre- 
sponding increase in the number of teachers, in 
the enrolment and attendance of pupils. The 
average number of months taught was increased 
from 6.4 in 1905 to 7.04 in 1910. 
326

Another important part of this ‘Omnibus bill’ 
provided that every schoolroom hereafter built 
should contain fifteen square feet of floor space 
and two hundred cubic feet of pure air a 
minute for each pupil; there should be facil- 
ities for exhausting the foul air; ceilings should 
be twelve feet high; all exit doors should 
open outward; light should come from the 
left and rear, and this required light space 
should be equal to twenty-five per cent of the 
floor space; there should be at least two suitable 
closets or outhouses. The Board of Trustees 
should see that these closets were kept clean 
and in order. 
Still another part of the bill provided for the 
establishment of one or more normal training 
schools. These should be located by the state 
Board of Education in connection with high 
schools already established. There should not 
be more than one for every county or incor- 
porated town, provided there was not a state 
normal school already located in the town. 
A few of these were established at first in 
various parts of the state. 
327

This bill also contained an act providing for 
the testing of sight and hearing of children. 
The mere pittance of three hundred dollars 
was appropriated to carry out the provisions of 
the act. It provided for the printing of blanks 
on which the parent is notified of any defect 
in his children. This act, too, has not led to 
any effective results. 
By act of the Legislature in 1908, agricultural 
high schools were established, one for every 
congressional district. Eleven schools of this 
type have been established. An annual ap- 
propriation was made for these schools. The 
idea was to establish curricula in agriculture 
and home economics in some of the high schools 
already established. The Legislature of 1908 
gave $20,000 to these schools. In 1910 this 
amount was increased to $30,000, and the next 
year an additional sum of $25,000 was appro- 
priated for permanent improvements at these 
schools.! 
1 These agricultural high schools are located as follows: 1st congres- 
sional district, Hampton; 2d congressional district at Driver; 3d con- 
gressional district, Chester; 4th congressional district, Burkeville; 5th 
congressional district, Elk Creek ; 6th congressional district, New London;

These schools retain the usual curricula in 
the various secondary school subjects, but, in 
addition, they conduct courses in various phases 
of agriculture and domestic economy. These 
schools are not strictly agricultural, for they 
continue to offer the courses leading to college 
entrance. 
Growth of High Schools. —In 1906 there 
were about seventy-five so-called high schools 
in the state. Only ten of these were free and 
gave a four-year course. Under the stimulus 
of the incentive fund given by the state and the 
work of the state examiners, the number of 
high schools in the state increased rapidly, for 
several years at the rate of nearly one hundred 
a year. In 1905 there were 50 high schools in 
the State, but in 1910 there were 360. At 
present (1916) there are over four hundred. 
These schools were standardized from year to 
year, and continued encouragement was offered, 
so that there were, in 1910, 143 high schools 
7th congressional district, Middletown; 8th congressional district, 
Manassas; 9th congressional district, Lebanon; 10th congressional 
district, Appomattox.

giving a two-year course; 81 giving a three-year 
course, and 83 giving a four-year course. These 
are ranked respectively as first grade, second 
grade, and third grade high schools. The lower 
grade schools are always striving to reach the 
standard of the higher grade schools. A few 
high schools at present charge a tuition fee, 
but soon they will all be free, since local taxation 
for school purposes is becoming more and more 
popular among the people. The movement for 
establishing rural high schools has had more to 
do with increasing local taxation for school 
purposes than any other single cause. The 
following table shows the growth in high 
school activities from 1906 to 1910.!

This table shows an interesting fact regarding 
the influence that the state high school fund 
had upon local taxation. While dollar for 
dollar is required by the state, each year shows 
that over three dollars of local support were 
given for each dollar of the state appropriation. 
So rapid has been the annual growth of high 
schools that the increase in five years has been 
nearly half a million dollars.1 
This same legislature of 1908 passed an act 
establishing a teachers’ retirement fund. An 
appropriation of $5000 was made out of the 
state treasury for the purpose and a provision 
was made by which one per cent of the teachers’ 
salaries could be retained and applied to this 
fund. The regulations governing the distribu- 
tion of this fund were placed under the control 
of the state Board of Education. At first 
_ teachers who had taught for twenty-five years 
or for twenty years, if mental or physical in- 
firmity or age had rendered them inefficient

for service, received an annual pension equal to 
half the salary at the time of retirement, pro- 
vided no teacher received more than four 
hundred dollars annually. In 1910 the act 
was amended, and now pensions are given to 
men who have taught for thirty years and have 
reached the age of fifty-eight and to women 
who have taught for thirty years and have 
reached the age of fifty. If the pension is sought 
because of mental or physical disability the appli- 
cant may have taught only twenty years, but, 
in this event, the application must be approved 
both by the state Board of Education and by the 
state Board of Health. The pensions are paid 
quarterly by the second auditor. In 1910 
there were 271 teachers in the state receiv- 
ing pensions under this act, 239 white and 32 
colored. The income from the one per cent 
deduction of the teachers’ salaries amounts to 
about $40,000, and, together with the annuity 
appropriated by the state, the total receipts 
are $45,000. The law provides that in case 
the funds are not sufficient for the eligible 
pensioners, the amount available shall be

prorated. This bill, while falling short of 
meeting the needs in the state, is a beginning 
in this line and commits the state govern- 
ment to the maintenance and support of such 
a cause. 
Normal Schools. — While the leaders in edu- 
cation throughout the state were arriving at 
conclusions regarding the improvement of 
schools, they could not escape the ultimate 
problem of devising means for the improvement 
of the teaching force. They were not long in 
determining that the best and most direct way 
of advancing the quality of teaching in these 
newly vitalized schools was to train teachers 
for this work. They ascertained that 1500 
new teachers entered the service each year 
and that the state normal school at Farmville 
at best was turning out only several hundred 
teachers annually. So the arguments for this 
urgent need were not difficult to understand, 
and the Legislature of 1908 established two 
state normal schools, one at Harrisonburg 
and the other at Fredericksburg. These schools 
were to be open only to women on account of 
333  
-P-A-G-E-352
Le eee Ee eee eee ne a ee ee Cn pen ee 
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
the fact that eighty per cent of the teachers 
in the elementary schools are women. 
State Normal School at Harrisonburg. — 
The normal school at Harrisonburg opened in 
September, 1909, after a year of constructing 
buildings under the direction of the newly 
elected president, Julian A. Burruss, of Rich- 
mond. The course of study planned by him 
  includes some of the modern features advocated 
by the leaders in the campaign for a more 
vital and a more democratized course of study 
for the public schools of the state. The en- 
trance requirements are two years of high school 
training. The course at this school consists 
of two additional years of high school work, 
together with two years of professional study. 
Domestic economy, manual arts, school garden- 
ing, poultry raising, and agriculture are striking 
features of the course at this institution. These 
probably receive greater emphasis than has 
ever been given to such subjects anywhere in 
the state. Another somewhat unique feature 
of this school is the calendar system of four 
quarters. The school is open eleven months 
334 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
  
  EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT 
in the year. This is probably the first attempt 
to follow such a calendar in any schools south 
of the Potomac River. 
Men are admitted to the summer quarter. 
This quarter is divided into two terms of six 
weeks each, the first of which is designated as 
one of the summer institutes in the state, and 
is attended by a large number of teachers who 
are preparing for examination for certificates 
or for the renewing of certificates they already 
hold. The last term is operated by the normal 
school directly and is attended by teachers and 
students desiring to make up the work of the 
regular session. 
Another important feature of this school is 
the plan for practice teaching. This is done in 
one of the Harrisonburg graded schools. Cer- 
tain grades in this school are designated for this 
use, and special critic teachers have immediate 
charge of the work of the grade and also im- 
mediate supervision of the student teachers, 
all of whom in turn are under a special super- 
visor who is a member of the faculty of the 
normal school. This arrangement, while a 
335 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
very delicate and difficult matter to work out, 
is proving very satisfactory to both the public 
schools of the town and the normal school 
authorities. Another feature of practice teach- 
ing which is an innovation is the work done by 
the student-teachers of the industrial arts de- 
partment in the rural schools of Rockingham 
County. The county school authorities, in 
coéperation with the normal school, have ar- 
ranged for cooking, sewing, manual training, and 
household economy to be taught in a number of 
the schools accessible to the normal school. 
These classes are conducted by members of the 
senior class in the household and industrial 
arts departments, under the personal direction 
of a special supervisor. This plan has worked 
well and promises to be a permanent feature 
of the normal school work. During the last 
year it has inaugurated a system of extension 
teaching by correspondence. All these lines 
of work, while more or less in the nature of in- 
novations, are being carefully worked out, and 
no doubt will ultimately become the permanent 
policy of the public school system of the state.

State Normal School at Fredericksburg. — 
Although the state normal schools at Fred- 
ericksburg and at Harrisonburg were provided 
for in the same legislative act, the former did 
not open its doors for students until Septem- 
ber, 1911. Mr. E. H. Russell was elected 
president of this school. An administration 
building, dormitories, and president’s home 
were erected, and the first year the dormitory 
capacity at this school was exhausted and ap- 
plicants were turned away. The entrance re- 
quirements are that an applicant shall have 
exhausted all the public school facilities offered 
in the home town. This practically means that 
students can enter after having completed the 
courses in the elementary schools. For the 
section of the state in which the school is located, 
it seems necessary at this time to maintain 
this standard, since there are few high schools 
in that region. The plan for practice teaching 
in connection with this school is similar to 
that in the Harrisonburg Normal. Certain 
grades in the city schools of Fredericksburg are 
set apart for this purpose, and critic teachers 
z 337 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
have charge. The course of study in this 
school follows in a general way the course as 
outlined in the school at Farmville, giving a 
four years’ high school course and two of pro- 
fessional training leading to the requirements 
of the various state certificates. The summer 
session at this school is four weeks in length 
and is designated as one of the summer insti- 
tutes in the state. 
The Normal School at Radford. — The State 
Normal at Radford was opened in 1912, with 
Dr. J. P. McConnell as president. This insti- 
tution is located at the gateway of the great 
southwestern part of the state, which section 
the school serves in a peculiar way. The en- 
trance requirements are the same as those of 
Fredericksburg and the practice schools are the 
city schools of Radford. The course of study 
is planned to meet the requirements for the 
various state certificates, and such subjects as 
domestic science and the manual arts are given 
prominent place. This school, like that of 
Harrisonburg, is open during the entire year, 
the summer quarter being divided into two 
338 
 
-P-A-G-E-357
  
  EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT 
terms, the first of which is designated as one of 
the state summer institutes, and the second term 
is conducted as a part of the regular work of 
the school. 
In each of these schools the industrial phases 
of education receive special attention, and the 
more modern principles and standards are em- 
phasized. The school at Harrisonburg rather 
set the pace for the other schools in these 
matters. The Normal School at Farmville’ up 
to 1909 maintained a high school course? with 
two years of professional or pedagogical work. 
Since the agitation in 1905-06 for the im- 
provement of the public schools of the state, 
the Farmville Normal School has revised its 
course of study and increased its equipment 
and general facilities for teacher training. 
The number of students has increased to over 
six hundred. The entrance requirements since 
1911 are one year high school training. The 
requirements for graduation are four years high

to teach at least two years after graduation in 
the public schools of the state. 
lg and Extension Work. — “‘ The 
Coéperativ. 
origin in s 
in 1906 un Demonstration Work” had _ its 
me work carried on in Mississippi 
er Dr. Seaman A. Knapp. Later 
he was employed by the General Education 
Board to work under the direction of the United 
States Dep: artment of Agriculture. The work 
thus organized had for its purpose the teaching 
of men, boys, women, and girls how to farm success- 
fully and how to manage their farms and their 
gardens to 
the greater their own greater advantage and to 
wantage of the nation. This was to 
be done by demonstration agents who would 
1 See Chapter VI, supra. 
340 
 
-P-A-G-E-359
    EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT 
carry expert information to the farmer while 
he was at work on the farm. Superintendent 
Eggleston of Virginia, with his characteristic 
vision, saw the possibilities in this practical 
aspect of teaching, and sought the assistance of 
Dr. Knapp. In 1907 the work was ‘tried out 
in two or three counties in Virginia. Mr. T. O. 
Sandy of Burkeville was put in charge as state 
agent. The next year, plans were made to 
organize boys’ corn clubs in connection with the 
public schools. Each boy was to be assigned 
an acre of land and he was to prepare the soil, 
select the seed, and cultivate the acre under the 
direction of a demonstration agent. Notwith- 
standing some rather strong opposition, the work 
grew steadily in popularity from the first, and 
Virginia led the other southern states in this 
new educational movement. Immediately the 
state and counties became interested, and ap- 
propriated money to carry forward and extend 
the work of organizing the corn clubs. At 
first there were three counties organized, next, 
twenty counties, and then forty counties, and in 
1914 there were sixty counties organized with 
341
-P-A-G-E-360
  
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
county demonstration agents. In 1908 the 
girls’ canning and poultry clubs were organized 
and Miss Ella Agnew was appointed state 
agent and put in supervisory charge. The same 
remarkable progress made by the boys charac- 
terized the work among the girls. This work 
was consciously kept in close touch with the 
rural schools. The interest and enthusiasm 
among the boys and girls soon spread to the 
farmers themselves and they cultivated crops 
under the direction of the demonstration agents. 
In 1914 there were in Virginia, 1 state agent, 
4 district agents, 50 local agents, and 5 special 
agents, working 52 counties. The influence of 
the local agents was felt by 8000 farmers and 
in other ways reached 34,362 people of the 
state. On 89 farms, 9706 acres of corn were 
raised under demonstration methods. This 
year, the highest yield on a multiple of acres 
was 643 3 bushels on five acres. All this demon- 
stration work is now carried to other aspects 
of farm activity, such as wheat, grasses, alfalfa, 
orchards, dairying, livestock, hogs, and farm 
irrigation. As a result of all this development, 
342
-P-A-G-E-361
  EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT 
farmers are organizing, institutes are held, co- 
operative buying and marketing is carried on in 
many sections of the state, and county fairs 
are being revived. School fairs have been in- 
augurated and have added much to the en- 
thusiasm of the movement. By this means 
education is carried to the farmer, instead of 
his being put to the necessity of leaving his work 
and attending an agricultural college in some 
distant part of the state. 
In 1911 the demonstration work was organ- 
ized for the colored people and placed under the 
supervision of Mr. Jackson Davis, and under 
his wise direction valuable service has been 
rendered to the colored farmer in Virginia. 
Sources of Funds for Demonstration Work. — 
When the demonstration work was inaugurated 
in Virginia in 1906, there was not a dollar 
in the state available for this purpose, but, at 
the recommendation of Dr. Knapp, the federal 
government carried the work for a while as an 
experiment. Efforts were soon made to get 
the state and counties interested in making 
appropriations for this work. The state at 
343
-P-A-G-E-362
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
first made a meagre appropriation for this pur- 
pose and has increased it from year to year, 
until now $20,000 is given annually. The coun- 
ties began by appropriating several hundred 
dollars each year. In 1914 the total amount 
given by the counties was between $25,000 and 
$35,000. Under the recent federal act, known 
as the Smith-Lever bill, the state receives 
$10,000 annually. Besides this, the federal gov- 
ernment contributes $40,000, making a total 
of all sources of $100,000 for carrying on the 
demonstration work in the state. 
The administrative machinery for distributing 
the funds for the demonstration work in the 
state at first was the United Board of Agricul- 
ture created by legislative act in 1908. In 1914 
this Board was abolished and the adminis- 
trative affairs were transferred to the Virginia 
Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg, from which 
institution the state demonstration work is now 
directed through a corps of experts at the 
college and state agents in the counties. Thus, 
in the short period of five or six years, this im- 
portant practical type of teaching in the state 
344
-P-A-G-E-363
  EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT 
has taken more or less permanent form, and 
from now on the efforts of those in charge will 
seek to perfect and extend the work until all 
the farm interests of the entire state shall 
feel the influence of this direct and most effec- 
tive kind of teaching. 
General Summary. — The administration of 
Joseph D. Eggleston in achievement, in inspira- 
tional appeal to the people, in sound organiza- 
tion, in democratic and practical significance, 
in the enthusiastic struggle to systematize the 
educational work in the state, in effective 
personal leadership, and in the wide influence 
that/reached not only to the boundaries of his 
own state but to the states throughout the 
South, is comparable to the struggle and ac- 
complishments in the wise administration of 
William H. Ruffner, the first state superin- 
tendent of public instruction in Virginia. Dr. 
Ruffner gave popular education in the state 
form and initial momentum. Mr. Eggleston 
took that form and force and gave to the in- 
stitution a more systematized, democratic effec- 
tiveness. 
345  
-P-A-G-E-364
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
The provision for public education in the new 
constitution of 1902 was one of the results in 
Virginia of the work of the Capon Springs 
Conference and the Southern Education Board. 
It laid down a broad and a more democratic 
scheme upon which to found a system of popular 
education. The people of Virginia were stirred 
to the point of action by the organized efforts 
of the leaders working through the Codperative 
Education Association. Mr. Eggleston came in 
as state superintendent when the enthusiasm 
for better educational facilities was at white 
heat. It was an opportune time for a man of 
ideas and action. He at once realized that this 
enthusiasm must be conserved and utilized for 
great educational achievements. He took stock 
(of the situation and laid down a programme of 
procedure which resulted in the remarkable 
series of accomplishments which characterized 
his administration. 
The following are some of the outstanding 
features of his work: (1) the State Department 
of Education was systematized so that its influ- 
ence was strong and effective as an educational 
346
-P-A-G-E-365
ee EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT 
force in the state; (2) the various educational 
activities|of the state were unified and coalesced 
into one great educational effort, directed toward 
the goal of popular education; (3) a series of 
constructive legislative acts, providing for, 
(a) a state system of high schools, (b) a loan 
fund by which the trustees in the counties might 
borrow money from the Literary Fund for the

CHAPTER XVIII 
THE EDUCATION OF THE NEGROES IN VIRGINIA 
Hampton Normal and Agricultural Insti- 
tute. — Hampton Institute grew out of con- 
ditions of the slaves set free by the Northern 
Army advancing upon Richmond, in the section 
of Virginia centering around Hampton as head- 
quarters. General S. C. Armstrong was sent to 
Hampton as a representative of the Freedmen’s 
Bureau to adjust the difficulties between the 
races. He found a heterogeneous mass of 
negroes under the care of the government, 
doing nothing for themselves, depending upon 
the federal government for rations. These 
new wards of the government were utterly 
unfit for the responsibility of citizenship so 
soon to be thrust upon them. It was the 
task of General Armstrong to organize this 
mass of people into an effective community 
life. 
349
-P-A-G-E-368
    HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
General Armstrong withdrew all rations ex- 
cept in cases of the infirm, and put everybody 
to work. This was the inception of Hamp- 
ton Institute which developed into so remark- 
able an educational experiment. General Arm- 
strong had a firm belief in the moral and 
intellectual value of manual labor. He took 
measures for the building of homes and finally 
he provided schools, where proper teachers 
and leaders might be trained for the colored 
race. The American Missionary Association 
of New York, in 1867, had purchased “ Little 
Scotland,” a small plantation of 125 acres on 
Hampton River. This association had con- 
ducted schools here for the negroes since 1862. 
This was the material and spiritual nucleus of 
Hampton Institute. General Armstrong was 
invited to take up the task of organizing the 
work for the education of the negro race through- 
out the whole South. For the support of the 
work he had to rely upon the government 
through the Freedmen’s Bureau and the chari- 
table and philanthropic spirit of the American 
people. It was his plan to devise means by 
350
-P-A-G-E-369
Ree ME OE ae Re ee nt eee mL Nor naam 
EDUCATION OF NEGROES IN VIRGINIA 
which the students might pay for the expense 
of attending the school, but even such a provi- 
sion costs money. Buildings, shops, and general 
equipment had to be provided. For this he 
had to look to the charity of the people of the 
North. These people responded liberally to 
this cause, but as in war, only “one shot in 
four hundred hits.” 
The Work of the School to Centre around 
Manual Labor. — General Armstrong had seen 
in operation in the Hawaiian Islands, under the 
direction of his father, a missionary to those 
people, a manual labor school. He sought to 
build such an institution at Hampton. The 
idea was not popular at first, but, under the 
wise direction of General Armstrong, the plan 
succeeded beyond the hopes of those who had 
it individually in charge. He laid down some 
principles and never lost sight of them. Some 
of these principles were: (1) that the purpose 
of Hampton Institute was to make the negroes 
of service to themselves, their people, and 
the white race; (2) that effectual work must 
have intelligence back of it, in order to give 
351 
 
-P-A-G-E-370
    
HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
dignity to it; (3) that every pupil has some duty 
to perform and for the performance of which 
he must feel a responsibility; (4) that manual 
training independent of utility has no place in 
the course of study. 
The negro was to be a worker along industrial 
lines. He was to be given training in this field, 
and such other instruction as would result in 
independence and moral and Christian char- 
acter. This was the broad platform of self- 
help for the conduct of Hampton Institute. 
The school opened in 1868 with two teachers 
and fifteen pupils. In 1870 the legislature of 
Virginia granted a charter, which provided for 
a non-sectarian Board of Trustees of seventeen 
members, independent of any association, sect, 
or government. The funds for the first build- 
ings were donated largely by the Freedmen’s 
Bureau. The work of the school was brought 
to the attention of men and women of wealth 
in the North, and gifts came year after year 
with which the institution was able to make 
substantial progress in developing the plant 
to its present enormous capacity. In 1878 
352
-P-A-G-E-371
  
EDUCATION OF NEGROES IN VIRGINIA 
the first Indian students were accepted. A 
lot of captives taken in the Indian wars (1873) 
in the West had been taken to Fort Marion at 
St. Augustine, Florida, for incarceration. They 
were given the choice of being set at liberty to 
return to their tribes or to go to Hampton for 
training. Seventeen of them chose to go to 
Hampton and study the arts and ways of the 
white man. This experiment led to the policy 
of the federal government to train and educate 
the Indian instead of supporting him on reser- 
vations. 
These are some of the events that determined 
the scope and policies of the future work at 
Hampton Institute. From 1880 to the pres- 
ent (1916), Hampton Normal and Agricultural 
Institute has had a constant growth and an 
ever widening sphere of usefulness. In 1893 
General Armstrong died and Dr. H. B. Frissell 
was made principal, and the institution under 
his wise administration has continued to grow 
into still greater usefulness. 
Buildings and Grounds. — The school has 
added to its landholdings from time to time 
2a: 353 
 
-P-A-G-E-372
  
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
until it now owns 1100 acres, much of it under 
cultivation by the students in the department 
of agriculture. It has 140 buildings. These 
have been added from year to year, as funds 
by gifts and otherwise became available. The 
work of construction of some of the buildings 
was done by the students. The buildings con- 
sist of dormitories, —Stone dormitory and 
Graves’ cottage for boys, and Virginia Hall + 
for girls, administration buildings, memorial 
church, Whittier training school, Huntington 
industrial building, machine shops, Whipple 
Barn and Peabody Dairy, Armstrong-Slater 
memorial, trade school, Cleveland Hall, chapel, 
library, and domestic science building. The 
campus is beautifully laid out with drive- 
ways and trees and shrubbery, — all making a 
beautiful village; on every hand there is evi- 
dence of the finest taste and cleanliness. The 
funds for these buildings in almost every case 
came from philanthropic sources. It is one of 
the most striking examples in America of the 
good results of the philanthropic spirit.

EDUCATION OF NEGROES IN VIRGINIA 
The Academic Work at Hampton. — Hamp- 
ton Institute is an industrial school, with 
the emphasis upon the side of utility. But an 
academic department is maintained to give the 
necessary basis for intellectual labor. Here, 
too, the idea of utility is uppermost and the 
training is related to the direct needs of the 
students in the various lines of work at Hamp- 
ton, and for the peculiar life needs after the 
students leave the school. 
The academic entrance requirements are not\ 
rigid, but, roughly speaking, students are sup- ° 
posed to have finished at least five grades in 
the elementary schools. The other require- 
ments are: (1) good health, (2) earnestness of 
purpose, (3) honesty, faithfulness, (4) the attain- 
ment of the age of seventeen years, (5) certificate 
of vaccination, and the above academic train- 
ing. 
The academic course comprises in general 
two years of the elementary school work and 
two of the high school, but recently the course 
has been extended so as to cover the four-year 
high school course. Usually the academic 
355 
 
-P-A-G-E-374
  
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
sessions are held at night, the day being 
given to work on the farm or in the trade 
school. 
The following four-year courses are open to 
boys: (1) academic normal course for the 
preparation of teachers, (2) agricultural course, 
(3) business course, (4) trade course, includ- 
ing blacksmithing, bricklaying, and plastering, 
cabinet making, carpentering, machine work, 
painting, printing, shoemaking, steam fitting 
and plumbing, tailoring, tinsmithing, upholster- 
ing, and wheelwrighting. Military drill is re- 
quired of the boys, in compliance with the Morrill 
act. For the girls the courses offered are: (1) 
academic normal course, (2) home economics 
course, (3) library course, (4) matron’s course. 
Scholarship and Endowments. — The source 
of the funds of Hampton Institute are one- 
third of the Virginia share of the Morrill act, 
the Freedmen’s Bureau, the Slater Fund, the 
Peabody Board, the General Education Board, 
Hampton Committees in Boston, New York, 
Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Springfield, Orange, 
Taunton, and the Indian Associations, and 
356
-P-A-G-E-375
i a ttf aa a i ei

numerous individual donors. The endowment 
fund in 1910 was $2,180,376.38. The current 
expenses for that year amounted to $250,000. 
It is necessary each year for Dr. Frissell to 
raise $150,000, to meet the running expenses of 
the institute. Scholarships are provided for 
about one-half of the students. The students 
pay for their board out of their earnings on the 
farm, in the trade school, in laundry, or other 
departments of work. 
Ideals and Influence of Hampton Institute. — 
Hampton Institute has been from the beginning 
the embodiment and continued fulfilment of a 
set of definite and fundamental ideals: (1) the 
use of industry in such a way as to obtain the 
greatest results in character and mental force; 
(2) to know and feel the meaning and dignity 
of labor; (3) to give to the negro and Indian such 
instruction as will enable them to make good 
homes for themselves and prepare them to 
teach the members of their own race how to 
keep their houses clean and sanitary; (4) to 
prepare leaders who will be able to carry on 
activities in agriculture and in trades, thereby 
357 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
raising the standard of social efficiency and 
citizenship; (5) the whole to go on in a deeply 
religious atmosphere. These ideals have con- 
stantly been the guiding factors that have 
made Hampton Institute one of the strong, 
positive forces in the social and economic re- 
demption of the negro race in the South. The 
school has endeavored to train leaders for two 
races, — leaders in agriculture, in industrial 
education, in business, in home building, in 
improving church and home life, in public 
school work, and in foreign missions. 
It is difficult to make a concrete estimate of 
the value and influence of the work done at 
Hampton. More than nine thousand young 
people have had the benefit of Hampton ideals 
and training. They have for the most part gone 
back to their own people and have become cen- 
tres of influence, — teachers, farmers, skilled 
mechanics, and thrifty home makers. Hamp- 
ton Institute has directly or indirectly been in- 
fluential in the establishing and organization 
of many schools for the negroes in every south- 
ern state. Booker Washington, a graduate of 
358
-P-A-G-E-377
  
EDUCATION OF NEGROES IN VIRGINIA 
Hampton, was called by the state authorities 
of Alabama to superintend some work for the 
negroes at Tuskegee. The famous “ Tuskegee 
Institute” was the outgrowth of this simple 
beginning. Hampton has demonstrated the 
effectiveness of industrial education, and the 
training for white children in agriculture and 
other industrial lines has followed the standards 
so effectively carried out at Hampton Institute. 
The Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute 
at Petersburg (1882).— The Virginia Normal 
and Industrial Institute was established by an 
act of the state legislature in March, 1882. 
The act provided that the school should be 
under the management and control of a Board 
of Visitors composed of seven men. It directed 
that the school should offer collegiate and pro- 
fessional courses. A normal course was to be 
offered of not more than three years in length. 
The sum of $100,000 was appropriated from the 
proceeds of the sale of the Atlantic, Mississippi, 
and Ohio railroads for the purchasing of a 
site and the erection of buildings, and $20,000 
annually for running expenses. The Board of 
359  
-P-A-G-E-378
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
Visitors selected the “‘ Fleet Farm” near Peters- 
burg, and ordered the building to be erected. 
This was completed in the spring of 1888 after 
some additional appropriations had been made 
for the purpose. 
The school opened in 1883 with three de- 
partments, (1) normal, (2) academic, (3) college. 
From 1889 to 1902, college courses were offered 
and forty-nine persons received the degree of 
A.B. At the latter date, the legislature revised 
the charter, changing the name of the school 
to the Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute. 
The college work was abandoned and an in- 
dustrial department was substituted. The 
purpose of making these changes was to 
make the school serve the state as a normal 
school for preparation of teachers for the negro 
schools. 
The Curricula and Standards for Gradua- 
tion. — Students are admitted in September 
and January. The requirements for admission 
to the school are the completion of the work 
done in the sixth grade of the public schools. 
The academic course covers the work of the 
360
-P-A-G-E-379
EDUCATION OF NEGROES IN VIRGINIA 
usual high school curricula. In addition to 
these, courses are offered in normal training, 
covering two years, and courses in domestic 
science and agriculture. All students, both 
boys and girls, are required to take courses 
in agriculture. 
Buildings and Equipment. — The chica owns 
forty acres of land, twenty-four of which are 
under cultivation. There are ten buildings, 
the main one being a four-story brick structure 
367 feet long. The buildings are fully equipped 
for work in domestic science, agriculture, and 
manual training. There is a training school 
connected with the normal department. 
Summary.— This school was_ established 
during the “readjuster” régime in Virginia 
politics. At first, it gave college courses in 
connection with the normal department.‘ In 
1902 the legislature changed the charter so as 
to provide training along industrial lines and 
preparation of teachers for the negro public 
schools of the state. All state students are 
exempt from tuition fees.) This is the state 
school, established, maintained, and controlled 
361
-P-A-G-E-380
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
by the state of Virginia for the training of negro 
teachers of the public schools. 
Public Schools for Negroes. — Public schools 
for negroes in Virginia were inaugurated under 
the constitution of 1869. This constitution was 
formulated during the reconstruction régime by 
the convention which was held in December, 
1867.1. The twenty-four negroes in this con- 
vention urged the establishment of a system of 
schools which the white and colored children 
should attend together. The debates upon this 
point grew tense, but many radicals stood out 
for a dual system, and the various proposals 
for “mixed schools”? did not prevail.2. The 
comprehensive plan for public education sub- 
mitted to the legislature in 1870 by Rev. W. H. 
Ruffner, the newly elected state superintendent 
of public instruction, included a system of 
schools for the negroes on the same basis as 
the schools for the white children. In many 
instances at first, particularly in the cities, 
white teachers were assigned to the schools for

EDUCATION OF NEGROES IN VIRGINIA 
negro children, but soon a sufficient number of 
teachers of their own race became available. 
There was a strong public opinion in Virginia 
against the education of the negro. The opposi- 
tion to the public school system inaugurated by 
Rev. W. H. Ruffner centred about the provi- 
sion in the law for the equal opportunity of the 
negroes in public education. In 1872 the 
state superintendent asked the county su- 
perintendents whether the colored people mani- 
fested a desire for education. The replies 
were in almost every case in the affirmative. In 
some instances, the reports show that the 
average attendance in the negro school was 
better than the white schools. There was a 
great difficulty in obtaining competent teachers 
and suitable buildings for the negro schools. 
In his annual reports of 1871 and 1872, Su- 
perintendent Ruffner makes arguments for the 
education of the negro on the basis of capacity 
for education and value of training the negro, 
which he says is an important factor in Virginia 
civilization. His conclusion is that the state 
cannot afford not to give them the same oppor- 
363 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
  
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA . 
tunities for elementary education that are 
given the white children. He gives statistical 
proof of the ability of the negro to learn, by 
figures obtained from the Freedmen’s Bureau 
at the closing of the bureau in 1870. There 
were 2677 negro schools in the eleven southern 
states, 3300 teachers, and 149,581 pupils. 
There were 74 high and normal schools. Be- 
sides these secular schools, there were 1562 
Sunday schools, with 6007 teachers and 97,752 
pupils. All this had been accomplished within 
the period of ten years. 
The Peabody Education Board, through its 
field secretaries, first Dr. Sears and later Dr. 
J. L. M. Curry, distributed money to the negro 
schools. The Slater and Jeans funds were 
other sources of support that supplemented 
the state money for negro education. The 
more modern ideals have sought to make the 
training in the public schools for the negro 
children of direct practical benefit to the race. 
Courses in manual training, domestic science, 
and industrial arts are emphasized. In recent 
years, a special state supervisor has done 
364
-P-A-G-E-383

much to stimulate the schools to effective work. 
The following table will show the progress 
made by the schools for the negro race.

SPECIAL TECHNICAL SCHOOLS 
Beswwss the technical courses offered at the 
state schools,— the University of Virginia, 
Virginia Military Institute, and the Poly- 
technic Institute,—two special schools, pri- 
vately endowed or maintained, have been giving 
special trade or technical courses. One is the 
Virginia Mechanics Institute at Richmond and 
the Miller Manual Labor School, near Crozet, 
in Albemarle County. 
The Virginia Mechanics Institute. —'The 
Virginia Mechanics Institute was founded in 
1854 in Richmond and operated on a small 
scale for a while at first. The purpose of the 
school was to give training in the “ Scientific 
and Mechanic Arts.” The school was in- 
corporated by the General Assembly of Vir- 
ginia in January, 1856. It held an annual 
exhibition of manufactures and maintained a 
366
-P-A-G-E-385
  SPECIAL TECHNICAL SCHOOLS 
school in which the various mechanic arts were 
taught. In 1857 a commodious building was 
erected. The institute started with no en- 
dowment or available funds except the funds 
arising from the issuance of bonds of $25,000. 
The enterprise was conducted with fair success 
until 1861, when the buildings were occupied 
by the War, Navy, and Patent offices of the 
Confederate States’ government. At the evac- 
uation of Richmond in 1865 the building, 
together with the records and models, was 
destroyed by fire. There was nothing done to 
revive the school until 1884, when the enterprise 
was reorganized as a night school for the 
teaching of technological subjects. The school 
was conducted in rented buildings until 1902, 
during which time the number of students in- 
creased, and the city of Richmond favored it 
with annual appropriations. During that year 
346 students were enrolled. From 1884 to 
the present the following men have served as 
the head officials of the school: George H. 
Anslie to 1889, Dr. Henry C. Jones to 1892, 
W. J. Whitehurt from 1892 to the present time. 
367
-P-A-G-E-386
  HISTORY OF EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA 
In 1907 the office of superintendent was created, 
and Frank W. Duke was elected to this posi- 
tion and has direct charge of the institute at 
present. 
The school now owns property to the value 
of $125,000. It has a library of 3000 volumes 
and a student enrolment of nearly 600. It 
maintains the following departments: (1) 
mathematics, (2) science, (3) drawing, de- 
signing, and modelling, (4) engineering, (5) 
mechanical shops, (6) language, (7) commerce, 
(8) telegraphy. The city of Richmond during 
the last decade has developed large industrial 
interests, and this school supplies a real need 
for apprenticeship and technical training for 
this large centre of population. The school 
has maintained itself without any appreciable 
endowment, but many friends of the institution 
in Richmond have rallied to its support in time 
of need. 
Miller Manual Labor School. — The Miller 
Manual Labor School of Albemarle County is 
a highly endowed institution for the training 
of the poor boys and girls of Albemarle County. 
368
-P-A-G-E-387
  SPECIAL TECHNICAL SCHOOLS 
The will of Samuel Miller,! who died in 1869, 
a native of the county, but then a resident of 
Lynchburg, contained a bequest amounting to 
about one million dollars for the establishment 
and maintenance of a school for the poor chil- 
dren of Albemarle County. After five years 
of litigation the courts dismissed the suits 
against the estate and the school was planned 
and commodious buildings were erected near 
Crozet. The will devised that the funds be 
placed in the hands of the governor of Virginia, 
the attorney-general, the state superintendent 
of public instruction, and the second auditor, 
these constituting a Board of Corporation for 
the management of the funds of the Miller 
Manual Labor School. The charter provides 
that the judge of Albemarle County be made 
1 Samuel Miller was a poor boy living in the “Ragged Mountains” 
of Albemarle County. While gathering blackberries with his brother 
John, they planned to accumulate property and ultimately endow a 
school for the poor children of their native county. During the Civil 
War, Indiana troops under General Hunter pillaged the Miller home near 
Lynchburg and carried away securities, and by court proceedings in 
Indiana appropriated the fund to their own use, but Samuel Miller 
appeared and succeeded in having the original decree revoked and thus 
saved the fund for himself and ultimately for the Miller school.

an ex officio member of the Board, and that he 
appoint two other citizens of the county to 
serve with him as a Board of Visitors to manage 
the affairs of the school. In the year 1878 
the Board elected Professor C. E. Vawter of 
Emory College, superintendent, by whose native 
intelligence, fine attainments, and rare execu- 
tive ability, the school was planned and put 
into operation. The school was opened for 
pupils in October, 1878. Only twenty-one boys 
were enrolled the first year. The first girls 
were enrolled in November, 1884. The num- 
ber of both sexes has steadily increased until at 
present there are nearly 800 students at the 
school. ‘ 
The Miller School was among the first schools 
in America with the distinct purpose of giving 
courses in industrial education. At first there 
was an evident prejudice against it as a manual 
labor school. Several institutions in the North 
were trying out the experiment, but at best 
were feeling their way. To start such a school 
in the South was a still more doubtful enter- 
prise. To dignify labor in the South was no 
370
-P-A-G-E-389
  SPECIAL TECHNICAL SCHOOLS 
easy task. There was opposition everywhere 
and sympathy nowhere. Manual labor was 
the peculiar occupation of the negro, and the 
white people felt it undignified to engage in 
such activities. To educate away from this 
false idea was the task of the Miller School. 
Superintendent Vawter, with this idea in view, 
planned a magnificent building in which to 
house the shops, and employed the best-equipped 
teachers in New England to carry on the work 
of instruction. He studied the schools in the 
North that were doing this type of manual work 
and selected what seemed to him to be the best 
features of the schools he studied, and in- 
corporated them into the school in Albemarle. 
At first the manual labor was so unpopular 
that many pupils were admitted who did not 
come under the head of “ poor” children, but, 
in a few years, the school was filled with the 
class of pupils for which it was originally in- 
tended. In 1901 the county school board 
met to recommend appointments to the county 
judge. There were ten vacancies to fill and

Curricula and Requirements for Admission. — 
The requirements for admission are (1) that the 
children be residents of Albemarle County, (2) 
they must be between the ages of ten and 
fourteen, (3) they must be selected from the 
indigent or poor class. ‘ 
The course of study covers the usual 
branches in the four upper grades of the elemen- 
tary school, and, in addition, courses in manual 
training, sewing, and cooking for the girls, and 
shop and farm work for the boys. The higher 
courses correspond to the academic work of a 
modern four-year high school, with additional 
work in technical subjects in the following 
fields: woodwork, metal work, foundry work, 
mechanics, agriculture, and horticulture. 
Buildings and Equipment. — The farm con- 
sists of 1200 acres of land, much of it woodland, 
and a large acreage of alluvial land under a 
high state of cultivation. There are over a 
dozen buildings making up the group, all of 
which are of the best in design and architecture. 
The equipment is most complete in every re- 
spect.
